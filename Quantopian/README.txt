*We use the Quantopian platform to backtest our algorithms.
*with_conf_intervals.txt is our most recently updated code. Confidence intervals are how confident we are of
the rise/fall of the stock. It can also be replaced by the strength of the +/- signal.
*without_conf_intervals.txt isn't as recently updated, but it essentially just performs trades on each signal without considering confidence levels.
