Divina Paredes (CIO New Zealand) 14 October, 2016 10:00 - - - - print email Comments AI-related industrial applications will replace humans in a number of readily disrupted fields, or any other industry involving routine tasks The Institute of Directors (IoD) and law firm Chapman Tripp are calling on the New government to establish a high-level working group to help New Zealand deal with artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be smarter than humans within 24 years, so it is critical for New Zealand to act now, the two organisations said in a joint statement. The IoD and Chapman Tripp have developed a call to action paper highlighting the risks, opportunities and challenges AI presents. “AI is an extraordinary challenge for our future,” says IoD chief executive Simon Arcus. “Government and business leaders need to work together to promote greater development of AI technologies to ensure there is a coordinated approach to prepare for the impact AI will have on work, education and welfare. This requires big-picture thinking, long-term vision and appropriate oversight.” Simon Arcus of Institute of Directors Establishing a government led high-level working group is critical in helping New Zealand rise to the challenge Simon Arcus, Institute of Directors Read more Tech CEO rises to the challenges of big data and diversity The IoD and Chapman Tripp say New Zealand must move now to ensure it can manage all the risks AI may present, but also capitalise on the opportunities. “A working group with experts from science, business, law, ethics, society and government, should be tasked with considering the possible impacts, identifying areas of opportunity and concern and making recommendations on how New Zealand should prepare for AI-driven change,” says Bruce McClintock, head of technology, media and telecommunications, Chapman Tripp. “While the impact of AI on the New Zealand economy is unquantifiable, many sectors should be investing more in AI technologies to make the most of their full potential,” says Arcus. This extends from startups, to SMEs and corporates to government agencies and educational institutes,” says Arcus. “AI is an extraordinary challenge for our future. Establishing a government led high-level working group is critical in helping New Zealand rise to that challenge.” Read more SAS CEO Dr Jim Goodnight on the power of big data, literacy and philanthropy The two organisations cited the government’s work with the private sector to develop a National Cyber Security Strategy and establish a National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). “We also call for greater collaboration and coordination among AI researchers, policymakers and industry members at sector level,” they said. “Just as the Industrial Revolution reduced the demand for human labour in manufacturing and agriculture, AI technologies have the potential to reduce the need for skilled professionals in service fields that have been largely insulated from disruption, such as finance, accounting, law and medicine,” they noted in the report Artificial Intelligence - Opportunities and challenges for New Zealand: A call to action. AI has already disrupted many industries, the report states. The manufacturing industry was one of the first to experience the impact with increased automation and the use of robotics. Read more New Zealand organisations continue to experiment with IoT “AI-related industrial applications will replace humans in a number of readily disrupted fields, including call centres, customer services, legal document review, or any other industry involving other routine tasks. “It remains an open debate whether, like previous industrial revolutions, AI ultimately leads, after an initial period of disruption to established skills and industries, to greater employment as new work becomes available in areas that have not been automated.” How do we encourage new jobs and industries that AI may promote? Read more CIO upfront: ​A cybersecurity primer for SMBs The report said some key questions that need to be answered include: What New Zealand industries will be most disrupted by AI? What impact will AI have on our economy as some jobs are replaced by AI-driven automation? How do we encourage new jobs and industries that AI may promote? Read more The 'Google Steering Wheel Dilemma’ or why full autonomy may not be possible or desirable in smart machines How does the education system need to evolve to address AI-driven change?

For example, Facebook Inc. (FB) uses AI to recognize faces in images that users post, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) uses AI to predict what you’re searching for before you’re even done typing and Amazon Inc. (AMZN) uses AI to predict what products you’ll buy. In this article, we’ll take a look at the best exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for investors to consider in the artificial intelligence space. Growth in AI Artificial intelligence is widely seen as a technology that will replace human work. While robots have taken a lot of manufacturing jobs, artificial intelligence has thus far only complemented knowledge workers by making their jobs easier. Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Alphabet’s DeepMind, believes that AI is still decades away from replacing knowledge workers on a large scale, although it’s something people should “pay attention to.” According to ReportsnReports, the artificial intelligence market is expected to grow at a 53.65% compound annual growth rate from $419.7 million in 2014 to $5.05 billion by 2020. Machine learning technology is expected to account for the largest share of the growth as it’s used to improve media and advertising, as well as the financials sector. Furthermore, artificial intelligence as a replacement for human intelligence could emerge over the next five years. Over the longer term, these technologies could be used to solve complex financial problems and develop healthcare solutions pertaining to clinical trials and related studies. A great example would be assimilating the data from millions of clinical trials in order to find similarities that investigators could then target for the treatment of certain diseases. These kinds of drug discovery applications could generate billions in revenue for biotech firms leveraging AI. Investing in AI There are many different companies that are actively focused on research and development activities in the artificial intelligence industry. While oftentimes these companies are focused on a particular segment of the AI market, such as healthcare or e-commerce, there are also several companies that are researching AI in a purer sense, including IBM and Alphabet. According to Reportsnreports, some of the top publicly traded companies in the global AI market include: IBM Corp. (IBM) Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Google Inc. (GOOGL) Rocket Fuel Inc. Mobileye NV (MBLY) Most investors might be better off investing in ETFs since they provide instant diversification across the entire industry. Global X recently launched its Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF (BOTZ n/a) that provides exposure targeting the industry with an expense ratio of 0.68%. The ETF’s top holdings include SMC Corp. (SMECF) and ABB Ltd. (ABB) at around 8% of the portfolio a piece. The Robo Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (ROBO ) is another option for investors to consider with a 0.95% expense ratio. Some of the fund’s largest holdings include iRobot Corp. (IRBT) and Cognex Corp. (CGNX), although no single stock accounts for more than 2.5% of the portfolio. This makes it a more diversified option than the Global X ETF that’s focused on artificial intelligence. ETFdb’s Stock Exposure Tool can help investors find additional ETFs that have significant holdings in companies focused on AI research and development. In addition, investors can check their existing holdings to see how much exposure they already have to these companies. Risks to Consider Investors should keep in mind that there are several important risk factors to consider when investing in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Some of these key risk factors include: Expense Ratios. Many specialized ETFs have higher expense ratios than broad market index ETFs, which means that investors should factor in these costs. Indirect Exposure. Many companies involved in AI R&D are also focused on other industries, which could increase their risk in these areas. For example, Alphabet Inc. has an AI research division, but its stock trades based on its ad division’s performance. Long-term Play. Artificial intelligence remains in its infancy, although it’s seeing strong double-digit growth rates. Investors should be aware that the industry could take decades to fully mature and deliver exceptional value. The Bottom Line The artificial intelligence industry is already worth more than $400 million per year and is expected to grow at a 50%+ clip to more than $5 billion by 2020. Investors looking to capitalize on these opportunities may want to consider the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF (BOTZ n/a) as a pure-play or other ETFs that have overweight holdings of companies involved in R&D focused on machine learning and AI.

Artificial intelligence: can it at any time take a destination of human intellect? The debate as to it doesn’t matter if Synthetic Intelligence (AI) can switch human intelligence happens to be heading on for a while with just about every faculty of believed advancing different good reasons. There is absolutely no question that artificial intelligence will basically switch the way human beings undertake important things in future. Even though there have been a normal consensus over the capabilities of AI in adjusting the way human beings undertake operations, researchers have disagreed within the extent to which AI will adjust items in the future. In such a regard, these authors have argued the all-natural intelligence in human beings depends upon unconscious instincts as opposed to mindful symbolic manipulation of AI systems. These expertise could by no means be captured by official guidelines in AI systems. Within this paper, I talk about the positions by equally universities of assumed. The rest belonging to the paper is structured as follows: Primary, AI is d defined to offer an general point of view on its loving relationship with all the human mind. Next, considerations why AI can swap human brain could be introduced. Third, motives why AI are not able to exchange human intellect are going to be introduced and at last a conclusion will likely be done. AI can certainly be outlined as the improvement of home computer units that will be in a position to undertake pursuits that will need human intelligence (Bostrom & Yudkowsky, 2013). These pursuits include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. In simple terms, AI is the intelligence that is put into the machines to enable the machines function the way human beings do. According to Dietrich (2014) , for any intelligence to be acquired and used by human beings or machines, the human head or the machine has to be taught initially. For instance, a human brain, which is genetically created to categorize elements needs to see several examples of animals before it can differentiate between cats and dogs. The event and evolution of AI has reached a point where some experts have begun to argue that AI can exchange human minds. Others have argued that AI will practically never substitute human thoughts despite the capabilities of AI in modifying just how human beings undertake functions. According to Hutter (2012), synthetic intelligence programs can actually think and have a genuine head the way human beings do. Such solutions need not only to have simulated intelligence, but really intelligent entities that have been modeled in machines to assist these machines work and think the way in which human intellect does. Hutter argued that computers could possibly be seen as useful tools to study the mind, allowing the empirical testing of models belonging to the thoughts. For such machines to equal the processing power of human beings, researchers have to develop AI http://essaycapital.org/essays devices that match the processing power of a human brain within the potential. This is a possibility basing in head that the processing abilities of hardware devices have been increasing exponentially. The association between AI and human mind is not without controversy, however. Various scholars have argued that there is absolutely no way AI solutions will equal the processing power belonging to the human brain. According to Bostrom & Yudkowsky (2013), the natural and organic intelligence in human beings will depend on unconscious instincts instead of the mindful symbolic manipulation of AI devices. Such competencies can do not ever be captured by official principles that happen to be usually employed in AI units. Bostrom & Yudkowsky posits that the unconscious instincts in human beings are God-given natural and organic intelligence which can not ever be replicated in computers. Some roles that demand unconscious instincts may under no circumstances be handled by AI programs. These roles include teaching, creative arts, professional sports, quality assurance and health (Dietrich, 2014). Strong arguments by the two of faculties of assumed on even if AI units can replace human intellect has become offered. One college of believed believes that AI can change the human thoughts even though another university believes AI can in no way just take the spot of human brain. There is no question that artificial intelligence will essentially alteration just how human beings undertake things in future. Despite the abilities of AI in upcoming, AI solutions will practically never replace human mind. This is because the all natural intelligence in human beings relies on unconscious instincts instead of conscious symbolic manipulation of AI units. Such abilities can never be captured by formal procedures that are usually employed in AI programs.

By David Templeton / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Nowadays people are — or arguably should be — aware of the advances, promises and challenges of artificial intelligence, which already controls computers, mobile phones, automobiles and just about everything else that has a battery or power cord. Along with artificial intelligence (AI) comes the need to make sure benefits aren’t undermined by risks with something controlled by a computer algorithm rather than humans. It’s an important but complex topic, explaining why the White House released a 58-page report, “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence,” in advance of today’s Frontiers Conference at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. “Developing and studying machine intelligence can help us better understand and appreciate our human intelligence,” states the report’s executive summary. “AI can augment our intelligence, helping us chart a better and wiser path forward.” But with progress come challenges, the report says, calling for government regulation of products using AI to protect public safety, with full disclosure of risks the technology poses. Such regulations already exist or are being adopted for new motor vehicles, weaponry and drone technologies, among others. Technological advances also could change the workforce significantly, the report warns. While increasing productivity and create wealth, AI also may have various impacts on jobs, reducing demand for skills that can be automated while increasing demand for workers with skills complementary to AI. Negative effects of AI will be born by those with lower-wage jobs, with new jobs likely to be higher-wage, “potentially increasing economic inequality,” it says. That will raise the need for public policy to ensure “that workers are retrained and able to succeed in occupations that are complementary to, rather than competing with, automation,” the report states, adding that “economic benefits created by new technology should be shared broadly.” Another concern is safety, especially as new technologies have unintended consequences after widespread public adoption. AI experts caution about the many challenges in understanding and predicting behavior of advanced AI systems, the report says, with weapon systems and drones representing “key concerns about moving away from direct human control of complicated technology.” Government roles include holding public discussion and debates about advances in AI and monitoring the safety and fairness in its application. There’s also the need for government to find middle ground with regulations that encourage innovation and avoid disrupting new developments, all while protecting the public. “AI holds the potential to be a major driver of economic growth and social progress, if industry, civil society, government and the public work together to support development of the technology with thoughtful attention to its potential and to managing its risks,” the report concludes.

Agencies should consider building "DARPA-like organizations" for "high-risk, high-reward AI research and its application" in government, said the report, which outlined opportunities and challenges for the technology. The report was released Wednesday, months after the White House hosted a series of public workshops, including one focused on AI applications for social good. That document incorporated discussions from the workshops, and recommended the Executive Office of the President publish a second report by the yearend to delve deeper into the effects of AI on the U.S. job market and outline recommended policy responses. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. The White House recommended federal agencies prioritize open training data and open data standards for artificial intelligence so those systems could be trained to analyze government data sets.  While artificial intelligence technology could save people's lives—self-driving cars, for instance, could cut down the fatal accidents caused by human error—it could also prompt unanticipated economic consequences, the report said. New technology could put low-wage earners out of work by “reducing demand for certain skills that can be automated while increasing demand for other skills that are complementary to AI," causing a "wage gap between less-educated and more educated workers, potentially increasing economic inequality.” Another major challenge is "building systems that can safely transition from the 'closed world' of the laboratory into the outside 'open world' where unpredictable things can happen." Despite challenges, many federal agencies are investing in AI; at the Walter Reed Medical Center, for instance, the Veterans Affairs Department uses the technology to "predict medical complications and improve treatment of severe combat wounds, leading to better patient outcomes, faster healing and lower costs." The White House has been investigating how machine learning could help law enforcement "better inform decision-making in the criminal justice system," while also attempting to reduce "the possibility that AI might introduce bias or inaccuracies due to deficiencies in the available data." But machines are “very unlikely” to “exhibit broadly-applicable intelligence comparable to or exceeding that of humans in the next 20 years," the report said, though it acknowledged "it is to be expected that machines will reach and exceed human performance on more and more tasks.” recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Emerging Technology: The Government of the Future Has Arrived Textual Chemistry: Getting to Know Citizens Through Their Words The Inimitable Effect of Standing on Productivity The Decision-Making Science of Effective Healthcare FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

The report, entitled Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, examines the current state of AI, along with its applications both now and in the future, and outlines a series of recommendations to ensure safe use. It explains that researchers must ensure future systems are ‘open, transparent, and understandable; that they can work effectively with people; and that their operation will remain consistent with human values and aspirations.’ According to the report, future technology can help to drive economic grown and social progress, as long as industry, civil society, government, and the public cooperate on its development, while working to manage the risks. This coincides with the release of a pair of reports from the White House today, addressing strategic plans regarding research and preparations for the future of artificial intelligence. Speaking to Wired editor in chief Scott Dadich and MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito, the president explained that artificial intelligence ‘promises to create a vastly more productive and efficient economy’ if used properly. But, these capabilities come with ‘downsides’ as well. ‘It could increase inequality,’ Obama told Wired. ‘It could suppress wages.’ The president distinguishes between ‘generalized AI,’ which is seen in science fiction and is still thought to be a long way off, and ‘specialized AI,’ which has already begun to appear in numerous applications, from medicine to transportation. This latter form already presents immediate but ‘solvable’ concerns, Obama said. ‘If you’ve got a computer that can play GO, a pretty complicated game with a lot of variations, the developing an algorithm that lets you maximize profits on the New York Stock Exchange is probably within sight,’ Obama told Wired. ‘And if one person or organization got there first, they could bring down the stock market pretty quickly, or at least they could raise questions about the integrity of the financial markets.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Did Ancient Greeks help build the Terracotta Army?

Share this article Share 14 shares The rise of ‘specialized AI’ could deepen income inequality and make low-skilled employees become redundant in the workforce, Obama warned in an interview with Wired He also points to an example in which an algorithm learns to launch missiles. Rather than focusing on rogue AI, however, Obama says the concern centers on ‘the capacity of either nonstate actors or hostile actors to penetrate systems.’ In the discussion, Ito points out that it will likely require more than a dozen breakthroughs before humanity achieves a generalized AI, so these can be monitored as they happen. ‘And you just have to have somebody close to the power cord,’ the president responded, with a laugh. ‘Right when you see it about to happen, you gotta yank that electricity out of the wall, man.’  A pair of reports from the White House today, addressing strategic plans regarding the future of artificial intelligence.The graph from the White House strategic plan shows how mentions of 'deep learning' or 'deep neural network' have spiked in journal articles worldwide Moving forward, he says we will have to rethink the way we maintain security to address these growing AI threats.  You just have to have somebody close to the power cord. [Laughs.] Right when you see it about to happen, you gotta yank that electricity out of the wall, man. President Obama  ‘I think there’s no doubt that developing international norms, protocols, and verification mechanisms around cybersecurity generally, and AI in particular, is in its infancy,’ Obama told Wired. On that same note, the White House has released a report and strategic plan regarding future directions and considerations for AI ahead of Thursday’s White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh. The report, entitled Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, examines the current state of AI, along with its applications both now and in the future, and outlines a series of recommendations to ensure safe use. There have been three waves of AI research, according to the strategic plan.  It largely began in the 1980s, and swelled again from the 2000s to present with the rise of machine learning. According to Obama, self-teaching algorithms could pose threats to the stock exchange and national security. Moving forward, he says we will have to rethink the way we maintain security to address these growing AI threats. A scene from Terminator Genisys is pictured Now, we may be on the cusp of the possible third wave, which could enable rapid learning and even provide AI with a sense of ‘meaning’ or ‘understanding.’ With the risks considered, the report explains, researchers must ensure that future systems are ‘open, transparent, and understandable; that they can work effectively with people; and that their operation will remain consistent with human values and aspirations.’ According to the report, future technology can help to drive economic growth and social progress, as long as industry, civil society, government, and the public cooperate on its development, while working to manage the risks. ‘Developing and studying machine intelligence can help us better understand and appreciate our human intelligence,’ the report says. ‘Used thoughtfully, AI can augment our intelligence, helping us chart a better and wiser path forward.’ WILL ROBOTS TAKE YOUR JOB?  As robots increasingly make their way into the workforce, some have argued that they will soon be taking over many traditionally human jobs. In an interview with Fox Business, former McDonalds USA CEO Ed Rensi argued that the $15/hour minimum wage raise will bring ‘job loss like you can’t believe.’ He argued that it would be cheaper for companies to instead purchase robotic devices. ‘If you look at the robotic devices that are coming into the restaurant industry -- it’s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who’s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries,’ Rensi said. Foxconn, a supplier for Apple and Samsung, has already reduced its human workforce drastically, The South China Morning Post reports. One factory has now ‘reduced employee strength from 110,000 to 50,000, thanks to the introduction of robots,’ an official told the Post. They predict more companies will soon follow, with up to 600 firms reporting similar plans in a government survey. And, according to recent studies, there are five jobs already at risk of being replaced by automated workers. Accountants are 99 per cent likely to lose their jobs to machines. Umpires and referees have a 98.3 per cent chance of being automated. Waiters and waitress are 93.7 per cent likely to be replaced by machines. Legal assistants and paralegals have a 94.5 per cent chance of being automated. Fashion models are 97.6 per cent likely to lose the lime light because of robots.   Read more: www.whitehouse.g... www.whitehouse.g...

The group will invite academics, other nonprofits, and specialists in policy and ethics to join its board, which will represent corporate and noncorporate members equally. The partnership will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license. It will address topics such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity, transparency, privacy, and interoperability collaboration between people and AI systems, as well as AI technology's trustworthiness, reliability and robustness. There are no plans to lobby government or other policymaking bodies. Discussions with professional and scientific organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, as well as nonprofit research groups including the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, an AI research organization set up by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, were ongoing, the partnership said. A Time of Great Turmoil Salesforce and Apple are notably missing from the group's roster. Salesforce recently announced Einstein, designed to embed AI in all of its offerings. Apple just purchased machine learning and AI startup Turi. "Salesforce may have been locked out by Microsoft," speculated Ray Wang, a principal analyst at Constellation Research. Apple "tends to take a go-it-alone strategy, though they've worked closely with partners like IBM," he added. As for the smaller players, "the concept started with bringing a few anchor vendors into the alliance and then growing it from there," Wang told TechNewsWorld. "Right now we're in an era of AI babel. The machine learning algorithms, neural net designs, and data standards are a cacophony of hell." We're at an inflection point in the progress of AI, according to Frost & Sullivan. Breakthroughs in deep learning due to more data, faster processing and better algorithms have led to dramatic improvements in computer vision, natural language processing and robotic motion systems. All of the fundamentals are in place for AI to revolutionize every business in every industry. "I think the participants are thinking in terms of controlling the Frankenstein factor that seems to be developing around AI," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "People, especially the mainstream media, are getting concerned about the rise of the machines, and I think a lot of this is in the nature of PR," he told TechNewsWorld. Several universities have begun studying the possible dangers AI might pose. High-tech visionary Elon Musk and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking are among the people who have voiced concerns. His concerns led Musk to help establish OpenAI, a nonprofit AI research organization that includes Amazon Web Services among its members. We will "see a rise in digital ethics and a potential call by other alliances and organizations, like the EFF, for an international human right to privacy and digital and AI ethics standards," Wang predicted. Potential Impact Partnership on AI "should provide more rigor and initial standardization, particularly around safety protocols, definitions and certifications," noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "All of these are needed to validate [it] as viable and not just a time or money hole," he told TechNewsWorld. Its founding members "have deep AI experience," Enderle pointed out, and therefore "should be able to establish rules and frameworks for the group far more quickly." Partnership on AI might help the advancement of artificial intelligence by convincing the public that governmental controls aren't necessary, Frost's Jude suggested. "Governments are beginning to get interested in the technology," he said. "There have already been hearings on AI in Congress, and the public policy types are clearly interested in potentially regulating this space. If the industry can demonstrate that in a sense, it's self-regulating, that may keep the regulators at bay." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast? Will nanotech solve our coming food crisis? Does Sturgeon's Law still hold true? You can connect with Richard on Google+.

A report from the Science and Technology Committee – made up of 14 MPs – released on Wednesday warns the UK government that "government leadership in the fields of robotics and AI has been lacking." The report claims citizens have not been equipped to deal with a world that relies more and more on artificial intelligence and calls for the creation of a a new 'Commission on Artificial Intelligence' at the Alan Turing Institute. Based at the British Library in London, the new commission would examine the social, ethical, and legal implications of developments in the field of AI. Related: What is Google DeepMind? Acting chair of the Science and Technology Committee, Dr Tania Mathias MP, said in a statement: "Science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our lives over the coming decades. "It is too soon to set down sector-wide regulations for this nascent field but it is vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now." Self-driving cars and computer-aided diagnoses for patients were highlighted by the committee as ways in which artificial intelligence has, and is set to, change the way we live. Google's AI-focused DeepMind division is based in the UK The new report follows the creation of a 'Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society', established by some of tech's major players including Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. The partnership will consider numerous issues including privacy, safety, and the interaction between AI and people, in order to help ensure artificial intelligence is implemented safely and ethically in the future. But Dr Mathias says the government should be doing more, adding: "Some major technology companies — including Google and Amazon — have recently come together to form the 'Partnership on AI'. "While it is encouraging that the sector is thinking about the risks and benefits of AI, this does not absolve the government of its responsibilities. "It should establish a 'Commission on Artificial Intelligence' to identify principles for governing the development and application of AI, and to foster public debate." The report also calls on the government to provide education to ensure citizens have the skills needed to function in a society where AI plays a greater role.

ADVERTISEMENT “Government has several roles to play,” the White House said in a report. “It should monitor the safety and fairness of applications as they develop, and adapt regulatory frameworks to encourage innovation while protecting the public.” “Many areas of public policy, from education and the economic safety net, to defense, environmental preservation, and criminal justice, will see new opportunities and new challenges driven by the continued progress of AI,” the authors added. “Government must continue to build its capacity to understand and adapt to these changes.” Wednesday’s report represents the first federal guidance on artificial intelligence, a field that is of mounting importance to industry. It was released a day before President Obama hosts a conference on tech issues in Pittsburgh. Artificial intelligence technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern life. They power the autonomous vehicles that Google and Uber have invested heavily in, for example, and back personal assistant applications that are becoming more commonplace in smartphones. The report’s authors encouraged regulators to balance the harms and rewards associated with AI while crafting rules for products built with the technologies. The authors said that, generally speaking, “the approach to regulation of AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk that the addition of AI may reduce, alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase.” Regulators should also use existing regulations as a starting place when possible, they said. Tech powerhouses have lobbied the White House to encourage light regulatory guidance to AI as part of the process leading up to the report. Facebook’s James Hairston, for example, told the White House that any regulatory “approach should consider AI's benefits to consumers." The Internet Association’s Michael Beckerman also said that thoughtful “public policy in this space demands a careful weighing of these benefits against perceived risks so that the benefits can be fully realized.” But the report also pushed federal agencies to evaluate instances in which they are giving money to fund — or directly using — artificial intelligence technologies that help make major decisions in Americans' lives. Civil rights advocates have warned that if artificial intelligence uses data or code informed by bias, the product of the technologies could be biased as well. The White House cited as potentially risky applications of AI in the criminal justice system, where software is used to predict risk associated with an offender, or in the hiring process. “Federal agencies that make grants to state and local governments in support of the use of AI-based systems to make consequential decisions about individuals should review the terms of grants to ensure that AI-based products or services purchased with Federal grant funds produce results in a sufficiently transparent fashion and are supported by evidence of efficacy and fairness,” the report said. Another key questions about artificial intelligence is what effect it will have on the economy and the job market, where automation as a result of AI threatens jobs in certain industries. The White House elected not to address those questions in its Wednesday release, but promised to do so before President Obama leaves office in January. “The economic policy questions raised by AI-driven automation are important but they are best addressed by a separate White House working group,” the report said. “The White House will conduct an additional interagency study on the economic impact of automation on the economy and recommended policy responses, to be published in the coming months.”   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Printing industry’s ticking time-bomb, Crimson under fire, the beginning of Brexit’s ‘phoney war’ Duncan Bridgeman Friday October 14, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on In NBR Print today: The vicious five-year price war Fuji Xerox has waged on both sides of the Tasman may yet topple many small businesses, leading print industry figures say. They claim the beleaguered company has begun strictly enforcing contracts with its customers, and fear many will be unable to pay their debts. Karyn Scherer follows up her recent investigation of the company’s accounting practices with an in-depth look at the flow on effects to the wider industry. Concerns have been raised that New Zealand is not preparing for the inevitable advance of artificial intelligence, reports Calida Smylie. There is a 50% chance AI will surpass average human intelligence within 24 years, rising to 90% by 2076, according to an Oxford University study. AI will cause major issues in almost every sector, Institute of Directors CEO Simon Arcus says. Following scepticism over its valuation, Crimson Consulting is copping criticism for the onerous non-compete and restraint of trade clauses it’s imposing on its contractors.Insisting on young tutors signing up to a 12-month restraint of trade “far exceeds what is reasonable for an independent contract,” according to solicitor Jennifer Walsh, who says it would be excessive even in an employee agreement. Campbell Gibson reports. A partial takeover offer for NZX-listed Airwork proposed by obscure Chinese company Zheijiang Rifa is a sign of a missed opportunity for New Zealand investors, writes Tim Hunter in Hunter’s Corner. If successful, the offer will leave Airwork 75% owned by an overseas company with negligible experience of aviation. Minority investors will be in a poor position as a result. The 20th anniversary of the first MMP election is time to take stock – not just of the system itself but what caused it to be adopted, writes Rob Hosking. In viewing Europe’s economic and political deadlock, and the rage-fuelled campaigns that produced the Brexit vote and the candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, New Zealanders can look on and say, “been there, done that.” Theresa May’s pledge to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March 2017 effectively began the manoeuvring for position that precedes the start of open hostilities, writes Michael Coote. The UK will adopt a “divide and rule” strategy to prevent agreement against its interests by the EU’s disunited members. All this and more in today's NBR Print Edition. Out now.

Elizabeth Gibney 13 October 2016 Article tools Rights & Permissions Mary Evans Picture Library DeepMind's AI uses external memory to accomplish tasks that require reasoning, such as learning to navigate the London Underground. Artificial-intelligence (AI) systems known as neural networks can recognize images, translate languages and even master the ancient game of Go. But their limited ability to represent complex relationships between data or variables has prevented them from conquering tasks that require logic and reasoning. In a paper published in Nature on 12 October1, the Google-owned company DeepMind in London reveals that it has taken a step towards overcoming this hurdle by creating a neural network with an external memory. The combination allows the neural network not only to learn, but to use memory to store and recall facts to make inferences like a conventional algorithm. This in turn enables it to tackle problems such as navigating the London Underground without any prior knowledge and solving logic puzzles. Though solving these problems would not be impressive for an algorithm programmed to do so, the hybrid system manages to accomplish this without any predefined rules. Although the approach is not entirely new — DeepMind itself reported attempting a similar feat in a preprint in 20142 — “the progress made in this paper is remarkable”, says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal in Canada. Memory magic A neural network learns by strengthening connections between virtual neuron-like units. Without a memory, such a network might need to see a specific London Undeground map thousands of times to learn the best way to navigate the tube. DeepMind's new system — which they call a 'differentiable neural computer' — can make sense of a map it has never seen before. It first trains its neural network on randomly generated map-like structures (which could represent stations connected by lines, or other relationships), in the process learning how to store descriptions of these relationships in its external memory as well as answer questions about them. Confronted with a new map, the DeepMind system can write these new relationships — connections between Underground stations, in one example from the paper — to memory, and recall it to plan a route. DeepMind’s AI system used the same technique to tackle puzzles that require reasoning. After training on 20 different types of question-and-answer problems, it learnt to make accurate deductions. For example, the system deduced correctly that a ball is in a playground, having been informed that “John picked up the football” and “John is in the playground”.  It got such problems right more than 96% of the time. The system performed better than ‘recurrent neural networks’, which also have a memory, but one that is in the fabric of the network itself, and so is less flexible than an external memory. Although the DeepMind technique has proven itself on only artificial problems, it could be applied to real-world tasks that involve making inferences from huge amounts of data. This could solve questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the data set, says Alex Graves, a computer scientist at DeepMind and a co-author on the paper. For example, to determine whether two people lived in the same country at the same time, the system might collate facts from their respective Wikipedia pages. Although the puzzles tackled by DeepMind’s AI are simple, Bengio sees the paper as a signal that neural networks are advancing beyond mere pattern recognition to human-like tasks such as reasoning. “This extension is very important if we want to approach human-level AI.” Journal name: Nature DOI: doi:10.1038/nature.2016.20784 References Graves, A. et al.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung October 13 Follow @b_fung (iStock) Humanity may still be years if not decades away from producing sentient artificial intelligence. But with the rise of machine-learning services in our smartphones and other devices, one type of narrow, specialized AI has become all the rage. And the research on this branch of AI is only accelerating. In fact, as more industries and policymakers awaken to the benefits of machine learning, two countries appear to be pulling away in the research race. The results will probably have significant implications for the future of AI. (Office of Science and Technology Policy/The White House) If you're not familiar with the term, “deep learning” is a subset of the overall branch of AI known as machine learning — which basically involves the use of computer algorithms to perform pattern recognition and analysis. It's this type of AI that powers personal digital assistants such as Google Now, for example. The chart above was published Wednesday by the Obama administration as part of a new strategic plan aimed at spurring U.S. development of artificial intelligence. What's striking about it is that although the United States was an early leader on deep-learning research, China has effectively eclipsed it in terms of the number of papers published annually on the subject. The rate of increase is remarkably steep, reflecting how quickly China's research priorities have shifted. The quality of China's research is also striking. The chart below narrows the research to include only those papers that were cited at least once by other researchers, an indication that the papers were influential in the field. (Office of Science and Technology Policy/The White House) Compared with other countries, the United States and China are spending tremendous research attention on deep learning. But, according to the White House, the United States is not investing nearly enough in basic research. “Current levels of R&D spending are half to one-quarter of the level of R&D investment that would produce the optimal level of economic growth,” a companion report published this week by the Obama administration finds. The government is pushing for a major role for itself in AI research, and here's why: Becoming a leader in artificial-intelligence research and development puts the United States in a better position to establish global norms on how AI should be used safely. When AI stands to transform virtually everything including labor, the environment, and the future of warfare and cyberconflict, the United States could be put at a disadvantage if other countries, such as China, get to dictate terms instead. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Matt Strawbridge is a 17-year-old student who is dyslexic. He says that children with dyslexia, and other learning difficulties, are frequently made to feel stupid, even though they are often highly intelligent. In the very early years at school, no one can really read or write, so it's not as obvious that you have dyslexia until everyone else starts doing proper schoolwork. I can remember now, thinking that I must be stupid. I can't do it. Why can everyone else do it? In primary school, we would have reading groups, where everyone would take their turn reading aloud from a picture book. My turn would come, and I would look at the picture on the page, and make up a story to go with it. My teacher would be disappointed with me, because that wasn't what was written. When you are ten years old, there shouldn't be much to be upset about, but reading and writing was just such a battle for me. Reading shouldn't be such a hard thing if you really think about it — it's just letters and words on a page. But when those words are moving around on the page, it's just such a mission. Everyone with dyslexia is different, but for me, I see words moving around crazily. I used to read each individual letter, one-by-one, and then make the word up from there. Now, it is easier, and I can see individual words.   READ MORE: * Why Stuff is working with Unicef New Zealand * My school day: Drama, dyslexia, piano and Kafka ​* Designer creates font to show what it's like to have dyslexia * Seven myths about dyslexia put to rest * As Timor-Leste turns 16, pre-schools are vital * Kiribati children at the mercy of climate change * Unicef's pictures of the world's children in 2015 * Attacks in Aleppo leave kids in constant danger    SUPPLIED Matt: Dyslexic kids are highly intelligent, so it is frustrating as you want to learn and without reading learning is very difficult.   Dyslexic kids are highly intelligent, so it is frustrating as you want to learn and without reading learning is very difficult. I was having these thoughts at the age of ten, because I couldn't read or write. People with dyslexia – and other learning differences – are made to feel stupid, often by people who are uneducated about their situation, but should be. It is a really heartbreaking experience for parents and kids. To hear someone call you stupid at a very young age, really reinforces what you are thinking already as a person. Mum was made to feel it was her fault and that I couldn't read. She was told that I just needed to focus and read more.   However, an educational psychologist helped me, who is fantastic. She explained to me all things that I would struggle with. She told me about famous people who were dyslexic, and it got me thinking "I can't read and write, can I get someone else to write for me? Can I just brainstorm the story, and then figure out what else to do".    One of the biggest hurdles for a dyslexic is self-esteem. The biggest change was training the voice in my head not to tell me, "I can't do this. I can't do this" to "OK, how are we going to do it?" For me to know that I was different, and that I could do something well, that would be the big thing. The big difference was when I reached out to help other dyslexic kids with dyslexia to make sure they didn't feel stupid. Having other things that I was good at that others found difficult also helped. Mountain biking was one of those things. It was my escape. I would drift off and think about that. If it wasn't for the mountain biking and helping others, then I would be a very different kid. I run workshops now, for dyslexic kids. I see myself when I was younger in them. I see all the things that they are going through. These workshops are so important for me, because I don't want anyone to feel the way I did growing up. I talk to them, and am not embarrassed about anything. If someone had talked to me when I was younger, it would have made a massive difference. As told to UNICEF New Zealand.

BMW’s motorcycle concept is so smart you won’t need a helmet to ride it Posted Oct 12, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Shine is rolling out on-demand life coaching via text message Motorcycles aren’t exactly safe, but BMW envisions a future where two-wheel vehicles have enough onboard intelligence to make it possible for drivers to use them without protective clothing. The emphasis here is still on the thrill of the drive, but intelligent driver assistance features will help make it possible for the ride to maintain its thrill while adding a lot more safety. The so-called Motorrad VISION NEXT 100 vehicle is one in a series of BMW concepts that aim to anticipate where its future vision is going, and how incorporating new technologies and connectivity features will change the driving experience. With the Motorrad, the answer is less a path to full autonomy, as you might expect with four-wheeled cars, and instead represents a natural conclusion based on the aspects of motorcycle riding that people value. That means the end-user experience is more about the freedom of the open road, with issues like safety handled by on-board artificial intelligence systems. p90238730_highres p90238733_highres p90238702_highres p90238696_highres p90238693_highres p90238689_highres p90238753_highres p90238745_highres p90238738_highres p90238728_highres p90238727_highres p90238719_highres p90238715_highres p90238706_highres p90238703_highres p90238747_highres p90238701_highres p90238700_highres p90238699_highres p90238692_highres p90238749_highres p90238717_highres p90238714_highres p90238709_highres p90238741_highres p90238691_highres p90238750_highres p90238739_highres p90238732_highres p90238718_highres p90238697_highres p90238735_highres p90238729_highres p90238721_highres p90238712_highres p90238694_highres p90238755_highres p90238746_highres p90238744_highres p90238711_highres p90238707_highres p90238705_highres p90238752_highres p90238748_highres p90238734_highres p90238716_highres p90238704_highres p90238690_highres p90238751_highres p90238737_highres p90238736_highres p90238713_highres p90238698_highres  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit The appeal of a motorbike you can ride without having to heap on layers of protective gear, including a huge cumbersome helmet, is indeed an amazing proposition. BMW says the Motorrad’s systems will anticipate the road ahead and offer drivers guidance on what to do to avoid incidents, and even step in and take over to prevent anything from happening if necessary. It also uses a self-balancing system that absolutely prevents the possibility of a tip-over, either when in motion or when standing still. There is some headgear involved, even though the helmet is gone in the concept – it’s a lightweight visor, however, and it’s made to keep the wind out of your eyes but also to overlay important information on your view, including anticipated twists and turns. Powering everything is a zero-emission electric drive train. Again, this is a concept so it’s far from being a real thing, but it is a very cool vision of what might be next for the motorcycle industry in a future where autonomy is king for cars. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase BMW Founded 1916 Overview Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), is a German automobile and motorcycle manufacturing company.

MPs said all kinds of jobs from taxi and lorry drivers, medical workers, call centre staff, seamstresses, insurance clerks and bank tellers are at risk. 4 How robots are poised to take your jobs Recent breakthroughs in technology include driverless cars and supercomputers that help doctors to diagnose patients and teachers to tailor lessons for students. Acting Science and Technology Committee Chair Dr Tania Mathias said artificial intelligence would “fundamentally” change the way we live and work. And she accused the Government of “lacking” in leadership on the threat. Getty Images 4 Driverless cars will soon make van drivers obsolete Getty Images 4 Supercomputers will help doctors to diagnose patients It came as driverless cars were unveiled in Britain for the first time yesterday. Dr Mathias said ministers were failing to ensure education and training was up to scratch to create new jobs to replace those that could be lost.

Nevertheless, it is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing others. “Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes will play out, we must respond with a readiness to reskill and upskill.” Getty Images 4 3D printers also pose a threat to the manufacturing industry 'Hot Sophia' humanlike robot flirts with man during TV interview And she added: “Government leadership in the fields of robotics and AI has been lacking.” Dr Mathias said ministers must set up a commission to scrutinise AI systems and to encourage debate. And she slammed them for not having a strategy to develop the new skills workers will need to succeed as the use of AI increases. List of jobs under threat from artificial intelligence and robotics Jobs that require creativity or social intelligence like nurses, chiropractors and fashion designers have the least risk of automation while roles like taxi drivers and accountants have the highest risk.

Educators must prepare them to be creative and entrepreneurial Educators must educate the next generation for a future that is unclear. Photograph: Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images Supported by About this content Thursday 13 October 2016 19.13 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 26 October 2016 18.14 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger It’s a disruptive world. Back when the current ruling class were at school, disruptive behaviour was punished. Today disruption is cool and SMAC (the acronym for the technologies driving business innovation, social, mobile and cloud) is the new normal. Businesses able to ride the tidal wave of disruptive change are steadily wiping out those that don’t and CEOs are left wondering if they’ll be the next to be Ubered or Amazoned. The world has changed. The first industrial revolution mechanised the means of production using water and steam power; the second created mass production with electric power; the third used electronics and information technology to automate production. The fourth and current industrial revolution combines the physical, digital and biological worlds, bringing together previously unconnected areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, 3D printing, nanotechnology, genetics and biology. It’s the Internet of Everything, changing how people and things connect, how we collect and harness data, and how they all work together to facilitate intelligent processes. Digital technologies are now changing the way education is delivered, accessed, assessed and perceived. And, across the world, new jobs are being created while others are ruthlessly eliminated at a pace humanity has never seen before. With robots, is a life without work one we'd want to live? Read more A CSIRO report earlier this year estimated that nearly half of Australian jobs are at risk of computerisation. Early computerisation waves only affected jobs in labour-intensive, readily coded repetitive tasks but the evolution of cognitive computing has shifted into areas previously believed to be uniquely human. Driverless cars, wearable computing and DNA nanobots have quickly moved from science fiction to science fact and are desirable. It is estimated that 65% of children entering primary school today will work in jobs that don’t yet exist. Consider that less than a decade ago very few of us knew what an app was but today graduates have been educated as app developers, data analysts and social media managers. And tomorrow? Machine algorithmic designers or robotics lifestyle integration consultants? A small number of companies – Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google, or Fang – have changed the world in less than a decade. This is the age of Fang and, while many might hope this era is shortlived, educators must educate the next generation for a future that is unclear. Universities are preparing graduates for 21st-century lives and careers in complex and unpredictable future. One certainty, in an age when vast quantities of information are available instantaneously and outdated almost immediately, will be the ability to deal nimbly with complex and often ambiguous knowledge rather than simply accumulate facts for detailed reports. The skills with an enduring shelf life will be the uniquely human skills – emergent leadership, entrepreneurship, emotional intelligence, creativity and complex problem-solving. In our digitally enabled and hyperconnected world, graduates will also need cultural empathy, cross-cultural communication skills and global contacts. The connection between work and learning will also become closer and work-based learning opportunities will have a critical place in preparing for the jobs and skills of the future. It's up to organised people to ensure the new economy serves the greater good Read more The career of a lifetime will certainly no longer last a lifetime and workers will probably need to upskill multiple times throughout their working lives. Even jobs less directly affected by technological change will require very different skill sets as the ecosystems in which they operate are affected by the changes such as more flexible working conditions, teleworking and increased casualisation. Certainly Stem will be important – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – but we must also invest in the arts and humanities. Consider the Fang companies that have made a fortune by creatively marrying technology and culture. It shouldn’t surprise us – creativity and innovation have always been the source of the very best ideas. Until recently it would be fair to say that the buildings blocks of universities, their governance, their business model and their instructional design, had changed little since the first university was established in 1088. In the blink of one year, online education went from poor relation to leading-edge cool. Massive open online courses or MOOCs represent the first wave of disruptive change for universities and how they transmit knowledge. MOOCs have freed universities from fixed concepts of meritocratic selection and from preconceived notions of who should go to university and when. Just as iTunes unbundled songs from a CD, the digital revolution enables a university degree to be disaggregated into its component parts – vocational knowledge, generic professional skills, deep discipline knowledge, practical training, evidence of achievement, networking opportunities and student lifestyle. The billion-dollar question for Australia of course is how will we keep pace with technological infrastructure and remain competitive in an increasingly complex global market? We must worry less about what the actual jobs are and more about equipping our people to be thoughtful, entrepreneurial and forward-looking. Whatever path eventuates over the decade, there are some things we can be fairly sure of: the pace of change will continue to be breathtaking and education will continue to be both a compelling indicator and a powerful instrument of human progress.

If the movies have taught us anything, artificial intelligence created by the government = bad. The Obama administration is aware of those concerns, which is why a new report questions how government-backed AI could impact society and public policy. It calls for long-term investments in AI research, as well as investigations into the ethics and security implications of the technology. "Advances in AI technology hold incredible potential to help America stay on the cutting edge of innovation," the White House said in a blog post. At Walter Reed Medical Center, for example, the Department of Veteran Affairs is using AI to better predict medical complications and improve treatment. Smarter traffic management applications, meanwhile, are reducing wait times, energy use, and emissions across the country. And some researchers are using AI-based software to improve animal migration tracking. Still, these systems risk overstepping the boundaries of government-regulated operations, particularly as it relates to security and defense. The administration's solution: more and better data. "Federal actors should focus in the near-term on developing increasingly rich sets of data, consistent with consumer privacy, that can better inform policy-making as these technologies mature," the report says. Key agencies, however, can't use and improve upon AI if they don't understand it. So the administration is calling for federal employee training. It also wants to implement an exchange model—the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program—which would temporarily assign experts to governments, universities, research centers, and other organizations to fill in the gaps. "For example, agency staff sent to colleges and universities as instructors can inspire students to consider federal employment," the paper says. "Likewise, programs that rotate employees through different jobs and sectors can help government employees gain knowledge and experience to inform regulation and policy, especially as it relates to emergent technologies like AI." There is no pressing need to put these plans into action, though. //Related Articles Tech Giants: AI Is Awesome, Totally Not Going to Kill You "It is very unlikely that machines will exhibit broadly applicable intelligence comparable to or exceeding that of humans in the next 20 years," the White House says, forecasting that "rapid progress in the field of specialized AI will continue, with machines reaching and exceeding human performance on an increasing number of tasks." A companion document, meanwhile, details a proposal for federally funded AI R&D.

Review Your Emotional Intelligence, Says LMC Interactive Services Brisbane-based outsourced sales and marketing experts LMC Interactive Services have outlined five ways to fine-tune emotional intelligence - a key trait that the firm believes will increase the likelihood of success both personally and career-wise.     BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA, October 13, 2016 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Emotional intelligence is described as an intangible quality among individuals that affects how we manage behaviour, navigate social situations, and make personal decisions that achieve desired outcomes. It requires effective communication between the rational and emotional compartments of the brain, as it is common to emotionally react to something before the brain can rationally evaluate the complexities of a given situation. LMC Interactive Services are of the opinion that emotional intelligence can greatly impact the way in which a business is able to sell to potential customers. The firm utilises aspects of emotional intelligence to channel the mindset of target consumers, and to gain a greater understanding their ever-changing desires. Indeed, the firm can detect the emotions of customers using face-to-face interaction, and they assist them in a way that reflects the unique brand values they uphold on behalf of their clients. About LMC Interactive Services: http://lmcinteractiveservices.com.au/mission-statement/ If a person is unable to sell effectively to a target audience, it could be because they are slightly out of sync with their ability to manage or judge emotions. LMC Interactive Services believes that this mismanagement of delicate situations is often the cause of ultimately losing sales. It is because of this that the firm believes emotional intelligence often trumps intellectual ability when it comes to dealing face to face with customers, and understanding their needs. If a sales person doesn't have the necessary emotional empathy or ability to read situations, they are unlikely to succeed in a sales and marketing role. With this in mind, LMC Interactive Services has put forward 3 practical ways to improve emotional intelligence that can be used in a variety of personal and business situations: 1) Having regular downtime - Downtime allows us to refocus and revisit past situations in order to gain clarity. LMC Interactive Services use downtime to think over the 'what's and 'why's behind actions or inactions of the day, allowing them to examine how they would do things differently when the next similar situation arises. Simply put, if time is not being put aside to examine behaviour, then it is extremely likely that the same mistakes, misjudgements, and loss of sales will be made time and time again. 2) Having backup plans - LMC Interactive Services follow the mantra of 'fail to prepare, then prepare to fail', and argue that being prepared for what's around the corner and beyond is of utmost importance. Thorough preparation allows for greater reaction times and the total avoidance of reactionary and overly emotional reactions. This is extremely important in sales situations, and LMC Interactive Services advise those in sales roles to practice dealing with a variety of different customer types, situations, etc. to avoid being caught off guard when the situation happens for real. 3) Seeing the other perspective - We've all heard the saying 'walk a mile in the other person's shoes' before judging, and LMC Interactive Services believes this phrase underpins the importance of emotional intelligence. When a co-worker, superior, investor, competitor - or even customer manages to get under your skin, the firm suggests looking at the situation from that person's perspective - examining it from every angle. LMC Interactive Services use dynamic, cost-effective direct marketing services that are deployed throughout Brisbane. The firm's specialised sales and marketing campaigns are developed and tested using data that the firm has collected, and this allows them to always generate the best results. LMC Interactive Services are committed to the development of the people they work with, and they regularly host voluntary educational and motivational workshops and seminars to help the firm's associates expand their skills set and improve both their personal and professional development.

It solves puzzles in a surprisingly human-like way. by Will Knight October 12, 2016 A new kind of computer, devised by researchers at Google DeepMind in the U.K., could broaden the abilities of today’s best AI systems by giving them an important new feature—a kind of working memory. The researchers show that the computer, which consists of a large neural network connected to a unique form of memory, can perform relatively complex tasks by figuring out for itself what information to hold in its memory. The tasks include figuring out the best way to get from one station to another on London’s spaghetti-like Underground transit network, after exploring diagrams of other types of networks and learning about the most salient features. The Google DeepMind researchers call their system a differentiable neural computer. It is differentiable in the sense that its behavior—including what to store in memory—can be learned using the mathematical process, called backpropagation, that underlies the working of neural networks. As the network is trained with data, it will automatically store some information to a memory matrix. “Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data,” the authors, which include Alex Graves, Greg Wayne, and Demis Hassabis, write in a paper published today in the journal Nature. The advance is a step toward artificial intelligence that is a little more human-like in its abilities. While the technique is limited for now, systems built this way might someday perform useful work, says Ruslan Salakhutdinov, an associate professor at CMU who specializes in machine learning and AI. For example, a more advanced version might crawl Wikipedia and figure out what significant concepts, like names, places, and dates, to store in memory. Or it might allow a robot to use information learned in one setting in a completely new one. “It’s a very exciting piece of work,” Salakhutdinov says. The latest machine-learning systems are brilliant at certain tasks, like recognizing faces in images or spoken words. And with practice they can learn to perform complex tasks like playing computer games to an expert level. But they require huge quantities of specific data for training, and unlike a human, cannot store much of what they have learned in memory for use later. This presents a problem in many areas, including language (see “AI’s Language Problem”).  Salakhutdinov notes, however, that making such a differentiable neural computer more complex could be difficult. That’s because in order to access its memory, it has to perform a complex calculation querying every stored piece. “It’s super difficult to get these things to work,” he says. “Scaling up can be a bit problematic.” Interestingly, the work brings two fields of AI that have long been at loggerheads a little closer together. Early work in artificial intelligence involved programming machines to represent information symbolically, while the current vogue is to use very large neural networks that train themselves to perform tasks. For a long time, some AI traditionalists and cognitive scientists have questioned whether neural networks can do what humans do without gaining some deeper ability to represent information symbolically. “I am most impressed by the network’s ability to learn 'algorithms’ from examples,” says Brenden Lake, a cognitive scientist at New York University who studies ways of making computers mimic human intelligence. This could expand the usefulness of deep learning. “Algorithms, such as sorting or finding shortest paths, are the bread and butter of classic computer science. They traditionally require a programmer to design and implement.”  But Lake points out that the system is still not quite human-like in the way it works. “People can pick up a new task from a limited amount of experience, especially if they are familiar with the domain,” he says. “In contrast, the differential neural computer is trained on tens or hundreds of thousands of examples of each task. I think the human ability to quickly learn new tasks will be one of the next major AI challenges.” Weren't able to make it to EmTech? We've got you covered.

Through its multi-dimensional, algorithmic modelling approach, the Visual IQ platform measures the true impact of an organisation's marketing efforts by identifying the touchpoints that are most effective across the complex customer journey and determining how to best allocate budgets.

Visual IQ, which was included as a Niche player in last year's inaugural Digital Marketing Analytics Magic Quadrant, was positioned the furthest in the Visionaries quadrant in this year's report for its Completeness of Vision, which is evaluated based on a deep understanding of the industry, product innovation, and marketing, sales, and geographic strategy. "We feel Gartner's recognition of Visual IQ as a Visionary in Digital Marketing Analytics speaks volumes to the work we've been doing since we started in 2006 to build a robust, innovative and constantly evolving attribution solution for our customers across the globe," said Manu Mathew, co-founder and CEO of Visual IQ. "We believe our shift from Niche player to Visionary demonstrates we are meeting, and in many cases exceeding, the unique needs of today's advertisers, and we look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with attribution in the years to come."

"Science fiction is slowly becoming science fact," Tania Mathias, chair of the Science and Technology Committee said. "Robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our lives over the coming decades." The committee's report urges the government to set up a commission to ensure AI enriches workers' lives in Britain, rather than destroy them.

"Government leadership in the fields of robotics and AI has been lacking. Some major technology companies — including Google and Amazon — have recently come together to form the partnership on AI." The report expresses "disappointment" that the British government has still not published its digital strategy and urges it to "set out its plans for equipping the future workforce with digital skills we need."

Labour Deputy Tom Watson, told the party's annual conference that the inquiry would look at the future of Britain's workforce; an announcement that was branded "ignorant" and "patronizing" by robotics expert and futurologist Ray Hammond.  "I understand why they may need to discuss the topic. But they're representing it as some kind of apocalypse," Mr. Hammond told Sputnik in a recent interview.

Artificial intelligence (AI) such as driverless cars and supercomputers that can help doctors with medical diagnoses will soon be the norm, the Science Technology Committee says, but the government’s role in preparing for the change is “lacking.” Read more Robots will ‘liberate’ 25% of business service workers by 2035, claims Deloitte “Science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our lives over the coming decades,” said Tania Mathias, the Tory acting chairwoman of the committee. “It is too soon to set down sector-wide regulations for this nascent field but it is vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.” The committee warned the government does not have a strategy in place for developing new skills to help workers succeed in a world with greater reliance on AI. “Concerns about machines taking jobs and eliminating the need for human labor have persisted for centuries. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing others,” Mathias said. “Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes will play out, we must respond with a readiness to reskill and upskill. “This requires a commitment by the government to ensure that our education and training systems are flexible, so that they can adapt as opportunities and demands on the workforce change.” Read more Self-learning AI robot hired by London council… for customer service The committee added there were ethical and social issues arising from the use of AI. It said Google’s photo app, which automatically labels pictures, was reported to have classified images of black people as gorillas, and called for action to be taken to stop discrimination being accidentally built into AI systems. Earlier this year, a report by Deloitte said a quarter of jobs in Britain’s business services sector would be taken over by robots in the next 20 years because of falling technology costs and rising wages. Another report by the Big Four firm said more than 11 million jobs in the UK are at risk of automation, with the manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and professional, scientific and technical sectors to be hit the hardest. The London Business School predicts jobs in law, medicine, architecture, communications and space technology would be performed by robotic workers in the next 20 years.

Last month, an entrepreneur who hopes to open London’s first “fellatio cafe” revealed his staff will be made up entirely of sex robots. Businessman Bradley Charvet claims the sex-bot will be programmable to a person’s needs and will soon be seen as “totally normal.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2016.

Thousands of Facebook users have shared this maths conundrum with their friends, but there’s a catch- you can only share it if you understand what is going on (or just pretend you do). Surprisingly, more than 100,000 have shared the post, however you actually only need the most basic of maths skills to work out the correct answer. The post has divided problem solvers; with some unable to work it out and others arguing they found it too easy. (Scroll down for the answer). Brenden Sterrett posted: “I'll probably be the only one to admit that I didn't get it…” While John Bradley Leonhart replied: “It's important to remember that an IQ test doesn't measure intelligence, simply pattern recognition. I figured this out nearly immediately, that doesn't make me any more or less intelligent than any of you, it means I recognised a pattern on a photo on the internet. “Admitting failure is the quickest way to learn in my opinion, I feel really bad for those who pretend to know something they don't. They're only hurting themselves.” US scientists' new IQ measure: take the test Play! 01:31 Isis Ngame argued: “This has nothing to do with having a high IQ. The brain is, and always will be, a ‘pattern seeking device’. “Once you find the pattern of the first two problems, you'll seek out patterns in the others. Nothing special. It's what the brain naturally does.” Jerry Saunders replied: “Simple math and pattern recognition does not equal high intelligence.” So what’s the answer? All you need to do with the first two numbers on each line is to: Multiply/add/subtract. So on the first line: 8 x 2 = 16, 8 + 2 = 10, 8-2 =6 (or 16106). You then repeat the pattern for each line.

If you’ve been following the tech space over the last year, you may have noticed increased use of terms such as AI and bots. AI is definitely improving, and we’re just about getting started with bots, who can answer your queries, book your cabs and more. The underlying leitmotif of both these technologies is to take off some mental load off of us. So far, so good. Technological Singularity – that moment when AI takes over human intelligence – is still (at least) decades away. But British MPs on the Science and Technology Committee have already called for establishing a commission to address the issues raised by AI. They are calling for news skills for humans, which will ensure AI doesn’t make our jobs completely redundant. The bots are here Think about it. Till digital assistants and later smartphones came along, we used to memorise telephone numbers and birth dates of our loved ones. Since the last decade, we have conveniently outsourced this task to our digital organisers, phonebooks, Calendars and so on. The AI powering some services also send you reminders of when to call you friend on their birthdays; pulls up photos shot years ago to remind you of this day; shows you restaurants nearby based on time and location and much more. Why bother remembering things when you have information at the click of a button? Or through the voice of a digital assistant. We keep hearing about jobs that were done by humans being taken over by machines. Earlier this year, Foxconn replaced 60,000 employees with robots. Think replacing manual labour with robots is a no-brainer? Well, then how about a robot which is writing news articles? Then there’s this short film starring Silicon Valley’s Thomas Middleditch called Sunspring, the screenplay for which was written by AI. So you still think AI will not replace your job in the years to come? Well, think again. Image: Associated Press Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates have all expressed concerns over the threat perceptions of super intelligent robots and advanced AI. In his biography, Musk had even mentioned how Google buying Boston Dynamics had him concerned. Although Musk is good friends with Page, he is not very optimistic about something like AI assisted robots such as the ones Google has demoed. “He could produce something evil by accident,” said Musk about Page, alluding to the fact that Boston Dynamics made robots for US military. Alphabet, Google’s parent company has now put Boston Dynamics up for sale. Are we headed for a dystopian future? Robots being used in warfare is no longer in the realm of science fiction. But there are many books and movies which revolve around the theme of a dystopian future. The 2008 film Wall-E has painted a great picture of what could happen if we completely give in to intelligent robots and AI. Here’s a short video that drives the point home. As humans, we are meant to be physically and mentally active. But over the years, at least in metros, our dependence on smart devices and propensity to lead sedentary lifestyles has reached alarming levels. Innovations in technology have surely made our lives better. But just like remembering phone numbers, outsourcing everything to something programmed is also dangerous. Else the day isn’t far when we will start resembling the obese humans in Wall-E. Skills that require human intervention So far the AI we have seen, at least on consumer products, is aimed at performing specific tasks quickly. The conversational assistants such as Siri and Google Assistant, are definitely taking it a notch higher. Like that Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johannson starrer Her, where a lonely man falls in love with his operating system. Dr Tania Mathias, acting Science and Technology committee chairwoman, says that AI machines have narrow and specific roles for now. “It is too soon to set down sector-wide regulations for this nascent field, but it is vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now,” she told the BBC. She says that the government hasn’t shown any leadership on tackling the issue. According to her AI may create jobs in the future, but it will definitely be displacing many in the process. Mathias says that since we cannot pre-empt what those replace jobs will be, there should be committment from the British government to upgrade education and training systems. TechUK, representing UK technology companies has welcomed the report saying there has to be an informed and balanced discussion between business, academia, citizens and governments. Our systems and AI are getting more intelligent by the day. Google’s AI for instance is quite good at understanding context. This was ably demonstrated at the recently held Google hardware event. Supercomputers such as IBM’s Watson, which defeated a Jeopardy champion is the other spectrum. In the midst of this, what are those skills which cannot be made redundant by AI or robots? That is the question that needs a lot more discussion, not just in the UK, but across the globe.

The tech industry has been all over AI for a while but, so far, governments have stayed quiet. With the launch of the Science and Technology Committee’s report on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in the UK and the White House’s National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology report, AI has now been thrust into central conversations at a regulatory and policy level. The tone of both the reports is largely what you would expect. The UK report, which was prepared by Science and Technology Committee, was pessimistic on the country’s current readiness for AI, while also critical on government actions to date. The US report was largely negative in its tone when addressing the future, focusing on correcting the challenges than growing the potential, and at times demonstrated paranoia more than anything else. In both reports, there was a very strong undertone of haughty self-importance. But what did we learn from the reports? Education and Skills Both reports focused on one area which has been clear for some time, though has not been recognized in an official capacity: the education systems in both the UK and the US are not built towards creating the skills required for a digital era and artificial intelligence. The industry is already in a skills drought, this can be seen through the vast sums of money which is being spent on AI start-up acqui-hires, and it will only become worse. Within the UK, the Science and Technology Committee has called upon the government to stop dilly-dallying and commit to a digital strategy which would trickle down to the education system. Professor Rose Luckin from the UCL Institute of Education commented “I do not feel that the moment we are equipping either students in school or workers in the workforce with the requisite skills to know how to adapt themselves to use the automation they are being offered to the best effect.” In short, Rose believes the education system needs to evolve to prepare students for a world where AI and robotics are commonplace. The US government also echoes this point. “Integrating AI, data science, and related fields throughout the Nation’s education system is essential to developing a workforce that can address national priorities. Educational institutions are establishing and growing AI programs at all levels. Universities, colleges, and even secondary schools are expanding AI and data science curricula, but more programs and teachers are needed.” One of the most important notes from both the reports is a change in mind set to both individuals and the education system. While the millennials are accustomed to the connected world, the education system is not. Schools and universities need to adapt to create a more data-literate community to alight with the digitally-orientated economy which is on the verge of mainstream. Economy and jobs This is an area which Telecoms.com has discussed before, and has been addressed by a number of industry commentators but not with any official substance to date. The introduction of artificial intelligence will have to managed responsibly to ensure the impact on employment in certain sectors is not too drastic. The UK report has taken a very balanced, if non-committal view on the topic, highlighting the number of jobs which will be created alongside the ones which will be lost. While this is encouraging for the country and economy on the whole, your correspondent isn’t too sure the same sentiment will be felt by a London cabby having to retrain in his mid-fifties. The White House’s National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology instead raise an interesting point which has so far flown under the radar. “Analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) suggests that the negative effect of automation will be greatest on lower-wage jobs, and that there is a risk that AI-driven automation will increase the wage gap between less-educated and more-educated workers, potentially increasing economic inequality.” In a country where tensions are already high, with the difference between the increasingly wealthy middle-class and the further down-trodden working classes plainly obvious, the transition will have to be managed carefully to ensure the negative impacts are not too drastic. The roll-out of artificial intelligence will come faster than any other scientific advancement in history, how the government reacts and the policies created to support redundant workers could partially define the success of AI. A question of ethics How do you programme ethics and morals into a computer? If philosophers have been pondering the questions of existence, morality and consciousness for millennia without coming to a conclusion, what chance do plebs like us have of translating that unknown answer into a language a computer can understand. AI will impact every aspect of day-to-day life from self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, to intelligent tutoring programmes, raising a host of social, legal and ethical questions. Transparency in the decision making process of the machine has to be paramount, to maintain the AI is continuing to act within the parameters set forward. But who writes these parameters in the first place? Preventing bias being built into the AI system could be a very complicated task. The report from the White House has even gone as far as to suggest introducing new training programmes for those involved in the development of AI. “Ethical training for AI practitioners and students is a necessary part of the solution. Ideally, every student learning AI, computer science, or data science would be exposed to curriculum and discussion on related ethics and security topics. However, ethics alone is not sufficient.” The question of ethics and control models in artificial intelligence could be a melting pot of political, economic and social conflicts in the future. International collaboration is key though the one-upmanship which is commonplace in the political world and standards development could see a slight delay. Government posturing Both reports demonstrated a clear message: we’re the best and should lead the development of AI on a global scale. The ‘listen to me’ attitude should hardly come as a surprise considering politicians and academics are some of the more self-righteous career paths available, though there is certainly a bit of international posturing coming through too. The report has highlighted the UK considers itself the self-appointed world leader in artificial intelligence, and thus the UK government should play a central role in the development of international standards. Back in 2013, the UK government identified Robotics and Artificial Intelligence as one of the ‘Eight Great Technologies’ which should be supported and cultured. A committee was promised and to-date, three years later, has not appeared. This contradictory chain of events dents the UK government’s claim for prominence in the international AI arena. The US government is hardly any better. Once again throughout the report there are several undertones of ‘we’re going to be the boss at this’. The posturing is hardly surprising as the potential of AI is immense; governments will want international policy to best support its own citizens needs and businesses ambitions. There isn’t necessarily a right answer to which country is most advanced at the moment. The US has Silicon Valley, and some of the leading minds in the technology world. The UK has Google’s Deepmind headquartered in London, a group of machine learning engineers who are arguably the best in the world. The Germans meanwhile, who are currently hosting the global IBM Watson HQ, have remained uncharacteristically quite over this international land-grab. Pompous public sector Another area which will have to be kept an eye on is the role of government. Throughout both reports there were numerous claims of the importance of the government in the development of the industry. Yes, there is a role from a regulatory and policy perspective, as well as education, but the involvement in the development of the technology should be managed because, let’s be honest, the best engineers are going to be working for the AI companies not the government. In short, the role of the government needs to be defined. After reading both reports it was still unclear how involved the government needs or wants to be. For example, there are several statements made in the reports which suggest the development of AI couldn’t possibly go any further without government assistance. Somehow Google got this far without public servants helping out whenever they decide to turn up to the office. For example: “Without a Government strategy for the sector, the productivity gains that could be achieved through greater uptake of the technologies across the UK will remain unrealized” – UK report “Provide much need direction and coordination” – UK report “Given the strategic importance of AI, moreover, it is appropriate for Federal Government to monitor developments in the first worldwide” – US report “Recommendation 12: Industry should work with government to keep government updated on the gradual progress of AI in the industry, including the likelihood of milestones being reached soon” – US report The government is important in the development of new technology, though it should be put in context. The private sector has more R&D funds, better insight on the practical implementations of AI and more qualified engineers to move the technology forward. Government has an important role to play, but let’s keep it to the right areas. One quote which should be analysed further is in the UK report in the section focused around standards and regulation. “It should focus [a committee to oversee the development of AI] on establishing principles to govern the development and applications of AI techniques, as well as advising government of any regulation required on limits to its progression.” Limits are needed, no-one wants AI to take over the world, but the limits imposed should be closely scrutinized to ensure progress is not faltered by prying government hands. In fact, this is a concern of Tech UK also: “Over regulation of robotics and artificial intelligence at this stage of its development risks stalling or even stifling innovation. This could in turn risk the UK’s leadership in the development of these technologies.” Gratuitous abuse The government has a very important role to play in the development of artificial intelligence, though it has to appreciate it is a supporting role. Creating regulation and policy to support the growth and prevent the abuse of AI should be the primary concern of public sector officials, though there are certain areas in the report where one could become concerns government hands are reaching too far. The role of government is critical, that is not under question, though there has to be a careful balancing act to ensure actions are not at the detriment of progress. Only time will tell as to whether official bodies are able to keep clear of micro-managing industry, but it also can’t write a blank cheque to industry.

Your Right to Know Public records complaint program open for business Enlarge Image Request to buy this photo Evan Vucci/The Associated Press Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump kisses a “Women for Trump” sign during a campaign rally in Lakeland, Florida, on Wednesday. By Julie Pace and Kathleen Hennessey The Associated Press  •  Thursday October 13, 2016 8:58 AM PUEBLO, Colo. — Brimming with new confidence, Hillary Clinton turned up the heat Wednesday on Republican candidates who are facing both tight election races and tough decisions on what to do about Donald Trump. She’s now seeking to spread her new momentum to fellow Democrats on November ballots. Are you with him or not? Clinton and her campaign are demanding of GOP candidates as she surfs a wave of new support, part of the fallout from the revelations of Trump’s aggressive sexual comments about women. Two newspapers, meanwhile, reported late Wednesday that Trump’s actions went beyond words. The New York Times published interviews with two women who say they were touched inappropriately by the billionaire without their permission. The Times said Jessica Leeds, 74, of New York, told the newspaper she encountered Trump on an airline flight three decades ago. Leeds said they were sitting next to each other when Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt. “He was like an octopus,” she told the newspaper. “His hands were everywhere." She said she fled to the back of the plane and later told several friends of the incident. Four of those friends also talked with The Times. Rachel Crooks, of Ohio, said she met Trump during an event at Trump Tower in 2005 while she worked in an office there. Age 22 at the time, Crooks says Trump kissed her “directly on the mouth” against her will. Shaken, Crooks said, she returned to her desk and called her sister, Brianne Webb, in the small town in Ohio where they had grown up, and told her what had happened. “She was very worked up about it,’’ said Webb, who recalled pressing her sister for details. ‘‘I was like, ‘that is not normal.’” Trump denied the accusations, telling The Times “None of this ever took place.” His campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, called the story “a completely false, coordinated character assassination.” Separately, The Palm Beach Post in Florida, reported Wednesday night that Mindy McGillivray, 36, told the newspaper that Trump groped her at his Mar-a-Lago estate 13 years ago. Trump’s campaign said her allegation “lacks any merit or veracity.” At a rally in Colorado, Clinton declared that Trump is desperate and running a “ scorched earth strategy.” “That’s all they have left — pure negativity, pessimism,” she said. Indeed, Trump kept up his unrelenting denunciations of Clinton at a rally in Florida. It’s not enough for voters to elect him instead of her, he declared, “She has got to go to jail.” Later Wednesday, Clinton was campaigning in Las Vegas, where she planned to call out Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican in a tough Senate fight who revoked his support for Trump after hearing his caught-on-video boasts about groping women. The focus on Republican congressional candidates is the latest sign the Clinton campaign is moving past a narrow focus on winning the White House and is aiming to win big — by delivering the Senate to Democrats, making deep cuts into the Republicans’ majority in the House and, possibly, winning states long considered Republican territory. “If you’ve got friends in Utah or Arizona, make sure they vote, too,” Clinton told a raucous crowd in Pueblo. “We are competing everywhere.” Clinton’s new swagger and expanded ambitions come as Trump has declared that he feels unshackled to launch the sort of hard-edged, personal campaign his most ardent supporters love. In Florida, he highlighted a new batch of hacked emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s account, published by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group. He asserted that the emails show ever more clearly that the former secretary of state and her family are corrupt. Podesta, citing a tweet as evidence, suggested the Trump team knew in advance about WikiLeaks’ plans to publish his hacked emails. The group, which U.S. officials have said has ties to Russian intelligence, released a fourth installment of correspondence between top Clinton campaign officials on Wednesday. Podesta said the FBI is investigating Russia’s possible involvement. While acknowledging that any evidence was circumstantial, he said the alleged ties could be driven either by Trump’s policy positions or the Republican’s “deep engagement and ties with Russian interests in his business affairs.” As party leaders step away from him, Trump vows to win the election his own way. He has struck particularly hard at House Speaker Paul Ryan, who told Republicans Monday he’ll no longer campaign for Trump. Trump said in Florida there is a “whole sinister deal going on” that has prevented Ryan and other Republican leaders from fully backing his campaign. “We’re going to figure it out,” he said. “I always figure it out.” He said, “I wouldn’t want to be in a foxhole with a lot of these people, that I can tell you, including Ryan. By the way, including Ryan, especially Ryan.” Information from The New York Times was used in this story.

She’s now seeking to spread her new momentum to fellow Democrats on November ballots. The move came on a day that ended with new allegations — piling onto already damaging revelations of Trump’s aggressive sexual comments about women. Two newspapers reported late Wednesday that Trump’s actions went beyond words. The New York Times published interviews with two women who say they were touched inappropriately by the billionaire without their permission. The Times said Jessica Leeds, 74, of New York, told the newspaper she encountered Trump on an airline flight three decades ago. Leeds said Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt. “He was like an octopus,” she told the newspaper. “His hands were everywhere.” Rachel Crooks, of Ohio, said she met Trump at Trump Tower in 2005. Age 22 at the time, Crooks says Trump kissed her “directly on the mouth” against her will. Trump denied the accusations, telling the Times, “None of this ever took place.” His campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, called the story “a completely false, coordinated character assassination.” Separately, The Palm Beach Post in Florida, reported Wednesday night that Mindy McGillivray, 36, told the newspaper that Trump groped her at his Mar-a-Lago estate 13 years ago. Trump’s campaign said her allegation “lacks any merit or veracity.” The reports came as two GOP senators and two House members who called for Trump to step aside over the weekend climbed back aboard. Their basic case: They’re voting for a Republican next month, and if Trump isn’t leaving then he’s got to be the one. John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate told the Rapid City Journal he had “reservations about the way (Trump) has conducted his campaign and himself.” However, he said, “I’m certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton.” Also back on board after calling on Trump to resign: Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Reps. Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Bradley Byrne of Alabama. There still are some three dozen GOP lawmakers who have withdrawn their support or are calling for Trump to step aside. At a rally in Colorado, Clinton declared that Trump is “desperate” and running “scorched earth strategy.” “That’s all they have left — pure negativity, pessimism,” she said. Indeed, Trump kept up his unrelenting denunciations of Clinton at a rally in Florida. It’s not enough for voters to elect him instead of her, he declared, “She has got to go to jail.” Later Wednesday, Clinton was campaigning in Las Vegas, where she planned to call out Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican in a tough Senate fight who revoked his support for Trump after hearing his caught-on-video boasts about groping women. The focus on Republican congressional candidates is the latest sign the Clinton campaign is moving past a narrow focus on winning the White House, and now is aiming to win big — by delivering the Senate to Democrats, making deep cuts into the Republicans’ majority in the House and, possibly, winning states long considered Republican territory. “If you’ve got friends in Utah or Arizona, make sure they vote, too,” Clinton told a raucous crowd in Pueblo. “We are competing everywhere. ... I think Americans want to turn out in as big a number as possible” to reject Trump’s message, Clinton said. She had sympathetic words — serious or not — for Trump supporters who have begun to interrupt her events. As security escorted one man out in Pueblo, Clinton said: “You have to feel a little sorry for them; they’ve had a really bad couple of weeks.” Clinton’s new swagger and expanded ambitions come as Trump declares he feels unshackled to launch the sort of hard-edged, personal campaign his most ardent supporters love. In Florida, he highlighted a new batch of hacked emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s account, published by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group. He asserted that the emails show ever more clearly that the former secretary of state and her family are corrupt. “It never ends with these people,” he said. Clinton aide Glen Caplin said Wednesday that Trump’s campaign needs to explain its “possible ties to foreign espionage.” The campaign has accused Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, of having advance warning about the leak. Stone has confirmed he had “back-channel communications” with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, but he denies knowing about the group’s plans to release the trove of damaging correspondence. WikiLeaks, which U.S. officials have said has ties to Russian intelligence, released a fourth installment of private correspondence between top Clinton campaign officials on Wednesday. Podesta says the FBI is investigating Russia’s possible involvement, raising the extraordinary prospect of a link between Russia and the U.S. presidential election. The FBI said anew that it is investigating possible Russian hacking involving U.S. politics but made no comment on Podesta. Late Wednesday, Podesta was hacked again, this time via his Twitter account. The campaign would not comment on whether the second hack was related to the email breach. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday in Moscow that “hysterics have been whipped up to distract the attention of the American people from the essence of what the hackers released. ... They talk about who did it. Is it really that important?” With polls showing Clinton pulling ahead in the presidential race and Trump digging in, Republican candidates for the House and Senate are tied in knots. If they revoke their support for their party’s nominee, they risk losing his voters and losing their races. If they stand by him, they not only risk turning off moderate Republicans but also being branded for years as aligned with the Republican who sparked a crisis for the party. As party leaders step away from him, Trump is vowing to win the election his own way. He is striking particularly hard at House Speaker Paul Ryan, who told Republicans Monday he’ll no longer campaign for Trump. Trump said in Florida there is a “whole sinister deal going on” that has prevented Ryan and other Republican leaders from fully backing his campaign. “We’re going to figure it out,” he said. “I always figure it out.” He said, “I wouldn’t want to be in a foxhole with a lot of these people, that I can tell you, including Ryan. By the way, including Ryan, especially Ryan.” ——— Associated Press writers Steve Peoples, Jonathan Lemire and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.     Tags: trump, clinton, campaign, republican, wednesday, about, Other stories from today: Condor chick born in wild flies from nest at California park Drone attack on Kurdish, French forces reveals new threats Danish angling bonanza: 80,000 trout set free by accident     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of Donald Trump's election as president of the United States?

The funding will allow the RegTech firm to realise its ambitious growth strategy, and increase product penetration across Europe and North America, with the New York office officially opening this week. With financial crime becoming ever more sophisticated and endemic, the time is ripe for a smart disruptor to shake up the compliance market. ComplyAdvantage takes a unique approach in providing proprietary, dynamic risk data with more efficient screening and monitoring technology. It is already enjoying early success, with some 200 clients globally relying on ComplyAdvantage technology to reduce financial crime risk and take the pain out of regulatory compliance. The funding round was led by Balderton Capital, one of the largest Europe-focused venture funds. "In compliance, we see lots of entrants with a new workflow, or user-interface tool that is just repackaging the same data. ComplyAdvantage is doing something different, by developing its own proprietary global data set of individuals and companies that pose a threat”, said Tim Bunting, General Partner, Balderton Capital. “We believe that this is one of the few remaining large industries that is still ripe for digital disruption. We are thrilled to be backing Charles and his team, they are well on their way to changing the way companies can understand and monitor risk around their clients. Their mission is truly exciting, and relevant to all businesses." Considering the escalating volume of financial crime combined with the corresponding waves of regulation, it is clear that current anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) solutions must improve. London and other financial centres are frequently cited as money laundering hot spots, while according to recent reports authorities are only able to identify and stop a tiny fraction of illicit funds. “Compliance is painful, slow and expensive,” said founder Charles Delingpole. “It is a huge overhead for firms and there is a massive opportunity to unlock this through technology. At one of my earlier businesses, I was the guy who would have gone to prison if we got compliance wrong, and I found it incredibly difficult to rapidly and safely assess the potential risk of my customers using the existing data and software on the market. To make matters worse, the tools generally generated a huge amount of manual work. So I decided to do something about it. This investment is testament to the incredible things the team has achieved so far and we look forward to taking our business to the next level with Balderton’s support and expertise.” Using its dynamic proprietary database, which covers Sanctions and Watchlists, Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), and global Adverse Media, the firm is able to create structured profiles of high risk individuals, companies and their associates based on the very latest data. Its innovative AI screening and monitoring technology not only ensures better accuracy but also helps in cutting through the noise and reducing ‘false positives’ (incorrect risk alerts). Chris Pilling, previously founder of Complinet, and former-SVP of Compliance and Regulatory Risk at Thomson Reuters, is now a Strategic Board Advisor to, and investor in, ComplyAdvantage. He commented, “I am delighted to be involved with Charles and the team. At a time when the industry is struggling to cope with the increasing burden of regulatory compliance, there has never been a greater need for radical innovation. By adopting the very latest technologies this firm is capable of delivering a solution that is markedly superior to anything I have seen on the market today.” ComplyAdvantage’s solutions cover three main areas: a data feed of proprietary AML risk data, an on-boarding screening and monitoring platform for ‘know your customer’ (KYC) processes and a real-time transaction monitoring platform to detect suspicious customer behaviours. About ComplyAdvantage ComplyAdvantage helps firms make intelligent choices when complying with regulations relating to sanctions, money laundering (AML), terrorist financing (CFT), bribery and corruption. Its unique proprietary database of individuals, organisations and associated entities provides dynamic real-time insight into financial crime risks. ComplyAdvantage uses artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data analytics combined with a tailored risk-based approach to help firms not only to manage their compliance and risk obligations but to prevent the occurrence of financial crime. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in London and with offices in Cluj, Romania, and now in New York, USA, ComplyAdvantage works with some 200 clients in the financial markets and other regulated and high-risk sectors.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) By  The Associated Press The Associated Press on October 12, 2016 at 10:24 PM, updated October 12, 2016 at 10:28 PM Print Email PUEBLO, Colo. — Hillary Clinton turned up the heat Wednesday on Republican candidates who are facing both tight election races and tough decisions on what to do about Donald Trump. She's now seeking to spread her new momentum to fellow Democrats on November ballots. The move came on a day that ended with new allegations — piling onto already damaging revelations of Trump's aggressive sexual comments about women. Two newspapers reported late Wednesday that Trump's actions went beyond words. The New York Times published interviews with two women who said they were touched inappropriately by the billionaire without their permission.

Trump denied the accusations, telling the Times, "None of this ever took place." His campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, called the story "a completely false, coordinated character assassination." Separately, The Palm Beach Post in Florida reported Wednesday night that Mindy McGillivray, 36, told the newspaper that Trump groped her at his Mar-a-Lago estate 13 years ago. Trump's campaign said her allegation "lacks any merit or veracity." And late Wednesday, People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff posted a story about a 2005 incident at Mar-a-Lago where, she wrote, Trump "was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat." The Trump campaign also said there was "no merit or veracity" to Stoynoff's story. The reports came as two GOP senators and two House members who called for Trump to step aside over the weekend climbed back aboard. Their basic case: They're voting for a Republican next month, and if Trump isn't leaving then he's got to be the one.

Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri issued a statement: about the New York Times story, saying it "sadly fits everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women." But an increasingly confident Clinton made only brief reference to Trump's comments about women — noting the Republicans' dismissal of the conversation as "locker room talk" — and did not address the new allegations. She spent Wednesday trying to float above the fray, warning voters in Colorado and Nevada not to be turned off by the "pure negativity" coming from her opponent. Clinton's campaign had signaled she would go even harder on Republicans, but after news of the fresh allegations, Clinton demurred. She continued to make newly prominent and explicit pitches for congressional candidates in tight races, including Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy and Nevada Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. Trump kept up his unrelenting denunciations of Clinton at a rally in Florida. It's not enough for voters to elect him instead of her, he declared, "She has got to go to jail."

By the way, including Ryan, especially Ryan." ___ About Us About NOLA.com About NOLA Media Group Community Rules Content Partners Advertise with us Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Connect with the Newsroom Blog for Us Careers Submit a Correction The Times-Picayune Subscribe TP electronic edition eNewsletters Breaking news text alerts Report a wet or missing paper Make a payment, manage your account RSS Times-Picayune Store Legal notices NOLA.com Sections News Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages New Orleans St. Bernard East Jefferson West Bank Northshore/St. Tammany Plaquemines River Parishes Baton Rouge Mobile Mobile Apps | Mobile FAQ More on NOLA.com Videos Weather Webcams/Live!

Noah's Ark Laboratory, the company's research unit that specializes in the development of machine learning, AI and data mining, is responsible for setting up the partnership between it and the university. Huawei's AI researchers will be collaborating with those from UC Berkeley's new Artificial Intelligence Research lab. Together they will be working on a range of subjects related to AI such as natural language processing, reinforcement learning and computer vision. The partnership is focused around bringing advancements made in AI out of the laboratory and into the hands of people. If their work is successful, it could later be implemented into the electronic devices produced by Huawei, such as its smartphones and tablets. Huawei and UC Berkeley are not focused on creating the most intelligent AI, but rather one that is functional and can contribute to society by improving the daily life of its users. Huawei elaborated further on the aim of its partnership with UC Berkeley, saying: "The two parties believe that this strategic partnership will fuel the advancement of AI technology and create completely new experiences for people, thus contributing greatly to society at large". Eventually the developments made at the Berkeley lab will find their way into Huawei's software. The company could either follow Microsoft's path by creating a virtual assistant similar to Cortana or it could use its advanced AI to create a predictive service more akin to Google's AI assistant. Either way the partnership between Huawei and UC Berkeley will benefit the company and the university and may possibly lead to breakthroughs in AI technology that are applicable to our everyday lives.

John Grimshaw, 59, from All Springs Drive, Great Harwood was found guilty after a trial at Preston Crown Court of an historic rape and indecent assault. In an emotional statement read out in court, the victim told how his actions have ruined her life. She said: “There was no part of my life that remains unaffected. “I still have nightmares. He ultimately stole my innocence.” The victim said she was ‘grateful’ to be finally able to speak out to bring Grimshaw to justice. She said: “I shall never forget what has happened but by speaking out I may encourage others to do the same. “I am so grateful that I have been given the chance to speak out and that someone finally heard my voice.” Judge James Adkin told the court that the evidence demonstrated Grimshaw’s actions had caused “severe psychological harm” to the victim. He sentenced Grimshaw to a total of 18 years in prison with an extended 12 months on licence and gave him a lifetime sexual harm prevention order. Petitioning for a sentence of less than 18-years, Wayne Jackson, defending, told the court 59-year-old Grimshaw had had a “long working life in industry” and had a lower than average IQ. Mr Jackson said: “At his age that sort of sentence will be devastating.” However Judge Adkin rejected the mitigation of low intelligence to hand Grimshaw the maximum prison sentence. He said: “Your intelligence is low and you have may not have been able to perceive when you did these dreadful things the extent to which you would damage the life of this child. “But the offending itself is not linked to your low intelligence.” AccringtonObserver Recently Published Hyndburn defendants up before the courts Our latest column from Blackburn and Burnley magistrates Councillor quits Accrington-based Masons - and threatened to involve police Man caught with sick video of restrained young girl being raped avoids jail Previous Articles Hyndburn defendants up before the courts Our regular column from Blackburn and Burnley magistrates Hyndburn defendants up before the courts Accrington defendants up before the courts Related Tags In The News Crime Places Great Harwood Most Read in News Accrington CCTV released after woman, 71, assaulted in Accrington Tesco Huncoat Bird's eye angle shows scale of huge fly-tipping incident in Huncoat Lancashire Constabulary Three boys taken to hospital after car collides with wall in Oswaldtwistle Accrington Woman accused of biting off half of barmaid's ear after being barred from pub Hollins Technology College Have-a-go hero dad Tony Moss tackles suspected shoplifter Most Read Accrington CCTV released after woman, 71, assaulted in Accrington Tesco Huncoat Bird's eye angle shows scale of huge fly-tipping incident in Huncoat Lancashire Constabulary Three boys taken to hospital after car collides with wall in Oswaldtwistle Accrington Woman accused of biting off half of barmaid's ear after being barred from pub Facebook Dad shares heartbreaking photo of Jessica Whelan's cancer battle - and gets call from One Direction star Harry Styles Most Recent Lancashire Constabulary Three boys taken to hospital after car collides with wall in Oswaldtwistle Accrington Stanley FC Coleman not surprised as Stanley turn the FA Cup tables Accrington Woman accused of biting off half of barmaid's ear after being barred from pub Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service Firefighters called out after cigarette 'burns hole in carpet' Hyndburn Council Taxi drivers to meet council bosses following Monday's strike Accrington Observer Follow Us Contact Us Advertise The Editor Journalists Join us on social media.
