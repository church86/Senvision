Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

The better they sell, the more competitive the market. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:17 Chorltonwheelie says: Wow! So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:21 Chorltonwheelie says: Intel and Nvidia’s products are better than AMD’s by a measurable distance at the moment. Try not to lose any sleep over it. If it’s what you can afford or just plain prefer then great… but no need to start telling fibs.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

These days performance gains are not as massive generation to generation By Matt Bach on Mar 16, 2017, 3:00 PM TechSpot Editor’s Note: Matt Bach is the head of Puget Labs and has been part of Puget Systems, a boutique builder of gaming and workstation PCs, since the early days. This article was originally published on the Puget blog. There is no doubt that a modern workstation will be faster than one that is more than a year or two old, but the advancement of computer technology has certainly slowed in recent years. 10 years ago, it was not uncommon to see massive performance gains generation to generation, but today we often see much smaller 10-15% performance gains whenever a new product is launched. Some areas (such as storage) are still showing massive raw performance gains, but when you benchmark the new products in a real-world scenario even these are not quite as impressive as what we used to see. These 10-15% gains per generation are not something most people will get excited about and make it difficult to determine how much of a performance gain you might see if you were to replace your 2, 3, 4, or 5 year old workstation with a new one. To try to answer this question as objectively as we can, we decided to directly compare five workstations using the highest end components over the past 6 years. Test Setup To benchmark the performance difference between different generations of workstations, we tested Photoshop with the following hardware configurations: Available ~January 2017 Intel Core i7 7700K (4 Core 4.2GHz) 4x 16GB DDR4-2400 (64GB Total) Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) 12GB Samsung 960 Pro 1TB NVMe SSD Available ~August 2015 Intel Core i7 6700K (4 Core 4.0GHz) 4x 16GB DDR4-2133 (64GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SATA SSD Available ~June 2013 Intel Core i7 4770K (4 Core 3.5GHz) 4x 8GB DDR3-1600 (32GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan 6GB Intel 335 240GB SATA SSD Available ~April 2012 Intel Core i5 3570K (4 Core 3.4GHz) 4x 8GB DDR3-1600 (32GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX 580 1.5GB Intel 335 240GB SATA SSD Available ~January 2011 Intel Core i7 2600K (4 Core 3.4GHz) 4x 8GB DDR3-1333 (32GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX 580 1.5GB Intel X25-M Gen 2 160GB SATA SSD   These configurations were designed first around the various Intel CPU generations (using the fastest CPU available at launch), followed by the fastest GPU that was available at that time. After that, we simply used the highest capacity of RAM supported by the platform along with the SSD model we most commonly sold at that time on Puget machines. On the software side, we will be using Windows 10 Professional and the latest version of Photoshop 2017 on each system to ensure that any performance differences we see are strictly hardware level rather than being influenced by different software versions. Unfortunately, since we don't always keep old hardware around once it is obsolete, we had to dig through our warehouse, closets and even home PCs to put together these systems. This means that some configurations are slightly off from what they ideally should be (such as using a GTX 580 instead of a GTX 680 and only a i5 3570K for the April 2012 configuration) but despite these small discrepancies our testing should fairly accurately show how a modern workstation compares to one that is 2, 4, 5, and 6 years old. Photoshop Action To start our testing, we looked at over 20 different actions including both general task like opening and saving files as well as a variety of filters (blurs, sharpen, lens correction, liquify, etc.) and a few other miscellaneous actions. Because of the high number of different tests, we are going to look at the results as an overall average across all of the tested actions. Looking at the average from the 20+ actions we tested, we get a pretty good idea of how much faster a modern workstation is for general Photoshop usage. If you go back just one generation, a system from the middle of 2015 is only going to be about 10% slower than a new system which is not terribly exciting. However, a workstation from 2013 is going to be around 25% slower than a modern workstation which means that if it takes you 10 seconds to open a Photoshop file or apply an effect on a 2013 workstation it should only take around 7.5 seconds on a modern workstation. This isn't anything dramatic, but it will certainly add up very quickly throughout a workday. If you go back even further to a workstation from 2011, that machine should be just a bit more than half the performance of a modern workstation. Again, if it takes you 10 seconds to complete an action in Photoshop on a workstation from 2011, a modern system should be able to complete that in about 6 seconds. This is a huge difference in performance! Photomerge Results To see how well a modern workstation performs when creating a panorama using photomerge, we tested with a set of both 18MP and 80MP images: Going back just one CPU generation to 2015, there is only about a 10% difference between a machine from that time and a modern 2017 workstation. However, if you go back to 2013, a workstation from that time is only 64-76% as fast as a modern workstation. If you look at the raw results, you will see that this means a photomerge of 6x 80MP images that takes 6.5 minutes on a 2013 workstation takes just 4 minutes on a new 2017 workstation. Going back even further, a machine from 2012 is only about 60% as fast as a modern workstation and one from 2011 is only 43-61% as fast. Again looking at the raw results, where a modern system takes just 4 minutes to do a Photomerge of 80MP images, a machine from 2011 will take a bit more than 9 minutes. Merge to HDR Results Just like photomerge, we again used a set of both 18MP and 80MP images to see exactly how much faster a modern workstation is: Overall, the results are not that much different than the results from the previous two sections. There is only a small difference in performance going back to 2015, but the difference gets larger and larger the further back you go. Especially if you have a workstation from 2013 or older, you can expect pretty large performance gains by upgrading to a modern workstation. Conclusion Averaging the results from the three sections, you can get a great idea of how much faster a modern workstation should be on average compared to ones from previous years. If you would rather think in terms of a new workstation being X times faster than an older system, we also have this data in a slightly different format that you may prefer: How much faster is a new 2017 Photoshop workstation? Compared to January 2011 system: 1.8 times faster Compared to April 2012 system: 1.5 times faster Compared to June 2013 system: 1.35 times faster Compared to August 2015 system: 1.12 times faster If you have a fairly new workstation that is only a few years old, it probably isn't necessary to upgrade unless your workflow requires the best possible performance. If you have a machine from 2013 or older, however, you could be looking at some very significant performance gains. You might not see a doubling in overall performance even if you have a workstation from 2011 but it will be pretty close and should significant improve your productivity. Keep in mind that we are looking strictly at high-end workstation from each time period. If you have an off-the-shelf workstation, you would actually probably see even larger performance gains than we showed since those workstations tend to not be nearly this high-end. For example, back in 2011 a typical workstation likely used platter storage drives rather than an SSD which would make opening and saving files much longer than what we saw in our testing. In addition, the majority of older workstations are not going to have nearly as powerful of a GPU as what we tested with or as much RAM. Overall, we hope that this testing helps you decide whether you should upgrade to a new workstation or not. If you found it helpful and want us to do more testing like this please let us know in the comments section. We highly value your feedback and love hearing your suggestions!

It seems clear, though, that Microsoft doesn't want these processors to work on their older operating systems. So they've decided to roll out a processor check in Windows Update on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, preventing users from download updates if their system contains a Kaby Lake or Ryzen CPU. The error message that users have been receiving on these systems reads: "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows". This update lock will no doubt annoy users who are running the latest hardware, but for whatever reason would rather not upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft is still supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through security patches and, in the case of Windows 8.1, some feature and bugfix updates, so those with the latest hardware will not be able to receive these updates. Microsoft's support page clarifies the exact processor families that aren't support in older versions of Windows: Intel seventh (7th)-generation "Intel Core" processor or a later generation AMD seventh (7th)-generation (“Bristol Ridge") processor or a later generation Qualcomm “8996" processor or a later generation Microsoft's recommended fix is, of course, to upgrade your system to Windows 10, even if it's working perfectly on an older OS. There does not appear to be any technical reason for the restriction, other than Microsoft's statement that these processors aren't supported.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News Why Are Chipmakers So Interested in Autonomous Cars? Shutterstock photo It’s the same reason that automakers are interested in the market. Although for them, it’s also a question of preventing tech companies from encroaching on their turf. There doesn’t seem to be any likelihood of such encroachment however, at least in the near future, as there is too much to making a car that’s just too far from what tech companies do best. So the first fully-autonomous cars that make it to the market will most likely be a collaborative effort between auto makers and tech companies. The primary selling point for self-driving cars is increased safety due to fewer accidents. There has been some research suggesting that when computers take over the roads, they will remove the chances of accidents due to human error (for sleep, distraction, intoxication, carelessness, brake failure or other mechanical problems, or when it’s the other guy’s fault, or any other reason). And of course this is what is broadly propounded by the companies invested in the phenomenon. Kathy Winter, the VP and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel INTC thinks that it will also help create logistics solutions for transportation and delivery of products. But don’t expect a sudden jump from driven to driverless cars. It’s more likely that cars will increasingly incorporate features that automate certain functions over time, making them semi-automated to varying degrees. Regulatory and insurance considerations will also likely require the presence of a driver long after cars become fully-automated. The Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California, recently conducted a survey of forty experts including policymakers, researchers, government representatives, nonprofit organizations and tech companies, presenting the results in a report titled „3 Revolutions: Sharing, Electrification, and Automation.” The chief findings were as follows: 70% of survey participants think fully driverless vehicles will account for more than 20% of vehicles sold by 2040. 88% think commercially offered shared rides will make up more than 5% of all U.S. passenger miles by 2030, and 78% think commercially offered shared rides will account for more than 20% of U.S. passenger miles traveled by 2040. 70% also think that by 2050, the majority of vehicles used commercially for ride and car sharing in the nation will be zero emissions vehicles, including battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell electric vehicles. According to IHS Automotive forecasts, several thousand autonomous vehicles will be on U.S. roads in 2020, with the number growing to nearly 4.5 million vehicles by 2035. By then, there will be 21 million autonomous vehicles on the road globally, growing at a 43% CAGR from 2025 to 2035. No wonder everyone is excited. What’s In It For Chipmakers? Both Intel and NVIDIA NVDA say that the fully automated car will have as much electronic horsepower as a super computer. Whether a lidar or radar system is used to pick up images of the area surrounding the car, the system is based on semiconductors. These images have to be processed and matched with relevant data to decide a course of action at the blink of an eye. So there’s processing (analog, logic), communications and machine learning involved. Each of these operations will be facilitated with semiconductors. Plus there’s entertainment, displays and syncing with other devices that will also require semiconductors. Key Players The Intel Go computer and NVIDIA Drive PX 2 are designed to help cars detect pedestrians, objects, lanes, respond to traffic signals, etc. BMW is testing the Intel solution while Tesla TSLA is testing the NVIDIA solution. Baidu BIDU is developing an artificial intelligence platform that combines its cloud platform with NVIDIA self-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, etc for the Chinese market. NVIDIA has a lead in the machine learning segment and its automotive chips are already in millions of cars from a number of suppliers, which in combination, gives it an edge in the automated car segment. Intel has been in collaboration with Mobileye for quite a while and has finally announced that it will buy the Israeli supplier of self-driving technology (camera and laser-based sensors) for $15 billion. Mobileye currently sells its technology to 27 automakers across the world, so the combination will be highly advantageous for Intel.    Qualcomm QCOM , which beat Intel hands down in the mobile computing business, is also set to rule in self-driving cars (although this time, competition will be tough with both Intel and NVIDIA having gained some mileage). The company recently launched its Drive Data Platform, which is its version of a self-driving system to process the sensor inputs generated by a vehicle. The system is based on the Snapdragon 820Am and makes use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE). But there’s more. Qualcomm’s soon-to-be-completed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in an all-cash deal worth $47 billion brings on board NXP’s RF SoC for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. While IVI may not sound that exciting in the context of self-driving cars, the thing to bear in mind in this case is the SoC technology that will shrink the size of high power systems while lowering the cost. This will be quite a breakthrough for Qualcomm as a lower price will speed up adoption of its systems. Additionally, NXP is the biggest supplier of automotive chips worldwide so it has the necessary relationships to jumpstart its business. Alphabet GOOGL has developed self-driving technology of its own but its component suppliers aren’t known. Back in 2015, the company quietly acquired Lumedyne, a maker of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors including an optical accelerometer, a vibration energy harvester and a „Time Domain Switched” type of inertial sensor for $85 million. Lumedyne also had a number of patents pending approval at the time. Over the years, Google has also been hiring a growing number of people with chip design skills. In 2015 itself, Google’s Pixel team advertised an opening for a „multimedia chip architect” who can „lead a chip development effort” and „work with other engineers to take chip to product shipment”. Google was particularly looking for expertise in „image processing, video processing, stabilization.” The Pixel still uses NVIDIA chips, but Google does have internally developed self-driving technology and the greatest number of self-driving miles on record to train its self-driving system. Wrapping Up The self-driving/autonomous car conversation is just getting started. There will no doubt be much innovation in the space over the next few years, both by the biggest tech players and automakers and by smaller startups. In fact, CB Insights estimates that financing in the auto tech startup sector was over $1 billion in 2016 and more money will surely follow. This is one of the best places to be in because the technology is just being built, so it could be good business. Also, early investors can sell out their interest at a nice premium. For chipmakers it’s a rush to grab a share of the pie. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run Did you miss Apple’s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2017 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) are titans of the same semiconductor industry, born a generation apart. As in all human endeavors, the only constant in business is change, and Intel and NVIDIA find themselves today at different stages of their corporate life cycles. Thanks to coming adoption of technologies such as self-driving cars and artificial-intelligence (AI) software, NVIDIA has seen demand for its graphics chips move from a niche into the mainstream. On the other hand, Intel roared to global dominance during the rise of PCs and mainframe servers, but it has struggled to tap into more recent growth markets such as mobile computing, deep learning, and the like. So which is the better stock for you to buy today: Intel or NVIDIA? Let’s examine three different aspects for NVIDIA and Intel to determine which companies’ shares appear more attractive today. Financial fortitude Those same life-cycle differences reveal themselves in assessing the financial strength of NVIDIA and Intel. Look at these four important metrics of liquidity and solvency for both companies. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio NVIDIA $6.8 billion $2.8 billion $1.7 billion 4.7 Intel $14.9 billion $25.2 billion $21.8 billion 1.7 Data sources: NVIDA and Intel investor relations; Yahoo! Finance. NVIDIA easily beats Intel in terms of near-term liquidity — as evidenced by its current ratio — and in terms of net debt, which is just a fancy accounting term for cash and equivalents minus debt. That being said, Intel’s cash flow-generation capabilities are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of its debt will mature in 2022 or later, Intel could easily erase the majority of its leverage in a single year, even after subtracting the $9.6 billion it spent on capital expenditures in 2016. Intel is also an example of a company that uses debt, or a leveraged capital structure, as a source of competitive advantage. It’s one of the few semiconductor companies that also owns its chip fabrication plants; NVIDIA outsources its fab to a consortium of partners including Taiwan Semiconductor , Samsung , and more. Operating large fixed assets such as semiconductor manufacturing plants requires plenty of capital, which explains Intel’s use of ample leverage. Either way, both companies are in fine financial shape, given their respective strategies, so let’s call this one a tie and move on. Winner: Tie. Image source: Getty Images. Durable competitive advantages NVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaningful competitive advantages in their respective areas of the global semiconductor market. Sources estimate Intel controls 87% of the PC CPU market and 95% the server CPU market, although the exact numbers aren’t as important as knowing that Intel dominates the global PC and data center microprocessor markets, and for a predictable reason: Intel’s longtime performance advantage over the competition — namely, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)  — has allowed the company to charge higher prices per unit for its chips. Intel plows an aggressive portion of its profits back into its research and development, which has, in turn, allowed it to maintain the performance advantages of its chips. Barring execution risks, which have been a concern from time to time , this long-standing trend has served as a virtuous cycle that has allowed Intel to dominate its core markets and consistently produce above-average profits for its shareholders. The dollar values involved help flesh this dynamic out a bit more. In the past three years, AMD’s revenue has totaled $4.2 billion in 2016, $3.9 billion in 2015, and $5.5 billion in 2014. In contrast, Intel’s research-and-development budget alone has totaled $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over the same period. This kind of structural advantage is incredibly difficult to overcome. NVIDIA’s competitive advantages are more technological than structural at the moment. Because of its long-standing place as the creator graphics computing, on which it still focuses, NVIDIA’s chips have generally been the best of breed in each of the graphics processing applications its products serve. The company pressed that advantage with last year’s debut of its Pascal architecture, around which it launched a number of new chips. Better still, NVIDIA has used its advantage to help consolidate early leads in core growth markets such as AI computing platforms and driverless cars. In recent years, NVIDIA has become the GPU supplier to the AI efforts at Microsoft , Facebook , Amazon.com , Alphabet , and Apple , to name a few. Much has also been made of NVIDIA’s potential in self-driving cars, where it supplies the graphics chips that power the autonomous-vehicle efforts of Ford , Tesla , Volkswagen , Honda , and many more. Both of these industries figure to offer substantial growth opportunities over the coming decade, and NVIDIA’s place as the go-to supplier to support these emerging technologies speaks to their compelling value proposition. Winner: NVIDIA. Valuation The way the market is pricing Intel and NVIDIA shares should come as little surprise, given what we just learned about the outlook for their businesses. Here’s a snapshot of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for Intel and NVIDIA. Company P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA NVIDIA 38.3 29.5 23.6 Intel 16.9 12.3 7.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Both companies also pay dividends: Intel shares currently yield 2.9%; NVIDIA, a mere 0.5%. As for which stock appears the more attractively valued, I think both companies appear reasonably valued, given their respective growth outlooks. The multiple trends fueling NVIDIA’s growth should support its earnings growth for arguably a decade or more, so its sky-high valuation shouldn’t be a deterrent for investors with a similarly long time horizon. As more of a mature company, Intel will have its investment outlook driven by its ability to grow its EPS and return excess capital to shareholders. Its fantastic economics should allow it to do so, but it’s hard to get excited about a company that analysts see growing sales just 0.9% this year and 2% in 2018. So in terms of which company is more appropriately valued, I think both companies trade near prices that seem fair. Winner: Tie. And the winner is… NVIDIA by a nose Both companies present interesting value propositions to investors today. Intel offers a mix of profitability and income at a fairly discounted price, which could prove compelling to more conservative investors. However, many of NVIDIA’s growth markets are in their early stages, which makes it the more attractive stock to own over the long term. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Security FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000 GO Intel works with HackerOne to find the best white hats Mar 17, 2017 00:01 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Lagging behind many other tech companies, Intel has finally launched a bug bounty program, offering rewards of up to $30,000 for hardware vulnerabilities.  The program is being run via HackerOne, which enlists white hats from all over the globe to find security vulnerabilities in various software, firmware or hardware, depending on the hiring company. "We want to encourage researchers to identify issues and bring them to us directly so that we can take prompt steps to evaluate and correct them, and we want to recognize researchers for the work that they put in when researching a vulnerability. By partnering constructively with the security research community, we believe we will be better able to protect our customers," reads the announcement. Get a score, get some cash As per usual with this type of programs, the harder a vulnerability is to mitigate, the more Intel will pay white hats. The company takes into account several factors when determining the severity of a vulnerability. It first uses the CVSS 3.0 calculator to compute a base score, which is then adjusted based on the security objectives and threat model for the given product. For instance, a critical vulnerability for Intel Software will pay up to $7,500, while one found in the firmware will pay up to $10,000. The highest prize comes for vulnerabilities found in Intel hardware, where the limit was set to $30,000. The Intel Security products are not in-scope for the bug bounty programs, and neither are any third-party products and open source. Intel's Web Infrastructure is also not subject to the bug bounty program. Any acquisitions the company makes are not included in the bug bounty program for the first six months after the deal is complete. The fact that more and more companies turn to bug bounty programs is encouraging because it indicates they take security seriously. Some giants like Google have their own programs set in place, while others work together with HackerOne to run them. #Intel#bug bounty#HackerOne subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news 1Password Taunts White Hats with $100,000 "Capture the Flag" Bug Bounty Twitter Vulnerability Allowed Hackers to Access Locked Accounts Slack Bug Gave Hackers Access to Accounts, Messages, Tokens YouPorn Teams Up with HackerOne for Bug Bounty Program, Offers Up to $25,000 Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Microsoft Says Windows 10 Users Might Receive Critical Updates No Matter What New Windows 10 ISO Available for Download (Build 15058) Microsoft Launches Windows 10 Build 15061 for PCs Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support Say Goodbye to Another Microsoft App on Old Windows Phones    Intel finally launches bug bounty program Related Apps Hotspot Shield: Gain full access to online content while keeping your virtual identity safe with the help of this powerful and easy to use application Hotspot Shield Elite: Worry no more about being tracked while surfing the web or that your computer gets infected by using this powerful software application OkayFreedom: A VPN application that can conceal your real location, granting access to restricted web content and ensuring online privacy protection Trojan Killer: Seamlessly find and remove malware, spyware and other malicious components from your computer using this user-friendly application Boss Key: Hide currently open windows with a single key stroke by resorting to this application that ensures your privacy is protected while using your PC ACCDB Password: A simple to use application that works as a password recovery tool and supports MS Access 2007 to 2013 accdb, accde, accdm database files Avast Decryption Tool for CryptoMix: An utility that tries to decrypt files locked by the CryptoMix ransomware using the offline key and restore access to your valuable information Reader comments Two Russian Spies and Two Hackers Charged for 2014 Yahoo Hack more on: Yahoo i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The duo has joined hands to offer protection to Micromax smartphone users against growing and increasingly complex mobile threats. The Micromax devices including smartphones and tablets will now come integrated with McAfee Mobile Assistant that will help provide a secure mobile experience to Micromax users in India. The McAfee mobile suite is slated as an all-in-one security and optimization application that offers protection from risky apps, malware and potentially unwanted programs. The mobile security suite will come integrated on Micromax smartphones starting April 2017. SEE ALSO: Best Micromax 4G VoLte smartphones with Android Marshmallow to buy under Rs 7,000 The announcement was made in presence of Christopher Young, Senior Vice President, General Manager, Intel Security Group who mentioned, "With smartphones becoming an integral part of our connected lives, it is important consumers realize threats that exist in the digital world and understand how to safeguard their valued data". As of now, Intel has teamed up exclusively with Micromax smartphones to offer such secure ecosystem. McAfee team highlighted that as more consumers use their mobile devices in day to day activities from online banking to managing their connected devices, malware writers are rapidly evolving their techniques to exploit unsuspecting users to access their information, further underscoring need for robust protection. Besides, on being asked about the app's availability for users who are already using the Micromax smartphones, the team replied that the mobile security suite will be released to select existing Micromax smartphones via an OTA update. We also enquired about the fact that such security suites can consume resources such as battery, RAM and computing power in the background as they are always active and monitoring the user's online activity. The team mentioned that the McAfee mobile assistant has been tuned to make sure that users don't face any performance issues on their smartphones in everyday usage. McAfee Mobile Assitant Features: 1) In addition to secure your Micromax device from threats and risks, the McAfee mobile assistant also monitors battery and memory usage. 2) Users can clean unwanted junk files within the app 3) The app also offers real-time scans of apps for malware and unwanted app intrusions 4) Users will also get timely notifications to ensure a smooth running secure, phone experience As noted, India is the fastest growing market for mobile internet users and as per a survey, there will be 400 percent increase in digital payments by the fourth quarter of 2017. And with the ongoing trend of affordable 4G internet, smartphone users are constantly connected to internet making it a necessity to keep a check on mobile security. Post demonetization, there has been a surge in usage of mobile wallets, online transactions and app downloads, making the smartphones even more vulnerable and a playing field for cyber criminals. Therefore, such kind of secure mobile suites can prove quite useful to offer a safe online experience in the digitally connected world.

Now, there's a little smoke and fire in some corners of the internet, though, since a Microsoft Knowledge Base page has popped up about a potential error message that users with systems based on the forementioned CPUs might encounter when running Windows Update. More to the point, you might be told that "your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows," and that you'll need to upgrade to Windows 10. Despite this bit of news making the rounds around the web, and the fact that there's a running Reddit thread with close to 600 comments on the subject, there have yet to be reports of systems in the wild where this error message popped up. The support page doesn't appear to be a fluke, though, since searching the Knowledge Base for article 4012982 yields results in multiple languages. The company stated back as early as August 2016 that Windows 10 is the only supported version for new-generation systems, and its FAQ says as much: As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon. For example, Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel's upcoming "Kaby Lake" silicon, Qualcomm’s upcoming "8996" silicon, and AMD's upcoming "Bristol Ridge" silicon. Rather predictably, some commenters are up in arms about this event, assuming it ever pops up in production systems. However, as recently as January, Youtuber JayzTwoCents installed Windows 8.1 on a Kaby Lake Core i5 system without fuss. Veering a little into an editorial piece, there are a few things to consider. The whole situation begets the question of what are the expectations of users trying to run what's effectively a legacy OS on their new boxes, since they already knew what the support policy is. Ma and Pa may not, but it's not likely they're installing a fresh operating system on their computers anyway. There's also the matter of install media to consider. While there's a Media Creation Toolkit for Windows 10, most people trying to install Windows 7 or 8.1 will use a DVD or USB stick that (as far as we know) doesn't appear to have a CPU generation check, and possibly never will. That means that in order to not let people use an unsupported OS, it makes at least some sense that the check be done in Windows Update. Technically-minded users might point out that they're fine with running an "unsupported" operating system at their own risk, but the average user is likely not even aware of Microsoft's policy regarding Windows 7 and 8.1. In turn, he may encounter problems that he doesn't know the origin of, much less how to fix them. Flipping the subject on its head, it could be argued that at least Windows 8.1 could be supported on those CPUs, since its support ends in 2023, while Windows 7's EOL is reasonably close in 2020. At this point, it's difficult to tell if Microsoft's policy and execution on the matter creates a real problem. Tags: Windows Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

This meant basically that only Windows 10 would support Intel's, AMD's and Qualcomm's new processors, while Windows 7 or 8.1 would not. This does not mean that Windows 7 or 8.1 won't install on machines running these new processors, but that Microsoft (and the manufacturer) won't offer any form of support for those devices. A new support page on the Microsoft website suggests that users who run an unsupported processor on an older version of Windows -- read Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 -- won't be able to scan for or download Windows updates anymore. Users will get the following error message when they run the scan: Unsupported Hardware Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates. Microsoft notes that users may see other error messages when they use Windows Update, including: Windows could not search for new updates An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error. The cause, according to Microsoft, is that "new processor generations require the latest Windows version for support". Microsoft mentions seventh generation Intel processors, AMD "Bristol Ridge" and Qualcomm "8996" processor families specifically on the support page. The company has a solution for users affected by the issue: upgrade to Windows 10: We recommend that you upgrade Windows 8.1-based and Window 7-based computers to Windows 10.. Is there another option besides upgrading the operating system to Windows 10? Updates that are released for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 are also made available on the Microsoft Update Catalog website. I don't have access to one of the processors mentioned on the support page, but it is possible that manual installation of updates released for Windows 7 or 8.1 still works. While this means more work for the user, as it is necessary to monitor update releases to run searches on the Microsoft Update Catalog whenever they are released, it may be an option to keep on using the older version of Windows. Microsoft does not mention this explicitly on the support page, but it does not deny it either. Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update. Blocking Windows devices from using Windows Update is certainly an anti-consumer friendly move with the aim to get users to upgrade to Windows 10. Now You: Do you think Microsoft is going too far with this policy? Summary Article Name Microsoft blocks updates for new cpus on Windows 7 and 8.1 Description Microsoft revealed recently that Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 machines running cutting edge processors won't be able to use Windows Update anymore.

Set up a machine with both Windows 7 and Windows Vista installed, featuring one of these new processors, and then demonstrate how the Vista installation will happily continue to install updates, while the Windows 7 side is being blocked. I'm guessing that since Vista has something like a 3% market share (and was rejected by the public), Microsoft has not gone through the trouble of blocking would-be Vista users from using these new processors and getting updates. X86 is a standard for a reason. At one point I was even insane enough to run Windows XP on a Phenom II x6. Yes, it ran, and Yes, it installed updates just fine. Windows Update has never cared about what CPU was in the machine before, and it is more than a little fishy that it would start now, when Microsoft is so desperate to get Windows 10 adoption numbers up. And what about people on Windows 8.1? Windows 8.1 is still in the mainstream support period, so one would reasonably expect that Windows 8.1 would be supported on modern hardware up until the date of mainstream support expiration (some time in 2018). Reply The Flash March 17, 2017 at 1:32 pm # I can't install any updates at all on a fresh install of vista sp2. Reply seeprime March 17, 2017 at 3:06 pm # A Vista SP2 clean install can take several days to list the updates. It's very annoying and is another indication of how bad Microsoft's Windows Home and Pro update system actually is. If you want to speed that up you can install 360 Total Security, and run it's Patch up tool. It's often much faster than the Microsoft update system on older machines. It downloads the stand alone installers for each missing security update, and then installs them. Since there are about 200 for Vista SP2, this takes many hours, even on a 60mbps connection.

WSUS doesn’t run the same hardware checks and it bypasses all of the usual restrictions because it receives updates directly from Microsoft’s servers.

M$ have set their course for the long term, and their new business model is dependent on the personal customer data harvested by W10 spyware and malware. They've spent a lot of money going down the Big Data path, and will do anything and everything to ensure Windoze users are using W10. Reply buck March 17, 2017 at 10:10 am # Surely people are not surprised by Microsoft's latest W10 extortion tactic. "We've spent a lot of money developing our spyware platform and really must insist that you use it. You are only users, who are who to defy us?" On the bright side, at least these users won't be pestered with telemetry updates any more ;). Reply Owl March 17, 2017 at 10:27 am # Maniacal course and determined to run it. Changing CEO wouldn't fix it. They will do as much as they can. Most Windows 7 and 8.1 users will wind up unpatched. Reply Tau March 17, 2017 at 10:28 am # Simply don't use Windows Update but WSUS Offline. I think that, by trying to kill 7 as soon as possible, they're only doing collateral damage by now. Ryzen currently works better in W7 than 10 with that broken CPU sheduler, and the last Intel has very little changes. They got burnt with the extended support for XP, but W7 won't leave anytime soon..

Reply tinfoil friend March 17, 2017 at 11:09 am # I've been without updates for several years now. Everything looks and works ok. No telemetry. No unsual internet activity. Common sense is the best way when on the internet. Having serious thoughts to try a linux distro. Been several years since i tryed one. Linux wont be 'safe ' forever. Microsft just became involved with Linux. Tips for tinfoil people: -Shutdown PC when not in use. Remove/turn it offfrom the plug/main. -Block [range ]ip adress in router. -Use some firewall. The best are the ones that block all and ask you when something is trying to connect. -Use some software that disables ALL network connections when PC is idling.(5-10 minutes) -Dont use wireless. Personal example: i've update smart Tv firmware, now the wireless cant be disabled. LG smart shitware. Dont connect TV to internet either if you dont need it -Use a (laptop, NUC, mini etc)PC for browsing. Do everything else on another (no internet ) PC Relax from time to time. Go outside..leave your phone home.They cant track, too well, there yet. :) Reply hirobo March 17, 2017 at 7:34 pm # Same here. I stopped updating my Win7 several months before Win10 became RTM cuz I suspected they would have time to backport telemetry once the RTM was out. Reply nuna March 17, 2017 at 11:26 am # Just checked Amazon for an AMD B350 motherboard for their new Ryzen processors. Comments are showing that with a fresh install of Windows 8, the AMD/OEM chipset driver will not even install. https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Prime-B350-Plus-Ryzen-Motherboard/dp/B06X416NJ1/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1489740204&sr=8-6&keywords=AMD++Ryzen+Processor Also at the AMD site for Ryzen , their overclock utillity shows on chapter two, only windows 10 64 bit version as compatible. https://www.amd.com/system/files/2017-03/AMD-Ryzen-Processor-and-AMD-Ryzen-Master-Overclocking-Users-Guide.pdf So, apparently AMD and Intel are colluding with Microsoft to force upgrading to Windows ten even on currently maintained/ supported versions of Windows. This is little better than the price fixing scandals we've seen in various markets over the years. Class action would be nice to challenge their taking advantage of their monopoly position to force upgrading to their spyware/adware OS. There has got to be some law broken when a user must agree to give up their basic privacy and controll of their property as a condition of using Microsoft's products at any, even rudimentary level. Same could be said for Cellphones but that's another matter. Reply DaveyK March 17, 2017 at 11:28 am # Not wanting to feed the troll, but OSX Lion has been fully unsupported for 3 years. Windows 8.1 still has *mainstream* support for another year, and extended support until 2023. Windows 7 is also still under support for another 3 years. The fact that MS are blocking updates for Windows 8.1 on modern computers despite it being under full mainstream support is pathetic. They also risk a lawsuit from people who've bought Windows 8.1, only to find MS blocking updates for software that is supposed to be under full support. Nobody is complaining that unsupported MS operating systems like XP may not install on modern hardware because, well, they're unsupported. But that is not what is happening here. Reply Mustaf March 17, 2017 at 11:51 am # It's Microsoft, so what can you expect ? Or in other terms:......?@#!*&+?&!@)$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Reply Dan82 March 17, 2017 at 12:45 pm # I'm neither terribly surprised nor dismayed by these news. It's what has been happening for years, only now it has become apparent because a small number of Win 10 haters have bought some new hardware. Not that I disagree with their opinion on Microsoft's latest operating system, but the overlap of both groups is small enough that neither Microsoft nor AMD or Intel will care about them. That being said, owners of PCs are best off by far and many don't even realize how good they have it still, even in the face of Microsoft self-destructing before our eyes. If you want to get first-hand experience of how bad it can get, then buy a new laptop at the wrong time, like I did. Back then Windows 8 was the current operating system, so naturally the device came pre-installed with it. It was no big surprise that drivers for Windows 7 were unavailable, but Asus offered compatibility for an upgrade to version 8.1 of Microsoft's OS. Well, long story short, the integrated Intel wifi card started disconnecting frequently after the OS upgrade, while the manufacturer (Asus, can't mention them often enough) provided new drivers from Intel, they were clearly bugged and the old ones that did fine on 8 didn't work on 8.1 either. After contacting the Intel support about the matter directly, they only told me that the wifi card was compatible with Windows 8 but not with 8.1 and I should contact the manufacturer about it. D'oh, you can imagine how that story ended, namely with me p***ed off and not having bought a single Asus product in the past few years. So, while I can totally understand how consumers don't like Windows 10 and would like to use an earlier operating system despite their new hardware, I can also see the side of software companies who don't want to add new hardware support for their legacy software. Refusing them updates after they got the OS installed anyway may go a bit far, but it will also reduce the number of people contacting Microsoft support if the company can stop users from using that combo in the first place. Reply HateW10 March 17, 2017 at 1:16 pm # As much I dislike the current Windows update policy all of you above whining about not receiving update for an OS YOU have bought are WRONG. You can't have bought a windows 7, Vista and even windows 8 any more. Or do all of you people have unused copies of those OS lying in your closet for years ? Well maybe 8.1 but 7 or Vista aint really a case. When you bought that copy of Win7 there was no Ryzen. An you bought the OS with the license for 1 machine not 2, not 50. So none of the normal current Windows 7 user group can be affected by this. Changing you mother board had always the consequence of buying a new OS license. Sorry all of the above is just trolling or bad reading. Reply AnorKnee Merse March 17, 2017 at 2:35 pm # @ HateW10 Fyi, since 2009/2012, many companies have bought from M$ tens/hundreds/thousands copies of Win 7/8.1 Enterprise Volume Licenses. They would often have to buy new OEM Windows Pro computers, eg as replacement for broken Win 7/8.1 Ent computers and/or for business expansion. ....... Since Oct 2016, they could only buy new OEM Win 10 Pro computers and then downgrade them to Win 7/8.1 Ent = for free. Now, they can't do this with new OEM Win 10 Pro computers that come with Kabylake or Ryzen chips. This is way before the EOL in 2020/2023. So, M$ are using the above dirty tactic to try to force such companies to move to Win 10. On the consumer side, those who have bought from M$ the more expensive and transferable Retail Win 7/8.1 licenses is similarly affected, ie can't buy new computers with Kabylake or Ryzen chips. Reply Corky March 17, 2017 at 3:34 pm # @HateW10, You do know retail versions of Windows exist right? You do know that when people paid for those retail copies Microsoft agreed to patch security vulnerabilities for at least 10 years, irregardless of what hardware it was running on. Besides this has nothing to do with Windows or future patches being incapable of running on newer hardware as those patches are still going to be issued to businesses and via the Windows update catalog, this latest move is nothing more than an arbitrary choice of Microsoft's to make it more difficult for people to use Windows built in updating system on certain system.

Reply pHROZEN gHOST March 17, 2017 at 1:33 pm # One of the issues with sticking with an older OS, especially after end of life (EG XP), is that software support for third party packages eventually stops. You can keep running the older versions. But, eventually you will have problems to resolve on your own. Sure, you can go to Linux. But, as more people move to Linux, more hackers will take aim at the larger target. You cannot beat Microsoft. Reply www.com March 18, 2017 at 6:35 am # >Sure, you can go to Linux. But, as more people move to Linux, more hackers will take aim at the larger target. That's a lot tougher considering Linux was designed with security in mind while security in Windoze was seen as an afterthought. Not saying Linux is invulnerable but it will be tougher since one has to go out of their way in order to log in as root or even in an elevated account in order to get infected. Beside, Linux still has a long way to go if it hopes to reach any marketshare hackers will take aim at. Reply Stechy March 19, 2017 at 2:03 am # >considering Linux was designed with security in mind like pressing backspace 28 times and login in over a dozen distros? or like CoW which wasn't patched for years?

Henk van Setten March 17, 2017 at 2:06 pm # You may call me dumb, but I'd like to ask a simple question. Why not simply keep using your old PC motherboard with its good old chips? Do we really need those last-generation CPUs? Why? Are the old ones not fast enough? Except perhaps when you're some kind of cutting-edge gamer, why would we need to upgrade our some-years-old core hardware? Yes, a couple of years ago I revitalized both my old desktop PC and my not-so-old laptop by putting in a new fast SSD in each of them. And maybe one of these days I will buy a larger higher-res monitor. And oh yes, last year I did get myself a better keyboard (a backlighted mechanical one, fit for intensive typing work). But why on earth would I, as an average user, need to buy an all-new computer with a new motherboard any time soon? Reply Tom Hawack March 17, 2017 at 5:13 pm # I won't call that a dumb question. Maybe because I ask it to myself, or then we'd both be silly, not to mention many others. Hey! are we dumb to wonder what in a human being's brain pushes him frenetically to run after the latest service, product when it appears he/she has strictly no necessity of it? When what he uses runs fine, when the choice is between a perpetual run after the fashion and a calm use of a reliable and functional product? Fear. Fear of being left aside, fear of laughs, fear of not being in the system. Not only. Some users really want the latest top-notch not (only) to play the big-shots but because they know the limits of what they have, want to discover beyond those limits and have enough technological science to be sure the latest innovation/update is a true improvement and will get them where they want to go. But they are a minority. Most of us buy again and again, throw what we have though 100% functional and suitable for our needs, just to be in the lot. Advertisement and marketing interfere, to create those pseudo-needs and to satisfy them. The answer to your question, I don't know why I even gave my answer since this answer is known by all, all of which nevertheless continue to run, run and run. Carpe diem, my friends. Reply www.com March 18, 2017 at 6:40 am # I agree 100%, but that still doesn't exclude the sleazy tactics (like these chipset games) that M$ is using in order to force people into upgrading into Windoze 10.

I knew that and still ordered a Kaby Lake. It wouldn't have been a problem to not get FURTHER updates so long as I had previous ones. Now they block those and say "not our fault, just upgrade". I think this mindset is preposterous and they should be ashamed, but they are only in it for the money not customer satisfaction and ethics. Same applies to Mozilla, Google, Apple and many others that I can luckily avoid. Microsoft OS is a different matter :/ What's even worse... if they truly keep this up and don't undo their "mistake" this means that people will be forced to use W10 starting this gen CPUs, meaning that every new piece of hardware in the future will be W10-only (not just this gen!). Microsoft still officially supports 7/8.1 for a couple of years but you won't be able to build new PCs (without W10). This is hideous... Next step may be dropping support and drivers for the next GPU gen. I bet gamers would fancy that. Then again they want their precious DX12 which is W10-only. I found out about this new update policy yesterday, just 3 hours AFTER paying for my new computer with a Pentium G4560. For several weeks I pondered about buying and building a PC and monitored prices all the time. Ultimately I caved in and bought the parts. Already worried about stuff arriving DOA, dying later or not working correctly... now I also have to worry about stupid updates? Well, thanks. On my 8.1 laptop I haven't run WU for more than half a year (WU is slow and never works even with the update to WU) and the laptop works just fine. I planned on installing 8.1 on the new rig and getting some updates for security and fixes and then disable WU again. I'll still try to do that with WSUS or AutoPatcher, but what if I can't install chipset or GPU drivers because "Your OS-CPU combo is not supported, get the fabulous Windows 10!"? My only choices would be: no drivers or "CIAdows 10"... I didn't spend 450€ on a "good" PC for it to not work. And I absolutely don't want 10 (I'm also not a Linux person). I already don't like W8.1, but W10 is even more horrible. I've set it up and used it on another laptop and it's just ugly, annoying and clunky in usability, not to mention all the hidden "services" and restrictions. Sure, some stuff can be disabled or hacked in via registry or tools, but I don't want to do that and there are no guarantees (maybe some update reverts all the changes = waste of time). Even on 8.1 I can't get around some features and designs, but at least that OS is somewhat acceptable and stable. I should have my parts by next weeks weekend and then we'll see how it goes. I already kind of regret my purchase. This lengthy comment is from a person who grew up using Windows 95, 98, NT, 2k/ME, XP, Vista, 8.1 (and several hours of 10). Oddly I never touched 7.

Perhaps the DOJ should investigate this provided the current Administration follows suit. This move essentially kills upstarts and prevents competition in the hardware industry and some software circles. They've been fined for that before. Guess they need a refresher hit in their proverbial pocket book. Other countries have laws on their books that may prohibit this as well.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

The better they sell, the more competitive the market. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:17 Chorltonwheelie says: Wow! So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:21 Chorltonwheelie says: Intel and Nvidia’s products are better than AMD’s by a measurable distance at the moment. Try not to lose any sleep over it. If it’s what you can afford or just plain prefer then great… but no need to start telling fibs. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:44 a potato. says: I gotta say, I used a Radeon HD 5770 and a Phenom II X4 965 Black from 2010 until 2015, when I (finally) upgraded to an i5 6600 and a GTX 970. I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 17:33 MajorLag says: Yeah, that makes sense given their reputation as “basically a mediocre PC”. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

Sign up to comment and more Sign up Ars Technica UK Technology Lab — Blocking Windows 7, 8.1 updates for Kaby Lake, Ryzen chips appears imminent It looks like a policy announced a year ago is going to kick in. Peter Bright - Mar 16, 2017 10:45 pm UTC Enlarge / A Kaby Lake desktop CPU, not that you can tell the difference in a press shot. Intel reader comments 363 Share this story A recently published Knowledge Base article suggests that Microsoft is going to block Windows Updates for owners of the latest Intel and AMD processors if they try to run Windows 7 or 8.1. Last year, Microsoft announced a shift in the way it would support Windows. Going forward, new processors, including Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's recently-released Ryzen, would require the newest version of Windows. Users of Windows 7 and 8.1 would be out of luck, with Microsoft having no plans to support the new chips on the old operating systems. Skylake was originally going to be included in this policy, too, but Microsoft partially relented, switching instead to a policy of providing only security fixes for Skylake systems running Windows 7 and 8.1. This makes no practical difference for Windows 7, since that is in extended support already. Software in extended support only receives security fixes, and Windows 7 will continue to do so until 2020. In principle it means that Windows 8.1 users might miss out. That operating system is in mainstream support until January 2018, and during mainstream support Microsoft can potentially deliver feature improvements and other non-security updates. In practice, this is unlikely; Windows 10 is the only operating system receiving any meaningful feature development now, with Windows 8.1 only likely to receive security fixes from now until its end of support in 2023 anyway. Somewhat surprisingly, it looks as if Microsoft is going to actively enforce this restriction for Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors. Rather than mere benign neglect (not actively testing new patches on the new processors, but not stopping anyone from hitting Windows Update and installing them), the Knowledge Base article would suggest that Microsoft intends to implement a hard block, with Windows Update completely shutting out these new processors. This doesn't seem to have taken effect just yet, and this week's Patch Tuesday updates seem to download and work on Ryzen and Kaby Lake systems. The existence of the KB article, however, suggests that it's only a matter of time before that changes. Using Windows 7 on these latest systems is already awkward in many situations; the operating system has no built-in support for USB 3 or NVMe. While neither hurdle is insurmountable, both can cause headaches during installation. Installing on Windows 8.1, however, is relatively smooth sailing, and with Kaby Lake's overwhelming similarity to Skylake, dropping support does feel rather unnecessary. We've asked Microsoft for comment, but received no response as yet. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not?

I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity.

But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run).

From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency.

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument.

The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction.

It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published.

But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not?

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case.

And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity.

But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment.

From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance.

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument.

Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction.

It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time.

The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need.

Author: Akiva Eldar Posted March 16, 2017 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon agreed March 13 to devise a joint plan for cutting taxes. Earlier that same day, Intel announced its purchase of Mobileye, the Israeli leader in self-driving technology. Kahlon insisted a day later that the tax cutting has nothing to do with the Mobileye mega-deal and the expected tax windfall from it of at least 4 billion shekels ($1.09 billion) that will land in the state's coffers. Summary⎙ Print Instead of focusing on poor people, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has decided to advance tax cuts that will only benefit the rich and deprive the state of revenue. Author Akiva Eldar Posted March 16, 2017 TranslatorRuti Sinai Indeed, the goverment's policy of pursuing tax cuts is hardly new. The proposed 2011-12 budget said the government would “continue to implement its multiyear tax plan, extended in 2009 until 2016.” In September 2015, the government also decided to reduce the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 18% to 17% and corporate taxes from 26.5% to 25%. The tax cut policy is explained by the desire to stimulate economic growth. In accordance with neoliberal economic theory, in which Netanyahu avidly believes, easing the tax burden encourages foreigners to invest in Israel. It is also designed to prevent Israeli firms, such as Mobileye, from fleeing to tax havens and countries with lower tax rates. Mobileye’s success, however, as well as that of other high-tech Israeli firms that have paid billions in taxes and will continue to do so, proves that the tax burden in Israel is not so onerous. Not only was Mobileye founded and developed in the Holy City of Jerusalem, but Intel decided that the company would continue to operate there and would even recruit additional local staff. As Kahlon said, the Mobileye deal and Intel's decision to keep the company in Israel surely have nothing to do with the government’s expected tax cut decision. Israel does not have an economic growth problem. In fact, the economy is forecast to grow 3.25% this year, more than the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. Israel’s tax burden is also not excessive. It is ranked among the lowest third of the 34 OECD member states in terms of its tax-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. Thus, any additional tax reduction is not expected to generate a significant change in the growth rate. On the other hand, it will lead to a significant revenue loss for the state. For example, a 1% cut in VAT would cost the state 6.5 billion shekels a year. Not only that, about one-half of adult Israelis do not pay income tax at all because their income is lower than the tax threshold. Netanyahu’s pet neoliberal ideology would have it that all Israelis enjoy the fruit of accelerated growth, but the annual report issued in January by the Adva Center for Information on Equality and Social Justice finds that its touted trickle-down effect does not work in Israel’s case. If anything, the fruits of economic growth have continually trickled up more than down. The top 1%, or primarily the top 10th of the percentile, are the main beneficiaries of Israel’s periods of economic prosperity. During the 2003-07 economic upturn, the share of Israel’s national wealth belonging to the top percentile more than doubled, and that of the top 10th almost tripled. At the same time, the national wealth of 90% of the population shrank. The top 1% of Israeli households own 5.2% of the national wealth, a share equal to that held by 70% of the population. The annual report on poverty and social gaps issued by the National Insurance Institute indicates that in 2015, almost every fifth family lived below the poverty line. Among the Arab population, that figure stood at 53.3%. Israel’s poverty rate is almost double the OECD average. The income of one of five Israelis aged 66 and above is below the poverty line. Almost one-third of the remaining 200,000 Holocaust survivors, some 65,000 elderly Israelis, receive government assistance, according to data from the Welfare Ministry and the Finance Ministry’s Holocaust Survivors Administration. The economic model developed by the world-renowned American economist Robert Solow in his 1956 book “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth” shows that in the long term, tax policy has no impact on growth rates. (The model was cited in a Knesset Research and Information Department study on the influence of tax levels on economic growth.) On the other hand, any rational person knows that in the long run, the highest-yielding public investment is in education. This would especially be true for a country ranked among the lowest third of OECD countries in terms of state expenditure per student. The grim outcome of Israel's low investment in education is reflected in its being ranked 40th by the Program for International Student Assessment based on student test scores in sciences and being ranked 39th in math. The Adva Center argues that successive Israeli governments have not developed long-term plans to increase the number of students receiving high school diplomas, to increase the number of university students or to foster an all-inclusive “start-up nation.” Official expenditures by government and local authorities on services for citizens totaled 41.2% of GDP in 2014, similar to the rate in the countries of Eastern Europe and countries with a tradition of low government expenditure. The state of the country’s public health care system is especially egregious. The number of hospital beds per capita — three to every 1,000 residents — positions Israel at the bottom of the OECD rankings. This is what led opposition leader and Zionist Camp Chairman Isaac Herzog to call on the government to invest surplus tax revenues in rehabilitating public health and welfare services. The desire of Netanyahu and his colleagues on the economic right for tax reductions to leverage trickle-down growth is neither new nor surprising. This was their calling card in the 2015 election campaign as well. Kahlon, who is the leader of the social-welfare championing Kulanu Party and is considered a “socially minded finance minister,” is also the person who signed off on the following: “The theory of trickle-down growth, according to which growth will trickle down to the weak strata of society, has collapsed.” This is stated in Kulanu's economic platform. It also urges a “change in this approach, so that shrinking the gaps and inequality will bring about increased growth.” There were some, this author included, who believed Kahlon and his friends in Kulanu (which in Hebrew means “all of us”) would provide a counterweight to the political, clerical and nationalist right. Sadly, they have turned out to be a featherweight not only in that respect, but also against the social-economic right as well. Still, the row that began March 15 between Netanyahu and Kahlon over when to launch the new public broadcasting corporation might reshape the balance of power between the two men. Netanyahu has hurt Kahlon’s ego and his image of heading a promising, socially oriented party. This disgrace could actually provoke Kahlon into re-adopting his own social-welfare policies.

But where the Ryzen 7 was a top-tier line akin to Intel’s Core i7 models aimed at users who demand peak performance at any price, the Ryzen 5 could be a much bigger deal as a cheaper, midrange model that’s taking aim at Intel’s popular Core i5 line. A viable competitor for Intel’s popular Core i5 line The Ryzen 5 line has four models: the $169 Ryzen 5 1400 (4 cores/8 threads at 3.2GHz/3.5GHz), the $189 Ryzen 5 1500X (4 cores/8 threads at 3.5GHz/3.7GHz), the $219 Ryzen 5 1600 (6 cores/12 threads at 3.2GHz/3.6GHz), and $249 Ryzen 5 1600X (6 cores/12 threads at 3.6GHz/4.0GHz). As noted by AnandTech, that top-tier Ryzen 5 1600X lines up nicely against Intel’s $242 Core i5-7600K, hitting roughly the same price point but offering 6 cores with 12 threads to Intel’s 4 core/4 thread offering, although obviously we’ll have to wait for some actual benchmarking tests to see how that shakes out in the real world. AMD will be selling the Ryzen 5 processors starting April 11th. Additionally, the company is planning a budget Ryzen 3 line to go head-to-head with Intel’s Core i3 series for later in 2017.

The center of Mobileye’s operations will remain in Israel, where Intel plans to build a global development center to handle international activity regarding autonomous vehicles. Mobileye makes sensors and systems so a vehicle’s computer knows where it is in relation to its surroundings. The deal, worth about 45 percent more than the company’s market valuation before the announcement, is expected to close in nine months. In November, a delegation touring Israel from Atlanta with Conexx: America Israel Business Connector visited Mobileye’s headquarters and met with the global sales director, Lior Sethon. #Conexxmission16 began today with a visit to driving assist Start-Up Mobileye in #Jerusalem where the group met with Global sales director Lior Sethon. Mobileye claims that with their #tech, 80% of automotive collisions could be avoided. #startupnation #Israel A post shared by Atlanta Jewish Times (@atljewishtimes) on Nov 7, 2016 at 3:39am PST “Having visiting Mobileye with our delegations over the last few years, it is exciting to see their innovation leadership pay off,” Conexx President Guy Tessler said. “Even more exciting is to learn that they will stay in Israel to lead the upcoming revolution in driving and automotive.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Mobileye President and CEO Ziv Aviram by phone and told him that the deal is a source of Israeli pride. The record for an Israeli tech sale was Cisco’s $5 billion purchase of NDS Group in 2012. Other notable Israeli exits include Google buying Waze for $1.1 billion and Apple buying 3D sensor specialist PrimeSense for about $300 million, both in 2013. “The deal dramatically proves that the vision which we are leading is being realized,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is becoming a global technology center, not just in cyber but in the automotive sector as well.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Business,  conexx,  Guy Tessler,  Israel,  Mobileye,  News Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Current top stories Atlanta Rabbis Coming and Going   2nd Bomb Threat Hits Marcus JCC   A Look Back: Ramah Darom at 20 By Patrice Worthy   AJA’s STAR Student   Subscribe to the newsletter Atlanta Jewish Times Free to Your Inbox The email is either missing or invalid Almost finished...

The event was organized by a local chapter of ACT for America, a self-described “grassroots national security organization” that regards Muslims with considerable suspicion. “There’s an ongoing coup going on in Turkey right now,” Flynn said in his remarks. “Right now!” The country, Flynn said, was heading “towards Islamism” under Erdoğan, and the military was trying to preserve Turkey’s secular identity. The audience applauded the putschists. A day later, the coup failed; Erdoğan proceeded to round up thousands of alleged plotters and sympathizers, including military officers, judges, and teachers. A Times editorial accused the Turkish President of staging a “counter-coup” and acting “increasingly authoritarian.” Such characterizations tend to unnerve tourists and foreign investors. In early August, Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman and the chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, contacted Flynn’s consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group, about repairing Turkey’s image in the United States. Flynn, whom I profiled for the magazine in February, was one of Trump’s most prominent supporters on the campaign trail, and often accused Hillary Clinton of “influence peddling.” Still, he agreed to help Alptekin, in exchange for a six-hundred-thousand-dollar contract. In order to comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, lobbyists working directly or indirectly on behalf of foreign governments must file paperwork with the Justice Department identifying themselves as “foreign agents.” After agreeing to work with Alptekin, Flynn and his colleagues initially considered doing this, according to a source who participated in the discussions, but they concluded that it wasn’t necessary, since Alptekin was not a Turkish official and the funds were not Turkish government funds. Instead, they filed with Congress, under the Lobbying Disclosures Act. Flynn was merely helping a businessman, they rationalized, and not acting as an agent of a foreign government. But, last week, Flynn—who was forced to resign as Trump’s national-security adviser on February 13th—refiled his paperwork, to acknowledge that his work for Alptekin may, in fact, have benefitted the Turkish government. The disclosure put Flynn’s work with Alptekin in a new light, raising new questions about Flynn’s judgment—during both the campaign and his brief time in the Administration—and about the Administration’s handling of his entanglements. Flynn’s work for Alptekin began in earnest in mid-September, when the businessman arranged a meeting in New York between Flynn and the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, at a New York hotel. Turkey’s energy minister, Berat Albayrak, who is also Erdoğan’s son-in-law, was there, too. On Flynn’s side, James Woolsey, a former director of the C.I.A. and a member of Flynn Intel Group’s advisory board, attended, as did Brian McCauley, a former F.B.I. agent who worked closely with Flynn in Iraq. (Woolsey told me that he had only “perfunctory involvement” with the Flynn Intel Group and “received no compensation.”) Though the full breadth of the group’s conversation is not known, the same source told me that the Turks sought, among other things, Flynn’s assistance in maligning Fethullah Gülen, a self-exiled cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, whom Erdoğan blamed for the attempted coup. Subsequently, the Flynn Intel Group paid S.G.R., a lobbying and public-relations firm, forty thousand dollars to work on a project that included designing a graphic—“Gulenopoly”—characterizing Gülen as “the Mula Mullah” whose “clandestine” movement had “mastered the game of political and economic influence.” Yet it seemed that Alptekin was expecting more from Flynn and his colleagues. On November 2nd, Alptekin met with Bijan Kian, the vice-president of the Flynn Intel Group, and McCauley, among others, at the Flynn Intel Group’s offices, in Alexandria, Virginia. (Flynn was not present.) Alptekin stressed their need to produce something—and soon, since Election Day was approaching and the polls suggested that Trump was certain to lose. “We have to generate something to show Turkey how successful we can be,” Alptekin said, according to the source. “What success can we show them now?” A week later, an op-ed appeared in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, authored by Flynn. It heralded Turkey as “our greatest ally” against the Islamic State; accused Obama of “keeping Erdogan’s government at arm’s length”; and described Gülen as a “false façade,” a closet supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood—the Islamist political movement founded in Egypt—and “Turkey’s Osama Bin Laden.” Nine days after winning the election, Trump appointed Flynn as his national-security adviser. The following day, Bill McGinley, a law partner at Jones Day who advised Trump during the campaign and transition, and who is now the White House Cabinet secretary, spoke on the phone with Kian and others working with Flynn to review the particulars of Flynn’s piece in The Hill. When asked about the article, Kian said that Flynn wrote it himself, and that it was unrelated to his work for Alptekin. “Some people seemed skeptical as to whether Flynn had really woken up the day before the election and felt compelled to write an op-ed defending Erdoğan,” the source said. “McGinley wanted to know if Turkish government dollars touched that op-ed.” (Flynn was not on the call.) According to the Washington Post, Don McGahn, now the White House Counsel, was also notified during the transition of Flynn’s potential ties with Turkey. (In response to questions about McGinley’s conversation with Flynn Intel Group executives, the White House said, in a statement, “The transition team advised Flynn, like numerous other appointees and nominees, to retain his own counsel to ensure his own compliance with legal obligations. The transition was subsequently informed that Flynn retained counsel.”) The Flynn Intel Group’s contract with Alptekin was terminated in November, though Turkey’s interests may have remained on Flynn’s mind. A few days before Trump assumed office, Flynn spoke with Susan Rice, Obama’s national-security adviser, to discuss her team’s ongoing initiatives against ISIS. An element of their plan for taking Raqqa, ISIS’s self-proclaimed capital, entailed aligning militarily with the Y.P.G., an armed Kurdish group that the Turkish government regards as terrorists. According to the Washington Post, Flynn told Rice not to commit to that plan. “Don’t approve it,” Flynn said. “We’ll make the decision.” Once Trump took office, the plan was put on hold. Meanwhile, by late January, Flynn’s attorneys were again exploring the prospect of refiling under FARA. They were preparing the paperwork when news emerged about contact, before the Inauguration, between Flynn and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and how Flynn had supposedly misled Vice-President Mike Pence about that contact. In the wake of the scandal, Flynn was fired—but the FARA discussions continued. Three weeks ago, Flynn’s attorney Robert Kelner, a partner at Covington & Burling, a firm that specializes in political-law compliance, met with Justice Department lawyers. The Justice officials later urged that, in order to comply with the law, Flynn should register as a foreign agent: Flynn’s work for Alptekin may not have been at the behest of the Turkish government, but it served Ankara’s interest. Last week, after Flynn’s foreign-agent status became public, Pence described the news as “an affirmation of the President’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign,” and said that the reports of Flynn’s work for Turkey had been “the first I’d heard of it.” But on November 18th—the same day McGinley spoke with Flynn Intel Group’s executives—Elijah Cummings, a congressman from Maryland, addressed a letter to Pence, expressing concern about Flynn’s “being paid to lobby the U.S. government on behalf of a foreign government’s interests.” As more details about Flynn’s work become public—on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that he was paid tens thousands of dollars by Russian companies as recently as 2015—it may get harder for the Administration to maintain that he was operating in a vacuum.

Armenian News Network / Groong [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] ‘Foreign Agent’ Flynn Says Lobbying May Have Helped Turkey From: Mihran Keheyian <mkeheyian@gmail.com> Date: Thu, 16 Mar 2017 18:41:03 +0000 ‘Foreign Agent’ Flynn Says Lobbying May Have Helped Turkey INTERNATIONAL NEWS, TURKEY, US, WASHINGTON | MARCH 16, 2017 1:24 PM Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin By Stephen Braun and Chad day WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was fired from his prominent White House job last month, has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government. Paperwork filed Tuesday, March 8, with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” It was filed by a lawyer on behalf of the former US Army lieutenant general and intelligence chief. After his firm’s work on behalf of a Turkish company was done, Flynn agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, US citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign government or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. A Turkish businessman who hired Flynn’s consulting firm told the Associated Press on Wednesday, March 8, that the amended filings were made in response to pressure from Justice Department officials in recent weeks. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, said in a phone call from Istanbul that the changes were a response to “political pressure” and he did not agree with Flynn’s decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. “I disagree with the filing,” he said. “It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.” Flynn’s attorney did not respond to questions about whether the Justice Department or FBI had contacted Flynn about his lobbying activities. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive transparency about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. In the filings with the Justice Department, Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, noted they served as a termination of the registration, saying the firm had ceased operations in November, the same month the lobbying contract ended. Calls to phone numbers associated with Flynn and his firm weren’t answered. Kelner, his attorney, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. Reached Wednesday afternoon, an official at the Turkish embassy in Washington said he would refer the questions to the embassy spokesman. The spokesman did not immediately respond. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. As a key member of Trump’s transition team last December, Flynn spoke by phone several times with Kislyak during the period when former President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the US and levied new sanctions in response to Russian election-related hacking. According to the new paperwork, Flynn’s firm took on the Turkish-related lobbying work in August while he was a top Trump campaign surrogate. Flynn Intel disclosed in its filing that in mid-September, the company was invited by Alptekin to meet with Turkish officials in New York. Alptekin acknowledged Wednesday that he had set up the meeting between Flynn and the two officials. He said they met at an undisclosed hotel in New York. Alptekin said Flynn happened to be in New York while the Turkish officials were attending United Nations sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. “I asked one of Gen. Flynn’s staff if he was in town and would be available to meet and they got in touch with him,” said Alptekin, who owns several businesses in Turkey. Among those officials, the documents said, were Turkey’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn’s company did not name the officials but reported the two worked for Turkey’s government “to the best of Flynn Intel Group’s current understanding.” Alptekin, who previously told the Associated Press he has no relationship with the Turkish government, is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. Erdogan’s power base is Turkey’s Islamic voters, and since a failed coup in July, he has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction. Erdogan has accused cleric Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the US, where he lives. The Obama administration did not comply, and Gulen still lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel’s work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring US officials to take action against the cleric, including a meeting in October between Flynn’s firm and a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee. Flynn Intel arranged the meeting to discuss a technology developed by another Flynn Intel client. But after discussing the technology, the firm changed the subject to Gulen, pressuring the committee to hold congressional hearings to investigate the cleric, said a US official with direct knowledge of Flynn Intel’s work. That request was rebuffed. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The official said Flynn Intel never revealed whom it was representing during the meeting. The October meeting came as Flynn was working on an op-ed promoting Turkey’s political and business affairs that was later published in The Hill, a Washington-based political newspaper. Flynn wrote that Turkey needed support and echoed Erdogan’s warnings about Gulen, whom he called a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Flynn argued that Gulen should not be given safe harbor in the US In the new filing, Flynn disclosed that in writing the op-ed, he relied on research conducted as part of the Inovo BV contract. Flynn’s firm also admitted it conducted “open-source research,” directed by Inovo, focusing on Gulen. The results “were provided to Inovo” and to a separate lobbying firm, S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying, a public relations company retained by Flynn Intel. The materials were aimed for distribution to “third parties,” but because the project terminated early, “the full scope of the contract was not performed,” according to the filings. In the filings, Flynn emphasized that neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government directed him to write the op-ed. He also said he was not paid for the op-ed. Alptekin said he had been opposed to Flynn’s writing the op-ed, although he agreed with its anti-Gulen and pro-Turkley stances. Alptekin added that he had asked for some of the $530,000 in payments to the Flynn Intel Group to be returned to him because of his dissatisfaction with the company’s performance. http://www.mirrorspectator.com/2017/03/16/foreign-agent-flynn-says-lobbying-may-have-helped-turkey/ [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] [ Reply to sender | Write to Groong ]

A reluctance to make them, however, has not stopped Israel from becoming a thriving centre for the high-tech kit with which cars now bristle, and also for mobility services such as ride-hailing. The latest evidence of Israel’s pre-eminence in the field came on March 13th, when Intel, a giant American chipmaker, paid $15.3bn for Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based firm that is at the forefront of autonomous-car technology. With the acquisition, Intel joins the ranks of technology companies that are trying to outmanoeuvre carmakers and auto-parts suppliers to develop the brains of vehicles of the future.

Its EyeQ software is already used by most of the world’s carmakers to help their vehicles stay in their lanes and brake in emergencies, precisely what will also be required in autonomous vehicles. This system, which is currently fitted in over 15m vehicles but is set to be used by many millions more, can also collect information from installed cameras to continuously update the incredibly detailed maps that self-driving cars will require. Israeli politicians are cock-a-hoop that the country’s prowess in technology had made headlines around the world. Yigal Erlich, a former chief scientist of the Israeli government, called it “a great achievement that a company like Intel is building its future on Israeli technology”. There was further delight that Intel will relocate its existing car-technology business, which is sizeable, to the country. Mobileye is not the first Israeli car-technology firm to attract a foreign buyer. Waze, a driving-navigation app, was snapped up by Google in 2013 for $1.1bn. Last year Volkswagen paid $300m for a share of Gett, a ride-hailing startup. But this is by far the biggest deal. Though not a vast sum by technology-industry standards, some analysts reckon that Intel has overpaid. The firm is under pressure. Its main business, of providing chips for PCs, is past its peak. Its record with deals to make up for that is unenviable. Intel has proved willing to write enormous cheques to chase growth. Last year it sold McAfee, a cyber-security business, for some $4.2bn, around half what it had paid for it six years earlier. Having largely missed out on the transition to mobile devices, Intel may fear doing the same in autonomous cars. Competitors are beefing up. Last year Qualcomm, another big chipmaker, announced a deal worth $47bn for NXP Semiconductors, a firm that makes chips for cars. Nvidia, better known for chips used by the gaming industry, is developing them for cars, too. Setting price aside, marrying Mobileye’s camera and mapping expertise with Intel’s chip and computing skills makes sense as the battle to establish predominance in the field of autonomous vehicles heats up. The priority for tech companies such as Intel and Google is to get their hands on the prodigious amounts of data that cars generate. Data are a vital commodity for perfecting the algorithms that underpin autonomy. Established car firms already have access to data from billions of miles of driving. Google’s self-driving vehicles throw off data of their own. For Intel, too, Mobileye’s value will be as a source of data as well as revenue and profit. Tech firms have also tried striking alliances with carmakers to secure more data. Last year, in fact, both Intel and Mobileye teamed up with BMW to develop self-driving cars. Carmakers have at last caught on to the value of data and know that they should guard it jealously. The problem they face is that they are also under pressure to share their data in return for the new technology they badly need. Intel and Mobileye have recognised that becoming large and powerful gives technology firms more leverage in this relationship. As the battle for data heats up it would be no surprise if both tech and automotive companies were to come shopping for more of Israel’s car-tech wizardry. twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon print icon View comments Reuse this content Editors’ picks Andrés Manuel López ObradorMexico’s populist would-be president Mexico City, we have a problem Americas German lessonsAngela Merkel and her press corps show how big democracies are supposed to operateDemocracy in America From deprivation to daffodilsThe world economy is picking up The science of popularityThe magic of making hitsCulture You are seeing the beta version of Economist.com Leave feedback Need assistance with your subscription?

Not anytime soon, it won't. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 16, 2017 at 10:30AM Following Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) announcement that it would be spending more than $15 billion to acquire computer vision specialist Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), the former posted a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document on a website dedicated to this proposed transaction. One thing that Intel addressed -- and I really appreciate that it did -- was the topic of current and future manufacturing plans for Mobileye's computer vision chips.  Image source: Intel. Who builds Mobileye's chips? Mobileye's EyeQ family of computer vision chips are currently manufactured by ST Microelectronics (NYSE:STM). Also, according to Intel, Mobileye's EyeQ4 chip -- which is "about to go in to volume production" -- as well as its future EyeQ5 chip (Intel says will "be sampled in mid-2018") will continue to be manufactured by ST Microelectronics. "Intel's priority, post-closing, is to maintain the best engineering, best cost, and best performance in all aspects of the new organization," Intel said, adding that "Mobileye's current relationships with suppliers and technology providers are an integral part of Mobileye's value." In other words, Intel didn't just spend $15 billion for this company (which clearly had something that Intel didn't) just for Intel to mess with the currently working recipe. Why not bring EyeQ4 and EyeQ5 in-house? In the FAQ, Intel explicitly wrote: "Does Intel plan to bring manufacturing in-house? If so, when?" Of course, Intel didn't directly answer the question that it brought up (though kudos for at least recognizing that this is a question whose answer would interest investors), but it does sort of imply a response. It's important for investors to understand that manufacturing technology decisions are made well in advance of a product coming to market and that it takes time for a chip company to implement a chip design in a specific manufacturing technology. Moving EyeQ4 to Intel technology simply wouldn't make sense -- the design is about to go into mass production, per Intel, so it's far too late to change that. Intel could conceivably migrate the EyeQ4 design to its own manufacturing technology at some point, effectively becoming a "second source" to ST Microelectronics but design work on such a product wouldn't even begin until the deal closes (in roughly nine months). By the time an Intel-built EyeQ4 could potentially hit the market, the design will be very old news. It isn't reasonable to bring EyeQ5 in-house, either. If the chip is going to sample in mid-2018, then that means design work is already well underway -- moving to Intel technology would almost certainly cause a schedule slip. But even if it were possible to change manufacturing direction right now for EyeQ5, it wouldn't be feasible to make the change. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the accompanying conference call that both Mobileye and Intel must, per regulatory requirements, operate as independent companies until the deal closes at some point within the next nine months. Since Mobileye clearly didn't show any interest in using Intel Custom Foundry (ICF) for its EyeQ chips, Mobileye suddenly deciding, completely independent of this pending transaction, to use ICF for the EyeQ chips just wouldn't happen. What about the future? Intel addressed post-EyeQ5 chips in a roundabout way in its FAQ as well. Intel's claims with respect to its "priorities" post-closing as well as its claim about Mobileye's current supplier/technology partners being an "integral part of Mobileye's value" seem to suggest that the chip giant has no interest in trying to get Mobileye to use Intel's manufacturing technologies unless doing so would be an unequivocal win for Mobileye under Intel. Mobileye's chips do seem as though they would benefit from using advanced manufacturing technology. Indeed, in an article published in EETimes, an ST Micro executive said that EyeQ5 will "contain eight multithreaded CPU cores coupled with eighteen cores of Mobileye's next-generation vision processors." That same executive also explained to the publication that "this level of complexity has prompted ST to use the most advanced technology node available." Clearly, Mobileye's future processors will benefit from using advanced manufacturing technologies, so there could be value in building, say, the EyeQ6 and beyond using Intel manufacturing technology. However, if moving from other manufacturers to Intel will introduce undue risk/complexity, then Mobileye (under Intel's wing) should be allowed the freedom to build its chips elsewhere.

Acer’s range of Swift laptops is available in four flavours: the range-topping Swift 7, the mid-tier Swift 5 the cheaper Swift 3 and the budget Swift 1. Don’t let the latter’s standing against its siblings put you off, though. The Swift 3 includes plenty of the premium touches of its pricier family members. It has a slim and light all-metal body, an IPS display and dual-core Intel Kaby Lake processors – all for a starting price of just £500. Certainly, there are smaller and lighter machines available, but if you’re looking for a laptop that comes close to having the premium feel of the MacBook or Dell XPS 13, for example, but don’t want to pay over £1000 then the Swift 3 is well worth a look. Being low-cost, slim and light, it faces direct competition from the Lenovo IdeaPad 510S. I haven't reviewed the refreshed version of the 510S, which has been updated with new 7th-gen Intel processors, but it shares many features with last year's version so I'll compare and contrast with this new Acer throughout the review. Video: How to choose a laptop Acer Swift 3 – Design and Build The fanciest feather in the Swift 3’s cap is down to its all-aluminium body. While it isn't uncommon to see an aluminium lid or base at this price, it’s the first time I’ve encountered a latop with all the major panels – the lid, base, keyboard surround and display surround – all made from aluminium. This immediately gives the Swift 3 a premium look and feel that few machines of this price, or considerably more, can match. Related: Best Laptops The overall fit and finish is pretty good, too, even if you miss out on the super-solid feel of the unibody chassis of a MacBook. There’s a greater level of flex in the base than you'd find in more premium models, and where the base panel meets the keyboard surround panel, there’s also a pronounced lip that you'd be unlikely to see on more expensive laptops. Apart from that, the Swift 3 wants for little. The lid is nice and ridged, the fold-flat hinge mechanism is smooth, and overall it feels reasonably well put together. Related: Best web browser for Windows The Swift 3's screen measures 14 inches from corner to corner, and the bezel isn’t particularly narrow, which results in a markedly larger machine than more typical Ultrabooks; it has a footprint of 343 x 237mm. It’s reasonably thin, however, at a consistent 17.95mm and weighs in at 1.5kg. This puts it 200g lighter and a smidge thinner than the Lenovo 510S, although both would fit the remit of a "take-anywhere" device. Connectivity is fairly impressive, too. You get one each of USB 2.0, USB 3.0 and USB Type-C as well as an HDMI, SD card reader and headphone/microphone combi jack. This means that the only thing you’ll regularly have to find a dongle for is connecting to a wired network. There's built-in Wi-Fi, too, which is of the latest quad-stream 802.11ac variety (Qualcomm QCA61x4A). Here the Lenovo has an intriguing ace up its sleeve: it includes an Ethernet port. However, it lacks the Type-C USB, so it's swings and roundabouts. Acer Swift 3 – Keyboard and Trackpad The keyboard on this laptop wants for very little. The UK version has a proper UK configuration and the overall layout is spot on. I’d prefer the Home/End/PgUp/PgDn keys to be secondary functions of the cursor keys, rather than have four awkwardly positioned dedicated keys over on the right-hand side – but aside from that it’s great. The key action is also surprisingly good. It's light yet defined, and although there's a little flex in the body of the laptop as you type, I didn't find it enough to cause issues with speedy typing. What’s more, the entire keyboard is backlit. You get only the one brightness option – on or off – but having backlighting at all is a bonus at this price. Praise for this laptop continues when it comes to its trackpad. Sure, it can’t can’t compete with the best, but its aluminium finish allows fingers to glide easily, tracking is reasonably accurate and, although a little stiff, the click action is adequate. I’ve found far worse on far more expensive machines. Acer Swift 3 – Screen The screen is fine for the money, although as ever this is a back-handed compliment because there are many, many better laptop screens out there. It has a Full HD resolution, so there's been no scrimping when it comes to the number of pixels you get to play with. It’s also an IPS LCD panel, meaning viewing angles are very good. Plus, its matte finish keeps reflections at bay. Related: Top 10 things to consider when buying a laptop Its overall performance is good too. You get an excellent contrast ratio of 1360:1, thanks largely to an impressively low black level. However, maximum brightness is a touch low, at just 243 nits. That’s sufficient for the vast majority of uses – 150 nits is recommended for day-to-day indoor use – but in particularly bright lighting conditions this panel will struggle a little. You can see from our pictures that when in a well-lit room (two 100W fluorescent photography lights) it can appear a little dim. In terms of colour reproduction, for casual use it’s absolutely fine: its gamma rating of 2.15 proves it can properly produce the brightness curve that's expected, so the display doesn’t look grey and washed out, or overly dark. However, its default colour temperature is 7008K, which is some way off the ideal of 6500K. It’s barely noticeable most of the time, but the display can look a touch colder/bluer when compared to the best, calibrated displays. But it’s the sRGB colour space coverage rating of just 55.5% that's its real Achilles heel. This results in a slightly muted colour palette that, although fine for general use, is insufficient for people who regularly edit pictures or video. Much the same complaints can be levelled at the 510S, although it manages to squeeze out 30 more nits of brightness, making it a little better suited to use in bright environments. Acer Swift 3 – Webcam and Audio The Swift 3 has a 30fps, 720p webcam that's absolutely fine for general video-chat duties. It delivers a fairly grainy picture, but the automatic exposure works well to keep your face visible in most lighting conditions. As for audio, a couple of speakers fire down from the underside of the laptop and they create a reasonably powerful and satisfyingly stereo sound, with none of the irritating tininess of the worst laptop speakers. For long listening sessions you’ll want to plug in headphones, but for occasional use they get the job done.

The eight-core Ryzen 7 chips are designed for high-performance processing and professional applications, and are an ideal option for high-end gamers. We compared the gaming performance of Intel’s high-end Core i7 processors against AMD’s new Ryzen line-up across numerous titles to see who came out on top. CPU benchmark data from Guru3D was used for the comparison, with all processors tested on a system consisting of: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 16GB DDR4 2,666MHz RAM We took the frames per second each CPU delivered in four games and calculated an average FPS value to reflect overall performance. Both Full HD and WQHD benchmarks were included in the comparison, along with a 3DMark FireStrike Score. The Ryzen 7 1700 was not included in the performance comparison due to a lack of benchmark data. 1080p Benchmarks 1080P Gaming Benchmarks FPS Processor Hitman DX12 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12 Far Cry Primal DX11 The Division DX11 Average FPS Core i7 7700K 112 132 108 119 117.75 Core i7 6800K 110 139 105 109 115.75 Core i7 6700K 112 138 92 117 114.75 Core i7 6900K 109 137 100 107 113.25 Ryzen 7 1800X 109 114 93 100 104 Ryzen 7 1700X 105 107 87 98 99.25 WQHD Benchmarks WQHD (2,560 x 1,440) Gaming Benchmarks FPS Processor Hitman DX12 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12 Far Cry Primal DX11 The Division DX11 Average FPS Core i7 7700K 86 91 81 86 86 Core i7 6800K 83 91 81 83 84.5 Core i7 6900K 84 91 81 81 84.25 Core i7 6700K 83 91 76 84 83.5 Ryzen 7 1800X 85 92 81 74 83 Ryzen 7 1700X 85 92 79 73 82.25 3DMark FireStrike 3DMark FireStrike Processor FireStrike Score Core i7 7700K 17,854 Core i7 6900K 17,487 Core i7 6700K 17,101 Ryzen 7 1800X 16,860 Core i7 6800K 16,518 Ryzen 7 1700X 16,418 Ryzen and Gaming While AMD’s Ryzen 7 processors deliver good value and performance in professional benchmarks, they fall slightly short in terms of gaming performance against Intel’s Core i7 processors. However, the processors are still relatively cheap and are a major improvement over AMD’s last generation of desktop chips. Currently, AMD’s $499 Ryzen 7 1800X offers performance nearly equal to Intel processors which are twice the price.

But you need to build a computer to put the GPU in. And that can get expensive. Fortunately, we’ve covered the best ways to keep computer building costs down and more. We’ll start with doing a bit of research, discuss overclocking, then move on to choosing specific components. After that’ll, we’ll share some tips for getting the best deals on those parts. Estimate Your Budget Budgeting is an important first step. Just saying you want to build a “cheap” gaming PC How to Build an 8-Core Gaming PC from Cheap Server Parts How to Build an 8-Core Gaming PC from Cheap Server Parts Want a beefed-up gaming or video-editing PC with dual Intel Xeon processors for under $200? The parts are out there, but finding and putting them together could prove difficult. Read More isn’t enough. Do you have $500 to spend? $700? $1,000? How you define “cheap” will make a big difference in the quality of the computer you end up building. Putting together a PC for less than $500 is certainly possible, but you’ll have to make some big compromises. Also, you may benefit from being a little flexible on your budget, at least when it comes to two components. The GPU and CPU offer significant performance returns, per dollar spent. But you may need to spend a bit more to get them. So set a guideline budget, and keep it in mind when you start picking out your components. Two of the most useful PC-building tools are ChooseMyPC and PCPartPicker’s build guides. These two sites help find and build the best PC for your money. They’ll also ensure that your parts are compatible with each other. Decide Which Games You Want to Play What games do you play? Different types of games demand different hardware. For example, strategy games don’t require the graphical horsepower of first-person shooters. But they may be better served by a more powerful processor or more RAM. If you’re happy playing games released a couple of years ago, the requirements will be notably lower on both the CPU and GPU end. Keep in mind, too, that games offer different graphics settings 7 Common Video Game Graphics Settings Explained 7 Common Video Game Graphics Settings Explained Don't know what those settings on your video games are all about? Let us explain what they mean and how they affect your games! Read More . Adjusting a game’s settings can let you play AAA titles on budget hardware. There are limits to how low a game’s graphics can scale down, but a good rule of thumb is that the minimum graphics settings equal the minimum system requirements. The recommended settings are normally the hardware specs that you want. If you play strategy games, but you want to play a shooter now and then, a slightly less powerful graphics card might be a good decision. A $100 card easily handles strategy games, and you can dial down the graphics settings on the shooters to keep them running smoothly. You can usually find system requirements on Amazon or Steam, but if you’re having trouble, just search for “[game title] system requirements.” They’ll be posted somewhere. Here’s an example of the system requirements for Dishonored 2: Let’s look at the minimum requirements for a moment. You can get an Intel Core i5-2400 for about $160 on Amazon, and an acceptable Nvidia GTX graphics card for around $110. The recommended requirements, however, would run you closer to $550 for a processor and graphics card. Plus it offers twice as much RAM — that’s a big difference. Think of a handful of games that you’ll play shortly after building up your PC. Look at both sets of requirements, and keep them in mind when you’re selecting components. To Overclock or Not to Overclock? Overclocking — it always comes up when you discuss budget PC builds. In a nutshell, overclocking is the process of telling different parts of your computer (normally the processor or GPU) to run faster. Is it a good idea? Maybe. While overclocking your processor or your graphics card provides better performance, it comes with a cost. Overclocking causes greater power draw and heat production. That can potentially shorten the life of your components. Image Credit: Christoph Burgstedt via Shutterstock However, moderate overclocking isn’t likely to overly stress your PC. If you keep the increase in speed to a reasonable level, you don’t have to worry too much about damage. You’ll want to take the extra heat into account when determining the level of cooling you’re going to put into your case, though. An extra fan or a water-cooling system will definitely help keep your components functioning properly. It also may require additional wattage from your power supply unit. If you’re trying to save as much money as possible, overclocking will help you squeeze every ounce of power possible out of your machine. Can’t afford to build the PC you’d need to play the games you want? Overclocking is a good way to go. If you don’t have to overclock, I’d recommend not doing it. Wait until you need some extra power, then overclock your processor and your graphics card. That way you decrease the chances of over-working your components. And if you decide to overclock your components, do it safely How to Safely Overclock Your GPU to Gain FPS How to Safely Overclock Your GPU to Gain FPS Overclocking can make your PC perform at clock speeds one generation above its release. If done right, it's safe and easy. We'll show you how to get a GPU performance boost for free. Read More . Choose a Graphics Card Now that you have an idea of what you’re able to spend, and an idea of what sort of system you’ll need, we can start looking at specific components. We’re going to look at Nvidia graphics cards Nvidia Graphics Cards: Which One Is Right for You? Nvidia Graphics Cards: Which One Is Right for You? Nvidia graphics cards are the most popular for a reason. But which model should you buy and why? We explain the jargon, the cards, and their performance. Read More  for our example. Why not AMD cards? Because Nvidia cards provide slightly better value in the mid- and high-end range and require less wattage (and a less expensive power supply). If you’re a diehard AMD fan, by all means, get an AMD card — they’re comparable. There’s a good chance your graphics card will be the most expensive part of your PC, so you’ll want to make the most of every dollar. If you’ve looked at a number of games that interest you, you’ll probably have an idea of the sort of card you’ll need. Most modern games will need a GTX-level card, and one with at least 2 GB of RAM. The GTX 1050 will satisfy these requirements for less than $150. Of course, using the cheapest card means it becomes obsolete sooner rather than later. So instead, we’ll look at the Nvidia GeForce graphics cards that give you the best value. According to VideoCardBenchmark.net, the GeForce GTX 1050 is the second-highest-value card in the Nvidia lineup. It’s second to the GTX 1060’s 3 GB, but just ahead of the GTX 1050 Ti’s 4 GB. The $150 GTX 1050 Ti is a phenomenal deal for a card with 4 GB of GDDR5 RAM. The price, memory, and speed put it in a sweet spot of great value and decent longevity. If you’re able to spend more money, stepping up to the GTX 1060 is a great choice. For $250 or so, you’ll get 6 GB of RAM and a big boost in performance. The 1060 will go quite a few years before becoming obsolete. And when it comes down to it, $250 for a graphics card is a really good deal. Third-Party Manufacturers Nvidia sells very few reference (or “standard”) graphics cards. Instead, you’ll see modified versions sold by companies like EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, and ASUS. There are a few minor differences, but in general, they offer very similar cards. Their cooling systems are different: some pack a single fan, while others provide two. Some also offer overclocked cards that are already set up to provide maximum power. EVGA, a single manufacturer, sells no less than 10 different versions of the GTX 1060. It can be easy to get caught up in the minute differences between these cards. But if you don’t need to create a gaming PC that’s going to make the absolute most out of every watt of power, don’t worry too much about it. Every company is developing strong technologies that keep your card running smoothly, providing a lot of graphics power, and running at a sustainable temperature. If there’s one difference you look at, check out the listed clock speed. This is basically the speed at which the graphics card runs. The Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060, for example, has a base clock speed of 1556 MHz. MSI’s version reports a base clock speed of 1594 MHz. Is that going to make a notable difference? Probably not. If you see a large discrepancy, do some further research. And consult the price performance chart on VideoCardBenchmarkTest.net to see which cards offer the best value. The Absolute Minimum If you’re looking to build a gaming PC on a shoestring budget, be sure to look carefully into the specs of the graphics card you buy. One of the most important components is the RAM used by the GPU, often known as GDDR5 SDRAM (double data rate type five synchronous graphics random access memory). GDDR5 is slower than GDDR5X. Also, make sure it has the ports you need — HDMI has become the standard for video output Video Cables Explained: Difference Between VGA, DVI, and HDMI Ports Video Cables Explained: Difference Between VGA, DVI, and HDMI Ports There are so many video cables out there and it can get confusing. VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort -- what's the difference and why do they even matter? Read More , but if you own an older monitor, you may need a VGA port. Image Credit: Hiroyuki Takeda via Flickr And remember that the graphics card is the real muscle of your PC. You can cut costs elsewhere, but be wary of low-priced graphics cards. They’ll really drag down the performance of your machine. Nvidia’s GTX 1050 is a high-value card at $150, and it’s going to be tough to go much lower than that without making some big compromises in graphics. If you’re playing lower-spec games, a GTX 950 will work, but you’ll pay almost as much. Choose a Processor The biggest decision you’ll make is which graphics card to use. After that, all choices become much easier. For example, choosing a processor is largely a question of looking at the system requirements of your games. If the minimum requirements say you need an Intel Core i5, for example, an Intel Core i3 may not cut it. Keep in mind that some games will provide requirements in the form of GHz speed, and you’ll need to check that any potential processor for your build. Fortunately, good-enough processors cost less than a GTX 1070. An Intel i5-6500 with 3.2 GHz of processing speed, for example, costs about $200 on Amazon. That’s a great gaming processor that will last for years before it shows its age. Intel has had a strong hold on mid-level and high-end processors for quite a while now, with AMD being more common at the low end (or for console VR rigs AMD's New Plan: Make Virtual Reality Cheaper for You AMD's New Plan: Make Virtual Reality Cheaper for You AMD seems to be switching gears in 2016, and if all goes well, they're going to be a big player in the virtual reality market. Read More ). AMD’s new Ryzen chips, however, are showing decent marks for gaming. At the time of this writing, only a handful have released, so there’s no real-world data to back that up. If the Ryzen chips do show strong gaming performance, however, pairing an AMD chip with an Nvidia graphics card could be a good way to get a lot of value for your money. Until then, however, Intel is likely the way to go. The processing power you’re going to need to power modern video games is where Intel’s Core chips really shine. And, of course, the more powerful chip you have, the longer it will be able to play the newest games. Choose RAM In 2015, Hardware Secrets ran a very interesting test, playing eight PC games with three different amounts of RAM. They tested Battlefield 4, Dirt Rally, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Dying Light, Grand Theft Auto V, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Metro: Last Light, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on machines with 4 GB, 8 GB, and 16 GB of RAM. Intuition tells us that 16 GB of RAM would always be better. Image Credit: Georgii Shipin via Shutterstock The results, however, showed that 4 GB of RAM was almost always just as good as 8 or 16 GB. In fact, 4 GB out-performed higher amounts of RAM in a few cases. How could this be? Hardware Secrets pointed out that the heaviest lifting is performed by the graphics card, not RAM. They also speculated that with lower amounts of RAM, some game features might not be loaded. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that you don’t need to buy the absolute biggest and fastest RAM you can find. 8 GB is plenty for modern gaming How Much RAM Do You Really Need?

Of course, the more you have, the more you can do. 16 GB will let you run more programs in the background while you’re playing a game, for example. And future games may require more RAM. If you’re looking for the best deal, though, get a single stick of 8 GB DDR4 RAM. It will give you performance close to that of dual sticks for less than $50. And adding more RAM in the future is easy. Choose a Motherboard Let’s keep this simple. A motherboard is very important because it links all of your various parts together. But as long as it can do that, you don’t need to worry about too much else for a budget build. Check to make sure it supports your processor. There are different types of sockets for different brands and generations of CPUs, and the most recent Intel processor socket is LGA 1151, so there’s a good chance you’ll need to look for that. Check to make sure it supports DDR4 RAM (or DDR3, if you’re using that). Compare the ports that it has to the port required for your graphics card — usually PCIe x16. Beyond that, you don’t need to worry much about the differences. Image Credit: cp2studio via Shutterstock Sure, you can spring for a gaming motherboard that supports higher-quality sound or provides advanced networking features. But unless you have a pretty big budget for your gaming PC, your money will be better spent elsewhere. It’s easy to get a very capable motherboard for less than $100. (Though buying a higher-end one will give you added upgrade capabilities, like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity.) When you choose your motherboard, be sure to note what size it is. ATX (large), Mini-ITX (small), and microATX (medium) are all common, and they’ll determine the type of case you need. Also, keep in mind that Mini-ITX and microATX options offer fewer ports and sockets. They’ll almost certainly have enough for a budget build, but double-check to be sure. Choose Drives What are you going to store your data on? Will you choose a fast solid-state drive (SSD), or a slower but much larger hard drive (HDD)? Many gamers opt for one of each, using the SSD for the operating system and games that get played often and the HDD for backup files, other types of data, or older games. SSDs are faster, but they offer significantly less space for the same amount of money. Image Credit: Hadrian via Shutterstock A 480 GB SSD will likely only cost you a little over $100, while a 1 TB HDD will be closer to $50. If you can’t get both, the HDD will likely be a better deal, as it will take longer to fill it up. And while an SSD is faster, it won’t make a difference to your actual gaming experience. Your computer will boot up faster and games will load more quickly, but the majority of your gaming will be handled by your graphics card. Choose a Power Supply Unit (PSU) All of these components need power. Which means you’re going to need a power supply that meets their needs. How do you figure out how much power you need? There are plenty of different PSU calculators available — PowerSupplyCalculator.net gives you many different options and lets you tweak values. If you’re building a budget machine, there’s a chance you’re interested in overclocking, and this calculator lets you take that into account. Image Credit: Charcompix via Shutterstock Simply put in the various components you’ve selected, and the calculator will tell you how much power you need. While choosing a lower power PSU will help you save on energy costs (no small matter if you plan on using your PC many hours a day), leaving yourself some room is a good idea. If you decide to overclock or upgrade your components, you’ll need more power. Starting out with a PSU that gives you some room means you won’t have to replace it. Beyond that, it’s simply a matter of finding a PSU from a reputable company. If it provides the power you need, offers a good warranty, and is rated gold or above, go for it. Even a high-powered unit in the 750W range will be less than $90. Also, a modular power supply will be easier to set up and deal with than a non-modular one. Check which one you’re getting, and if you have the opportunity, go for modular. Choose a Case A case is arguably the least important part that you’ll choose (though that doesn’t mean it’s not important). Getting something cool looking is nice, but budget builds demand performance over aesthetics. In short, all you need is something that will fit your motherboard and graphics card. Here’s where you need to know the size of your motherboard. A case that only fits miniATX is going to be way too small for your ATX board. Most full-size cases also support the smaller boards, though. The same goes with your graphics card. Some of the higher-end ones with extensive third-party cooling systems can be absolutely monstrous. The larger ones are over a foot long. On a budget build, you almost certainly don’t have to worry about this. But you should check it out anyway. Manufacturers will tell you how long their cards are, as seen here: You might have to do some looking around to figure out how much space the case has, however. If you have a 10″ graphics card and the case is 18″ long, you don’t have to worry. But if you’re getting close to the length of the case, you may want to find someone who has measured the space available. This is often available in the questions and answers section of Amazon. Beyond that, make sure that your case has room for at least one extra fan (in case you decide to upgrade the cooling system in the future), and that’s about it. Spending more money gets you better cable management possibilities, more room, compatibility with specific cooling systems, and other features that you probably don’t need to worry about on a budget. Image Credit: Bplanet via Shutterstock Double-Check Compatibility If you used PCPartPicker or another similar tool earlier in the process, you probably already know that your parts are compatible. But it never hurts to double-check. Go to www.pcpartpicker.com and put all of your components into the System Build window. If it warns you that there are incompatibilities, click the See Details link and see which parts are conflicting. Make any adjustments to your plan that are necessary. It’s much easier to do this before you place your orders.

Makes the article a bit of a joke tbh, that is the main area of competition in the gaming pc market and just to dismiss it entirely is either ultimate fanboyism or totally retarded! You start off talking about a cheap gaming PC but then dismiss AMD cards because "Nvidia cards provide slightly better value in the mid- and high-end range". That contradicts making a gaming Pc as cheap as you can. I am not a fanboy of either side but somebody reading this who wants to mainly play Ashes of Singularity or Hitman is going to be better off getting a rx480 than a gtx 1060. I think what is the most laughable thing about the gaming "community" is this fanboyism, at least it is usually the common place within the comment sections the journo's are usually a tad more subtle!

The $15 Billion Question: Why Did Intel Buy Mobileye? Intel makes a strategic move to establish dominance in a different, but still related industry. March 16, 2017 WSP Autonomous vehicles are on the rise. It’s not the first time we’ve heard this. What’s new, however, is the information that there’s a ‘new’ major player in this emerging industry that’s estimated to grow into a $70 billion market by 2030. We all know Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) as the reigning computer chip giant because for the longest time computer makers have been using nothing but Intel chips and processors. Now that it’s facing a possible threat from competitors like Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and lately, ARM, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company may be seeing this as the perfect time to focus (and maybe hope to dominate) in a different type of market — that of autonomous vehicles. Intel made this intention known by announcing its acquisition of Israel-based autonomous vehicle-software maker Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) for a whopping $15.3 billion, or $63.54 per share. To be clear, Intel didn’t rush blindly into this deal. In fact, Intel and Mobileye have previously worked together with BMW to test self-driving cars and are planning on introducing fully autonomous cars by 2021. Plus, there are several operational vehicle models, as well as autonomous vehicles undergoing testing, that are currently using Intel chips. The decision to acquire Mobileye is simply a continuation of a partnership that has been going on for a while, and is poised to culminate and usher in a new breed of self-driving vehicles — integrating Intel’s data technologies with Mobileye’s expertise in ‘automotive-grade computer vision’. Mobileye was founded in 1999. It employs 660 personnel and presently accounts for about 70% of the world market for advanced driver-assistance and anti-collision systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. Mobileye used to be one of Tesla’s vision systems suppliers, until that tragic accident last year which claimed the life of a Tesla Model S driver operating the vehicle under Tesla’s Autopilot feature. Since then, Tesla has been relying on its in-house developed integrated vision-based system that depends on radars instead of cameras. Meanwhile, Mobileye continued with its efforts, retaining auto giants BMW, General Motors, Hyundai and Nissan as its biggest customers. Its portfolio has expanded from cameras and sensors, to more advanced technologies such as cloud software, data fusion, machine learning and road mapping. Also, there’s no doubt that Mobileye has now accumulated an enormous amount of data from millions and millions of miles of driving experience. This is, of course, essential in making its deep learning vision system more efficient and most importantly, not easily replicable from the competition. The more images it captures, the better it becomes at identifying what it is seeing so that it can trigger the appropriate response, like stay on the same lane, or put on the brakes. As reported by MIT Technology Review, Mobileye has also started to use ‘reinforcement learning’, a technique that teaches computers how to drive safely in different kinds of situations. By combining all these techniques with Intel’s hardware and software expertise, along with its expansive data center network, the goal of making autonomous driving comparable with normal driving should be easier to achieve. As Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a press release the company issued, “Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” INTC MBLY Previous article Next article Related Articles News MBLY Stock: Mobileye Increasingly Looking Like Silicon Valley’s Safer Ambition Blend August 9, 2016 WSP News Notable Reits: 3D Systems (DDD), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Realty Income (O) December 30, 2015 WSP Business Intel (INTC) Might Sell $1B in Venture Capital Assets : Report March 11, 2016 WSP Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Source: Mobileye On March 13, Intel agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion, and when the deal closes in about nine months the American company will be a leader on the autonomous driving market. Intel’s voracious appetite, however, has also brought it to Russia where it’s already in talks with Cognitive Technologies, a pioneer of AI-based driver assistance systems. Olga Uskova, president of Cognitive Technologies, confirmed that her company is in discussions with seven investment funds, including Intel Capital, a division of Intel Corporation. “We’re now offering 15-20 percent of our company to investors and planning to close the deal by the end of 2017,” said Uskova.    Intel spokesmen declined to comment on the company's plans.  Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. / Photo: Mobileye The main reason for the additional investment is to speed up the process of entering global markets, Uskova told RBTH. The Russian company already opened an office in the Netherlands and plans to establish a subsidiary in California. “Our goal is to accelerate our access to the international market and take advantage of the window of opportunity open now,” Uskova said. “The market of computer vision systems and unmanned vehicles is in the early stage of formation. If we do not secure a place now, then there’s the risk that we’ll fall behind competitors who develop unmanned technologies and remain a local player.” The Russian AI developer claims its main advantage over competitors is a more advanced artificial intelligence that allows the autonomous-driving system to work well even in bad weather, as well as on bad roads when street signs are lacking and the road surface is damaged. Cognitive Technologies is also discussing supply deals with three international companies. In 2016, the company has developed C-Pilot, an intelligent autonomous driving system that can be installed in cars and other vehicles. The technology can be embedded in international automakers systems. Earlier, Cognitive Technologies reported plans later in 2017 to unveil an advance driver assistance system with artificial intelligence, ADAS, for Russia's KAMAZ truck. The prototype is now released and can be industrially produced at the end of 2017.

The ultra-compact form factor (UCFF) heralded by the Intel NUCs has experienced rapid growth over the past few years. GIGABYTE, with their BRIX lineup, was one of the first vendors to introduce NUC clones. They went beyond the traditional Intel models and provided plenty of choices to the end users. GIGABYTE has also kept up with Intel's release cadence and updated the BRIX lineup after the launch of new U-series CPUs. Today, we are taking a look at the GB-BKi7HA-7500 - a BRIX based on the Kaby Lake Core i7-7500U, with support for a 2.5" drive, and sporting an ASMedia bridge chip for USB 3.1 Gen 2 support. Introduction The Kaby Lake-U platform for mini-PCs has proved to be a simple one for OEMs with existing Skylake-U mini-PCs in their lineup. Given the pin compatibility, the vendors only needed to put in some BIOS support before swapping the Skylake-U package for a Kaby Lake-U one. We have already covered the advantages of Kaby Lake over Skylake for mini-PCs (such as 4K Netflix and improved perf/Watt) in earlier reviews. A look at the GIGABYTE BRIX listings shows more than 20 different Skylake-U units (models starting with GB-BS). Given that Kaby Lake doesn't provide a great deal of benefit over Skylake for many use-cases, GIGABYTE has decided to only selectively update the comprehensive lineup. Each barebones Skylake BRIX SKU has a model number fitting the following format: GB-BS<CoreSeriesIdentifier-01>(H)(T|A)(L|C)-<CoreSeriesIdentifier-02> The format changes for Kaby Lake, with the BS being replaced by BK. The CPU in the SKU can be determined using the CoreSeriesIdentifier. For example, our review sample, the GB-BK<i7>HA-<7500> has the Intel Core i7-7500U. The other parts of the model number are optional. For example, in the Skylake series, we have the GB-BSi7-6500, which is essentially a Skylake-U NUC clone with no bells and whistles, but, just sporting a CPU option that the Intel NUC lineup doesn't provide. The optional components indicate the presence of the following features: H = 2.5" drive support T = Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 Gen 2 using the Alpine Ridge chipset A = Dual USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports (1x Type-A and 1x Type-C) using the ASMedia 1142 USB 3.1 Gen 2 controller L = Dual RJ-45 gigabit LAN ports C = COM (RS-232) port (RJ-45 slot similar to the L SKU, and a RJ-45 to COM cable bundled) As part of the Kaby Lake update, GIGABYTE has introduced ten models, with a choice of Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7, with or without support for a 2.5" drive, and a Thunderbolt (no ASMedia USB 3.1 Gen 2) or non-Thunderbolt (but, with ASMedia USB 3.1 Gen 2) option. GIGABYTE sampled us the barebones version of the GB-BKi7HA-7500.

Reply niva - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Can you please point out where one can find a Kaby Lake Intel NUC with Iris for the same price, or less? We will be eternally grateful! Reply gigahertz20 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link @niva The new Intel NUC Kaby Lake i7 version will be out end of this month. Right now you can preorder it on several websites. The website below has it for preorder for $521 and on their website it says they are expecting to receive 190 units on March 31st.

Specifically the NUC7i7BNH model, it's got 2x2 802.11ac WLAN unlike this Gigabyte BRIX and hopefully the fan isn't as loud as this one either. The UEFI Bios is always pretty comprehensive on the Intel NUCs as well. Amazon is selling the i3 version but not the Kaby Lake i7 version yet, I heard sometime from March through May is when the i7 NUC should show up on Amazon/Newegg. If you are looking to buy a UCFF PC, there is no reason I can think of to get this BRIX when the Intel NUC will have it beat plus you get Iris Graphics. It will be a no brainer. Reply CSMR - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link The NUC7i7BNH does look good. I think with any powerful machine in such a small form factor you have to mod it if you want it to be quiet. The last Iris Pro/Plus device in a similar form factor is the Brix BXi7-5775. I using this, and cut open the top to put a larger quiet fan in. It's great, fast and quiet.

Reply BrokenCrayons - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I'd argue that televisions in general are on a slow decline as well. Certainly 3D TV was something of a niche/fad that didn't gain the widespread sales it needed to take off in the late 2000's after making its return from the grave. At this point, since TVs are waning anyway as a entertainment source (current models sold are larger, but there are fewer of them per household and the trend seems to point generally downward for the future), 3D variants don't seem like they have a chance of surviving. Though I think it's likely 3D projection will be resurrected yet again in the future and maybe next time around the technology will make it practical, I can't see that happening soon while many of us remember the last flop and would be cynical about another attempt. It is also unlikely to take the form of a conventional consumption device like a television since, by the time it's forgotten and brought back as a new idea, we'll be consuming content differently. Reply Samus - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I have a Samsung 3D tv from 2011, it's gimmicky but still fun for certain movies.

It just didn't take off like it would have needed to for it to get the broad support it required to survive past more than an iteration or two of hardware from most companies. In fact, with as hard as it fell, I was surprised there were a few products that continued to support some form of 3D like Nintendo's New 3DS even well after it was clear 3D wasn't a thing anymore.

Business Intel, betting big on driverless cars, is buying Mobileye for $15 billion Mobileye Richard Drew / Associated Press The logo for the Israeli company Mobileye appears on a screen at the New York Stock Exchange. The logo for the Israeli company Mobileye appears on a screen at the New York Stock Exchange. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Russ Mitchell As self-driving cars edge closer to street-legal status, technology companies don’t want to be left out. Computer chipmaker Intel Corp. reached for its share Monday with the $15.3-billion purchase of Mobileye, a small Israeli company that creates vision systems for cars and trucks. The two will combine their expertise to develop self-driving systems for automakers, technologies that combine computer chips with sensors and software to make driverless cars possible. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a note to employees about the acquisition. Billions of dollars are on the line as self-driving technologies transmogrify a transportation system based for more than a century on human drivers. It’s not just automakers that are being forced to change. Longtime tech companies and relatively young ride-hailing apps, too, are jumping into the game as cars become computers on wheels. In October, San Diego-based Qualcomm paid $38 billion for NXP Semiconductors, primarily for NXP’s strength in the automotive market. Nvidia is successfully moving beyond its roots as a graphics chip maker for high-end gaming to become a key supplier of central processors that use artificial intelligence to provide the brains for self-driving cars. Last year, Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300-million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to the ride-hailing company for autonomous vehicle research; Uber also bought Otto, a developer of self-driving technology for trucks. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1-billion purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI. Chips have been peppered throughout cars and trucks for decades, but they continue to grow in number and sophistication. Beyond guiding a car’s basic functions, they’re key to infotainment systems and are central to emerging communications systems that connect to the cloud and allow instant software updates. Robot cars — with no human driver — could hit California roads next year Russ Mitchell California is back on the map as a state that’s serious about welcoming driverless cars. Truly driverless cars — vehicles with no human behind the wheel, and perhaps no steering wheel at all — are headed toward California streets and highways starting in 2018. After months of criticism, state regulators... California is back on the map as a state that’s serious about welcoming driverless cars. Truly driverless cars — vehicles with no human behind the wheel, and perhaps no steering wheel at all — are headed toward California streets and highways starting in 2018. After months of criticism, state regulators... (Russ Mitchell) Intel and Mobileye were already partners in self-driving system development with automaker BMW. The three companies plan to put 40 autonomous vehicles on the road for testing by the end of the year. With an outright purchase by Intel, Mobileye will enjoy plenty of access to capital and other corporate resources, enabling its products to hit the market faster at lower cost. Mobileye’s vision systems dominate the market for lane-keeping and other driver-assist technologies, and are being used by most of the companies testing driverless cars. The company said it has contracts with 27 automakers. The deal will “greatly expand Intel’s automotive reach,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Auto Trader. In an email to staff, Mobileye Chief Executive Ziv Aviram and fellow co-founder Amnon Shashua said they’re staying on to run Mobileye. "We always wanted to change the world – now we have better means of doing so,” the email said. Intel’s Krzanich, in a prepared statement, struck a more bureaucratic tone: "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Bureaucracy is always a danger in deals like this. Intel, whose chips powered the personal computer revolution, failed to take full advantage of the mobile phone revolution and doesn’t want to miss out on self-driving cars. Absorbing a scrappy small company with 660 employees into a giant organization with 106,000 workers, without killing the entrepreneurial spirit, is always a challenge. In the meantime, competitors abound, and there is no guarantee that any one company’s technological path is the right one.

(Tracey Lien) Ultimately, autonomous cars will require tight integration of optical, radar and lidar sensors working with artificial intelligence software. The technological distance Mobileye and perhaps competitors must travel to achieve true autonomy was made clear last year when the Mobileye vision system on a Tesla Model S mistook the side of a truck for an overcast sky. Noting that such semi-autonomous technology requires the driver to remain alert, federal regulators later absolved Tesla and Mobileye of blame for the fatal crash. After that, Tesla dropped Mobileye as a supplier, and began using chips from Nvidia, which is emerging as a major force in self-driving technology, to process its video and other sensor data. Nvidia’s stock has more than tripled over the last 12 months, while Intel’s has barely budged. The automakers themselves are taking different routes toward their driverless future. General Motors and Ford have each purchased small companies developing driverless systems: Cruise Automation in GM’s case, Argo AI’s in Ford’s. Most of the automakers will be mixing and matching technologies from different vendors to come up with a complete system. The technology in Google’s Waymo driverless car unit, however, is mostly home grown. Mobileye, a specialist in vision, will have to develop or purchase expertise in radar and lidar if it is to become a full system provider. In the deal, Intel will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye, a 34% premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of each company must approve the deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country's history. He said he's been assured that the company's operations will stay in Israel. “The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is turning into a global technology center, not just in cyber but also in the automotive industry.” Mobileye shares closed Monday at $60.62, up 28.2%. Intel closed down 2.1% at $35.12. The Associated Press was used in this report.

AMD said it will ship its Ryzen 5 desktop processors on April 11, the same day it will begin accepting its first orders for the chip. All of the four new Ryzen 5 chips will be priced at less than $250, the same price range that Intel currently offers for its own Core i5 chips at. However, the number of cores and threads that the Ryzen 5 offers pushes into Intel’s Core i7 territory, potentially offering much more value for the price. Here are the four members of the Ryzen 5 family: The $169 Ryzen 5 1400, a 4-core/8-thread chip that runs at 3.2GHz and boosts at 3.4GHz The $189 Ryzen 5 1500X, (4 cores/8 threads, 3.5GHz/3.7GHz) The $219 Ryzen 5 1600 (6 cores/12 threads, 3.2GHz/3.6GHz) And the $249 Ryzen 5 1600X (6 cores/12 threads, 3.6GHz/4.0GHz) So far, Intel has held firm on its own processor prices, which means the selling point of the Ryzen 5 will be “tremendously more computational power” than the Core i5, according to Kevin Lensing, the corporate vice president and general manager of the Client Business Unit at AMD. Specifically, AMD is taking aim at Intel’s $242 Core i5-7600K, a 3.8GHz, 4-core/4-thread chip, with its slightly pricier Ryzen 5 1600X, which offers three times the thread count. (Intel’s cheapest 6-core chip, the Core i7-5820K, is $389.) Why you should care: To measure how successful AMD will be with Ryzen, look to the Ryzen 5. As AMD has noted previously, the company expects to sell twice as many of these low-cost chips (priced at less than $250) as it does pricier enthusiast chips. For now, Lensing said, AMD can offer a “disruptive price and performance ratio” that Intel can’t match.  And AMD’s Ryzen 5 performance is...? Though AMD and others typically consider the Ryzen 7 and Core i7 to be so-called “gaming” or “enthusiast” parts, hardware surveys like those conducted by Valve Software’s Steam store tell another story. In February, 48 percent of all PC gamers ran PCs with four physical cores, while another 46 percent used just two cores. That actually places the typical gamer at or just below what the Core i5 offers, and right in the niche AMD hopes to conquer. So far, Lensing said, Ryzen 7 sales offer an optimistic projection for how well the Ryzen 5 will be received. “We couldn’t be more proud and happy with the launch of Ryzen 7,” he said. “The demand that we’ve generated has been truly surprising, and truly flattering for us. This new processor has been so well-received in the marketplace, and we can’t wait to continue.” Interestingly, Lensing said that AMD would be emphasizing the B350 motherboards in conjunction with the Ryzen 5. Although the B350 was launched alongside the X370 motherboards, the latter board was preferred for the Ryzen 7, and subsequently either sold out or was in short supply. The B350 offers almost all of the features of the X370, including overclocking, he said. We still don’t know how much performance the Ryzen 5 family will deliver. AMD shipped the Ryzen 7 to great fanfare. Reviews showed, however, that the Ryzen processor performed slower than Intel chips in games at more CPU-dependent lower resolutions. A number of theories were floated, many of which AMD itself debunked in a blog post on Monday night. For now, AMD executives said they’ll disclose Ryzen 5 performance numbers at a later date, after orders for the chip have begun. There’s one small exception: AMD disclosed that the XFR threshold for the 1400X will be 3.7GHz, 200MHz higher than the boost speed. AMD’s eXtended Frequency Range kicks in when the processor is properly cooled. The XFR number is typically only 100MHz higher than the boost speed, or the clock speed that the chip can leap to for a short period under load. Like the Ryzen 7, however, all Ryzen 5 chips will be multiplier unlocked, meaning you could push the performance higher. All of the new Ryzen 5 chips use a 65W threshold, except the 1600X, which has a TDP of 95W. Fortunately, some of the new Ryzen chips will also include the new Wraith coolers inside the box. The Ryzen 5 1400 will include the Wraith Stealth, while the Wraith Spire will ship with the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X, Lensing said. The Ryzen 5 1600X won’t include a cooler in the box.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | March 16, 2017 -- 11:12 GMT (04:12 PDT) | Topic: Security NopSec Intel and Microsoft have launched new bug bounty programs with thousands of dollars on offer for the most dangerous bugs. Intel revealed the new bug bounty program will be hosted on HackerOne at the CanSecWest security conference on Wednesday. While old hat for companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Google, the scheme is the first of its kind for the tech giant. More security news Microsoft begins blocking updates for older Windows versions on newer hardware Making this one change could eliminate spam, says police tech chief This laptop-bricking USB stick just got even more dangerous Automating security? Robots can't replace humans in decision loop "We want to encourage researchers to identify issues and bring them to us directly so that we can take prompt steps to evaluate and correct them, and we want to recognize researchers for the work that they put in when researching a vulnerability," Intel said. "By partnering constructively with the security research community, we believe we will be better able to protect our customers." Intel says the "harder a vulnerability is to mitigate, the more we pay." As a consequence, critical bugs are the most lucrative, with $7,500 on offer for critical Intel software bugs, up to $10,000 for critical Intel firmware security flaws, and up to $30,000 for each critical Intel hardware bug disclosed to the company. The Santa Clara, California-based firm uses the CVSS score generator to ascertain how dangerous a vulnerability can be. If a bug is deemed of "high" importance, up to $10,000 is up for grabs, while a "medium" severity bug can earn researchers up to $2,000. In addition, "low" risk security flaws are worth up to $1,000. Intel Security (McAfee), third-party products, and Intel's web presence are not part of the bug bounty program. In addition, Microsoft also announced a new bug bounty program on Wednesday for the Microsoft Office Insider on Windows. The Redmond giant says it will offer researchers a minimum of $500 and maximum of $15,000 for vulnerability submissions which are discovered in the Microsoft Office Insider slow build shipping on the latest, fully patched version of the Windows 10 Desktop operating system. The flaws must be zero-day vulnerabilities and the Microsoft team must be able to replicate the problem for a bug to qualify for a reward. The company will also consider rewarding researchers with more than $15,000 if the security flaw is something special. The program will run until June 15. Bug bounties can be lucrative, not only for researchers that can earn cash rewards for their findings but also for companies which can potentially save money otherwise spent on damage control -- and money lost through a hit to reputation -- if a zero-day vulnerability is exploited in the wild before it can be patched. In 2016, on crowdsourced bug bounty platform HackerOne, rewards were on offer of up to $30,000 for the most severe flaws. Through the platform, Twitter has paid researchers a total of $561,980 for responsible disclosure, and other companies offer up to $50,000 for novel, dangerous bugs.

The 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 1600X will dent wallets to the tune of $249 (which we're guestimating will be around £230 in proper money), while the cheapest Ryzen 5, the 1400, will cost around $169 (or £150).  While AMD was keen to stress the radically lower prices of its Ryzen 7 parts compared to Intel's Core i7 range when it launched last month, with the Ryzen 5 AMD is keener to assert that it offers much more performance for around about the same money, part for part.  Pitted against a quad-core 3.8GHz Intel Core i5 7600K, AMD claims that its top-of-the-range Ryzen 5 1600X can outperform the similarly priced Intel part by "up to" 69 per cent running Maxon's Cinebench performance benchmarking tool.  Like the Ryzen 7, the Ryzen 5 range will feature AMD's SenseMI technologies that "learn and adapt to what you do", according to Kevin Lensing, AMD's corporate vice president and general manager of client computing, unveiling the new Ryzen 5 range. SenseMI is a marketing term that covers a bundle of different on-chip technologies, including neural-net prediction, smart pre-fetch, and precision boost, which can automatically increase the CPU's clock speed (and hence performance) without user intervention. While the Ryzen 5 1600X will ship without a bundled cooler, the 1600 and 1500X will come with AMD's popular Wraith Spire, while the Ryzen 1400 will include the Wraith Stealth. The Ryzen 5 will be competing in what could be described as the make-or-break segment of the market, with twice as many PC and laptop CPUs sold at the sub-$300 mark compared to more expensive CPUs, such as the high-end Ryzen 7 and Intel Core i7.  "The idea is to offer a range of price and performance options in the mainstream segment, tailored to end-users' needs for the best frequency, the best IPC [instructions per cycle] and the best core and thread count to maximise the performance of the processors," said Lensing. AMD's Ryzen 5 microprocessors will also, as promised, fit into the new AM4 range of chipsets and motherboards unveiled with Ryzen 7 last month, with the company expecting most Ryzen 5's being slotted into AM4-B350 motherboards.  Summary: AMD's Ryzen 5 line-up Part Cores Threads Base GHz Boost GHz Cooler TDP Price Ryzen 5 1600X Six Twelve 3.6GHz 4GHZ N/A 95W $249/c£230 Ryzen 5 1600 Six Twelve 3.2GHz 3.6GHz Wraith Spire 65W $219/c£200 Ryzen 5 1500X Four Eight 3.5GHz 3.7GHz Wraith Spire 65W $189/c£170 Ryzen 5 1400 Four Eight 3.2GHz 3.4GHz Wraith Stealth 65W $169/c£150 AMD's Ryzen 3 microprocessors, meanwhile, are slated for the second half of the year, which if the company's release schedule so far this year is any guide means that they could be shipping in early July. µ Further reading Chipset/Mobo AMD's Ryzen 7 is half the price of Intel's Core i7, despite 'better performance' 22 Feb 2017 Chips AMD rebuffs Ryzen temperature and Windows 10 thread scheduling complaints 14 Mar 2017 Cloud AMD Naples: 32-core Zen-based SoC takes the fight to Intel Xeon 07 Mar 2017 Chipset/Mobo AMD: Ryzen is coming soon, honest.

Now Apple working on self-driving car How driverless cars work and its impact on the professional drivers Samsung Note 7 fiasco, 'Freedom 251' fraud, driverless cars: Tech news in 2016 Microchip manufacturer Intel has invested heavily in the driverless car race with the latest $15 billion (A$19.5bn) purchase of Israeli tech company Mobileye. Mobileye develops sensors and intelligence technology behind automated driver-assistance systems and many self-driving cars. Its tech enables a car to “see” and understand the world. Other recent purchases include the deep learning tech company Nervana, microchip maker Movidius and automotive tech company Delphi. Intel is also working with the automotive companies BMW and Volkswagen to begin trials later this year. Intel is strategically putting together all the critical capabilities required to develop self-driving cars that can “see” and intelligently understand the world around us. Seeing is safe Most self-driving cars use a combination of sensing technologies. These include visual sensors, such as cameras, and range-to-object detecting sensors, such as lasers and radar. Until the last decade or so, range-based sensors have dominated commercially developed systems in robotics and self-driving cars. These sensors reliably tell the distance to all objects surrounding the platform to ranges of 100 metres or more. Lasers were typically only used for low-level, simple tasks such as obstacle avoidance, to make sure the system didn’t hit anything. Radar sensors have been used for at least a decade in advanced cruise control systems in some high-end cars, and have recently transitioned to low-cost cars. But range-only sensors have their limits. A long-range laser or radar scan can give you crude information about the posture of a pedestrian, but won’t tell you the expression on that person’s face. Range sensors are also poor at reading existing signage, since most signs are visual. In contrast, vision-based sensors like cameras provide a perceptually rich view of the world. They sense colour and fine appearance details, which a laser or radar unit simply does not pick up. When it comes to driving, our environment has been designed and built with the assumption that a human driver will be able to see. So cars that see like us will fit most naturally into existing infrastructure and signage. Seeing is difficult However, cameras are very susceptible to changing environmental conditions. The simplest example encountered on roads is the day-night cycle. Beyond the darkness, artificial lighting such as from oncoming headlights makes life difficult for the software trying to make sense of what is on the road ahead. Other changes like weather, seasonal changes, fog, smoke and haze cause other problems. Snow banks can build up on streets, completely obscuring line markings and even signs. Humans are often able to drive cautiously and work out what to do, but self-driving cars, designed to rely on rigid road rules, struggle. The biggest challenge occurs when multiple changes happen at once, such as a tropical thunderstorm in the middle of the night. People deal with these conditions reasonably well, although we have higher accident rate in such conditions. But no driverless car has yet demonstrated it can reliably drive under extreme conditions. Regularly occurring circumstances, such as moderate rain, is about as well as they can currently do. A fully autonomous drive on a rainy night on the streets of Mountain View, CA, produced by AI company drive.ai. Seeing can be taught Many of the biggest players in the self-driving car world are developing deep learning systems that learn how to drive at a scale far beyond what a human driver does during their hundred hours or so of learner training. This is where Mobileye comes in. These deep learning systems typically require huge amounts of labelled data. Gathering the raw data is expensive but quite doable: just put sensors and computers on a large number of cars and drive millions of hours around road networks. This leaves them with the labelling problem: labelling people, cars, hazards, traffic lights, lane markings and signs in massive amounts of camera footage. Mobileye solves this problem by employing hundreds of humans to laboriously label these images. It is one of the leaders in this field and its relationships with dozens of companies working in this area show it has been successful. Intel’s acquisition positions it as a direct challenger to other major companies pursuing the same learning-based approach, such as NVIDIA. NVIDIA’s self-driving car demo. In the longer term, we may see companies like Mobileye and Xerox switch increasingly to using photo-realistic simulation to generate much of their data. This approach has the advantage of not requiring any human labelling, as the simulation environment already knows about all the things in the environment. Seeing is sensitive and subtle Current self-driving cars are typically much more cautious than humans. This is because humans are able to reliably make more sense of what is happening in the world around them. In this Tesla video (below, at 0:54), the car slows and almost stops as it drives past joggers on the side of the road. A human will see the joggers and likely infer that they are very unlikely to suddenly jump out into the road. A machine tends or is explicitly programmed to be more cautious, at least for now. Vision technologies like those developed by Mobileye can potentially provide much of the more subtle “scene context” to help the car drive more confidently. Vision technologies can read facial expressions and analyse the body pose and likely intentions of people standing by the side of the road. They can even see into another human-driven car to see whether the driver is looking at the road or at their phone. Vision-based technology may also potentially integrate more seamlessly with human drivers in driver-assisted systems such as Toyota’s Guardian system, which helps humans avoid mistakes. Seeing and statistics More than a dozen companies have demonstrated self-driving cars driving autonomously under varying circumstances. But we still don’t have reliable fleets of vehicles we can book at any time, as we can with human-driven ride-sharing services such taxis, Uber and Lyft. One of the challenges that remains is that the top self-driving cars are reliable most of the time, but not all of the time. They are also bad at dealing with those one-in-a-million (or billion) events where something completely unexpected happens, such as a couch being driven down the road or a man in a giant chicken suit on the side of the road. In last year’s Tesla fatality, a combination of human error and unlikely but possible events contributed to the accident. One of the problems – the autopilot not noticing the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky – is a classic example of the vision problem that everyone is trying to solve.

For many years, ARM has dominated the mobile industry with its line of mobile processor architectures. So far, almost all phone makers equip their products with a version or combinations of various ARM architectures. However, a recent partnership suggests that Intel is now ready to face ARM head on with its newest Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA  SoC mobile processor. The Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA SoC processor is a result of a design partnership between Intel and Spreadtrum. The new mobile processor boasts an eight-core system design that can run at up to 2GHz of clock frequency. Furthermore, just like the ARM processor the consumers have come to know and love, it also has other features built for mobile applications. In addition to core count and clock speed, the Spreadtrum SoC also has a Cat 7 LTE wireless module. It has an uplink speed of 300Mbps and downlink speed of 100Mbps. On top of this, the new chip can also support a single 26-megapixel camera sensor or two 13-megapixel sensors. New Intel Spreadtrum SoC processor (via spreadtrum.com) In terms of graphics, the Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA chip uses Imagination’s PowerVR GT7200 GPU and is capable of 4K video encoding at 30 frames per second. The maximum screen resolution supported by the chip is WQXGA or 2560x1600pixels. The new Spreatrum SoC chip is based on Intel’s 14nm process technology. As mentioned, it contains eight 64-bit CPU cores based on the Airmont (Intel Atom) architecture. The new chip was introduced back in February during the Mobile World Congress (MWC 2017) event in Spain. Intel will begin production of the said chip in the second quarter of 2017. Consumers can expect mobile products using the device sometime before the end of the year. It seems like Intel has finally decided to join the fray of the ARM dominated market. Unfortunately, Intel would have to cover a lot of ground since ARM has cemented itself on almost every mobile product in the market. Nevertheless, Intel introducing a new mobile processor can promote healthy competition. Perhaps in a few years, consumers could be looking at a cheaper mobile device in the market.

These will fight in the market against Inte's i5 range, and as you can see from the pricing AMD has more or less matched Intel. Intel's cheapest i5, the 2.7GHz (3.3GHz Turbo) i5 6400 currently sells for around $245, and that's what AMD is asking for its cheapest Ryzen 5 -- the 3.2GHz (3.4GHz Boost) 1400. At the higher end, the top Ryzen 5 1600X (3.6GHz/4GHz Boost is $359, while Intel's i5 7600K (3.8GHz/4.2GHz Turbo) is a bit cheaper at $325. However, the Ryzen 5 1600X had six cores to the i5's four. Of course, Intel's CPUs are now a bit cheaper since the company dropped prices to battle AMD, but isn't it interesting how closely they're priced? Now things in the CPU scene are going to get really interesting! It seems that the top tier Ryzen 7 will be the ones to smash Intel on price against the i7, while the middle of the pack range will fight it out based more on the performance Ryzen has already established, and more cores in some cases. Be sure to pick up the next (issue of PC & Tech Authority magazine, onsale April 13th, for a full and somewhat huge feature analysis of Ryzen. Ryzen 5 will be onsale April 11. Will you buy one?   Press release follows: Sydney, Australia — March 16, 2017 — Following the successful introduction of AMD Ryzen™ 7 desktop processors including record pre-orders and award-winning1 performance, AMD today announced Ryzen™ 5 desktop processors will launch worldwide on April 11, 2017, offering disruptive price-to-performance for gamers and creators.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Intel is spending $15.3 billion to acquire the company behind Tesla’s early self-driving tech Zach Epstein @zacharye March 13th, 2017 at 8:48 AM Share Tweet Intel on Monday morning confirmed earlier reports that it will acquire Jerusalem-based self-driving technology company Mobileye for $63.54 a share, or $15.3 billion in total. The deal follows successful work the two companies have done on BMW’s iNext self-driving platform, which is expected to appear in production vehicles as soon as 2021, just four years from now. Of course, Intel and Mobileeye have their sights set much higher than just on the work they’re doing with BMW. The companies are looking to build a scalable architecture that will become an industry standard, powering safe and feature-rich autonomous driving systems in cars and trucks from a wide range of auto makers. By combining forces in this multi-billion deal, the duo will seemingly be better positioned to realize this ambitious vision. Don't Miss: New leak shows how incredible Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design really is “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a press released announcing the deal. “Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Mobileye is widely known as a market leader in the self-driving car space, though its most recent round of press ahead of this major deal wasn’t very positive. Tesla was one of the Israeli company’s biggest early partners, but the two firms parted ways after Tesla blamed Mobileye tech in part for the fatal Model S crash that left a Model S driver in Florida dead last year. The car’s sensors failed to see a tractor-trailer pulling out onto a highway with Autopilot engaged, and the Model S struck the side of the truck, killing the driver instantly. Both Tesla and Mobileye have independently made significant changes to their self-driving systems since then in an effort to improve safety and performance. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers,” Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram said of the deal with Intel. “By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” Intel says that it expects the acquisition to close within the next nine months.

Intel/Mobileye Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Microchip manufacturer Intel has invested heavily in the driverless car race with the latest US$15 billion (A$19.5bn) purchase of Israeli tech company Mobileye. Mobileye develops sensors and intelligence technology behind automated driver-assistance systems and many self-driving cars. Its tech enables a car to “see” and understand the world. Other recent purchases include the deep learning tech company Nervana, microchip maker Movidius and automotive tech company Delphi. Intel is also working with the automotive companies BMW and Volkswagen to begin trials later this year. Intel is strategically putting together all the critical capabilities required to develop self-driving cars that can “see” and intelligently understand the world around us. Seeing is safe Most self-driving cars use a combination of sensing technologies. These include visual sensors, such as cameras, and range-to-object detecting sensors, such as lasers and radar. Until the last decade or so, range-based sensors have dominated commercially developed systems in robotics and self-driving cars. These sensors reliably tell the distance to all objects surrounding the platform to ranges of 100 metres or more. Lasers were typically only used for low-level, simple tasks such as obstacle avoidance, to make sure the system didn’t hit anything. Radar sensors have been used for at least a decade in advanced cruise control systems in some high-end cars, and have recently transitioned to low-cost cars. But range-only sensors have their limits. A long-range laser or radar scan can give you crude information about the posture of a pedestrian, but won’t tell you the expression on that person’s face. Range sensors are also poor at reading existing signage, since most signs are visual. In contrast, vision-based sensors like cameras provide a perceptually rich view of the world. They sense colour and fine appearance details, which a laser or radar unit simply does not pick up. When it comes to driving, our environment has been designed and built with the assumption that a human driver will be able to see. So cars that see like us will fit most naturally into existing infrastructure and signage. Seeing is difficult However, cameras are very susceptible to changing environmental conditions. The simplest example encountered on roads is the day-night cycle. Beyond the darkness, artificial lighting such as from oncoming headlights makes life difficult for the software trying to make sense of what is on the road ahead. It is hard for a camera-based navigation system to recognise where it is in the world. The photos (left) are the same place, but the photos (right) are from two different places. Michael Milford, Author provided Other changes like weather, seasonal changes, fog, smoke and haze cause other problems. Snow banks can build up on streets, completely obscuring line markings and even signs. Humans are often able to drive cautiously and work out what to do, but self-driving cars, designed to rely on rigid road rules, struggle. The biggest challenge occurs when multiple changes happen at once, such as a tropical thunderstorm in the middle of the night. People deal with these conditions reasonably well, although we have higher accident rate in such conditions. But no driverless car has yet demonstrated it can reliably drive under extreme conditions. Regularly occurring circumstances, such as moderate rain, is about as well as they can currently do. A fully autonomous drive on a rainy night on the streets of Mountain View, CA, produced by AI company drive.ai. Seeing can be taught Many of the biggest players in the self-driving car world are developing deep learning systems that learn how to drive at a scale far beyond what a human driver does during their hundred hours or so of learner training. This is where Mobileye comes in. These deep learning systems typically require huge amounts of labelled data. Gathering the raw data is expensive but quite doable: just put sensors and computers on a large number of cars and drive millions of hours around road networks. This leaves them with the labelling problem: labelling people, cars, hazards, traffic lights, lane markings and signs in massive amounts of camera footage. Mobileye solves this problem by employing hundreds of humans to laboriously label these images. It is one of the leaders in this field and its relationships with dozens of companies working in this area show it has been successful. Intel’s acquisition positions it as a direct challenger to other major companies pursuing the same learning-based approach, such as NVIDIA. NVIDIA’s self-driving car demo. In the longer term, we may see companies like Mobileye and Xerox switch increasingly to using photo-realistic simulation to generate much of their data. This approach has the advantage of not requiring any human labelling, as the simulation environment already knows about all the things in the environment. Seeing is sensitive and subtle Current self-driving cars are typically much more cautious than humans. This is because humans are able to reliably make more sense of what is happening in the world around them. In this Tesla video (below, at 0:54), the car slows and almost stops as it drives past joggers on the side of the road. A human will see the joggers and likely infer that they are very unlikely to suddenly jump out into the road. A machine tends or is explicitly programmed to be more cautious, at least for now. Vision technologies like those developed by Mobileye can potentially provide much of the more subtle “scene context” to help the car drive more confidently. Vision technologies can read facial expressions and analyse the body pose and likely intentions of people standing by the side of the road. They can even see into another human-driven car to see whether the driver is looking at the road or at their phone. Vision-based technology may also potentially integrate more seamlessly with human drivers in driver-assisted systems such as Toyota’s Guardian system, which helps humans avoid mistakes. Seeing and statistics More than a dozen companies have demonstrated self-driving cars driving autonomously under varying circumstances. But we still don’t have reliable fleets of vehicles we can book at any time, as we can with human-driven ride-sharing services such taxis, Uber and Lyft. One of the challenges that remains is that the top self-driving cars are reliable most of the time, but not all of the time. They are also bad at dealing with those one-in-a-million (or billion) events where something completely unexpected happens, such as a couch being driven down the road or a man in a giant chicken suit on the side of the road. In last year’s Tesla fatality, a combination of human error and unlikely but possible events contributed to the accident. One of the problems – the autopilot not noticing the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky – is a classic example of the vision problem that everyone is trying to solve.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD announces, details its new Ryzen 5 mainstream CPU family AMD announces, details its new Ryzen 5 mainstream CPU family By Joel Hruska on March 15, 2017 at 10:00 pm Comment Ryzen 7’s debut just under three weeks ago clearly kicked off an upgrade cycle for AMD fans and potentially some Intel converts — in the three weeks we’ve been watching, the Ryzen 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 have all maintained spots in the Top 20, and typically the Top 15. With 6-7 CPUs in the Top 20 compared with 2-3 prior to the launch of Ryzen, AMD is clearly better positioned (and earning at least somewhat more money, thanks to higher CPU prices). Still, the cheapest Ryzen 7 CPU clocks in at $329, and that’s not exactly affordable. Today, AMD is announcing its new Ryzen 5 CPU family. While the naming evokes the Core i5, the products themselves do not. First up, we’ve got a pair of six-core chips; the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1600. Both of them have SMT enabled, but the 1600X has a 3.6GHz base clock and a 4GHz Boost, while the 1600 has a 3.2GHz base clock and a 3.6GHz boost. Drop down the stack again, and we’ve got the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. Both CPUs offer quad-cores and eight threads, with clock speeds of 3.5GHz – 3.7GHz and 3.2GHz-3.4GHz respectively. While this is a touch lower than some of Intel’s Core i5s, the addition of SMT should more than compensate for lower clocks in multi-threaded workloads. I don’t plan to spend much time talking about chipsets, but I wanted to give an updated version of the image that’s been floating around for awhile. The X370 and B350 are the obvious enthusiast platforms, with the X300 available for SFF options. Of course, none of this means much if the prices aren’t good. Check this out. AMD isn’t done putting a world of hurt on Intel’s high-end product stack. We’ve put together a chart below to show how AMD’s new Ryzen 5 stacks up against Intel’s lineup, but we have to note that it’s not a perfect match. There are two sets of chips you can conceivably stack up against the quad-core Ryzen 5’s — the Core i7 family, which has four cores, eight threads, and is vastly more expensive, or the Core i5, which has quad-cores, no SMT, and is more competitive within the same price band. We decided to show two comparison points for the 1500X, but stayed with an i5 comparator with the Ryzen 5 1400. If you’re eyeing a $169 chip, stepping up to a CPU that costs twice as much probably isn’t something you’re very interested in doing (and there aren’t enough desktop chips in the Kaby Lake Core i7 family to give us much to compare with anyway). If you thought AMD was going to confine itself to gunning for Intel’s top-end Broadwell-E chips, think again. The six-core Ryzen 5’s are priced at 40% and 50% of their Intel equivalents, respectively. The quad-core chips are a bit of a mix. If you compare Ryzen 5 1500X against the Core i7-7700, the 1500X is definitely cheaper, but won’t match an i7-7700’s performance (the 7700K is more expensive, but also clocks higher). If you compare Ryzen 5 1500X against a Core i5, the cost difference is marginal, meaning this comes down to a pure performance fight. With eight threads vs. four, Ryzen should win that struggle, but we’re not going to call the situation either way until we have silicon in-hand. The Ryzen 5 1400 is in a similar position. It’s somewhat cheaper than the i5, but we’ll need to see performance before we render a verdict. But based on this lineup, AMD has a potent set of products, particularly at the six-core level. Ryzen will only have been in-market for a month when AMD’s next quarterly conference call rolls around, but a lot of eyes will be watching to see how the company’s CPU & GPU revenue looks. So far, it seems like they’ve got something to look forward to.

Launches Reviews Cars Motorcycles Scooters EV Commercial Intel Acquires MobilEye for $ 15.3 Billion! by Mayank Dhingraon March 16, 2017No Comments Intel, the world’s biggest hardware chip-set producer has acquired Israel based autonomous driving technology firm, Mobileye. The tech giant has signed the dotted line to close the deal for a staggering $ 15.3 billion, which would aid it to rapidly scale up its operations in the arena of self-driving technology, which is going to come as a strong force in the global automotive scene. The said deal has seen shares of Mobileye shooting up dramatically, while Intel also benefits hugely as now being able to give a direct fight to the competition, which stands in the form of Qualcomm and Nvidia, both of which are already in the area of making hardware for self-driving technology. Intel is now slated to merge its in-house Automated Driving Group or ADG with Mobileye and the headquarters of the company will remain to be there in Israel. Mobileye has been the key supplier for camera-based supportive technologies, which are used in driver assistance systems present in a host of today’s cars. The current technology can change lanes, detect pedestrians and also detect obstacles and moving objects, including cars in the way of a driver and can assist him in evading a possible collision by partial intervention. The future will see these systems being able to take judgments on their own and driving in a complete autonomous manner. Mobileye has also been working in close association with ST Microelectronics since the past 12 years for developing its systems. The two companies are now taking their partnership forward to come up with a fifth-generation Mobileye system, called EyeQ5, which would offer fully autonomous driving features to be implemented in self-driving cars by 2020. BMW has also been a long term customer of the company for its various sensors used in its vehicles. Recently, German auto major BMW joined hands with both Intel and Mobileye to develop its autonomous cars for the future. Related Posts CES 2017 : Self Driving Tech Ventures Into All-New BMW 5-Series!

With the device’s speculated release date fast approaching, leaks and rumors about the powerhouse hybrid are trickling in at a steady pace. While Microsoft is yet to confirm any of these speculations, the nature of these rumors is quite encouraging for avid fans of the device. Here then are three new compelling rumors that have recently emerged about the upcoming Surface Pro 5. An AMD Ryzen 7 Variant Since the Surface Pro 5 began doing its rounds in the rumor mill, speculations were already high that the upcoming hybrid device would feature Intel’s 7th-generation processors, the powerful Kaby Lake series. These processors are the best that Intel currently has to offer, and because Surface Pro devices have long used the chipmaker’s processors, speculations of a Kaby Lake-equipped Surface Pro 5 appear to be quite solid. Recently, however, rumors emerged that the Surface Pro 5 might feature another variant that does not utilize Intel’s latest-generation processors, according to a PC Advisor report. These speculations came as a result of the recent trailer for the upcoming sci-fi thriller film, Alien: Covenant, where characters in the movie’s teaser were shown using a very familiar-looking tablet device. @AlienMoviesUK Walter trailer showing the @Microsoft #SurfacePro5 uses an @AMD processor since they sponsor it? https://t.co/eyOLQh5xSx pic.twitter.com/0yPuZXIMHM — Robo Lobster (@RoboLobster) March 11, 2017 During the brief teaser for the movie (which could be viewed at the end of this article), a couple of scientists were featured using a device that looks very similar to the Surface Pro series. What was interesting, however, was the fact that the film itself was sponsored by Intel’s arch-rival, AMD. The official Alien: Covenant trailer, which has been uploaded and viewed over 2 million times on YouTube, even includes the phrase “Intelligence powered by AMD, Ryzen and Radeon” in its description. Of course, the links between the upcoming movie’s recent trailer and the upcoming hybrid device remain pretty slim. Considering the reviews that AMD’s Ryzen chips, mainly the Ryzen 7 1800X, have been getting from critics and users so far, however, there is a pretty good chance that the Redmond-based tech giant is considering AMD as a possible partner for the Surface Pro 5. Since the processors’ release, the AMD Ryzen 7 series has been showered with acclaim, with many stating that the chips were comparable in every way to Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. Rumors of a multi-variant Surface Pro 5 release have been around for some time. Over the course of the last few months, speculations were high that apart from the Kaby Lake variants of the device, Microsoft would also be unveiling an ARM-based LTE version of the Surface Pro 5. Thus, while the links between the Surface Pro 5 and AMD’s Ryzen chips are pretty flimsy at this point, the idea of an AMD-totting SP5 is completely plausible. Surface Pro 5 ! pic.twitter.com/hiiL7ph0aQ — FlashFly46 (@FlashFly46) March 3, 2017 USB-C Port Apart from the possible partnership with AMD for the Surface Pro 5, rumors are also high that Microsoft might finally begin adopting USB Type-C in the upcoming device. USB-C is quickly emerging as a powerful trend in the portable tech market, with firms such as Apple fully embracing the robust port for its notebooks such as the MacBook Pro 2016 and the 12-inch MacBook. Considering the advantages that the addition of USB-C could give to the hybrid device, there is a pretty good chance that the Surface Pro 5 might debut with the port as its primary connector as well. Unlike Apple, however, rumors are high that Microsoft would still keep the legacy ports that were present in the Surface Pro 4. Thus, while the Surface Pro 5 might ship with a USB-C port, there is a good chance that the device’s standard USB 3.0 and display ports would still be featured on the upcoming device. March 2017 Announcement The official release date for the Surface Pro 5 remains unknown at this point, though speculations are high that Microsoft would be announcing the powerful hybrid together with the next big update for Windows 10, the highly anticipated Creators Update. Considering that the W10 update is due for a Spring 2017 release, speculations are high that the Surface Pro 5 is due for a March 2017 announcement. As for the device’s availability, rumors are abounding that the Surface Pro 5 would be available sometime around April 2017, if a March 2017 reveal does happen. Of course, these are but speculations at this point, so do take these with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, fans of the hybrid device could be sure of one thing — the Surface Pro 5 is definitely coming, and it is only a matter of time before the highly anticipated hybrid device gets an official release.

WIRE Intel Buys Self-Driving Car Tech Company Mobileye for $15 Billion The Israeli-based company is the latest in the self-driving sector to score a big-money deal. By Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at just over $14 billion, the latest push by a major tech company to advance autonomous vehicles that could change the way traffic moves globally. Mobileye develops technology that essentially gives computers a sense of their physical surroundings and it has also been busying creating ties to get that technology onto the road. Last year, it teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop the building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Also in 2016, ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. BMW, Intel and Mobileye also have a partnership, and Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne. In the latest deal, announced early Monday, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The companies put the equity value of the deal at approximately $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel's autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel and led by Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua. The organization will support both companies' existing production programs and build on relationships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, Tier-1 suppliers and semiconductor partners to develop advanced driving assist, highly autonomous and fully autonomous driving programs. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a company release that by working together, the companies will be able to "accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers." The deal, approved by the boards of both companies, is targeted to close within nine months. Mobileye's stock jumped nearly 32 percent Monday before the opening bell. --The Associated Press Published on: Mar 13, 2017 Advertisement

Today is the official announcement for Ryzen 5, featuring four processors in hex-core and quad-core formats, all with Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) and all using the same AM4 platform as Ryzen 5. Ryzen 5 Whereas Ryzen 7 was AMD’s main attack on high-performance x86 and a shot across the bow against Intel’s high-end desktop platform, Ryzen 5 is targeted more at mainstream users. The goal here is that where Intel has four cores with no hyperthreading, AMD can provide six cores with SMT, effectively offering three times as many threads for the same price and potentially smashing any multithreaded workload. Without further ado, here is where the Ryzen families stand: AMD Ryzen 7 SKUs   Cores/ Threads Base/ Turbo XFR L3 TDP Cost Cooler Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 3.6/4.0 +100 16 MB 95 W $499 - Ryzen 7 1700X 8/16 3.4/3.8 +100 16 MB 95 W $399 - Ryzen 7 1700 8/16 3.0/3.7 +50 16 MB 65 W $329 Spire RGB AMD Ryzen 5 SKUs   Cores/ Threads Base/ Turbo XFR L3 TDP Cost Cooler Ryzen 5 1600X 6/12 3.6/4.0 +100 16 MB 95 W $249 - Ryzen 5 1600 6/12 3.2/3.6 +100 16 MB 65 W $219 Spire Ryzen 5 1500X 4/8 3.5/3.7 +200 16 MB 65 W $189 Spire Ryzen 5 1400 4/8 3.2/3.4 +50 8 MB 65 W $169 Stealth Traditionally we are used to a part with fewer cores having a higher clock frequency, however perhaps due to the voltage scaling of the design, we see a matched Ryzen 5 1600X in frequency to the Ryzen 7 1800X, but the rest of the Ryzen 5 family are offered at a lower TDP instead. All the Ryzen 5 parts are unlocked, similar to the Ryzen 7 parts, and all four exhibit some movement in XFR mode, with the 1500X offering +200 MHz depending on the cooler used. AMD is going to offer some of these SKUs with their redesigned Wraith coolers: It is worth noting that the Wraith Spire for Ryzen 5 will not have RGB lighting, whereas the Wraith Spire for Ryzen 7 does use an RGB ring. OEMs will be able to use the higher-end Wraith Max stock cooler for their pre-built systems. AMD stated that at present, there are no plans to bring the Wraith coolers to retail as individual units, however they will keep track of how many users want them as individual items and regularly approach the issue internally. To clarify some initial confusion, AMD has given me official TDP support numbers for the coolers. The entry level Wraith Stealth is 65W, the Wraith Spire is 65W for high-ambient conditions (AMD states this might be considered an '80W' design in low-ambient), and the Wraith Max is 95W for OEM builds using Ryzen 7 95W parts. All the Ryzen 5 parts will support DDR4 ECC and non-ECC memory, and the memory support is the same as Ryzen 7, and will depend on how many modules and the types of modules being used. Recently companies like ADATA announced official support for AM4, as some users have found that there were memory growing pains when Ryzen 7 was launched. Platform support for Ryzen 5, relating to PCIe lanes and chipset configurations, is identical to Ryzen 7. Each CPU offers sixteen PCIe 3.0 lanes for graphics, along with four lanes for a chipset and four lanes for storage. Chipsets can then offer up to eight PCIe 2.0 lanes which can be bifurcated up to x4 (AMD GPUs can use chipset lanes for graphics as well, however at reduced bandwidth and additional latency). Competition The high-end Ryzen 5 1600X, at $249, is a shoe-in to compete against Intel’s i5-7600K at $242. Intel’s CPU is based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, and we’ve already shown in the Ryzen 7 review that by comparison Ryzen is more circa Broadwell, which is two generations behind. AMD won’t win much when it comes to single-threaded tests here, but the multi-threaded situation is where AMD shines. Comparison: Ryzen 5 1600X vs Core i5-7600K AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Features Intel Core i5-7600K 6 / 12 Cores/Threads 4 / 4 3.6 / 4.0 GHz Base/Turbo 3.8 / 4.2 GHz 16 PCIe 3.0 Lanes 16 16 MB L3 Cache 6 MB 95 W TDP 91 W $249 Price (MSRP) $242 Here we have twelve threads against four, at a 95W TDP compared to a 91W TDP (the 1600 is 65W, which looks better on paper). It is expected that for situations where a compute workload can scale across cores and threads that the AMD chip will wipe the floor with the competition. For more generic office workloads, it will interesting to see where the marks fall. On the quad-core parts, there are several competitive points to choose from. The AMD Ryzen 5 1500X, at $189, sits near Intel’s Core i5-7500 at $192. This would be a shootout of a base quad-core versus a quad-core with hyperthreading. Comparison: Ryzen 5 1500X vs Core i5-7500 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Features Intel Core i5-7500 4 / 8 Cores/Threads 4 / 4 3.5 / 3.7 GHz Base/Turbo 3.4 / 3.8 GHz 16 PCIe 3.0 Lanes 16 16 MB L3 Cache 6 MB 65 W TDP 65 W $189 Price (MSRP) $182 The reason why I didn’t pull out the Core i3-7350K there, at $168, is because the performance of the 7350K sits near the Pentium G4560, which is only $64 (and the subject of an upcoming review). That all being said, the $168 price of the i3-7350K matches up to the $169 price of the Ryzen 5 1400, although the 1400 has double the cores and double the threads of the 7350K. Cutting up the Cores Ryzen 5, both the hex-core and the quad-core variants, will use the same eight-core base Zeppelin silicon that Ryzen 7 does. The silicon design consists of two core complexes (CCX) of four cores apiece, and each with 8MB of L3 cache that is an exclusive victim cache. One of the suggestions regarding Ryzen 7’s performance was about thread migration and scheduling on the core design, especially as core-to-core latency varies depending on where the cores are located (and there’s a jump between CCXes). Despite the use of AMD’s new Infinity Fabric, which is ultimately a superset of HyperTransport, there is still a slightly longer delay jumping over that CCX boundary, although the default Windows scheduler knows how to manage that boundary as demonstrated by Allyn at PCPerspective earlier this week. So when dealing with a four-core or six-core CPU, and the base core design has eight-cores, how does AMD cut them up? It is possible for AMD to offer a 4+0, 3+1 or 2+2 design for its quad-core parts, or 4+2 and 3+3 variants for its hexacore parts, similar to the way that Intel cuts up its integrated graphics for GT1 variants. The downside with this way is that performance might differ between the variants, making it difficult to manage. The upside is that more CPUs with defects can be used. We have confirmation from AMD that there are no silly games going to be played with Ryzen 5. The six-core parts will be a strict 3+3 combination, while the four-core parts will use 2+2. This will be true across all CPUs, ensuring a consistent performance throughout. Performance Estimates We won’t have these CPUs in for a while, but given our new benchmark suite and the results we’ve seen so far with Ryzen, we’ve tried to lay out some estimates in performance in both single thread and multi-threaded workloads. Single thread performance is easy enough to estimate – we work from the turbo and XFR frequencies of each processor. For users looking for peak single thread performance, something like Intel’s Pentium G3258 or i3-7350K that can be overclocked to 5GHz+ (or starts as a base 4.2 GHz) is going to be a performance per dollar crown here. On the AMD side, we expect the Ryzen 5 1600X to match the Ryzen 7 1700X as it has the same frequency. Multithreaded is more difficult to predict. Some of our benchmarks offer perfect scaling across cores and threads, meaning that if you half the cores, you get half the score. Some of the benchmarks are not as clear cut though, hence why we see something like Intel’s Core i3-7350K, which should get about half the score of an i7-7700K, scoring 65% instead of 50%. We’ve tried to take this into account with the Ryzen 5 parts, and we get the graph above. The key results here show that the 1600 and 1600X should sit way above the i5-7600K, and the 1600X should offer so much better performance per dollar than the Core i7-7700K. On overall performance, taking the combination of results (our suite is slightly unbalanced in favor of MT, but this is taken into consideration) we funnily see a straight line between the 1800X, 1700X, 1700, 1600 and 1500X, putting the 1600X at a really good position as a performance per dollar CPU. The caveat here is that the Ryzen 7 processors came across as good workstation processors. Ryzen 7 was marketed towards that group of users, and it made sense. Ryzen 5 is more targeted towards mainstream gamers and users, which might offer some interesting results. Our results don’t feature any gaming numbers yet (still working on a Ryzen 7 part 2 for this), but it will be interesting to see how the core counts and frequency will affect gaming performance. The Bottom Line Ryzen 5. Two CPUs with six-core, from $219-$249. Two CPUs with four-core. From $169-$189. Retail availability on April 11th. Stay tuned for the AnandTech review.

POST A COMMENT 190 Comments View All Comments prisonerX - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Hmmm, AMD gives gamers 50% more cores for their expensive chunk of silicon, while with Intel you get... integrated graphics. But gamers are generally so stupid they'll keep buying Intel, becuase it's got 5% better single thread performance. Reply Makaveli - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link Gamers generally use Dedicated GPU's not integrated graphics. When was the last time you heard someone bragging about a igpu?? Secondly if you use highend GPU's at low resolutions (1080p) for possibly higher Hz monitor. You have to go Intel right now. At 1440 and greater where you have to worry less about cpu bottlenecks you are good with ryzen. And lastly most games are gpu bound not cpu that's where you are best spending your money. Reply prisonerX - Wednesday, March 15, 2017 - link I know, that's what makes gamer's continued love of i7's so puzzling. If you look at the die of a Core i7-7700K for instance, the IGP takes up more space that the processing cores! So Intel could have given people twice the cores for the same cost in terms of silicon, which is the determining factor. Now, I understand that the i7 gave better performance, but now with AMD delivering more cores that are competitive, revealing how Intel has treated them like rubes, gamers still vilify AMD and back Intel. It's puzzling. Reply Kaggy - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Well most gamers need really large ATX cases, blinking lights on mouse and keyboard. And every component has a "gaming" attached to it. So generally gamers do not look at logic much if they belong to that class of users. Reply Drumsticks - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link That's a mighty high horse you've got there purely for disagreeing with somebody's aesthetic choices. Do you sniff at people's Non-Black vehicles or painted walls, too? Reply prisonerX - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Don't worry, no-one's trying to take away your blinken lights. Reply TacticalTaco - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link Aesthetic changes like that will often reduce performance in one way or another. Reply RMSe17 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link A lot of gamers are like me, and simply care about best FPS and shortest load times. I will buy whichever CPU/GPU/SSD delivers that, within a reasonable budget. Hating a company is in this case illogical. Reply FMinus - Friday, March 17, 2017 - link I would consider myself a gamer (whilst not as much as I was 10 years ago) I still game each evening a bit. And I can't stand flashy things, I remember even going this far as snipping LEDs from fans that came with a chassis back in the day. Now I'm perfectly happy with my all black aluminum Lian-Li A76 tower where I just throw in random component, it's my third system in the same chassis, nothing glows, or blinks except for the motherboard lights, and I like it that way. Reply beginner99 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I don't think it's puzzling at all especially given reviewers mostly do stupid benches. There are few games that actually benefit from 6 or 8 slow cores over 4 fast ones and that mostly only applies to multi-player like BF1 which hardly ever is benched. So the 7700k especially OCed still comes clearly out at the top. And as has been said for high refresh rate gaming a fast CPU is a must as it must pump out 120+ frames per second. Besides that the launch issues with Ryzen and the fact it is underperforming in gaming compared to other benches will make people hesitant to buy. push them towards the known factor, eg 7700k.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / AMD Ryzen 5 Inbound: 6C12T and 4C8T CPUs Launch April 11th AMD Ryzen 5 Inbound: 6C12T and 4C8T CPUs Launch April 11th Luke Hill 3 days ago CPU, Featured Announcement, Featured Tech News AMD has announced its Ryzen 5 processors which will be launched and on shelves from April 11th 2017 in the form of two 4C8T parts and two 6C12T SKUs. Pricing will range from $169 to $249 USD, with the Ryzen 5 flagship 6C12T 1600X featuring a Precision Boost clock frequency up to 4.0GHz. After the disruption that Ryzen 7 has caused to the high-end prosumer market, taking on Intel’s vastly more expensive HEDT LGA 2011-3 processors, AMD is aiming to lay its stamp in the more popular sub-$300 segment. According to the Austin-based chip vendor, twice as many people choose CPUs at a sub-$300 price point than at higher levels. Simply put, AMD is trying to disrupt the sub-$300 processor landscape by putting 4C8T parts up against higher-clocked 2C4T Core i3 SKUs and 6C12T offerings against Intel’s 4C4T Core i5 range. In addition to Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), Ryzen 5 CPUs still have AMD’s SenseMI goodies baked in. That gives the chips access to features such as Precision Boost and Extended Frequency Range (XFR) that allow increased clock speeds under the relevant usage scenarios. Unsurprisingly, the processors also use the same AM4 platform as higher-end Ryzen 7 parts, making them compatible with the current crop of X370, B350, and A320 chipset motherboards, in addition to X300 and A300 offerings when they arrive. AMD is expecting Ryzen 5 chips to be paired with the more value-orientated B350 motherboards that still support overclocking, allowing Ryzen 5’s unlocked CPU frequency multiplier to be put to good use. Of course, there’s also no reason why the chips cannot be paired with a high-end X370 motherboard with a strong power delivery solution for enhanced overclocking.

Ryzen 5 1600X is the only 95W TDP part in the current Ryzen 5 line-up. This is a factor of its clock speeds which are as high as the flagship 8C16T Ryzen 7 1800X at 3.6GHz Base, 4.0GHz Boost, and probably 4.1GHz XFR (yet to be confirmed by AMD). The pair of 6C12T Ryzen 5 SKUs look to sandwich Intel’s 4C4T Core i5-7600K in terms of pricing. Ryzen 5 1500X is interesting as AMD confirmed in its briefing that the part will feature 200MHz of XFR headroom rather than the typical 100MHz for X-suffix SKUs. We asked AMD how the Ryzen 5 6C12T parts will be deployed from a design standpoint but we are yet to receive a reply. The six-core design will require two CPU Complexes (CCX) but AMD looks to have the option to disable one core per CCX or two cores on a single CCX. This choice may relate to yield of the four-core CCX modules or perhaps distribution of thermal energy within the die. Ryzen 5 six-core parts will have full access to the 8MB shared pool of L3 cache on each CCX, though the two disabled/removed cores will take their 512KB of L2 cache with them. This information is yet to be confirmed by AMD. Update 16/03/2017: AMD has confirmed to us that the Ryzen 5 six-core processors will be a 3+3 design both with the full total of 16MB L3 cache and 512KB L2 Cache per core (3MB in total). Depending on how the six-core chip is enabled, we may see a journey back to the old days for AMD users where there is an ability to unlock the disabled cores through the motherboard BIOS. That was a lot of fun for Phenom II users who could turn a dual- or tri-core into a full-fat quad. The 4C8T Ryzen 5 1500X and 1400 are likely to use a single CCX without the need for data transfer across the Infinity Fabric. This could aid performance, perhaps in gaming, where the latency penalty incurred by inter-CCX communications may be having a negative influence on performance. The four-core parts are likely to be equipped with 8MB of shared L3 cache and 512KB of L2 cache dedicated to each of the four cores. Update 16/03/2017: AMD has confirmed to us that the Ryzen 5 four-core processors will be a 2+2 design using a pair of CCX. Ryzen 5 1500X gets the full total of 16MB L3 cache (!) and 512KB L2 Cache per core (2MB in total). Whereas Ryzen 5 1400 gets 8MB of L3 cache and 512KB of L2 Cache per core (2MB in total). The dual CCX design will still rely upon Infinity Fabric for inter-CCX communications and data transfer. AMD will be bundling Wraith CPU coolers with the three 65W TDP Ryzen 5 parts. Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X get the same Wraith Spire that is bundled with the Ryzen 7 1700, though it does not feature the LED lighting of the Ryzen 7 version. We tested Wraith Spire with the Ryzen 7 1700 and found it to offer solid performance with capability for a moderate overclock. Wraith Stealth will be bundled with the Ryzen 5 1400 CPU. Ryzen 5 processors will launch and be available to buy on April 11th 2017. AMD also confirmed that Ryzen 3 is scheduled for the second half of 2017. KitGuru Says: Ryzen 5 is AMD’s weapon to shake up the sub-$300 processor market. With pricing that puts Ryzen 5 in competition with Core i3 and Core i5 CPUs, it will be interesting to see the performance on offer.

Add A Comment Pipeline statistics queries is the latest Vulkan capability being added to the Intel "ANV" Mesa Vulkan driver. Pipeline statistics queries allow applications to query a set of Vulkan pipeline counters. Developers interested in learning more about the feature can see the Vulkan documentation. Intel developer Jason Ekstrand sent out a set of 12 patches today, including an earlier patch by Ilia Mirkin for pipelineStatisticsQuery, for adding the necessary functionality to Intel ANV. The patches for review can be found on Mesa-dev. A benefit of the patches is that some bug fixes in them do fix rendering corruption for Intel with The Talos Principle. Besides pipeline statistics queries, other features ANV still has yet to implement in Mesa Git for device features are multi-draw indirect, depth bounds, shadow storage image multi-sample, shader storage image read without format, int16 shader support, shader resource min lod, variable multi-sample rate, and inherited queries.

Last year, Microsoft announced a shift in the way it would support Windows. Going forward, new processors, including Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's recently-released Ryzen, would require the newest version of Windows. Users of Windows 7 and 8.1 would be out of luck, with Microsoft having no plans to support the new chips on the old operating systems. Take note.

Microsoft no longer supports operating systems older than Windows 10 (because it's been out for so long now).     Microsoft is now gimping Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPUs on Windows 7/8.1, effectively forcing you to upgrade to Windows 10 - as they've thrown a processor check into the latest Windows Update for W7/8.1 - sneaky. This update prevents Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPU owners from downloading updates, with an error message that reads: "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows".   This doesn't mean Microsoft is completely throwing Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 away, it's only for the newer Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPU architectures. Microsoft is still issuing security patches to its older operating systems, but if you're rocking a new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K or Ryzen 7 1800X, you're done. Sorry, with no love, Microsoft.   NEWS SOURCES:Techspot.com Recommended for You Samsung to invest $7 billion in 7nm chips production... Qualcomm using Snapdragon 835 to dominate Helio X30...

Microsoft says it's blocking Windows 7, 8 patches on latest AMD, Intel chips Microsoft hasn't altered its earlier position, but it all seems a little harsh. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 17 March, 2017 10:00 0 - - - - print email When Microsoft said last year that it would restrict the latest Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Ryzen silicon to Windows 10, enthusiasts wondered what would happen if they tried running those PCs using Windows 7 or Windows 8. Now we know: no new patches. Word of a new Microsoft support document surfaced Thursday, applying the stick to those bold enough to try and pair an older Microsoft OS with the latest silicon. The upshot: Windows will block any updates from appearing on your PC until you upgrade to Windows 10. Specifically, you may see one of two error messages, Microsoft said: ”Unsupported Hardware: Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows  and you won’t receive updates.” ”Windows could not search for new updates An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error.” According to Microsoft, “This error occurs because new processor generations require the latest Windows version for support,” the document says. As Microsoft has stated before, those processor generations include Intel’s 7th-generation Core chips, AMD’s Bristol Ridge, or Ryzen, processors, and the Qualcomm 8996. Windows 10 is the only Microsoft OS supported on those chips, Microsoft said.  Microsoft representatives did not respond by press time when asked for comment. Why this matters: Unfortunately, Microsoft’s support document is entirely consistent with the stance the company has taken all along: that its most modern OS was built to go hand-in-hand with the capabilities of modern silicon. However, blocking Windows Update patches to those systems that use an older OS seems awfully draconian. Couldn’t Microsoft strive for some middle ground, such as a disclaimer that there might be some incompatibility? 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Following on from Microsoft's announcement of an expansion of their bug bounty program, it seems to be a good time to get into the bug bounty hunting business. The program is being run for Intel by HackerOne. Bugs are rated on a four-point scale ranging from Low to Critical severity across three areas - software, firmware and hardware. The smallest bounty on offer is for low severity issues found in software and firmware, with critical bugs in hardware good for a US$30,000 pay day.

Included are Intel seventh generation processors (Kaby Lake), AMD Bristol Ridge (Zen/Ryzen) and Qualcomm 8996. Users who see this message: "Unsupported Hardware. Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows  and you won’t receive updates", or this one: "Windows could not search for new updates. An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error", were told that they needed to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft said on its support forum: "This error occurs because new processor generations require the latest Windows version for support. For example, Windows 10 is the only Windows version that is supported on the following processor generations: Intel seventh (7th)-generation processors, AMD 'Bristol Ridge' and Qualcomm '8996'." And it added: "Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update." A Windows 10 upgrade reminder tends to be more important that the time of departure of your flight pic.twitter.com/nC3DvYzT2w — Kim Jong-potato (@rezedus) July 28, 2016 Microsoft said the issue could be resolved by upgrading to Windows 10. "We recommend that you upgrade Windows 8.1-based and Window 7-based computers to Windows 10 if those computers have a processor that is from any of the following generations: Intel seventh (7th)-generation "Intel Core" processor or a later generation; AMD seventh (7th)-generation ('Bristol Ridge') processor or a later generation; Qualcomm '8996' processor or a later generation." Last year, Microsoft tried several times, using methods that can only be described as devious, to force Windows users to upgrade to Windows 10 ahead of a 29 July 2016 deadline that it had set. In at least two cases, the company was forced to pay damages to users who went to court after they were forced into upgrades which they did not want. Reports say that take-up of Windows 10 has stalled after the 29 July 2016 deadline, with only about 400 million of an estimated 1.5 billion Windows users having upgraded.

REUTERS/Steve Marcus/Files 1/2 left right Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia speaks at the Nvidia keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking 2/2 By Georgina Prodhan | BERLIN BERLIN Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants. Chipmaker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. "Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles," he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany's Bosch, however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. "Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being," Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade. "No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving," said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. DEGREES OF AUTONOMY On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. "This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants," he wrote. But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. "We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable," he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber, Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia's Huang predicted those plans would speed up: "In the near future, you're going to see these schedules pull in."

The gaming-oriented chips are designed to undercut Intel's rival offerings by offering comparable performance at a much lower price, bringing competition back to PC components. AMD finally unveiled its highly-anticipated Ryzen processor range last month. At its original event, it only detailed the high-end Ryzen 7 chips, each of which have eight cores and are now on sale. Today, it launched the Ryzen 5 which will be available from this April. Although far from a like-for-like comparison, you can consider the gap between the Ryzen 5 and 7 as similar to Intel's long-standing Core i5 and i7 branding. Whereas the Ryzen 7 is focused on compute performance across a large number of threads, the Ryzen 5 is more aimed at general consumers looking for a competent processor for gaming and content creation. Four Ryzen 5 chips have been announced. At the top of the range is the 1600X and 1600, both of which are hexacore with 12 threads. They are followed by the 1500X and 1400, quadcore chips with a total of 12 threads. It's possible more options will arrive in the future, such as products to fill the gap between the 1400 and 1500X. Clock speeds vary across the range with the fastest chip being the 1600X. It has a base clock of 3.6GHz and can boost up to 4.0GHz when thermals allow. The 1600 has a substantially lower base clock of 3.2GHz and can boost to 3.6GHz. The quadcore 1400 and 1500X chips have base and boost clocks of 3.2 and 3.4 and 3.5 and 3.7 respectively. Rated power consumption is 65W across the board, with the exception of the 95W 1600X. AMD is pitching these chips at people looking for high-performance quadcore and hexacore processors at prices far lower than Intel's established offerings. The flagship 1600X will retail at $249, putting it against the quadcore Intel Core i5-7600K at $242. For just $7 more, AMD gives you two more cores and a 10MB larger cache, improving performance in multithreaded workloads. AMD Ryzen AMD However, clock speeds on the Ryzen 5 are lower than Intel chips across the board, suggesting gaming performance could be disappointing. AMD has already faced criticism for weak game benchmark scores with the Ryzen 7 series. While Ryzen gives you a chance to buy a strong processor on a much lower budget than Intel, it looks like it will also incur a gaming performance penalty. AMD says it's working on improving gaming performance but it's unclear when or how it will be able to raise the frame rates. In any case, Ryzen is still a much-needed rival to Intel's Core architecture, giving PC buyers more choice and driving down prices. "Ryzen will ultimately bring innovation and competition to virtually every segment of the PC market, and Ryzen 5 is the next big step on that journey, designed to achieve new levels of compute performance for millions of PC users," said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD. "AMD reinvigorated the high-performance desktop market with Ryzen 7 earlier this month, and AMD Ryzen 5 now brings the power and efficiency of the 'Zen' core to users in the highly popular sub-$300 segment of the market." The Ryzen 5 range will launch on April 11 at retailers worldwide. It's currently limited to desktop PCs and motherboards but AMD is also gearing up to give the chips a wider launch in other device form factors. Pricing is $169, $189, $219 and $249 for the 1400, 1500X, 1600 and 1600X respectively.

The program, announced at CanSecWest with HackerOne, enlists white hats all over the globe to hunt for bugs in their software, firmware and hardware. “We want to encourage researchers to identify issues and bring them to us directly so that we can take prompt steps to evaluate and correct them, and we want to recognize researchers for the work that they put in when researching a vulnerability,” the company said. “By partnering constructively with the security research community, we believe we will be better able to protect our customers.” Unsurprisingly, the harder a vulnerability is to mitigate, the more the chipmaker will pay. Intel said that it considers several factors when determining the severity of a vulnerability. The first step is to use the CVSS 3.0 calculator to compute a base score. The base score is then adjusted up or down based on the security objectives and threat model for the given product. For software, rewards can range up to $7,500; for firmware, up to $10,000; and for hardware, up to $30,000. Items that are not in the program scope include Intel Security (McAfee) products; third-party products and open source; and Intel’s web Infrastructure. Recent acquisitions also are not in-scope for the bug bounty program for a minimum period of six months after the acquisition is complete.

The Democratic side of the House Oversight Committee published the documents on Thursday, just more than a week after Flynn registered as a foreign agent of Turkey. RT, the Kremlin-controlled television network, paid $45,386 to Flynn Intel Group, Flynn’s consulting firm, for his appearance at an event held on Dec. 10, 2015, invoices reveal. Flynn, who retired from active duty in 2015, shared a table with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the gala, which was held in Moscow. The new documents also show that Flynn received a payment of $11,250 from Volga-Dnepr Airlines in August 2015 and a payment for the same amount in October of that year from Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. Volga-Dnepr, a Russian air carrier, was suspended as a contractor for the United Nations in 2007 over a corruption scandal. The fact that Flynn received payments from RT has previously been reported. But the other two payments, and the details of the arrangement with RT, had not been disclosed until Thursday.

Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS Though Flynn began advising the Trump campaign several months after the RT function, his appearance at the event fueled allegations that the Trump team was too soft on Putin. Along with releasing the documents, Democrats on the Oversight Committee are asking FBI director Jim Comey and Defense Sec. Jim Mattis whether Flynn disclosed his communications and financial arrangements with Russian and Turkish government officials during his security clearance process. Last week, Flynn registered retroactively with the Justice Department as a foreign agent of Turkey. Documents disclosed by Flynn Intel Group show it was paid $530,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch shell company whose owner is closely linked to the Turkish government. Flynn Intel contracted with Inovo BV last August but registered only with the U.S. Senate, which has less stringent disclosure requirements. The documents filed with the Justice Department showed that Flynn Intel was working on a project of great interest to the Turkish government. It is still not clear what prompted Flynn to register as a foreign agent for that work. In a statement, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, asserted that Flynn’s work for the Russian companies is an “apparent violation” of a clause in the Constitution which prohibits U.S. officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments or entities controlled by foreign governments. Flynn served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Obama before retiring. “I cannot recall any time in our nation’s history when the President selected as his National Security Advisor someone who violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy,” Cummings said. “I also cannot recall a time when the President and his top advisers seemed so disinterested in the truth about that individual’s work on behalf of foreign nations—whether due to willful ignorance or knowing indifference.” A spokesman for Flynn declined comment.

An Uber self-driving car is tested in Pittsburgh in this 2016 file photo. While there remains a general feeling of technological inevitability about self-driving vehicles, industry experts remain concerned about the shift’s looming logistical, legal and social ramifications.   (ANGELO MERENDINO / AFP/GETTY IMAGES file photo)   By Marco della CavaUSA Today Thu., March 16, 2017 AUSTIN, TEXAS—The cruise to autonomous transportation is alive, but first we’ve got to get past some roadblocks. That’s the takeaway from SXSW Interactive, the tech portion of the Texas confab that wrapped earlier this week and once again drew engineers, executives and lawmakers focused on steering society through a mobility revolution. While there remains a general feeling of technological inevitability about self-driving vehicles, industry experts remain concerned about the shift’s looming logistical, legal and social ramifications. “The vehicles will be ready by 2021, but will society?” said Bill Ford, chairman of Ford Motor, which along with a number of other automakers and tech companies have set roughly that date for the unveiling of a commercially viable self-driving car. Read more: Article Continued Below Big Three try to regain ground on self-driving cars Intel makes $14B (U.S.) push into self-driving technology with Mobileye Taking a peek into the self-driving future Interviews and SXSW lectures put a spotlight on a few big hurdles, which ranged from programming machines to have a heart to asking politicians to find consensus. Ford said those building the transportation of the future need to look at “the ethics of autonomy,” which includes how they direct vehicles to act in an emergency. “Who does the car hit, does the car try to save me?” he said. “And what happens if (car companies) made different decisions about that?” Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, raised the same question in his speech but added that these were philosophical questions that shouldn’t just be discussed among engineers. “These are questions for society at large, and we have to find general ethical agreements,” he said. “But we shouldn’t overstress this. It will be extremely unlikely these vehicles would have to weigh this dilemma often.” More than one million people die each year from traffic accidents. Autonomous car advocates argue the tech will drive that number down drastically. Still, warns Ford, public reaction in the face of “high-profile accidents” could cause consumers to lose faith in a tech that is eating up billions of dollars in research and development. Many cars on the road now, from Audis to Teslas, feature a range of camera, radar and laser sensors that provide driver-assist features, from lane-keeping to self-parking. But those sensors rely heavily on well-marked roads and good weather, which is why so-called high definition maps that provide digital scans of the world must make big strides to enable fully autonomous cars and trucks. “This is not easy stuff, rendering one building in a point cloud represents terabytes of data,” said Edzard Overbeek, CEO of HERE, a Berlin-based mapping company owned by Daimler, Audi and Mercedes-Benz that has partnerships with companies such as Nvidia and Intel-owned Mobileye. HERE has 400 vehicles out mapping roads around the world, but also processes data coming off sensors currently installed in millions of cars. The idea is that such geographical data can be crowdsourced and updated in real time. If a car ahead of you has just skidded on a patch of ice, that information would be relayed to both you and your vehicle. The competition in this space is intense. Alphabet’s Waymo has Google Maps. If Apple is indeed working on self-driving cars, it has its own mapping team. Uber has made hires to build out a mapping division. It remains to be seen if the result will be collaboration or chaos. “This is like the Internet’s early days, in that many well-intentioned companies will not survive because you need scale,” says Overbeek, whose company’s mapping system currently is in a majority of vehicles. “The competition will keep everyone on their toes.” Most autonomous car experts agree that if a brand new city were created tomorrow, it would be easy to create a mobility system filled with robotic vehicles packed with powerful vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (v2i) sensors. But the reality is far messier and includes the planet’s wide array of road conditions and human beings’ divergent views on how soon we need this tech. Crumbling infrastructures plague modern cities such as Los Angeles, while traffic chaos envelopes developing capitals such as New Delhi. Both would give computer-programmed machines a big headache. The artificial intelligence needed to power autonomous cars “has to advance a lot to cope with non-rule-based situations,” said Padmasree Warrior, CEO of Chinese-based car company NIO, which used SXSW to show off a sleek self-driving car it plans to roll out in 2020. While it’s fun to look at cars that tap into our sci-fi dreams, less fanciful engineering projects seems inherently more realistic. For example, automotive supplier Bosch is busy piloting a parking solution program with Mercedes in Stuttgart. Using existing front and rear bumper parking sensors to scan for empty curbside spots as cars pass them, Bosch is looking to create a system that could sending updated spot availability to a driver’s infotainment system. “In the next few years, you’re going to see more parking solutions offered up than complex freeway autopilot systems,” says Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch North America. “We are a ways off from all-weather, all-condition autopilot.” The NIO Eve, which drew steady crowds all weekend, is both futuristic and idealistic. Videos touting the benefits of this small den-on-wheels showed a woman knitting and even sleeping while her car battled traffic on the way to work. That reality is heavily dependent not just on big AI leaps, but also lawmakers pushing for its realization. “We had 25 mayors here this week, some who are attuned to these technological advancements but others are seeing some of this stuff for the first time,” said Austin mayor Steve Adler.

The report, commissioned by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, says, “Israel has established an apartheid regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole. On the basis of scholarly inquiry and overwhelming evidence, Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid. However, only a ruling by an international tribunal in that sense would make such an assessment truly authoritative." Not that surprisingly enough, the United States and European partners are outraged and have called for the withdrawal of the UN report. After all, they are all cut from the same imperial economics cloth, so much so that the UN’s top human rights division has even compiled an unprecedented blacklist of private companies doing business in occupied territories and illegal Israeli settlements. These organizations and companies refuse to pay attention to the global campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS), and they may not be the ones you would expect: Volvo: The automobile giant has been criticized by BDS campaigners for supplying equipment to bulldoze Palestinian homes. The Swedish automobile manufacturer also holds a 27% stake in Merkavim, whose buses are used to transport Palestinian prisoners to and from Israeli prisons. Hewlett Packard: The tech giant owns EDS Israel, which supplies the computer systems for Israeli military forces and produces hi-tech equipment like the Basel System that controls the movement of Palestinian workers through checkpoints in Gaza and the West Bank. Intel: Intel operates plants in Kiriyat Gat, site of the former Palestinian villages of al-Manshiya and Faluja. It was in the 1948-49 war that the residents of these villages were expelled, in line with Israel’s strategic plans. Motorola: The American telecommunications giant provides surveillance equipment around illegal settlements, along the Israeli-built separation barrier and the Gaza border. McDonald’s: The largest fast food chain in the world has longtime partnership with the Jewish United Fund. The Jewish United Fund works to maintain American military, economic and diplomatic support for Israel. Coca-Cola: Coca-Cola Israel owns dairy farms on the illegal settlements of Shadmot Mechola in the Jordan Valley and a plant in the industrial zone of Katzerin on the occupied Golan Heights. Danone: Close to 2 decades ago Danone opened its R&D facility in Israel – the Danone Institute. The French company also owns a 20% share of Israel’s second largest food company, the Strauss Group. Marks and Spencer: Since its beginning, M&S has been linked inextricably to Zionism. The fundamental objectives of the British company is to aid the economic development of Israel. Starbucks: The close relationship of this brand with Israel has been doing the rounds for quite some time. Nestle: The Swiss multinational has bought 51% shares in Osem investments. Osem Investments is directly engaged in the production and distribution of food products in Israel. In a flagrant violation of International Law, all these Western companies and organizations are implicated in Israel’s crimes against humanity and illegal settlement enterprise in occupied Palestinian territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Al-Quds. They are also a major obstacle to justice and peace in occupied Palestine and the broader region – by way of enabling and profiting from Israel’s theft of Palestinian land and other human rights violations. It is, therefore, long overdue for the United Nations and the international civil society to multiply cultural, economic and political pressure, and call on all states where these companies and organizations are operating to not recognize or provide assistance, economic or otherwise, to Israel’s illegal annexation, settlement policy, and apartheid regime. The international community should also call for sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel. Under International Law, all the UN-listed companies can and should immediately stop their dealings with the usurper regime and member states are to ensure that they do so. Additionally, investors and contractors, whether Western governments or private entities, should suspend military aid to Israel and avoid engagement with such companies and organizations until they end their illegal business dealings in occupied Palestine. The destruction of Israeli apartheid will not occur without a powerful, international movement dedicated to freedom for all Palestinians.         LATEST STORIES (9) Syria: ISIL, Turkish Army, Ankara-Backed Militants Leave Al-Bab in Ruins ISIL Suffers Heavy Casualties in Attack on Syrian Army Positions in Deir Ezzur Iraqi Soldiers' Battle with ISIL Continues in Western Mosul Yemeni People Protest in Sana'a against Al-Saud War Crimes Dire Conditions of Refugees in European Camps Syria: Dozens of People Killed in US Airstrike on Aleppo Mosque Yemeni People Protest against Saudi Arabia's War Crimes Mosul Liberation Operation: Iraqi Forces Patrolling in Newly Liberated Regions in Nineveh Province Paragliding in Iran A Story Not Told Often Enough: Unlike US, Iran Has Become an Exemplary Leader in Hosting Refugees Iran’s Boxers Settle for Third Place at 2017 Great Silk Way Afghan Provincial Police: 63 Militants Killed in Nangarhar Just in Past Week Man Shot Dead in Paris Airport Shooting Turkey Threatens to Send Europe '15,000 Refugees Each Month' WHO Warns of Counterfeit Saudi Medications Sent to Iraq Syria: ISIL, Turkish Army, Ankara-Backed Militants Leave Al-Bab in Ruins TEHRAN (FNA)- Syria has been mired in bloody war since March 2011, with Damascus forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad fighting numerous terrorist groups.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Skips Legal Challenge to President Trump's Latest Travel Ban | Main | Apple rewrites their 2011 Facial Recognition Patent Claims just as Rumors Point to this Feature coming to iPhone 8 » March 16, 2017 Apple Continues Work on Future Sports Oriented AirPods with Biometrics & Noise Cancellation Features   Apple began work on biometric sensors for both earbuds and for a wrist device back in 2007 as the iPhone was first being introduced. Apple's patent filing publicly surfaced in April 2009 and was granted in February 2014 – the very year that Intel introduced a similar idea of smart earbuds using their Jarvis digital assistant to control it while a user was active. Some of the graphics from Apple's granted patent are noted below. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a series of three patent applications all titled "Earbuds with Biometric Sensing." In Apple's patent filing they note that at least one of the biometric sensors within the earbud is configured to be pressed up against a portion of the ear known as the tragus that will allow the collection of biometric measurements. Beyond biometrics, the earbuds/AirPods could deliver noise cancellation features.    Apple's patent filing details how a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor could be added to the earbud so that it sits in a particular part of the ear called the tragus so that the device can monitor biometric data collected by the PPG sensor. The sensor measures biometric parameters by shining light and then measuring the reflectivity of that light off the skin. Variations in the reflectivity can be used to characterize profusion of the blood through the skin of a user.   Apple uses this technique in Apple Watch as well. Unfortunately, the exterior surface of a conventional earbud doesn't typically make sufficiently solid and/or consistent contact with a well-profused portion of the ear to provide reliable biometric parameter measurements. One solution to this problem is to arrange the PPG sensor along a surface of the earbud at an end of the earbud near a speaker opening of the earbud. In this way, when the speaker opening is aligned with the ear canal, the PPG sensor can contact an interior facing surface of the tragus of the ear. Contact between the interior facing surface of the tragus of the ear and the PPG sensor can be maintained by adding a compliant member to an opposing end of the earbud.   The compliant member can then engage an opposite surface of the ear known as the concha so that the earbud is wedged between two opposing surfaces of the ear. By choosing a compliant member formed of compressible or otherwise deformable material, the earbud can be well-suited to fit within the ears of a broad spectrum of users.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 noted below shows a cross-sectional view of an earbud device that includes a number of electrical components used to support the described device functionality; FIGS. 3A-3B show views of an earbud situated in the ear of a user and how a biometric sensor of the earbud contacts the tragus of the user.   Apple's patent FIG. 5B noted below shows how protrusion #504 can also include one or more electrical contacts #508. The figure also shows how the biasing member can be interchangeably removed from an earbud by way of a locking channel #506.   Apple's patent FIG. 11 noted above shows an earbud having a housing that defines multiple openings for receiving audio content at multiple microphones.   Beyond biometric measuring, the earbuds could provide noise cancellation by using one or more of the microphones. Apple notes that in some embodiments, the noise cancelling provided by earbud #1100 can be setup to provide selective noise cancelling which allows any audio received within the 10-20 degree window to be allowed through, while in other embodiments, substantially all audio can be screened out. In this way, during a conversation a person's own voice wouldn't prevent the speaker from being able to hear other speakers attempting to enter or participate in a conversation.   Biometric sensors associated with this device could include a range of sensors including a heart rate sensor, a VO2 sensor, a GSR (galvanic skin response) sensor, an electrocardiogram (EKG) sensor, an impedance cardiography (ICG) sensor and a temperature sensor.   Apple's patent applications 20170078780, 20170078781and 20170078785 were collectively filed on September 16, 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Apple's earlier work on this project covered a system that would also be able to work within a cyclist's helmet and also work with a head gesturing system to control your iPhone or iTunes while working out.   Interesting is the timing of today's biometric patents when a secondary patent filing published today covers new sensors for Apple Watch designed for cyclist activities. It's clear that Apple is approaching biometrics and advanced sensors for use across a wide range of products.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

At one point in the conversation, Trump apparently brought up the recent leaks of CIA spying methods when asked why he didn’t go the intelligence community to verify his claims, saying the following: And by the way, I just want people to know the CIA was hacked and a lot of things were taken. That was during the Obama years, that was not us, that was during the Obama situation. Well, it appears that the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee isn’t too thrilled with those comments. In a statement released today, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) claimed that the president may have disclosed classified information in that interview. .@POTUS appears to have discussed something that, if true & accurate, would be classified. Had it been anyone else he would call it a “leak” pic.twitter.com/XedWH4CTNF — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 16, 2017 As you can see, Schiff also hit Trump for doing something that he’s complained about over and over these past few months — leaking to the press.

Qualcomm doesn’t want you to call its Snapdragon processors ‘processors’ anymore Posted Mar 16, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Cubspot finds camps and classes for your wee ones Take note, tech writers: as of this morning, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors are no longer processors. Henceforth, the company would like you to refer to Snapdragon as a “platform.” In a post this morning, the San Diego-based chip – sorry processor – maker has detailed why it’s replaced one p-word with another. And why it thinks you ought to, too. “[Processor] is a word that Qualcomm Technologies has embraced over the years with our Snapdragon brand, or as we say — our Qualcomm Snapdragon processor,” the company writes in a post, dropping a couple of hard Ps to prove a point. “But the word is an inadequate representation of what the technology actually is, and the solutions that tens of thousands of Qualcomm Technologies innovators have worked on.” The piece goes on to explain that “processor” simply isn’t adequate to describe Snapdragon. And it’s true that the component company is doing a lot to shift with the times, working to cram more into its products, as it embraces AR and CR and drones and adds quick charging and biometrics to its products. But more than anything, the sentiment seems to prove that branding is hard – particularly if you make the stuff that’s inside the stuff that people buy. Rarely have companies been able to break out from that box. Intel was a rare exception in the 90s, with Intel Inside, a marketing success at a time when ingredient branding was really hitting its stride. Remember when people started caring what sort of artificial sweetener they used? The 90s were fun. Qualcomm is perhaps a bit on-edge. The company roundly trounced the competition in smartphone chip wars, and has actually had a pretty strong branding presence among early adopters who are as concerned about their device’s Snapdragon numbering as there are OS build. But lately more and more companies are looking to build chips in-house, in an attempt to stand out from the pack. And then, of course, there’s the whole anti-competitive dust up that has found the company at odds with Apple and a number of global governing bodies like the FTC. That’s the sort of news cycle that will get your behind-the-scenes brand name noticed by a non-techy audience. But, well, you don’t want the first thing potential customers hear about you to involve a dust up with the Federal Trade Commission. Of course, trading the term processor for platform isn’t going to change any of that. And in the company’s defense, this is a far subtler change than the millennial-bating, elementary school anti-smoking-style sketch presentation that was 2013’s “Born Mobile” campaign. And hey, there’s something to be said for the second half of this news, which drops “Snapdragon” from the company’s entry-level 200 series, opting instead for “Qualcomm Mobile.” That distinction can only help increase the cache of the company’s higher-end products. So good on the company for that. But Qualcomm, you’ve got a pretty solid branding proposition in the Snapdragon name on the high end. Unless you’re looking to start building your own branded phones (which is I assume gets brought up and shot down in every board meeting), you’ve already got the attention of the sort of people who purchase phones based on processor speed. So embrace the processor, Qualcomm. Live it, love it. Be the processor you want to see in the world. Hell, make processors great again. How’s that for a platform?

Enter the Ryzen 5. AMD vs. Intel: desktop CPUs Model Cores / Threads TDP L3 Cache Base Clock Turbo Clock XFR Memory Package Price AMD Ryzen 7 1800X 8 / 16 95W 16MB 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $499 AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8 / 16 95W 16MB 3.4GHz 3.8GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $399 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 8 / 16 65W 16MB 3.0GHz 3.7GHz 50MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $329 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 95W 16MB 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $249 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 / 12 65W 16MB 3.2GHz 3.6GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $219 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 65W 8MB 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 200MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $189 AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4 / 8 65W 8MB 3.2GHz 3.4GHz 50MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $169 On April 11, AMD will bring to bear the Ryzen 5 1400, 1500X, 1600 and 1600X. A key difference between these chips and the range toppers is the marketing choice to split Ryzen 5 into four- and six-core models. Ryzen 5 1400 and 1500X will both use the established four-core, eight-thread architecture common on current Intel chips. As we already know all Ryzen chips are unlocked, the pair are split on base and boost frequencies, with R5 1400 chiming in at 3.2GHz base and 3.4GHz boost while 1500X increases this to 3.5GHz and 3.7GHz, respectively. What AMD is not disclosing know is exactly how these Ryzen 5 chips are built from a CCX point of view, though it would make sense that the four-core part is one CCX paired with 8MB of L3 cache. All but the R5 1600 X will arrive at retail with coolers in the box. You may have heard of AMD releasing a slew of new heatsinks alongside the Ryzen launch, so the R5 1400 gets the Wraith Stealth while R5 1500X and R5 1600 receive the beefier Spire. We'd argue it is far more important for AMD's bottom line to ensure that Ryzen 5 is successful against a host of Intel chips - each company will undoubtedly sell more of these than $300-plus models. With that in mind, here is how the quarter line up against the price equivalent chips from Intel's current Kaby Lake stable. AMD vs. Intel price comparison AMD Price Intel AMD Ryzen 5 1600X (6 / 12) $249/$243 Intel Core i5-7600K (4 / 4) AMD Ryzen 5 1600 (6 / 12) $219/$213 Intel Core i5-7600T (4 / 4) AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (4 / 8) $189/$192 Intel Core i5-7500 (4 / 4) AMD Ryzen 5 1400 (4 / 8) $169/$168 Intel Core i3-7350K (2/4) AMD offers more threads at each price point, replicating what Ryzen 7 has done at the higher end of the spectrum. Gaming performance is still up in the air, especially as each chip is using SMT, so we will only have a truer picture once the chips are benchmarked and reviewed. Until then, has Ryzen 5 piqued your interest enough? Update: 11:00 AMD has confirmed that all Ryzen 5 CPUs are Ryzen 7 chips that have been symmetrically disabled, so 3+3 across two CCXes for the six-core part, and 2+2 across the same two CCXes for the four-core part. As they are based on the Ryzen 7, AMD has chosen to imbue the six-core part with the full 16MB L3 cache whilst the four-core part gets 8MB.

QOTW: How many cores/threads does your desktop CPU have?

Register today! Posted by Bagpuss - Thu 16 Mar 2017 08:41 From a marketing perspective wouldn't it be better for AMD to pitch the 1600X as it's answer to the 7700K? A 6C 12T 1600X for £250 would look & sound a lot better to a potential buyer than a 4C 4T 7700K for £330. Okay, the 1600X will still lose in single threading performance but those 50% extra cores and threads will still ensure better performance in most multi threaded apps and games or where the 7700K's slightly better IPC & much higher clock speeds will at best only match the 1600X in such tasks. I've always seen these 6 core parts as the proper rival to the 7700K, not the 1700, as AMD seem to pitch. Posted by Kanoe - Thu 16 Mar 2017 08:43 From a commercial point of view it would be better for AMD if the 6 core chips could be 4+2, 3+3 or 2+4 parts as it would enable them to use more of the ones that didn't make the 8 core grade during manufacture. However, because of infinity fabric connecting the CCX's being a bit of a bottleneck I can't see them being able to do so cause the 4+2 chips would perform differently to the 3+3 chips under heavy loads. Posted by this_is_gav - Thu 16 Mar 2017 09:00 I think the 6-core on will tempt me. I'd like more cores than my current i7 4790K but without losing too much in the way of clockspeed for older applications. I don't currently do enough multi-threaded tasks for R7 to be worth the extra. With regards to marketing, wouldn't it have made far more sense for AMD to go down this route: R4=4 core (and it's bigger than i3) R6=6 core (and it's bigger than i5) R8=8 core (and it's bigger than i7) Did they want to avoid the unlucky number 4 in China that much?

Posted by Brian224 - Thu 16 Mar 2017 09:32 Marenghi What have I missed with the most expensive CPU not including a stock cooler?The 1600X has nearly 50% more heat to dissipate, little point charging the consumer for an inadequate cooler. Having said that my I5 2500K (also 95W) came with a cooler although it only proved useful as a paperweight (and a great way to test the buzzer on my PC when running multi-threaded applications).

Intel CEO: “We Think Of Ourselves As Israeli Company As Much As US Company” By Aussie Dave - March 16, 2017 0 284 92shares 88 3 0 0 0 1 Photo credit: CHAIM ZACH / GPOFollowing news of Intel’s $15 billion plans to acquire Israeli company Mobileye, their CEO, Brian Krzanich had this to say at a press conference a few nights ago: “We think of ourselves as an Israeli company as much as a US company,” Krzanich said at a Jerusalem press conference on Tuesday evening at the Prime Minister’s Office. Of course, even before news of this acquisition, it was true that Israel has been responsible for much of Intel’s core processor chip development. But Brian Krzanich’s statement above serves as a great reminder to the BDS-holes out there that they are doing it all wrong if they purchase or have purchased any of the below products (click on the icons).

"Probably the most infamous was ‘Der Stűrmer’ by the anti-Semite Julius Streicher who claimed that ‘Der Stűrmer’ was Hitler’s favourite read.

With the announcement of its new Zen-based Ryzen line of processors, however, AMD is pushing back hard. The first line of the series, the Ryzen 7, was squarely aimed at hard-core gamers and professionals. The Ryzen 5 line, on the other hand, is targeting the mainstream, bringing the same key features of the Zen architecture, but with lower clock speeds and a matching lower price tag. It’s a numbers game when it comes to Ryzen, with AMD competing with Intel on the number of cores and threads. Specifically, AMD is offering equal or sometimes more cores that also include Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), whereas equivalent Intel processors sometimes have no hyperthreading. In practice, AMD Ryzen shines brightest when it comes to multi-threaded processing, able to hold out on its own or even surpass Intel chips at the same price tier. However, it has been largely observed that Ryzen does not actually do well in single thread performance, giving Intel an edge when it comes to programs and games that rely heavily on one or two threads only. The AMD Ryzen 5 line is made up of four models, two of which have 6 course with 12 threads while the other two have four cores and four threads. Compared to the Ryzen 7 line, the Ryzen 5 processors are clocked lower, resulting in lower TDP. That is, except for the Ryzen 5 1600X which, surprisingly, matches the base and turbo speeds, as well as TDP, of the highest Ryzen 7 1800X. The AMD Ryzen 5 will launch 11th April, available from etailer worldwide. With both the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 fully revealed, all that’s left is to wait for word on the Ryzen 3 series that is expected to target the lower tier PC market.

(AFP) Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order. A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump’s first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk. Airbnb Inc, Dropbox Inc and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief. Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft Corp, eBay Inc, Intel Corp, Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc. The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump’s executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary. Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson’s order “unprecedented judicial overreach.” Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump’s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February. It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the “friend-of-the-court” brief this time around. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said. Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position. A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump’s initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment. Representatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. tags Apple Google Facebook Donald Trump US travel ban more from business Builders reducing size of housing units to improve affordability for homebuyers Mar 18, 2017 19:01 IST Millennials stay put with their parents because buying a home is expensive Mar 18, 2017 18:56 IST Wake up before the next question Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

(NASDAQ: INTC) announced Monday morning a definitive agreement to acquire Mobileye N.V. (NASDAQ: MBLY) for $63.54 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $15.3 billion. Mobileye, an Israel-based maker of systems for autonomous driving vehicles, came public in August 2014 in an initial public offering (IPO) at $25 a share, and the stock reached an all-time high of more than $60 a share in July of 2015. Intel’s offer represents a premium of 34% to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday, and the Israeli company’s shares rose about 32% in Monday’s premarket session. Since its IPO, Mobileye’s fortunes have bounced around. Shortly before hitting its all-time high share price, the company announced that it was ending its relationship with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) in 2018 with the release of Mobileye’s EyeQ4 sensor system. In April of last year, short-seller Citron Research issued a report on Mobileye valuing the stock at $11 a share, based on its view that commoditization had arrived in the autonomous driving sector and that competitor NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) had arrived at a solution that did not require the complex Mobileye technology. At the time that Mobileye announced its divorce with Tesla, it also announced the formation of a deal with Intel and BMW, creating a partnership to get self-driving cars on the road. Here’s a clip from that announcement: BMW Group, Intel, and Mobileye are convinced that automated driving technologies will make travel safer and easier. The goal of the collaboration is to develop future-proofed solutions that enable the drivers to not only take their hands off the steering wheel, but reach the so-called “eyes off” (level 3) and ultimately the “mind off” (level 4) level transforming the driver’s in-car time into leisure or work time. This level of autonomy would enable the vehicle, on a technical level, to achieve the final stage of traveling “driver off” (level 5) without a human driver inside. This establishes the opportunity for self-driving fleets by 2021 and lays the foundation for entirely new business models in a connected, mobile world. As carmakers and technology companies race for position in developing autonomous driving technologies, Monday’s move by Intel is an attempt to get in on a fundamental element of the technology. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said: Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. The acquisition is expected to close within nine months, and Intel’s autonomous driving group will continue to be based in Jerusalem under the leadership of Mobileye’s co-founder, chairman and chief technical officer, Professor Amnon Shashua. Intel expects the deal to be immediately accretive to earnings. Mobileye’s stock traded up about 30% at $61.50 Monday morning, in a 52-week range of $33.09 to $51.15. Intel’s shares traded down about 1.4%, at $35.42 in a 52-week range of $29.50 to $38.45.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (10) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Setapp: Explore a universe of apps for just $9.99 per month!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

(Image Credit: AMD) Shares175 DNA Web Team | Thu, 16 Mar 2017-10:27am , Mumbai , DNA webdesk The desktop processors go up against Intel’s mid-range parts, aiming to offer more bang for the buck AMD announced their new range of ‘Ryzen 5’ processors, which will be available globally starting 11 April. The 4-processor lineup include two variants: a pair of 6-core,12-thread versions and a pair of 4-core, 8-thread versions. The prices of the processors are Rs 18,199 (for the AMD Ryzen 1600X), Rs 15,799 (Ryzen 1600), Rs 13,799 (Ryzen 1500X), and Rs 12,199 (Ryzen 1400). Based on the company’s new Zen architecture, the processors are targeted at enthusiasts, gamers, and high-performance applications. This launch follows on the heels of the company’s recently-announced higher-end Ryzen 7 processors. “Ryzen will ultimately bring innovation and competition to virtually every segment of the PC market, and Ryzen 5 is the next big step on that journey, designed to achieve new levels of compute performance for millions of PC users,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD. “AMD reinvigorated the high-performance desktop market with Ryzen 7 earlier this month, and AMD Ryzen 5 now brings the power and efficiency of the “Zen” core to users in the highly popular sub-$300 segment of the market.” All Ryzen processors support the new AM4 motherboard platform, with products being offered from brands like ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, and MSI. Also bundled with select AMD Ryzen 5 processors are a new range of coolers from the company’s new ‘Wraith’ range: the Wraith Spire and the Wraith Stealth. These uniquely styled heatsink/fan combinations are designed to provide near-silent operation while keeping the processor thermally safe even during intensive applications such as gaming and professional image and video editing.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC-GAMING AMD will launch four mainstream Ryzen desktop processors on April 11 Dean Takahashi@deantak March 15, 2017 9:55 PM Tags: Advanced Micro Devices, Amd, desktop processors, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7 Above: AMD Ryzen 5 Image Credit: AMD Advanced Micro Devices said it is launching four Ryzen 5 mainstream desktop processors worldwide on April 11. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company hopes the chips will help it steal some market share back from Intel, the world’s largest chip maker. Earlier this month, AMD launched its Ryzen 7 high-end desktop processors. The Ryzen family is based on Zen, a new core architecture that enables AMD to deliver 52 percent more performance per clock cycle than its previous generation of chips. Zen is AMD’s most competitive technology in a decade, and it will boost computing performance for consumers on everything from mainstream desktops to high-end gaming PCs. AMD said the Ryzen 5 processors are aimed at the high-volume, sub-$300 central processing unit (CPU) market with a disruptive price-to-performance ratio for gamers and creators. According to market researcher Mercury Research, 95 percent of all CPUs sold last year were less than $225. “MSI is very pleased to see overwhelming demand of the Ryzen-based X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium and B350 Tomahawk motherboard. We have geared up for immediate production ramp,” said Ted Hung vice president MB sales division at MSI, a major Taiwanese manufacturer, in a statement. The Ryzen 5 processors have either four cores or six cores and either eight threads or 12 threads. The prices on the chips range from $169 to $249. “Ryzen will ultimately bring innovation and competition to virtually every segment of the PC market, and Ryzen 5 is the next big step on that journey, designed to achieve new levels of compute performance for millions of PC users,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of the computing and graphics group at AMD, in a statement. “AMD reinvigorated the high-performance desktop market with Ryzen 7 earlier this month, and AMD Ryzen 5 now brings the power and efficiency of the “Zen” core to users in the highly popular sub-$300 segment of the market.” AMD showed off the Ryzen 5 chips at an event in Beijing, China. Previously, AMD demonstrated the Ryzen 5 1600X beating the Intel Core i5 7600K by 69 percent in CPU performance testing using the Cinebench R15 nT benchmark. With the announcement of the Ryzen 5 lineup, AMD reiterated its commitment to delivering excellent gaming performance to ensure existing and future game titles take full advantage of Ryzen. “We are impressed by the technological evolution enabled by the Zen architecture, which was designed to keep pace now and well into the future as gaming, eSports and virtual reality experiences continually push the limits of devices,” said Vlatko Andonov, president of Bethesda Softworks, in a statement. “Working with an all-new microarchitecture, like that in the Ryzen family of processors, means that everyone has the opportunity to raise their game and bring the very best interactive experiences to players. All of us at Bethesda are excited about working with AMD to keep evolving the premium performance that Ryzen offers.” All Ryzen processors support the new AM4 infrastructure, with motherboard designs being produced from top ODMs. Announced at CES 2017, AMD and its motherboard partners already debuted a wide array of new motherboards from ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, and MSI, all built upon the following desktop chipsets for AMD Ryzen processors – the X370, B350 and the A320, the latter intended for mainstream PCs at new, consumer-friendly price points.

The House Intelligence Committee has asked the Trump administration to provide evidence of the wiretapping claim — which Trump made last weekend — by Monday. But Schiff said he doesn't expect to see any.  "There are one of two possibilities here," Schiff told ABC News' "This Week" on Sunday.  "Either the president, quite deliberately for some reason, made up this charge, or perhaps more disturbing, the president really believes this," Schiff said. "And here's where I think it's consequential: If, six months from now, the president should say that Iran is cheating on the nuclear agreement. If he's making that up, it's a real problem. If he's not making it up, and it's true, it's an even bigger problem, because the question is, would people believe him?"  Schiff added that he expects the matter to be resolved after FBI Director James Comey appears before the House Intelligence Committee next week.  "I think on March 20, if not before, we'll be able to put this to rest," Schiff said. "But I don't think anyone really has any question about this. The only question is why the president would make up such a thing."  Also Sunday, on CBS News' "Face The Nation," House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged that he hasn't seen any evidence to back up Trump's claim.  Paul Ryan, who has met with Comey, says he has seen no evidence to back up Trump's wiretap claims pic.twitter.com/9s57ZgrJlZ — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 12, 2017 Advertisement Become a patron of breaking LGBTQ news Chip in $4 go tags: News, Donald Trump, Adam Schiff Advertisement Become a patron of breaking LGBTQ news Chip in $4 go Advertisement David Recommends NCRM's Official Statement on Donald Trump The best of NCRM, delivered straight to your inbox Optional email code More from around the web Be part of the movement.

The logical step down for more mainstream folks is the Ryzen 5 series of chips. AMD revealed two of those parts—the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1500X—alongside the Ryzen 7 family, and today we're learning more about a new pair of Ryzen 5 CPUs that complete the midrange tier of AMD's new processor lineup. Model Cores Threads Base clock Boost clock XFR TDP Price Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 GHz 4.0 GHz Yes 95W $249 Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 GHz 3.6 GHz 65W $219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.7 GHz $189 Ryzen 5 1400 3.2 GHz 3.4 GHz $169 At the top of the range, the Ryzen 5 1600X is joined by the Ryzen 5 1600. The 1600X will likely be pitted against Intel's entry-level six-core CPU, the Core i7-6800K. The aggressively-clocked 1600X boasts what AMD calls a "full" XFR range, although the company says the definition of "full" isn't being revealed at this time, and our guess is that it could vary from chip to chip in this lineup. Of the Ryzen 5 CPUs being announced today, the 1600X is the only one that will slot into a 95W TDP. Meanwhile, the modestly-clocked Ryzen 5 1600 retains XFR, but it likely won't benefit as much as its sibling from a bigger cooler on top.  That chip puts an impressive six cores and 12 threads into a trim 65W thermal envelope. Most builders are used to four cores and eight threads from Intel's $300+ Core i7 CPUs, but AMD is taking four Zen cores with SMT under $200 with the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. The Ryzen 5 1500X will boast 200 MHz of XFR headroom on top of its already-appealing base speeds, and it'll retain the unlocked multiplier common to all Ryzen CPUs. Whether that's enough to match or outpace the potent Core i5-7500 at $205 will be an interesting question as we approach review time. At the base of the lineup, the Ryzen 7 1400 offers what could be an impressive level of multithreaded performance and unlocked multipliers for about $25 less than the Core i5-7400. AMD will include unilluminated versions of its Wraith Spire cooler with the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500X, while the Ryzen 5 1400 will get the more modest Wraith Stealth heatsink. In response to questions about whether it would offer RGB LED-illuminated versions of these coolers separately, AMD said that builders who want the blinkenlights will need to shell out for a Ryzen 7 chip. As the enthusiast-class six-core chip in this lineup, the Ryzen 5 1600X will sell as a bare processor only. Some mysteries remain about the Ryzen 5 lineup. AMD didn't answer my questions about CCX arrangements for these parts, although the wide XFR boost range the company let slip for the Ryzen 5 1500X suggests that only one CCX may be underneath four-core Ryzens' heat spreaders. We also don't know these chips' cache arrangements just yet. All will be revealed soon enough, as AMD says the entire Ryzen 5 family will hit store shelves April 11.

Everything The Walking Dead What's New on Netflix: Movies and Shows Added This Month Today’s News The Voice: A (Not Very) Scientific Breakdown of How Adam, Alicia, Gwen and Blake Chose Their Teams by Malcolm Venable | Mar 15, 2017 8:37 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Pinterest Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp Let the games begin! The Voice's blind auditions are over, and the 48 contestants now battling for the top spot in the 12th season of NBC's vocal showdown are in place. The four coaches now each have a dozen people on their squads -- folks who'll now be belting out their best "Ooh baby oohs" in the battle rounds, which start Monday. That's when the coaches will pit two of their own team members against each other in "dueling duets" (which sounds like something you wanna safeguard antsy pets from) to choose who's strongest. It's also when we'll start to see advisors: DJ Khaled (with Alicia Keys); John Legend (for team Adam Levine); Luke Bryan (for Blake Shelton) and Celine Dion (for Gwen Stefani's team). Before all that gets underway though, we thought we'd take a step back and see exactly how these teams -- the full lineups for each of which are below -- came to be. All the coaches have their own distinct styles in selecting artists; here's a very unscientific assessment of their approaches. The Voice: The 6 best performances from the Season 12 premiere Adam Levine, The Voice Adam Levine Persona: Your Long Lost Bro Intel: Always ready with a wisecrack -- and the sense that there's a vape pen and/or a brewski under his chair -- Adam makes his charges feel like he'll swoop them up in a loving headlock and impart cool-guy knowledge like how to sing so girls (or boys) will like you. So far this season, Adam has tended to overcompensate for being passed over for other coaches, which only ramps up the intensity of his hard-yet-appealing sales pitches. It's from a good place though: Very fond of singers with soul and/or an edge, Adam projects a sensitivity and sense of caring that feels really genuine. He's a big bro with a heart. Motto: "Dude! No, seriously. Dude." Hallmarks: Upbeat compliments, cute self-depreciation Best attribute: Gushing over singers he likes and offering encouragement Weakness: Blake, and whining about losing out to Blake Greatest success story: Billy Gilman, Season 11's outstanding 2nd place winner Full team: Taylor Alexander Gaby Borromeo Sheena Brook Malik Davage Kawan DeBose Hanna Eyre Johnny Hayes Mark Isaiah Jesse Larson Julien Martinez Nala Price Josh West Alicia Keys, The Voice Alicia Keys: Persona: Earth Mother Intel: Practically radiating patchouli and a quiet hum from lots of meditation, Alicia conveys a kind of ever-present calm -- and a sense that she knows exactly what she's looking for in a member of her team. She tends to gravitate toward singers whose voices convey the sense that this isn't their first time here -- not The Voice, mind you, but life itself -- and are receptive to her advice on how to use music to become fully enlightened. Motto: "Show me your soul!" Hallmarks: Verbal hugs, actual hugs, really deep advice about being true to yourself Best attribute: Reminding contestants that they're unique, special and have a story to share Weakness: Defaulting to singers close to her R&B/soul wheelhouse Greatest success story: Wé McDonald, the New York teenager she helped get to the finals in Season 11 Full team: Chris Blue Jack Cassidy RJ Collins Vanessa Ferguson Lauryn Judd Lilli Passero Hunter Plake Missy Robertson Quizz Swanigan Felicia Temple Autumn Turner Anatalia Villaranda Gwen Stefani, The Voice Gwen Stefani: Persona: Ms. Most Popular Intel: Gwen Stefani is flawless and she knows it; her singular blend of squeaky peppiness, glamour and yes, extensive music knowledge obtained over decades (she's 47!) is unsurpassed. As vast as her education in music is though, Gwen more than anything seems to be seeking people a lot like her: confident, not easily defined and looking to have a good time. Which is not to say seriousness about the competition isn't important to her. She's discerning, for sure, but folks who don't have skills, swagger and sunshine in their voices aren't going to hang out with The Voice's version of the cheerleading squad captain. Motto: "We could have so much fun together!" Hallmarks: Charm, big smiles, being gorgeous Best attributes: Versatility/experience across multiple genres including pop, punk, ska and hip-hop Weakness: Blake Shelton Greatest success story: Nabbing this season's frontrunner JChosen Full team: Jozy Bernadette J Chosen Johnny Gates Savannah Leighton Davina Leone Kenny P Troy Ramey Stephanie Rice Aaliyah Rose Brandon Royal Caroline Sky Sammie Zonana Blake Shelton, The Voice Blake Shelton: Persona: The Wise, Sneaky Owl Intel: Blake's goofy Southern charm act is a cover for his cunning -- and his gift for being able to quickly hear (and get) some of the strongest competitors in the game. That's not always due to his talent-scouting ability -- nor his comfort recognizing talent across country, soul, rock and more. Blake is not above using some tricks to get people for his team -- as he did earlier in Season 12's blind auditions when he snatched contestant Enid Ortiz from other coaches' clutches at the last minute. His approach clearly works: of the current lineup of coaches, he's won the most at five times. Motto: "You want to win, right? Hallmarks: Dispensing wisdom, laid-back nonchalance Best attributes: Southern gentility, ability to annoy Adam without trying Weakness: Mind games and dirty tricks that undermine his superiority Greatest success story: Sundance Head, his most recent winner, from Season 11 Full team: Brennley Brown Dawson Coyle Lauren Duski Josh Hoyer Casi Joy Ashley Levin Aliyah Moulden Enid Ortiz Valerie Ponzio Andrea Thomas Micah Tryba TSoul The Voice airs Monday and Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC.

(NASDAQ: INTC) is continuing its strategy of investing in data-intensive market opportunities that build into the firm’s strengths in computing, connectivity and the cloud. The company recently announced that it aims to acquire Israeli tech firm Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY). Although many see this in a positive light and as a natural expansion for Intel going forward, one key analyst slashed its price target on Intel and downgraded the stock. Credit Suisse downgraded Intel to a Neutral rating from Outperform and lowered its price target to $35 from $45. Although the firm did maintain its calendar 2017 and 2018 earnings per share (EPS) estimates of $2.80 and $2.95, respectively. The consensus estimates call for EPS of $2.80 in 2017 and $2.93 in 2018. The brokerage firm ultimately likes the strategic rationale behind the Mobileye acquisition. While expensive, Intel is buying a market leader with above corporate average margins and a potential long-term total addressable market that is multiples of the purchase price. However, Credit Suisse is struggling with an investment horizon inside of Intel that is not compatible with most of its clients, and the Mobileye transaction serves to highlight the difference. While the brokerage firm applauds management for using a stable core franchise in Client Computing Group and Data Center Group to invest in future growth, the lack of emphasis on near-term operating margin creates a growing “opportunity cost” for investors. The firm made sure to say that this recent spending spree is not a sign of management “running scared.” Credit Suisse believes that Intel will be able to use its utility/stability of PCs, among other things, to provide durable cash flows to make larger riskier investments with longer payback. In the report, Credit Suisse’s John Pitzer detailed: While it is still too early to pick the winners in HAV and FAV (Highly Autonomous and Fully Autonomous Vehicles), the depth and breadth of resources and IP an Intel/Mobileye combination represents surely places them in the pole position. In addition, while Mobileye has a decidedly vision-centric view of HAV/FAV, Intel’s complete system will also leverage other sensing technologies like RADAR and LIDAR and be able to provide from entry level to high end and from end device to cloud solutions. More importantly, while the endpoint might be out 10 plus years, HAV/FAV is likely to be a sizeable total addressable market. Shares of Intel were trading down 0.7% at $34.94 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $40.34 and a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 17 March 2017 | MYT 9:47 AM Car industry players diverge on timescale for self-driving cars Optimistic or hopeful?: Jen-Hsun believes that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. — Reuters BERLIN: Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants. Chipmaker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's US$15bil (RM66.5bil)  deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. "Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles," he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany's Bosch, however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. "Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being," Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence – teaching computers to learn to write their own software code – for a decade. "No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving," said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. Degrees of autonomy On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five – full autonomy – as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. "This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants," he wrote. But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. "We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable," he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber , Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia's Huang predicted those plans would speed up: "In the near future, you're going to see these schedules pull in." —  Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Many top SPM scorers feel crushed Prostitution to redemption: A farm girl’s journey Inflation: Friend or foe?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft mercy killing Windows 7 by banning it from latest Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors 3 by Surur  @mspoweruser Mar 17, 2017 at 0:37 GMT2 days ago Microsoft has made true on their earlier promise to not support the popular Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on the latest generation of Intel and AMD processors. Users who have installed Windows 7 on these brand-new machines have been met by a warning message when trying to use Windows Update, saying: “Unsupported Hardware […] Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” Microsoft has argued that new processors work much better with a new OS, and it did not make sense to update a nearly 10 year old OS to support the latest technology. With 47% of the world on Windows 7, and given that Windows 10 was given away for free for a year, many are presumably reluctant to change to anything else, and Microsoft is running into the same issues as they experienced with the huge legacy installed base of Windows XP, which even today has 8% market share,  16 years after its release. Windows 7 left mainstream support in January 2015, meaning Microsoft is only liable for security updates to the OS at present. Microsoft warned users of their plans in January 2016 and again in August 2016, but this has not stopped Windows 7 fans from grousing and threatening to switch to Linux.

"The big-time portfolio managers don't see any real strength in consumer spending," Cramer said. "They're just baffled because they know that employment is way up and more hiring is supposed to translate into much better than expected service revenues." The "Mad Money" host said the answer is simple, and it's hiding right under money managers' noses. Cramer said consumers are chained to two things: their phones and their couches. Cramer argued that rather than spending money in traditional venues, consumers are dishing out large chunks of their paychecks on smartphone payments. As a result, most of their purchases become tied to their phones, which they use to order food, shop online, play games, stream content, and browse social media. "If you follow that trail you'll know the consumer hasn't gone away. She's just not being counted because she's hiding right in front of your nose, in the last place the professional money managers would think to look," Cramer said. Jose Luis Pelaez | Getty Images Cramer also took a look at some tech titans that have been finding their footing in their fast-growing sector, focusing on Oracle and its push into the cloud. "It's Oracle's turn to be hailed as a changed company that's accelerating its cloud business and migrating its existing customers, while aggressively poaching clients from its competitors," Cramer said. But Oracle's not the only one making breakthroughs in tech – it is joined by Intel, Cisco, and Microsoft as the giants reassert their dominance in the space by ramping up innovation in big ways. "Oracle, Cisco, Intel and Microsoft, the old four horsemen of the tech apocalypse, are coming back," Cramer said. "They had all slipped up. But they always preserved their balance sheets, they always recruited smart people, and they always were competitive. Now they're back, and all four of their stocks are buys." Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images Delivery trucks sit parked at loading docks outside the Fastenal Co. distribution center in Jessup, Pennsylvania. One Trump-related buy that caught Cramer's eye this week was manufacturer Fastenal, a maintenance, repairs, and operation supplies distributor that has blown up since the election. Cramer attributed Fastenal's recent success to a few trends: industrial production and manufacturing orders picking up, deregulation coming from Washington, and manufacturing inventories getting smaller, which could give Fastenal more pricing power "This is more than just a Trump stock," Cramer said. "It's a metaphor for exactly what's working in this economy right now, and I have to say that I like it." Fred Thornhill | Reuters A seamstress for Canada Goose, pieces together outerwear on the manufacturing floor of the company's facility in Toronto. And as the economy improves, more and more companies warm to the idea of going public — like Thursday's Canada Goose IPO, which marked the second-biggest IPO of 2017 so far. Cramer spoke about the high-end outerwear producer, saying there's much more in the pipeline for Canada Goose than expensive winter wear, pointing to the company's reputable brand, commitment to quality, and various growth opportunities. "Combine all of this info … and you've got a company with accelerating revenue growth, rising margins, and genuine profitability, a powerful winning combination that we rarely see among new IPOs. If Canada Goose can keep executing like this then I wouldn't be at all surprised if the stock ends up having more upside," Cramer said. In Cramer's lightning round, he touted two caller favorite stocks: Wells Fargo & Co: "We like Wells Fargo, especially every single time when they reveal that they might be clawing back something from all that mess that happened. They did that today. Best-performing bank stock, [my] charitable trust owns it." National Oilwell Varco: "I think that when this GE-Baker Hughes deal is done, the first thing they do is they buy National Oilwell Varco. I want you to hold onto it."

Home Industry Car industry players diverge on timescale for self-driving cars Car industry players diverge on timescale for self-driving cars Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants. By: Reuters | Berlin | Published: March 17, 2017 3:36 AM Chief Executive Jens-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants. Chipmaker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world’s top chipmaker after Intel’s $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jens-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. “Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we’ve really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles,” he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany’s Bosch, however, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. You may also like to watch: “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being,” Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence – teaching computers to learn to write their own software code – for a decade. “No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving,” said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia’s processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. DEGREES OF AUTONOMY On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five – full autonomy – as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. “This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,” he wrote. But Nvidia’s Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers’ cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. “We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable,” he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber, Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia’s Huang predicted those plans would speed up: “In the near future, you’re going to see these schedules pull in.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Chipmaker Nvidia <NVDA.O>, facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's <INTC.O> $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye <MBLY.N> this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. "Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles," he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany's Bosch [ROBG.UL], however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. "Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being," Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualization and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade. "No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving," said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. DEGREES OF AUTONOMY On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla <TSLA.O> ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. "This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants," he wrote. But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW <BMWG.DE> told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. "We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable," he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber [UBER.UL], Baidu <BIDU.O> and Google <GOOGL.O> spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi <NSUG.DE> and Ford <F.N> expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia's Huang predicted those plans would speed up: "In the near future, you're going to see these schedules pull in."

Shares Marlon E via Flickr. Click for original. Microsoft is giving Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users a heads up that if they attempt to download and install any OS updates, they may be blocked if they're running newer hardware. Specifically, Microsoft is no longer interested in updating older versions of Windows on systems with an Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen CPU inside (same goes for Qualcomm 8996). Anyone on an affected system who attempts to download Windows update may see an error message, according to a knowledgebase article published last week ( KB 4012982). "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows," the error message reads. As InfoWorld points out, it's not clear if Microsoft is actually blocking updates yet. A YouTube user named JayzTwoCents posted a video in late January showing he was able to update Windows 8.1 on a Kaby Lake system without issue. Have a look: Things may be different now, or Microsoft might simply be putting the word out so that users won't be caught off guard when it flips the switch. Either way, this was probably inevitable. Microsoft has been saying for many months now that Kaby Lake and Ryzen will only be supported in Windows 10. Initially it was going to include Skylake in the mix as well, but later reversed course. "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support,” a Microsoft spokeswoman told PCWorld last September. "This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon." Microsoft isn't alone here, either. While AMD has been mum on the subject, Intel previously confirmed that it has no plans of updating Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 drivers for Kaby Lake. The bottom line? If you're building or upgrading a system around Kaby Lake or Ryzen, it's pretty much Windows 10 or bust.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation Senate Intel: “There Was No Wiretapping” White House Responds: “Was So!” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Senate Intel: “There Was No Wiretapping” White House Responds: “Was So!” Posted at 5:30 pm on March 16, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter So on March 4, President Twitter tweets out that former President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. There were no quotation marks, nor anything to make it seem as if he decided just to get up at 3am and goad his predecessor, a bit. The House Intel Committee and pretty much all of the nation latched on to it, with Trump’s loyalists ready for Obama’s head on a platter (with CIA guts as relish), and the rest feeling a bit skeptical. Trump was asked to provide proof by March 13, midnight, but the White House asked for more time. As RedState’s Joe Cunningham pointed out earlier today, that evidence has not been forthcoming, and the Senate Intelligence Committee released a statement today, saying that based on the information they have, there is no indication of wiretapping or any kind of surveillance of Trump going on. Is that enough to stop Trump? If you think that, you haven’t been paying attention. That man creates his own reality. According to White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Trump is standing by his unsubstantiated claim. They’re nuancing it now to say that by “Obama wiretapped Trump Tower in October” what the president was actually referring to was just a general sort of all-encompassing kind of surveillance, and that he didn’t mean that he was the target. Got that? Trending BREAKING: Clinton Doctor Releases New Statement Susan Wright Trump Tower = Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, or anyone within the circle of Trump who may have been connected to Russia, in some way, or just got caught up in the investigation into Russian tampering. “There’s been a vast amount of reporting, which I just detailed, about activity that was going on during the 2016 election. There’s no question there were surveillance techniques used throughout this,” he said. “The president has already been very clear that he didn’t mean specifically wiretapping. He had it in quotes.” Dude. Melissa McCarthy is going to be a blast to watch on SNL this weekend. The Senate intelligence panel said today: “We see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016.” Pretty cut-and-dried, right? “No, they’re not findings,” Spicer responded. “The statement clearly says that at this time they don’t believe that. They have yet to go through the information.” “He meant it; he put it in quotes,” Spicer added later of Trump’s wiretapping tweets. Pressed on whether it was phone tapping, as Trump initially claimed, he added, “No, it was surveillance.” Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), citing the House and Senate Intelligence panels, had also asserted that “no such wiretap existed.” That’s not stopping Spicer, who went near unhinged at today’s press briefing. If I might borrow and paraphrase from Chelsea Clinton’s upcoming book: He persisted. He pointed to comments from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who said it was “very possible” that Trump associates’ communications had been indirectly swept up in surveillance activity. “You choose not to cover that part,” Spicer told ABC News’s Jon Karl. “Where was your passion and where was your concern when there was no connection to Russia?” But Spicer also glossed over Nunes’s assertion that the GOP chairman does not “believe there was an actual tap at Trump Tower,” based on the evidence he has seen. Trump tried to do a bit of glossing over on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson show last night, himself, by saying “wiretap” covers a lot of different things. Ok, man.

SPONSORED: FREE Raspberry Pi3 when you spend $77 on Arrow.com News & Analysis China Fab Boom Fuels Equipment Spending Revival Dylan McGrath 3/16/2017 04:50 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO—Sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment grew 13 percent last year and are projected to grow further in each of the next two years in what would mark the first three-year period of consecutive growth for fab tools since the mid-1990s, according to the SEMI trade group. Much of the growth in fab tool spending in 2016 and particularly anticipated growth in 2017 and 2018 is being driven by a projected boom in semiconductor fab building in China. Of the 62 front end fabs scheduled to begin operation globally between 2017 and 2020, 26 are in China, according to a fab-building tracking report issued by SEMI last year. China’s fab building boom has begun in support of the country’s stated goal of beefing up its nascent domestic semiconductor industry to feed its massive internal electronics market. The Chinese government has said it will pump $161 billion over the next decade into building its domestic chip industry. International semiconductor powerhouses including Intel, Globalfoundries and TSMC are all building or expanding fabs in China, and a number of domestic Chinese firms are planning fabs, notably Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd., which has announced plans to spend $54 billion on two huge memory chip fabs in China. Chip equipment sales rose to $41.24 billion last year, up from $36.53 billion in 2015, according to SEMI, which represents chip equipment and materials suppliers worldwide. The organization is projecting that spending on fab tools will rise to an all-time high of more than $46 billion this year and grow further to nearly $50 billion in 2018. If the forecast is accurate, it would mark the first period of three consecutive or more years of growth for semiconductor equipment since the five-year expansion of 1993 to 1997, according to Christian Dieseldorff, director of industry research and analysis at SEMI. Source: SEMI. Of the $41.24 billion spent on fab tools globally last year, $6.46 billion was in China, an increase of 32 percent over 2015, SEMI said. The organization estimates that China's fab tool spending will rise to about $6.7 billion in 2017. In 2018, when SEMI expects 49 total fabs in China—including 14 newly constructed fabs—to be buying equipment, the organization projects that China's equipment spending will rise to about $10 billion.   Bill McClean, president of market research firm IC Insights Inc., told EE Times that both his firm and SEMI expect a “China bubble” of semiconductor equipment spending over the next couple years. “The only real difference may be that we see more of the spending happening in 2018 than 2017,” McClean said in an email exchange. “Other than that, I think our opinion is close to theirs.” Next page: Taiwan Still No. 1 Market for Equipment Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 2 Next > More Related Links Intel/Mobileye Duopoly: Dream or Nightmare?

The QNX initiative may lead the upward curve and investors should get handsome rewards by Luke Joye • Thu, 16 Mar 2017 04:44 pm EDT Thu, 16 Mar 2017 04:44 pm EDT in Mobile BlackBerry shares slated for steady rise The Intel acquisition of Mobileye at about $15 billion is sweet news for BlackBerry shares. This acquisition demonstrates that the autonomous car market is strong enough to command valuations of 39xsales. By the same logic, BlackBerry can immediately spurt by 34 to 68% and keep the upward momentum going further. BlackBerry shares to gain from QNX The QNX software from BlackBerry is already used in 60 million vehicles as at early 2017. The Mobileye deal therefore immediately brings BlackBerry on to the block as a potential acquisition candidate for a number of players in the niche. In the coming days, therefore, BlackBerry must be getting a fresh look at the bourses disregarding the quarterly numbers being rolled out presently. QNX also enjoys an established leadership presence in the software segment for automotive electronics and with over 40 automakers globally, the future prospects for the QNX offerings from BlackBerry look very promising. ADVERTISEMENT QNX has applications other than automotive The QNX software currently owned by BlackBerry has multiple applications in industries like medical devices, industrial robotics, building automation, train-control, green energy and other safety and mission-critical segments. It is also expected that in the coming days, the breadth of the market size for QNX can only grow at a rapid pace. BlackBerry has already earned $486 million from the services and software segment and is on course to reach $640 million for the whole year.  Going forward, even with a 10% market share of the juicy connected cars segment, BlackBerry could be expected to become a healthy business focused on regaining all its lost ground and climb further. Further, the mobileye buyout by Intel also opens up the possibilities of pushing BlackBerry into an attractive buyout target.BlackBerry shares are currently hovering around the $7 mark, way down from its peak a decade ago.

The delegation is also reportedly considering investment opportunities in smart car technologies, according to a report by the Globes business news site. Advertisement Earlier this week it was announced that Intel Corporation purchased Mobileye, an Israeli technology company that develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems providing warnings for collision prevention and mitigation, for an estimated $15 billion. It is the largest deal in Israeli history. CEO Ziv Aviram told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday during a phone call between the two that the center of the company’s operations would remain in Israel, that the company would build a global development center in the country, and that it would be responsible for Intel’s international activity regarding autonomous vehicles. A number of auto firms are already involved in the “smart car revolution” in Israel, including General Motors, Volvo and Honda — all of which have research and development centers, and are actively involved in investment in the market. The latter two companies are sharing a center for searching out investment opportunities with Hertz. SAIC of China is in the process of setting up an R & D center and searching for investment opportunities, and Renault and Nissan are also expected to enter the market shortly with a smart car innovation center in Israel as well, according to the report.

GEORGINA PRODHAN BERLIN — Reuters Published Thursday, Mar. 16, 2017 4:34PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Mar. 16, 2017 4:48PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Car makers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants. Chip maker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world’s top chip maker after Intel’s $15-billion deal to buy autonomous-driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast car makers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. “Because of deep learning, because of AI [artificial intelligence] computing, we’ve really supercharged our road map to autonomous vehicles,” he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany’s Bosch, however, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught with issues, including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being,” Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualization and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence – teaching computers to learn to write their own software code – for a decade. “No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving,” Mr. Huang said. Together with Bosch executives, Mr. Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia’s processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at Level 2 and Tesla ready to switch from Level 4 to 5 – full autonomy – as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level 3 means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while Level 4 means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted auto makers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. “This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,” he wrote. But Nvidia’s Mr. Huang said he expected to have chips available for Level 3 automated driving by the end of this year and in customers’ cars on the road by the end of 2018, with Level 4 chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most car makers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury car maker was on its way to deliver a Level 3 autonomous car in 2021, but could produce Level 4 or 5 autonomous cars in the same year. “We believe we have the chance to make level three, Level 4 and Level 5 doable,” he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level Level 3 being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and Level 4 driving not before 2025. Uber, Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while car makers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Mr. Huang predicted those plans would speed up: “In the near future, you’re going to see these schedules pull in.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail The stepping stones toward a self-driving future, features already in cars (The Globe and Mail)   INTC-QIntel Corp Latest Price$35.27 +0.13 (+0.37%) Updated March 17 4:15 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Right after Sean Spicer‘s press conference today, CNN’s Jake Tapper pushed back against comments Spicer made backing up President Trump on wiretapping despite the Senate Intel Committee’s conclusion today. Spicer today said that the press has been mischaracterizing what happened today. Tapper said that was absolutely not the case. Tapper spoke with Jeff Zeleny and Manu Raju to run through the various responses the White House has used in the past two weeks to defend Trump’s tweets, including the argument that “‘wiretapping’ was in quotes and therefore what President Trump was referring to was any kind of surveillance.” He was struck by “this anger from Sean Spicer, who cannot defend the indefensible,” and even mentioned Trump’s comments last night on “his favorite channel Fox News.” And just to cap it all off, Tapper ended the segment by saying, “It’s amazing to watch the White House continue to argue that the earth is flat.” Watch above, via CNN.

Still, if you're on the road all the time, it's just not convenient to haul around a gaming desktop. Over at Asus' ROG blog, the company is showing off the 15.6" Strix GL502VS and 17.3" Strix GL702VS. These machines promise to pack serious gaming speed into a size that won't cause back injuries if you have to carry it around all day. We'll start with the graphics card. These two new machines both come with a GeForce GTX 1070 and its associated 8GB of GDDR5 memory. That's a pretty good start. Asus pairs that potent GeForce with the buyer's option of a 120Hz 1920x1080 display or a 60Hz 3840x2160 display. Both displays use IPS LCD panels and support Nvidia G-Sync. The machines come standard with Intel's Core i7-7700HQ processor, a quad-core, eight-thread design that clocks up to 3.8 GHz. Either machine can take up to 32GB of DDR4 memory running at 2400 MT/s using a pair of SODIMM slots. You can also outfit them with both M.2 storage and a 2.5" drive. Asus offers SATA and NVMe M.2 SSDs and 2.5" SATA hard drives as purchase options. The hardware on offer is certainly powerful enough for us to call one of these a "desktop replacement", and yet both the GL502VS and GL702VS are only a little over an inch thick (3 cm). They aren't light, though—the smaller GL502VS weighs 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg), while the GL702VS weighs 6.4 lbs (2.9 kg). The extra weight likely comes from the high-powered cooling hardware, comprising two relatively large radiators and a pair of blowers that exhaust toward the back of the machine. Asus' blog post talks up the repairability of these two machines, and says that removing ten Philips screws is all that's required to replace all components, short of the motherboard itself. If you aren't willing to dig into your laptop's guts, you can still use three USB 3.0 Type-A connectors, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, or a regular old Gigabit Ethernet jack to hook up other devices. The larger GL702VS gets its Type-C port upgraded to a Thunderbolt connector. The ROG blog doesn't talk about pricing or availability for the new laptops, but Newegg already has a listing for the GL502VS-DS71. This particular model includes 16GB of memory, a 128GB SSD, a 1TB HDD, and the 120Hz display for $1699. Tags: Mobile computing Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference.

Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel Corp. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. © Corinne Gretler BC-SWATCH-OPERATING-SYSTEM “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. Shares of Swatch rose 1.4 percent as of 1:24 p.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 19.4 billion francs ($19.5 billion). Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Separately, Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets as it published its annual report. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 percent to 9 percent this year. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Paul Ryan held an evening rally at Lee County Sports Complex Soccer Field in Fort Myers, Florida on Thursday, October 17, 2012, after comedian Dennis Miller entertained the crowd and Florida Attorney General Kim Bondi introduced him. WASHINGTON — The speaker of the House, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman and the ranking Democrat on the committee said Thursday that they’ve seen no evidence of President Donald Trump’s accusation that he was wiretapped last year by his predecessor. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Richard Burr and ranking member Mark Warner issued a statement Thursday, saying “based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016.” Their statement came hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said that “no such wiretap existed,” citing intelligence reports to House leaders. “The intelligence committees, in their continuing, widening, ongoing investigations of all things Russia, got to the bottom — at least so far with respect to our intelligence community — that no such wiretap existed,” Ryan said in response to a question from CNN at a news conference. House intel chairman: No evidence of wiretapping claim Ryan’s comment follows Trump and the White House retreating from the President’s stunning accusation in a tweet two weeks ago. “When I say wiretapping, those words were in quotes. That really covers — because wiretapping is pretty old-fashioned stuff — but that really covers surveillance and many other things. And nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes, but that’s a very important thing,” Trump told Fox News Wednesday.

The client he was working for last fall was paying him more than $500,000 to put Turkey first. Michael T. Flynn at President Trump’s inauguration in January. CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesMichael T. Flynn, who went from the campaign trail to the White House as President Trump’s first national security adviser, filed papers this week acknowledging that he worked as a foreign agent last year representing the interests of the Turkish government in a dispute with the United States. His surprising admission, coming more than four months after the election, raised further questions about the rise and fall of a presidential confidant who was forced to resign after 24 days in office for withholding the full story of his communications with Russia’s ambassador. Even now, out of government and out of favor, Mr. Flynn and his contact with foreign figures presented a new headache for a White House eager to move on. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, registered as a lobbyist last year but did not file papers with the Justice Department registering as a foreign agent, providing a fuller understanding of his role, until Tuesday. While he did not work directly for the Turkish government, the firm that hired him, Inovo, is owned by a Turkish-American businessman with links to leaders in Ankara and asked him to work on an issue important to the government. The White House said that Mr. Trump did not know that Mr. Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when Mr. Trump appointed him national security adviser, a position that gave him access to classified meetings and materials. But a person briefed on the matter, who insisted on anonymity to describe private conversations, said Mr. Flynn’s lawyer contacted a lawyer for Mr. Trump’s transition team before the inauguration to ask whether Mr. Flynn should register given his work for Inovo. The transition lawyer offered no advice, saying it was up to Mr. Flynn. After the inauguration, the person said, Mr. Flynn and his lawyer each raised it again with a White House lawyer, only to be told once more it was up to him. Mr. Flynn had no comment on Friday. His lawyer wrote the Justice Department that Mr. Flynn decided to register retroactively “to eliminate any potential doubt.” The White House said its lawyer considered it a private decision and saw no reason to intervene. “It’s not a question of raising a red flag,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. “It’s a question of whether or not they gave him the advice that they are supposed to, which is it is not up to them to make decisions as to what you need to do or not do.” Vice President Mike Pence, who was upset that Mr. Flynn had misled him about the conversation with the Russian ambassador that got him dismissed, seemed less forgiving. News reports on the matter were “the first I heard of it,” the vice president said during an interview on Fox News Thursday night, “and I think it is an affirmation of the president’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.” Throughout the campaign, Mr. Flynn positioned himself as someone willing to call out a national security establishment that was too corrupt to keep America safe. When former colleagues criticized him for becoming overtly partisan, he shot back by castigating them for using their titles to enrich themselves by joining corporate boards. In an interview in October, Mr. Flynn insisted that he had eschewed financial rewards to follow his political convictions and join the Trump campaign. “I would love to be making some money,” he said. “I wish I could stop what I’m doing.” On behalf of his firm, the Flynn Intel Group, Mr. Flynn signed a contract on Aug. 9 with Inovo, a Dutch firm owned by Ekim Alptekin, the chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. Mr. Flynn’s firm was to receive $600,000 for 90 days of work. His initial registration as a lobbyist last year indicated he would receive less than $5,000 for lobbying, although that presumably indicates that he did not define most of the services he would provide Mr. Alptekin as lobbying under the law. Mr. Alptekin has links to the government of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which has engaged in a political crackdown after surviving a military coup attempt in July. In documents disclosed by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, Mr. Alptekin emailed frequently with Egemen Bagis, the former Turkish minister for European Union affairs. In one email in 2013, Mr. Alptekin sent an article from The Wall Street Journal to Mr. Bagis, who then forwarded it to Berat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law and now the country’s energy minister. Mr. Flynn was assigned to investigate Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and was blamed by Mr. Erdogan for helping instigate the failed coup. Mr. Erdogan has demanded the United States extradite Mr. Gulen, which the Obama administration refused to do. The forms filed this week indicate that Mr. Flynn’s firm was “to perform investigative research” on Mr. Gulen and “develop a short film piece on the results of its investigation.” In the end, the video was never completed, and Mr. Flynn’s firm received $530,000 before the contract terminated in November. But on Election Day, Mr. Flynn published an op-ed article in The Hill, a newspaper serving Congress, calling Mr. Gulen “a shady Islamic mullah” and “radical Islamist.” “To professionals in the intelligence community, the stamp of terror is all over Mullah Gulen’s statements,” he wrote. “Gulen’s vast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network. From Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden.” The forms said Mr. Flynn decided to write the piece “on his own initiative” and not at Inovo’s request, although they said that he shared a draft of it with Inovo before it was published. The Hill appended a note to the online version of the piece after this week’s filing: “Neither General Flynn nor his representatives disclosed this information when the essay was submitted.” During the course of the work, Mr. Alptekin introduced Mr. Flynn to Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and Mr. Albayrak, the president’s son-in-law, in New York on Sept. 19, the forms said. In a letter to the Justice Department this week, Mr. Flynn’s lawyer said that he did not initially register as a foreign agent because the firm that hired him was not a foreign government. But the lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, said Mr. Flynn had decided to register after the fact because “the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” This week, Mr. Alptekin disputed the notion that he hired Mr. Flynn to influence the next president. “When I engaged Flynn Co. polls showed 85% likelihood of Hillary winning,” he wrote on Twitter after the filings. “If intention was to lobby USG I would have hired Podesta like Gulen,” he added, referring to the United States government and Tony Podesta, a prominent Washington lobbyist and brother of John D. Podesta, who was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. But the filings this week contradict past assertions by Mr. Alptekin, who told in an interview after the November election that the contract with Mr. Flynn was worth “tens of thousands of dollars, not hundreds of thousands of dollars.” In the same interview, he said that Mr. Flynn “never consulted with me” about the op-ed article in The Hill and that he “would have advised against it.” Mr. Alptekin repeated the latter assertion even after the filings this week. “For the record: nobody remotely linked to the Gov. of Turkey knew about Gen. Flynn’s article in advance and I wasn’t consulted either,” he wrote on Twitter. Mr. Flynn opened the Flynn Intel Group in October 2014, two months after he was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. The business was opaque, making little public, not even an address. When a reporter went looking for it last fall, he tracked it down to an Alexandria, Va., office building operating out of the nondescript headquarters of another firm, called the White Canvas Group. In the interview in October, Mr. Flynn offered only a vague description of the firm. He said he had clients in Japan and the Middle East and that he worked on cyber training, aviation operations and energy business. The firm was shuttered after the election when Mr. Flynn was headed for the White House.

Chipmaker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world's top chipmaker after Intel's $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jens-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. "Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we've really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles," he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany's Bosch, however, the world's biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. "Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being," Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade. "No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving," said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia's processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. DEGREES OF AUTONOMY On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. "This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants," he wrote. But Nvidia's Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers' cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. "We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable," he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber, Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia's Huang predicted those plans would speed up: "In the near future, you're going to see these schedules pull in."

However the page also confirms that Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users won’t receive updates anymore when they upgrade their CPU to an Intel’s Kaby Lake generation processor or an AMD Bristol Ridge or AMD Ryzen processor.   About a year ago Microsoft already announced that new CPUs would only be supported in the latest version of Windows, such as Windows 10. However, the Microsoft website now also indicates that updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. will only be available on older hardware. When using a new CPU on these older Windows versions an error might occur stating, “Unsupported Hardware. Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates or “Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error”. Microsoft also provides a solution on its website. “We recommend that you upgrade Windows 8.1-based and Window 7-based computers to Windows 10 if those computers have a processor that is from any of the following generations”, Microsoft writes after which the company lists Intel (7th generation) Kaby Lake,  AMD (7th generation) Bristol Ridge (or later) and Qualcomm 8996 CPUs. The company goes on to write, “Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update.” In practice this means that anyone who wants to upgrade to any of the listed CPUs is forced to use Windows 10.

Name: Subject: Message: Swatch announces it’ll develop its own OS for smartwatches Newsby Brian Reigh3 days ago 4 310 19 Shutterstock Switzerland’s largest watchmaker has announced that it will develop its own OS for upcoming smartwatches, competing directly with Google and Apple. See also: Will AI assistants spark renewed interest in wearables? 2 weeks ago According to Bloomberg, Swatch CEO Nick Hayek said in an interview that the Swiss watchmaker will develop its own wearable OS that is more efficient in saving power and protecting user data and will launch a model by the end of 2018 under its Tissot brand. Swatch’s announcement is in sharp contrast with the recently announced TAG Heuer smartwatch, developed in conjunction with Google and Intel. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek said in an interview that the Swiss watchmaker will develop its own wearable OS that is more efficient in saving power and protecting user data and will launch a model by the end of 2018 under its Tissot brand. It’s true that there have been growing doubts around Google’s wearable OS and wearables in general. People expect smartphone-like features as well as a long-lasting battery life inside a small timepiece, something that no manufacturer can deliver with today’s technology. That’s likely why some Android OEMs have quit the smartwatch market altogether for now or have moved onto a platform that allows for more freedom and flexibility à la Gear S3 running Tizen OS. According to Hayek, speaking at the headquarters of Omega – a sub-brand owned by Swatch Group – the company is trying to “think small”: There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system. He added that there have been around 100 requests so far for more information on this upcoming proprietary OS and that Swatch plans to provide its OS to third parties as well. Although some are skeptical that Swatch’s OS would be adequate in satiating consumer needs, I think that if it executes well the idea of miniaturization, it can carry over the success that connected hybrid watches saw to true smartwatches. Though I don’t imagine it being app-rich like Apple’s ecosystem or even Google’s, if Hayek and his company can create a good-looking Tissot timepiece that is both smart and long-lasting, then perhaps all this is worth the effort.

Political Editor For Dailymail.com Published: 14:24 EDT, 16 March 2017 | Updated: 15:51 EDT, 16 March 2017 e-mail 195 shares 591 View comments Former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn got paid $45,000 for a 2015 speech to the Kremlin-backed RT, explosive new documents reveal – placing a dollar figure on an event that raised questions during the presidential campaign. After his speaker's bureau, Leading Authorities, took its 25 per cent take, Flynn got $33,750, for an event celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the outlet.  Flynn, a retired Army Lt. Gen., long ago acknowledged getting paid, but wouldn't reveal the sum in an interview with the Washington Post. The documents were released by a Congressional inquiry on Thursday.  Flynn resigned under pressure just weeks into his tenure after it was revealed he multiple contacts with Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak during the transition, and didn't disclose to Vice President Mike Pence and others that sanctions on Russia were discussed. Dining companions: Flynn was a guest at Putin's table for the December 2015 celebration of RT - for which it is now disclosed he received $45,000 Former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn was paid $45,000 for a 2015 speech to the Kremlin-backed RT where he sat next to Putin, pictured, Flynn, a retired military general, stepped down as President Trump's national security advisor after revelations about his ties to Russia. He got paid $45,000 to speak in Moscow at an event where he was seated next to Vladimir Putin Documents reveal Flynn had three paid speaking engagements after getting fired form his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  Other documents show Flynn got two payments of $11,250 each, paid by two Russian companies, cargo airline Volga-Dnieper, and computer firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. The publication said they were U.S. subsidiaries of the private companies.  The documents show payments to Flynn Intel Group LLC. The client is listed as RT TV - America. The publication reported that Flynn brought his son and stayed at the swank Metropol hotel. Flynn had just left the military at the time at the time of his RT talk. He wouldn't reveal to the Washington Post how much he was paid for the engagement.  'I was asked by my speaker's bureau, LAI. I do public speaking. It was in Russia. It was a paid speaking opportunity,' Flynn told the paper. The White House knew that Flynn may not have been entirely truthful about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, but the vice president did not find out until two weeks later, on Feb. 9, Pence's spokesman said     Flynn's cut was less than $34,000 after a commission 'The gig was to do an interview with [RT correspondent] Sophie Shevardnadze. It was an interview in front of the forum, probably 200 people in the audience,' he said. After the speech, Flynn sat at Putin's table, and was seated at his right-and side.  Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings wrote Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and FBI Director James Comey about the new information Thursday. 'I cannot recall any time in our nation’s history when the President selected as his National Security Advisor someone who violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy,” he said.  Flynn accompanied Donald Trump frequently on the campaign trail and became his national security advisor Pentagon rules prohibit retired officers from accepting 'consulting fees, gifts, travel expenses, honoraria or salary' immediately after they leave the military. Flynn accepted the payments before he signed on as a Trump campaign advisor, ultimately becoming his national security advisor. Flynn last week filed papers with the government indicating that he acted as a foreign agent on behalf of interest tied to the government of Turkey, getting paid more than $500,000.

Login Register Public Release: 16-Mar-2017 UC researchers use gold coating to control luminescence of nanowires University of Cincinnati physicists manipulate nanowire semiconductors in pursuit of making electronics smaller, faster and cheaper University of Cincinnati Share  Print  E-Mail IMAGE: University of Cincinnati physicist Hans-Peter Wagner is exploring nanowire semiconductors to harness the power of light at the nano level. view more Credit: Andrew Higley/UC Creative Services In electronics, the race for smaller is huge. Physicists at the University of Cincinnati are working to harness the power of nanowires, microscopic wires that have the potential to improve solar cells or revolutionize fiber optics. Nanotechnology has the potential to solve the bottleneck that occurs in storing or retrieving digital data - or could store data in a completely new way.?UC professors and their graduate students presented their research at the March 13 conference of the American Physical Society in New Orleans, Louisiana. Hans-Peter Wagner, associate professor of physics, and doctoral student Fatemesadat Mohammadi are looking at ways to transmit data with the speed of fiber optics but at a significantly smaller scale. Wagner and lead author Mohammadi are studying this field, called plasmonics, with researchers from three other universities. For the novel experiment, they built nanowire semiconductors with organic material, fired laser pulses at the sample and measured the way light traveled across the metal; technically, the excitations of plasmon waves. "So, if we succeed in getting a better understanding about the coupling between the excitations in semiconductor nanowires and metal films, it could open up a lot of new perspectives," Wagner said. The successful harnessing of this phenomenon -- called plasmon waveguiding -- could allow researchers to transmit data with light at the nano level. Universities around the world are studying nanowires, which have ubiquitous applications from biomedical sensors to light-emitting diodes or LEDs. Four UC papers on the topic are among more than 150 others by nanowire researchers around the world to be presented at the March conference. "You're trying to optimize the physical structure on something approaching the atomic scale. You can make very high efficiency devices like lasers," said Leigh Smith, head of UC's Department of Physics.?Smith and UC Physics Professor Howard Jackson also presented papers on nanowires at the conference.?Virtually everyone benefits from this line of research, even if the quantum mechanics underlying the latest biosensors exceed a casual understanding. For example, home pregnancy tests use gold nanoparticles - the indicator that turns color.?"People use technologies all the time that they don't understand," Smith said. "Arthur C. Clarke said, 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'" Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corp., observed that the number of transistors used in a microchip has roughly doubled every two years since the 1970s. This phenomenon, now called Moore's Law suggests that computer processing power improves at a predictable rate. Some computer scientists predicted the demise of Moore's Law was inevitable with the advent of microprocessors. But nanotechnology is extending that concept's lifespan, said Brian Markwalter, senior vice president of research and technology for the Consumer Technology Association. His trade group represents 2,200 members in the $287 billion U.S. tech industry. "It's not a race to be small just to be the smallest. There's a progression of being able to do more on smaller chips. The effect for consumers is that every year they get better and better products for the same price or less," he said. Nanotechnology is opening a universe of new possibilities, Markwalter said. "It's almost magical. They get better, faster, cheaper and use less power," he said. Markwalter said UC professor Wagner's research is exciting because it shows promise in using optical switches to address a bottleneck in data transmission that occurs whenever you try to store or remove data. "It's really a breakthrough area to merge the semiconductor world and the optical world," Markwalter said. "[Wagner's] working at the intersection of fiber optics and photonics." But even nanotechnology has its limits, Smith said. "We're running toward the limits of what's physically possible with present technologies," Smith said. "The challenges are pretty immense. In 10 or 20 years there has to be a fundamental paradigm shift in how we make structures. If we don't we'll be caught at the same place we are now." How one UC experiment works: UC graduate student Fatemesadat Mohammadi and Associate Physics Professor Hans-Peter Wagner fire laser pulses at semiconductor nanowires to excite electrons (called excitons) that potentially serve as an energy pump to guide plasmon waves over a coated metal film just a few nanometers thick without losing power, a nettlesome physical property called resistivity They measure the resulting luminescence of the nanowire to observe how light couples to the metal film. By sending light over a metal film, a process called plasmonic waveguiding, researchers one day could transmit data with light at the nano level. "The luminescence is our interest. So we coat them and see: How does the photoluminescence characteristic change?" Mohammadi said. To make the semiconductor, they use a technique called high-vacuum organic molecular beam deposition (pictured above) to spread organic and metal layers on gallium-nitride nanorods. The use of organic film is unique to the UC experiment, Wagner said. The film works as a spacer to control the energy flow between excitons in the nanowire and the oscillation of metal electrons called plasmons. The organic material has the added benefit of also containing excitons that, arranged properly, could support the energy flow in a semiconductor, he said. Coating the nanorods with gold significantly shortens the lifetime of the exciton emission resulting in what's called a quenched photoluminescence. But by using organic spacers between the nanorod and the gold film, the researchers are able to extend the emission lifetime to nearly the equivalent of nanorods without a coating. Once the gold-coated sample is prepared, they take it to an adjacent lab room and subject it to pulses of laser light. Mohammadi said it took days of painstaking work to arrange the small city of mirrors and beam splitters bolted at precise angles to a workbench for the experiment (pictured above left). The reactions in the nanowire take just 10 picoseconds (which is a trillionth of a second.) And the laser pulses are faster still -- 20 femtoseconds (a figure that has 15 zeros following it or a quadrillionth of a second.) The UC project used a gold coating so that experiments could be replicated at a later date without risk of oxidation. But traditional coatings such as silver, Mohammadi said, hold even more promise. ### Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

Nick Hayek, CEO of Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group at a press conference to present the group's annual results, on March 16, 2017 in Biel.  (FABRICE COFFRINI / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Corinne GretlerBloomberg Thu., March 16, 2017 ZURICH—Swatch Group AG said it’s developing an alternative to the iOS and Android operating systems for smartwatches as Switzerland’s largest maker of timepieces vies with Silicon Valley for control of consumers’ wrists. The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch chief executive officer Nick Hayek said in an interview Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Read more:Has time run out for smartwatches? Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel Corp. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Article Continued Below Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. “I’m not convinced,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. “People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object.” Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to François Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Separately, Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets as it published its annual report. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 per cent to 9 per cent this year.

 The nastiest feud in the airline business seems tailor-made for Trump — but he won't touch it Benjamin Zhang Mar. 16, 2017, 1:10 PM 21,548 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump with the Boeing 787-9. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque The largest US airlines want the White House to intervene in the expansion of three huge Middle Eastern rivals, which they say is hurting business and jobs. Trump hasn't taken up the cause. The Middle Eastern carriers — Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar — are big customers of Boeing's. Trump's family business also has strong ties and ambitions in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. America's airline workers and CEOs are mad as hell. They face increasing competition from a group of foreign rivals that they say are government-supported, profiting off cheap labor, and abusing international agreements. On the surface, it seems like a perfect opportunity for President Donald Trump to champion American workers and threaten to tear up another trade agreement, but so far he's not biting. There are two reasons for this. His focus on job creation is in manufacturing, not the services industry, and the airlines that are triggering the complaints hail from a part of the world where Trump has growing business ties. What's the issue? Here's the shorthand version of the feud: Since 2015, American, Delta, and United Airlines (the US3) have been complaining about competition from three huge and fast-growing Middle East-based rivals — Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways (the ME3). According to the US3, the ME3's growth has been fueled by as much as $50 billion in subsidies over the past decade, allowing them to flood the international market and threaten the job security of US aviation workers. They also say the ME3 are in violation of the Open Skies agreements that govern air travel between the US and 120 nations including the UAE and Qatar. They're trying hard to get Trump's attention. Last Sunday, a group of United Airlines employees, unions, and members of Congress held a protest at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey in reaction to the launch of a new daily service by Emirates from Newark to Athens, Greece — a route that United flies during the summer. At the same time, a bipartisan group of 25 members of Congress from New York and New Jersey asked the White to block Emirates' Newark-Athens route. "It's crystal clear that the US airlines and their employees are looking to President Trump to enforce our international agreements with the trade cheaters of the UAE and Qatar," said Jill Zuckman, a spokeswoman for the lobbying group representing the US3 on this matter. The ME3, as you might expect, rebut all this. They say US airlines have been bailed out and supported by government spending in the past, and that their own flights into the US create jobs and growth. Manufacturing First Trump at the Boeing plant in North Charleston, South Carolina. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque From his early days on the campaign trail, Trump keyed in on a need for America to rebuild its once booming manufacturing sector. Time and time again, candidate Trump and then President Trump vowed to support American-made products. The president has personally praised companies such as Ford, General Motors, United Technologies, and Intel for deciding to keep manufacturing operations in the US. That extends to Boeing. In February, when asked about US airlines' request to block the entrance of Norwegian Air's Irish subsidiary into the domestic market, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: "They're flying Boeing planes. There is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now. I don't want to get ahead of the president on that. But just to be clear, I mean, when you're talking about US jobs — both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person who's building those planes — that's a very big difference." The difference here is that Boeing and its assembly plants in Washington state and South Carolina that produced the 120 737 and 787 jets in Norwegian's Boeing-only fleet are the same plants that will build the 100 next-generation 737 MAX airliners Norwegian has on order with a list value of more than $11 billion. After all, there are few visuals quite as representative of American industrial might as a shiny new Boeing jet. The ME3 are big spenders But Norwegian is small potatoes when compared with the economic might and sheer spending power of the ME3. Emirates' Boeing 777-300ER. Boeing Take Emirates, for instance: The airline is one of Boeing's most important and reliable customers. Emirates' fleet of 160 Boeing 777s is the largest of its kind in the world and worth $45 billion. To put things into perspective, if a 737 is the aeronautical equivalent of a $25,000 family sedan, then a 777 is a $100,000 Cadillac Escalade. And Emirates has been buying these "Cadillacs" in bulk, with orders for another $86 billion worth of Boeing 777 and next generation 777X airliners. It's not just Emirates. Collectively, the ME3 account for nearly 80% of the 306 777X aircraft Boeing has sold. Then there are the engines, which Boeing does not make. For Emirates, a larger number of its 777s are powered by General Electric GE90 engines. In 2015, Emirates signed a $16 billion deal with GE to provide maintenance for these engines. Even many of the non-American aircraft Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar fly are powered by American-made engines, built by a Connecticut-based joint venture between GE and Pratt & Whitney, called Engine Alliance. Put it all together, and the three airlines hold more than $150 billion worth of economic power that will keep Boeing's assembly lines rolling for the next decade and beyond. Despite the vastness and importance of the airline industry, the Trump administration's focus on manufacturing, that shining image of US industrial supremacy, takes precedence. After all, why antagonize some of the most lucrative customers for America's most recognizable industrial export? Trump Dubai It's also worth raising the issue of the Trump Organization's business interests in the United Arab Emirates. These business dealings have been the subject of criticism from the president's detractors. In February, the president's two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., presided over the opening of the latest Trump-branded golf course, the Trump International Golf Club Dubai. The course, located a stone's throw away from downtown Dubai, was developed by Hussain Sajwani, a billionaire and Trump family friend, and his Dubai-based DAMAC Properties. According to Reuters, DAMAC pays the Trump Organization a licensing fee to use the Trump brand on the facility, which features a 30,000-square-foot clubhouse, four restaurants, state-of-the-art recreation facilities, and a 7,300-yard, par-71 golf course designed by Gil Hanse. DAMAC is also developing a second Trump-branded golf course in the emirate, called the Trump World Golf Club Dubai, which will feature an 18-hole championship course designed by Tiger Woods. In 2015 and 2016, DAMAC paid the Trump Organization as much as $10 million, Bloomberg reported. Eric Trump at the opening of the Trump International Golf Club Dubai. REUTERS/William Maclean The tiny emirate of Dubai has blossomed over the past couple of decades under the guidance of its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, and revolves around its government, ruled by the house of al Maktoum. Infrastructure, land, and real-estate development are all part of the ruling family's efforts to brand Dubai as a global hub for trade and commerce, and the heart of this international marketing effort is Dubai's most recognizable and effective branding tool: Emirates, and its shining fleet of jumbo jets. It's not just Dubai either. Neighboring Abu Dhabi, where Etihad is based, and Qatar to the north are doing much of the same — including building hotels and golf courses that might carry the Trump name. According to Hotelier Middle East, in 2015, Ivanka Trump said the organization was looking at "multiple opportunities" in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. On a practical level, Emirates is also the how the world's golfers will find their way to Trump's Dubai properties. And according to a passenger on the flight, it's how Eric and Donald Jr. made their way back to New York from Dubai. It's still early, and it's entirely possible the White House could take up the concerns raised by American, Delta, and United. If it doesn't, we have a good idea why.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Our next speakers for our upcoming GamesBeat Summit event will talk about “Bucking the status quo: Redesigning leadership for diverse talent, perspectives, and products.” They will speak at our event entitled GamesBeat Summit 2017: How games, sci-fi, and tech create real-world magic. GamesBeat Summit 2017 will take place on May 1-2 at the historic Claremont resort hotel in Berkeley, Calif., just a short distance from San Francisco. You can secure your seat here. Use “VB6” at checkout for 10 percent off. The speakers on the panel include Megan Gaiser, the CEO of Spiral Media; Rami Ismail, the cofounder of Vlambeer; Asi Burak of Power Play; and Asra Rasheed, the producer at Disney. The moderator will be Guy Bendov, the CEO of Side-kick Games. Here’s what the panel is about. The news is dominated these days by the fear of the future and of “the other.” Revised immigration policies, the proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, and provocative remarks have mobilized millions around the world who are afraid of losing their jobs and national identity. Progress on diversity issues, equality in the workplace, and true international collaboration are challenged on a daily basis, and we need to invest in a leadership transformation to proactively find creative solutions. How do we advance the gaming and tech industries in the right direction and welcome diverse people, perspectives, and products without leaving anyone behind? Above: Asi Burak, the CEO of Power Play and chairman of Games for Change. Image Credit: Power Play Asi Burak is the CEO of Power Play and chairman of the game industry group Games for Change, which produces the largest gaming event in NYC, the annual Games for Change Festival. He has served as a strategic advisor to organizations like EON Productions (producer of the James Bond films), Tribeca Enterprises, Newsweek, and McCann Erickson, helping to guide the strategic use of games and digital experiences to further brand engagement. Prior to serving as G4C’s President from 2010 to 2015, Asi co-founded and led Impact Games, the creators of PeaceMaker and Play the News (acquired by Hybrid Learning Systems in 2010).

She guides technology and entertainment companies to create meaning and money. She serves as a senior creative leader, strategist, director, and storyteller for inspired computing experience across games & VR/AR and films. As one of the first female CEOs in the gaming industry, Gaiser spent the last 15 years experiencing the game industry as both an insider and an outsider. This unique vantage point enabled her to not only sidestep the outdated habits of the game industry but to capture the female market by creating the first intelligent game for girls via the Nancy Drew franchise. Gaiser gained a reputation for identifying and engaging unproven markets, inspiring collaboration, and showing a commitment to the highest artistic and aesthetic qualities.

It has produced hits like Ridiculous Fishing, Luftrausers, and Nuclear Throne. The company has been around for six years, but Ismail is an outspoken leader and thoughtful supporter of independent games and their role at large. He has traveled the world as one of the big voices of the indie game industry, presenting at a wide range of conferences and speaking out on issues such as diversity, Muslim representation in games, #GamerGate, and uncompensated crunch time in games. Other speakers include Rich Hilleman of Amazon Game Studios; Chris Roberts, the CEO of Roberts Space Industries; Akshay Khanna of the Philadelphia 76ers; Greg Richardson of Team Dignitas; Ted Price, the CEO of Insomniac Games; Mike Gallagher, the CEO of the Entertainment Software Association; John Underkoffler, the CEO of Oblong Industries and science advisor for Minority Report; Gary Whitta, the screenwriter for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story; Richard Marks of Sony PlayStation; Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games; Owen Mahoney, the CEO of Nexon; and Jamil Moledina of Google Play. Inspiring moments lead to disrupting the worlds of gaming, tech, and entertainment. Who hasn’t been influenced by great novels like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, which gave us virtual worlds, or Tom Cruise’s data gloves and gesture-controlled computer in Minority Report? Now, those things have become real, and we want to see what’s coming next. Our theme is about what inspires game developers, executives, and investors to be creative. Part of the event will focus on the inspiration cycle that is accelerating as the walls between science fiction, video games, and real-world technology come down. We don’t think there’s another conference that focuses on the seams between these industries. This event will focus on inspiration and creativity. So much of what used to be science fiction is coming true, and it is inspiring even more accelerated visions of the future in games and other entertainment. We hope to inspire you by taking you to the moments that led to great ideas across multiple industries. You’ll leave refreshed and ready to change the worlds of gaming, technology, and more. We think this conference will offer a rare chance for cross-pollination and networking between high-level people in different industries, and we believe that insights in one place can lead to inspirations in another. This conference is for high-end gaming executives, startup CEOs, developers, investors, publishers, marketers, tech experts, entertainment industry professionals, sci-fi experts, AR and VR executives, and other professionals. I should also point out that this is where we try to create an actual GamesBeat community with our supporters, readers, and attendees. We gather the right people in the room and encourage everyone to get to know each other. Join us. If you’re interested in sponsoring, message mike.sly@venturebeat.com.

Three months later it’s ready to talk some more about the fourth generation of the existing ISE/iglu product line and the coming launch of its new Axellio system. At a briefing we were told that Axellio is no longer just a general-purpose fast-access storage array and is being positioned as an edge processing device, "edge" being an Internet of Things term for an on-premises system handling potentially massive sensor-based data inputs that need processing before data is pumped off to a central system. So there are three things to look at: (1) gen 4 ISE/iglu, (2) Axellio and (3) product positioning and sales channels. Gen 4 ISE/iglu With its two most recent quarters being profitable and with a $10m funding injection, X-IO has been able to simultaneously refresh its existing USE and iglu product lines and fund the Axellio development. ISE, the Integrated Storage Element, came as a sealed box of disk drives with a five-year operating life. Clever software maintained drive operation through partial failures and the sealed box helped prevent vibration-induced problems. This all meant that ISE was proprietary and thus ill-suited to an era in which software-defined storage, with freedom from hardware lock-in, is becoming more important. The entry of flash drives into the product also rendered the disk-drive-focused software tech less important and, with all-flash ISE products, rendered the anti-vibration sealed container redundant. So generation 4 ISE decouples the software from the hardware and OEM customers will be be able to buy the software on its own to run on their hardware. We understand existing customers should be able to upgrade to Gen 4. Gen 4 ISE software will also have, at last, deduplication: X-IO’s own technology too, based on ideas from Richie Lary, X-IO’s chief scientist. We’re told it is much faster than other dedupe technologies, will be cost-effective and is patent-pending. Data volumes inside Gen 4 ISE can have dedupe applied or not – customers can choose. We assume this is something to do with saving CPU cycles. The existing ISE Matrix RAID tech is retained and this has a data layout scheme involving all the drives and speeds rebuild after a drive failure. With the expected inclusion of better drives and processors than gen 3 ISE and iglu, gen 4 should represent a gain in performance. Axellio hardeware Axellio Axellio was a developing all-flash array product whose arrival is now looking like the summer. The system has two controllers connected by a PCIe-based HyperFabric and these access data on flash drives. We should think, conceptually, of 2 x 1U servers each fitted with 36 dual-ported NVMe SSDs. These two servers are cross-connected by the fabric to produce, in effect, a twin controller 72 SSD system. We should think of the system as a converged platform as it will have enough processing power to run application code and be presented as an edge processing server. Axellio will run third-party virtualisation software. The initial product will be a stand-alone 2U enclosure with 88 cores and dual-socket motherboards. These motherboards will be upgradeable so as to be able to adopt new Intel processors as they arrive. It will feature 8TB SSD, meaning 576TB raw capacity. The plan is to then move to 16TB SSDs and surpass 1PB in capacity. On the roadmap are a storage-only version and also a scale-out version. Several units are being tested by beta customers and X-IO says its avoiding some of the issues that killed DSSD, by using Intel motherboards, a non-proprietary network, and off-the-shelf NVMe SSDs, along with a lower price. Channel approach The sales channel scheme for Axellio reflects its anticipated use as an IOT edge processor. We should think if uses such as being a packet-capture device in circumstances where regulatory compliance is a must, to meet such frameworks as MiFID (Market in Financial Instruments Directive). Solarflare high-speed NICS were mentioned as a way of capturing packets which Axellio would store in a database and enable immediate analytic routines to be run on them. In effect customers would be able, X-IO says, to store and analyse at the same time. Cyber-security was a second usage area and X-IO’s spokesperson, marketing consultant Gavin McLaughlin, said Axellio would form part of solution stacks in such usages, and so be bought as a solution stack by the end-user and not as a separate component: “We’ll go to market with solution providers.” Axellio might be bought by cloud service providers as well. A collapsed Hadoop idea was mentioned as well, with a 100-node Hadoop cluster conceptually distilled down to a single Axellio system with sufficient compute and capacity to churn through the same data faster. Such an approach would avoid extracting data from a store and distributing it across the 100 Hadoop nodes for processing. This solution stack approach means X-IO will market Axellio to the solution stack vendors and effectively say it’s a better mousetrap than alternative server-storage systems. As we understand it, the system won’t be sold through a general channel to the general business market. McLaughlin said: “We’re not going wide and doing everything.” Apropos DSSD he also said the pricing would be very competitive. +Comment The notion of an IoT edge processor is a boon to on-premises IT suppliers threatened by the public cloud, because an edge processor is inherently on-premises. The premise is that the data coming from IoT devices will be such a deluge that it will cost far too much to upload it to the cloud. An allied idea is that uploading the data to the cloud and processing it there will take time and prevent real-time analytics of the data with a feedback loop to control the IoT devices more effectively. You need far more than a gateway device. To achieve real time analytics and control/management you need to process the data at the edge and send abridged and processed data to the cloud for later central processing. Bingo – a supplier with a storage-dense fast server is in a pole position to meet this need. Cue X-IO talking to solution stack providers and avoiding the need to have a costly sales channel to make sales in the general business server-storage market. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register X-IO adds archive storage tier: ISE and iglu get cold storage Eats nourishing E60 in Nexsan OEM deal X-IO lights a fresh blaze in its iglu, puts it on ISE Fifty per cent speed booster adds IOPS X-IO: Reports of our demise have been greatly exaggerated Updated Lazarus-like miraculous recovery with chairman/CEO putting in his own cash 8 Comments X-IO and Pivot3 enter mutual back-scratch deal Loosely-coupled alliance with IP, product, staff, and engineering services aspects X-IO and Pivot3 talks stall Staff futures still up in the air as X-IO tries to avoid lay-offs X-IO erects its iglu over the data management market Services head unit keeps your ISE blocks covered 2 Comments Whitepapers Cox Automotive gains big data horsepower with Red Hat storage Built an Apache Hadoop cluster to support big data analysis and mining Supermicro MicroBlade Powers One of the World’s Most Energy Efficient Data Centers A Fortune 100 Company has deployed over 30,000 Supermicro MicroBlade disaggregated Intel Xeon Justifying Investment in All-Flash Arrays This independent study from IDC looks at the economic benefits of flash deployments from a business perspective.

RELATED ARTICLES Israel's auto-tech startups move up a gear All roads lead to Israel for smart car development Mobileye partners with Volkswagen on mapping Mobileye, BMW, Intel: Autonomous car fleet in 2017 Did Intel get a bargain? Last year, the company began a strategic partnership with Intel and Mobileye(NYSE: MBLY) in the development of a platform for the next generation of autonomous cars. Starting this year, it is also a partner in the gathering of data and the mapping of vehicles in order to create a geographical database for all next-generation vehicles. Senior R&D figures in the company have already visited Israel in the past, but usually in the context of cooperation with Mobileye. BMW is likely to join a long series of auto manufacturers and tier-1 suppliers in the industry already operating R&D centers in Israel and offices to find investments in companies dealing in smart cars at some level. These include General Motors, which has hundreds of employees in its Herzliya R&D center. Volvo and Honda are operating an incubator for smart car startups, and share a center for finding investment opportunities with Hertz.

UPDATE: 5pm ET: Today, in a letter sent to clients and first reported by VRM Intel, the company said it is shutting up shop. “While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations…. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off” (See reader comment, below, for the full letter.) LeisureLink’s closure strands several resort/hotel type managers as well as traditional vacation rental managers. Back to our original story: Earlier this year, the company said it had received a $17 million round of funding, with investors Clearstone Ventures, Kinderhook Industries and Escalate Capital Partners participating. Since its founding in 2007, it has raised more than $34 million. On Friday, SoCal Tech reported that the company has been sending email messages to clients that say: “We’ve been working aggressively to complete a corporate transaction. Regardless of what you may have heard we are still in that process and anticipate a positive outcome.” Tnooz’s voice and email messages to top-level executives this morning have not been returned, as of this afternoon. The only executive we could reach on the phone has declined to comment. In August, Utah-based LeisureLink sold several of its consumer-facing websites to Aspen-based Ski.com. Earlier this year, an official had told Tnooz that the company was working on releasing new, public APIs for distributors and suppliers. The goal was to enable LeisureLink rates and inventory to be passed over to Airbnb, HomeAway’s Escapia software, and Seekda’s Regatta booking engine. In 2014, LeisureLink was bought by VacationRoost, which changed its group name to LeisureLink. LeisureLink’s online chat system for customer service was closed today. When Tnooz contacted an account manager by phone, he was telling customers that all he could say was that “the company is going through a corporate transaction and they are hoping to get the business details resolved quickly.” Apparently any such potential deal fell through.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill had roles as a reporter and editor-in-chief at Tnooz between July 2012 and January 2017.   Tags LeisureLink Comments Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Sue Silver I booked a home in Lahaina back in July 2016 for a week in June 2017. Gave leisurelink 50% deposit. I was never contacted or notified of their bk until last week receiving an email from RealVoice that they bought it. They said they would honor my deposit and I would be responsible for balance. My concern is I no longer can find the rental property on any rental websites even Hawaiian beach rental which supposedly RealVoice bought from leisurelink. How can I find out if this is legitimate before I hand over thousands of dollars and get to Maui without a home to stay. Thanks for any advice Reply 2 months ago   Rhonda Hi Sue I feel your pain. I’m still waiting to see if we’ll be receiving our $1000. deposit from our August 2016 stay. Same place your headed. I guess I should be grateful the house was really there! It was my fear the entire time as we drove up the road & this was BEFORE we were swindled. We didn’t know what was going on behind the scenes until we returned from your trip & tried to get our security deposit back. We noticed the name of the Company seemed to change names a few times but we were assured they were one in the same. VERY misleading. Not sure I’ll book this way again. I hope you get what you pay for. Reply 2 weeks ago   Mike Harrison Found out the guy to,contact is named Erik Hovanec and this is a California company..or was.

Please check out this latest press release. http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/realvoice-acquires-hawaiian-beach-rentals-mexican-destinations-and-crm-software-300416380.html Reply 2 weeks ago   Jeffery Hill I am trying to figure out if this fall under Utah or California. The address was Utah. I just left a message with the Atty General’s office. I believe that under the law notices were suppose to have been sent to all creditors within 30 days of the closure which I believe was Sept 23rd. So it’s possible that those have been sent but I have not received anything yet. In the long run, I’m sure no one will see any money. This is essentially a bankruptcy and I’m sure the assets will not cover what it owed. If anything is paid out it will be pennies on the dollar. If anyone knows anything else, please post Reply 5 months ago   Cote Property Management I did get a letter from the Utah Atty General’s office, they said it falls under California law. They suggested contacting an attorney there. Reply 5 months ago   Geri Hauck We have yet to receive any forms or paperwork as stipulated in their notice of closure. Reply 4 months ago   Former LL Client Odd how Leisure Link still has its ties to Homeaway and VRBO has anyone heard back from the Utah attorneys office? Reply 5 months ago   Cote Property Management I heard back from the Utah Attorney Generals office, they said to file a complaint with California, which I did. They also suggested contacting an attorney. I think there needs to be a class action suit. I know there are places that suffered must larger losses then me and wonder if any of them have started anything? Reply 5 months ago   paul tateo Cote any response from CA about this closing with Leisurelink? anyone start any legal action yet? what I think happened is the venture capital in the firm sold the sites to Ski.com and pulled as much of its investment back as it could recover, including prepaid reservation rents from companies and people, took the funds and stranded the company. Reply 2 weeks ago   Peter in Colorado Every vacation rental manager should know that Advance Deposits paid by guests must be kept in separate bank accounts until those funds are earned. How was LL able to bypass this basic obligation and use Advance Deposit payments to fund their operations without committing fraud? If fraud has been committed, who is being held culpable? I would like to be able to tell my staff and my clients (who are all losing money on this!) that someone is being held to account for this fiasco! Reply 5 months ago   Cote Property Management So, since there are so many of us who have lost substantial funds due to the mismanagement of Leisure Link, aren’t there legal steps that can be taken? I have sent a message to the Attorney General’s office in California and Utah but wonder what we can do as a group. Perhaps if everyone sends a complaint to the Utah Attorney Generals office, it’s online, easy to fill out, maybe someone will look at the seriousness of this issue. Reply 5 months ago   Matthew Gurley Have you reached out to the channels directly? I’m happy to make an intro. matt@mybookingpal.com Reply 5 months ago   Peter Burns Our company is in the last minute discounts for luxury vacation villa properties. We recently started a financing arm of our company, http://www.hlvillas.com/financing/, that may be helpful to those Property Management Companies suffering because of lost revenue due to Leisurelink’s bk.

Reply 5 months ago   Rhonda Vinje I’m sorry for those that have lost their jobs over this fiasco, however you can find work again. How does one go about getting their money refunded? Who can we contact? Shame on those that robbed us of our hard earned money.That was my 1st vacation in FORTY YEARS!! I can only hope that Karma bites you in the A$$! Reply 5 months ago   Matthew Gurley Hey Rhonda, If you file a chargeback on your credit card it should be refunded by the credit card company. Reply 5 months ago   Rhonda Vinje Hey there…. That’s a negative, we tried that, Chase declined it. But thank you for responding. We paid in good faith & in full using our debit card. I should clarify, we got our vacation, but not our security deposit back. I was thankful the house existed & the key worked in the door knowing now what was going on behind-the-scenes! I will be VERY Leary next time around. Who can you trust today, there’s a scammer on every corner. Reply 5 months ago   Kristen Cherry The difficult part of the merchant of record solution is no OTA has a great system for managing payment or declined cards, which for some of the OTA channels can be a significant percentage, add in the process of making changes and modifications to existing reservations and the business of “handing this over” becomes the easy and necessary solution. Nobody could have foreseen this ending….the theory and vision were there…the execution fell flat. Property managers already have 10 jobs from managing homeowner expectations, wowing guests, maintenance -you name it. Managing the OTA channels from allotment, content, pricing, payments, and promos is just to daunting and unrealistic. Other intermediaries will gain market share – but established infrastructure will be critical. Reply 5 months ago   Displaced Worker from LL Please forgive me as I shamelessly use this platform to solicit employment. Desperate times call for desperate measures! I am among the many blindsided employees of LeisureLink who were left jobless. Are any of you competitors hiring? I was with Hawaiian Beach Rentals before VacationRoost bought them out, then worked with VacationRoost prior to their acquisition of LeisureLink, finally settling in a comfortable position with LeisureLink. Therefore, I have experience in many different sectors of the business. I worked remotely for my entire time with the company- over 5 years in total. I am located in Southern California (Inland Empire). I see that many of you are outside the US. Maybe a remote US employee is just what you need! 😉 However, I have come to terms with the unlikelihood of finding another remote position, so hopefully some of you are local enough to utilize my eagerness to work with you. If at all possible, I would love to stay within the same (or similar) industry. Thanks for your consideration. Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Send me your resume. We are hiring. Reply 5 months ago   Richard Vaughton I have to follow up on Alex’s comment here and is a common discussion point amongst managers and is well placed. Offering up full cash management to a third party is a risky situation. Managers are responsible to owners and this third party cash managament can cascade problems significantly. Look at Vacasol another “mid agent” sitting between contratctors, self marketing and creative channel distribution, now in bankcruptcy procedings and with clients possibly out of pocket. Any technology partner should be that, a conduit to booking success, with a means of transacting money seamlessly through secure, ring fenced bank accounts. Even UK banks will only secure £75K, so collect direct and manage efficiently. Its also not just the question of the being way out of pocket, its the lack of dynamic access to OTA’s on which many now rely. As for the $17m or $34m of however much was involved, it would be interesting to see the full story at some point.. Reply 6 months ago   Leisurelink Employee Alex if Leisurelink posed such a credit risk why did you try to buy them? Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin I think any company’s greatest assets is their employees. Leisurelink had very good, hard working and dedicated staff. It is a shame that they ended up in this situation. Reply 6 months ago   Former LL Employee It is a shame @AlexAydin. We busted our humps and it’s sad and disappointing that it ended like this. No severance either unfortunately. I don’t hold any grudges though. I’m grateful for the opportunity and the experience. Any former competitors out there that are looking to hire, I’d love to send you my resume! I have 3+ years experience working for an Online Travel Distributor as an Account Support Specialist troubleshooting software and listing issues for out clients. I would be a very worthy addition to your team ! Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Send us your resume. We are looking to expand our support team. https://www.mybookingpal.com/sub-careers/applyform?id=2 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Lesson to be learned from Leisurelink   With the situation that former LeisureLink clinets and suppliers find themselves in, it can be a frightening time for property managers. We are hoping that all LeisureLink suppliers receive some, if not all, of the funds that are still owed to them. If, and when, suppliers receive their funds, they are still dealt with the daunting task of searching for another channel manager while the risk of another LeisureLink situation looms in their mind. To avert another LeisureLink situation, property managers must first understand why the situation occurred in the first place. The epicenter of the LeisureLink failure revolved around credit risk and business continuity. Credit risk was due to the model LeisureLink used where they operated as Merchant of Record. In that model, LeisureLink collected the funds given from guests and OTAs and would then transfer the funds owed to the supplier typically after guest departure from the property. This is where the property management risk comes into play. If the channel manager, as the Merchant of Record fails, then the supplier runs the risk of not getting paid. To avoid this as a supplier of properties, choose a channel manager that allows the property manager to act as Merchant of Record. This will allow property managers to receive payments directly from guests or OTAs. As Merchant of Record, property manager eliminates any possibility of credit risk on behalf of the channel manager. Reply 6 months ago   Steve Sherlock @Sean – perhaps Tnooz can discuss this internally, though for those folks making pretty serious accusations and who aren’t prepared to put their name to the accusation, then perhaps those comments should be removed. For all you know those making the accusations are competitors of those they accuse. Bit of a sordid affair all round. Reply 6 months ago   Matthew Gurley This is completely incorrect. I would truly appreciate it if you would stop trolling our company online. This is completely unprofessional and considered defamation. BookingPal is a separate entity and competitor of LeisureLink. If you took 20 minutes with me to look at our platform you would realize it’s completely different. Contact me for more details. Reply 6 months ago   BookingPAL is not your pal All the way at the top, the former President of Leisurelink, Richard Barajas, is now an adviser for BookingPal. I dont believe I would want anyone that helped steer a company into despair advising me on a damn thing. whether he was a current executive or not is irrelevant. A company doesn’t go down in five minutes…its an evolution of piss poor decision making and that very well goes back to the tenure of Richard Barajas and many other idiotic people. He was the President in December 2013 Reply 6 months ago   Matthew Gurley Again. Defamation and incorrect. I advice Tnooz admins to please remove this user from your pages. Our board of directors can be found directly on our website. 1 member used to work with LeisureLink. We are an American built company and only 3 years old in the space, and completely different from LeisureLink. Do some research. Our integrations are different, products are different, channel support is different. BookingPal only supports a fraction of channels LeisureLink did. If this was remotely true we would have the exact same connections right? Please act professional and join us to help LeisureLink users regain access to distribution in a way where they cannot possibly lose money. A key difference between us and Leisurelink is the ability to allow the PM to be merchant of record (something LeisureLink tried and failed to repeat consistently). This way a PM can use us, remain merchant of record, and not have the chance to lose funds in a situation like LeisureLink’s ever again. Reply 6 months ago   Richard Barajas I hesitate to respond to a nameless, non-specific post but I feel compelled to do so until Tnooz recognizes this as defamation and a defenseless position that should be removed. The most important things I’d like to communicate are 1) I’m saddened to see this outcome for LeisureLink. All the employees, including myself, worked hard and did our best for our customers and our company. 2) BookingPal is a top-notch, professional organization with great technology and people. They have built a solid integrated infrastructure from day 1 targeted to serve the Vacation Rental marketplace. I encourage you to contact them and decide for yourself. Reply 6 months ago   Erica We are customers of a property that got screwed over by Leisure Link and guess what? When we arrived to the property they made us pay twice for the room we had already paid for in full, because Leisure Link hadn’t paid them. So guess who really got screwed here? Me the guest and you know what? $500 extra is a lot to me whereas I’m guessing it’s nothing to you Richard Barajas. So now we have paid twice for a room because you and your company. I plan to contact news agencies in Colorado to get the word out about your sham-full business practices. Reply 5 months ago   martin alletson Dear Sir. I realize no one ever wants to go out of business unless there is no other way.

I can loop you in with Expedia and AirBnB. If there are any funds that they were still holding and had not sent to leisurelink already, they can send the funds directly to you. Reply 6 months ago   Former LL Employee I was with LeisureLink for 3+ years and I’m disappointed that it ended like this. How did we come to this point? I believe we should’ve put more energy, focus, and capital on our Technology instead of going out and signing up new clients first and foremost, which I believe caused issues with scalability and ultimately led to our downfall. Any contemporaries out there hiring? I’m located in Los Angeles, CA.

I am aware of another sales organization/channel that went of out business who also owed their suppliers thousands, and I believe the credit card companies were able to help to some degree. Also going forward look hard at who is merchant of record, are there options or structures to help avoid this in the future.

Reply 6 months ago   Colorado PM This is so unfortunate but you wonder how a Harvard MBA and a board of directors that include executives from publicly traded companies waste $30+ millions. LeisureLink was known for big parties at MTS, expensive dinners and over promising. Some account managers were great and feel bad for them. They owe us $200K so many will be unemployed before ski season thanks to an inept management team and board members.

In speaking with Expedia today, they actually invoiced them for all reservation up to and including September 24th. You can’t invoice Expedia until the day of the reservation. So just before they close, they decided to screw us one last time. They currently owe $65,000. We have 45 reservations still on the books for the next six weeks, unfortunately if Expedia can not assure us payment for these, we will be forced to cancel them.

Obviously we are out quite a bit of money also. So for those of us in the hotel business with large sums of money owed by Leisure Link for past reservations what is our recourse? Any talk of a class action lawsuit? I have filed my invoice for “assignment of creditors” but being a small fish in a big pond I am not sure that will make any difference. Reply 6 months ago   Julie Hightower How did you get the paperwork for the “Assignment of Creditors? We didn’t even get the letter that is posted here. Reply 6 months ago   Evie Questions or concerns may be directed to the following: LeisureLink (assignment for the benefit of creditors), LLC P.O. Box 391600 Mountain View, CA 94039-1600 Reply 6 months ago   Alex Aydin Here at BookingPal we have had several of the Leisurelink Account Managers that have joined us and they have been working very closely with their property managers affected to find resolution on existing bookings from various channels and also to get them up and running distributing again with their key level and rep level inventory. We are available to support all distribution and revenue management of LL clients. Reply 6 months ago   Former LL Client No way my company will have anything to do with anyone from LL their employees are calling us daily offering a new platform they are building like we would trust them Reply 5 months ago   Matthew Gurley As long as you are merchant of record you are okay. We brought 3 great employee assets from the LL team onboard that were unfortunately effected by decisions our of their hands. With our product, you are receiving and accepting credit cards, not us or a third party. This means you have no credit risk in using us. I’d be happy to discuss further. Reply 5 months ago   Eric Mason Yes, this is disheartening to hear and unfortunately, this will leave some consumers and suppliers in a very difficult situation. One suggestion for consumers caught up in this is to reach out ASAP to your credit card company to see if there is any relief they can extend. We’ve been talking a lot about this on Vacation Rental Professionals, a Linkedin Group (https://www.linkedin.com/groups/69889) as well. There will be other suggestions on how to possibly handle this and other solutions that can be leveraged in light of this newly created void. Reply 6 months ago   VaycayHero Sad to see the news of LeisureLink ceasing its operations and we wish nothing but the best to them. At VaycayHero, we have successfully transitioned many vacation rental property managers from LeisureLink, and we are actively working to do the same for property managers who are caught in this crossfire. Reply 6 months ago   Rhonda Vinje Great! They have $1000. of my security depsoit Reply 6 months ago   Stupid Property Manager I’d really like to know what happened to the $17 million. It was not distributed to the suppliers – we’re a property manager and they still owe us thousands for winter bookings. Julian strung us along saying it was just due to disorganization because they grew so fast or that they were waiting for payment from Expedia or booking.com. I think Julian has a lot of explaining to do to his employees and suppliers. He’s probably walking away with millions and the rest of us are being screwed. I guess that’s what a Harvard MBA does for you. Reply 6 months ago   Carl They screwed us too! We are a property manager, small company, they owe us $9000. Very painful! Reply 6 months ago   Mike (wife was employee) My guess would be that $17 million was a theoretical amount to be disbursed over time if goals and milestones were met. Putting money into LL was a risky idea and they didn’t get all that money in a lump sum. I know they were hurting to operating money for a while even after securing that money. Reply 6 months ago   Adam Harris Sad news. If any of their team needs a new home we are always hiring @ Cloudbeds Reply 6 months ago   Tim Choate I was very sad to hear about the downfall of LeisureLink. They had strong people and I know worked hard to serve their clients well. RedAwning has opened our doors to help clients quickly transition and maintain their distribution and we are happy to see our industry leading position in vacation rental reservations and channel management expand, while we’d rather see it happen another way. Reply 6 months ago   Jane Doe Just received this from them: Dear Valued Partner, LeisureLink has been helping suppliers of vacation rentals generate bookings through third party channels for over nine years, and has experienced accelerated growth for the past several quarters. Supporting this growth and building the technology solutions for the industry has been a capital intensive process. LeisureLink is privately-owned and has historically met these capital needs with investments from its owners. For the last 12 months, LeisureLink has been working with an investment bank to raise additional equity capital to fund the Company’s growth for the future. The Company expected this process would yield an infusion of needed capital this summer. While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations. As a result, we have no choice but to stop operations and not process any new bookings as of September 27, 2016. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off. LeisureLink values the working relationships built over these last 9 years and appreciates the loyalty of its employees, vendors, customers and partners and is trying to cease operations as smoothly and orderly as possible, given the circumstances. To that end, the Company has agreed to undertake an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors (“Assignment”), which is a process designed to manage an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets and to distribute those proceeds to creditors according to their legal rights and priorities. As required by law, the Assignee will be mailing notices of the Assignment to all creditors in the next 30 days, providing further information about the Assignment and providing creditors with a proof of claim form through which creditors can file a claim for any obligations due.

A legal brief filed Tuesday in federal court in Hawaii listed support from 58 Silicon Valley companies. By comparison, a similar brief filed in opposition of President Donald Trump’s original executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries had 127 signatories. Read: Lyft, Apple, Other Tech Companies Speak Out Against Travel Ban Companies who challenged the original ban but have decided not to pursue the same legal avenues in response to the revised order include Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Intel and Netflix, among others. The companies have yet to disclose why they have opted not to sign on to the most recent brief, though it may reflect the general belief the most recent executive order has been crafted in a way that would pass legal muster. The ban will not be without legal challenges, though. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson ordered an emergency freeze of the executive order, which would have barred citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States and would have suspended the admission of refugees. President Trump has insisted the ban is necessary for national security, and called Watson's order "unprecedented judicial overreach." Read: Hawaii Judge Blocks Revised Travel Ban Tech companies will still have the opportunity to sign on to the brief challenging the order as it continues to move forward through the court system, though none of the big players in the industry have openly expressed their intention to do so. Airbnb, Dropbox, Lyft and Kickstarter are among the companies that have already signed the brief. A representative for Uber told Reuters the company is in the process of adding its name to the filing as well. Much of Silicon Valley spoke out against the original executive order because its implementation left company employees in limbo—especially those working or traveling overseas. The tech industry is heavily reliant on skilled workers from overseas and has a vested interest in making their entry into the country feasible.

(AMD)? AMD stock could be attractive to a number of larger companies By Larry Ramer, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 15, 2017, 1:18 pm EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)? Why Oil Prices Will Surge in 2017 Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)? Recent Posts: Why Oil Prices Will Surge in 2017 Who Could Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)? 3 Health Insurers Getting a Donald Trump Boost View All Posts With its strong positive catalysts and leverage to high growth technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could very well follow in the footsteps of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) and become a takeover target. Given its powerful growth catalysts and high takeover potential, AMD stock is attractive at current levels, despite its huge advance over the last year. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Of course, Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) acquisition of Mobileye was seen as an effort by the chip giant to buy a growth engine. Similarly, AMD’s highly regarded new chips and processors, combined with its significant presence in the rapidly expanding gaming and graphics markets, make the company a growth engine that could easily attract a suitor such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) or International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). AMD’s upcoming Zen chips “are expected to be good,” reported PC World, and Forbes columnist Anthony Leather said of its Ryzen chips, “for anyone that does often use rendering, video editing or other programs that benefit from the extra cores and threads, Ryzen is shaping up to be fantastic value.” Most reviewers found that the Ryzen 7 1800K processor slightly outperforms the equivalent Intel processor, but AMD’s product sells for half the price of Intel’s offering, Leather reported. Moreover, Ryzen processors will be used for video gaming, as are AMD’s Radeon graphics cards. Demand for digital games is growing quickly as mobile games become more popular, new consoles are launched, and virtual reality and augmented reality start to take off. Speaking of VR and AR, “AMD’s Radeon RX 480 (graphics card) can …power virtual reality headsets offered by Facebook Inc’s (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus and HTC,” but the cards have a relatively low price tag, VentureBeat has said, as I noted in this Seeking Alpha piece. So by buying Advanced Micro Devices, an acquirer would obtain access to VR and AR, which are expected to be quite lucrative, PC World has quoted research firm IDC as saying. Specifically, by 2020, 64.8 million VR devices will be shipped, up from an estimated 9.6 million last year, the firm predicted. Some 45.6 million AR hardware products will be shipped in 2020, up from 400,000 in 2016, according to the firm.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Microsoft locks Ryzen and Kaby Lake users out of updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 Microsoft locks Ryzen and Kaby Lake users out of updates on Windows 7 and 8.1 Matthew Wilson 3 days ago CPU, Featured Tech News, Operating Systems It looks like Microsoft is starting to lock down system updates for those using AMD’s Ryzen and Intel’s Kaby Lake processors on older versions of Windows, including Windows 7 and 8.1. Users are now starting to encounter the following error message: “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows”. This message appears when a user attempts to update their OS and a quick look at Microsoft’s support page reveals upgrading to Windows 10 is the only resolution. Microsoft’s support page on the matter says that Windows 10 is the ‘only’ OS to support these updated hardware configurations. You will need Windows 10 if running Kaby Lake or newer, AMD’s Bristol Ridge or newer (this includes Ryzen), or the Qualcomm 8996 and want to receive important updates in order to remain secure. This shouldn’t be entirely surprising news. Back in February we did hear that AMD wouldn’t be releasing drivers for Ryzen running on Windows 7 and Kaby Lake support on older operating systems has been up in the air since last year. That said, Windows 8.1 won’t hit its end of life until next year, so locking that OS out too seems like an overstretch, though it makes sense given Microsoft’s efforts to push people to Windows 10. KitGuru Says: It seems that Microsoft is trying some new methods to get die-hard Windows 7 users to finally make the jump to more up to date software. Are any of you still running an older version of Windows? Would you try sticking to it if building a new system? Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags kaby lake news Ryzen windows 7 Previous 3DMark world record broken with GTX 1080Ti overclocked to 2.5GHz Next be quiet! is giving away a GTX 1070-powered gaming rig Check Also UK pricing for Ryzen 5 CPUs revealed This week, AMD officially announced its Ryzen 5 processor lineup, with plans to start rolling … Arran McDonald proper clickbait title MS didn’t lock them out they are just going to to spend money on software they dont want to support any more so they are just not getting the kernel updates to take advantage of newer instructions offered by the chips, they will run on them OS’s fine just the CPU will be at reduced ability.as older windows have no clue about newer instruction sets. Here is proof https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yXD8BpJMsI Arran McDonald P.S. Matthew Wilson should be fired for wasting internet space with another as he gives no real evidence and have seen personally that this is not the case at all on kaby lake until you can show us this happening this article is a joke, Kitguru is getting just as bad as other sites with clickbait Gary Keen He never said they won’t run the OS at all as you are implying. They’re just not going to get the support patches as mentioned “lock […] out of updates” Matthew Wilson I don’t think you’ve fully understood what is being said here. Nobody said you couldn’t run Windows 7 or 8.1 on a Ryzen or Kaby Lake system. All we said is that Microsoft is actively blocking updates to systems featuring those CPUs and older versions of Windows. Where did this information come from? Well it came from Microsoft, you say I provide no evidence but the link to the support page is right there in the article clear as day. Matthew Wilson Nice to see someone actually read the information and understood what it meant, rather than jumping to conclusions and massively over reacting 😉 Rocky40 I am sorry but if true this is a really stupid move on MS’s part. I can’t see them locking users out of Windows updates because the CPU choice. This would lead to much much unwanted bad press when things go bad. Then again these days who knows what goes on at MS they want to force you to Windows 10 because it is now like a service and the older Windows is more like just standard software that MS can not inject stuff into such as ad’s if they wanted to or completely lock you out of your system or just get user data because of the way 10 is setup that way. I am not wearing a tin foil hat or anything I just know that MS did not give Windows 10 away for free for no reason at all at some point they will want to make money off of all those free hand outs. We will see what the next versions of Win 10 bring to us and how things will play out. I have a feeling at some point down the road we may need ad blockers for the Windows 10 OS itself who knows. Until then if it happens I just plan to enjoy my gaming system. holycow Hmm, so I can get one of these new processors then run Win 7 as a VM under say Linux and get full update support, but can’t get update support if running on bare metal? MS really going out of their way to give the bird to those of us who prefer Win 7. I wonder if there’s a way to change what CPUID values are returned to the OS as a work around. Mario Exactly the reason I’ll never buy another windows product!! JeremyAtticusFinch I don’t see a problem. You can still install Windows 10 and activate it with Windows 7/8.1 product key. There’s no need to purchase a new copy of Windows. If you have software that’s incompatible with Windows 10, Intel and AMD still sell plenty of processors that are supported by Windows 7/8.1. You can also run those applications on a virtual machine. karappo If M$ is going to shove that piece of NSA spyware on my work desk PC then might as well settle for a Skylake Core i7 on my next build and give a middle finger to Intel and AMD by not purchasing their new processors. I can only hope that low sales will cause a PC market crash or something, though I don’t think that’s gonna happen seeing a lot of sheep PC buyers are falling for M$ scare tactics. zero2dash Install updates manually; you don’t need WU to install updates. Use WSUS Offline instead, it’s a lot better anyway. Lucas So your middle finger is to buy their product? And low sales of what? W10 is basically free, and the new AMD CPUs are so incredibly cheap compared to Intel that you’re crazy if you settle for outdated technology. The OS market is and has always been incredibly limited, whether you get screwed by Microsoft or ripped off by Apple. And for the large majority Ubuntu or such is not a viable option. karappo >”So your middle finger is to buy their product?” I was actually referring to not buying Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors. > “And low sales of what?” Of Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors. Those who have the balls to resist M$ will not buy such processors. By opting not to purchase the new batch of processors, I am depriving Intel and AMD some revenue, even if it’s by minuscule amount (like a tiny drop in an ocean). > “W10 is basically free” Yes, but it’s only for those who already have upgraded to W10 back when the free upgrade offer was still available. For new builders who didn’t make it, there’s no such option but to purchase W10 license. >”you’re crazy if you settle for outdated technology” If your definition of updated technology is a spyware-baked OS version and a processor locked to a said OS version then by all means enjoy your new PC. Big brother will be pleased with you. Kane Bunce If they are so interested in creating “NSA spyware” why did they back Apple’s refusal to help the FBI by creating a backdoor for the FBI in iOS? And why have they been in court for 2-3 years challenging a warrant telling them to hand over user data in a server bank in Ireland? Do you think they are ecclectic and not sure what they really want? Or are you perhaps wrong and they simply created a means to collect *anonymous* data that they can use to improve Windows 10? Kane Bunce I think his definition is not having a conspiracy theory with no evidence to back up the belief that MS are lying that the telemetry features of W10 are entirely annoymous, which would make them useless to the NSA. Kane Bunce You are right they did not give it away for no reason. Their reasons were to reduce the number of people on older Windows, which reduces their costs as eventually it gets to a tipping point where there is less versions of Windows that they need to support. The other reason was to make money. They do the latter by selling subscription services like One Drive and apps in the Store. The idea is that these methods will make them more money than the old way of selling Upgrade licences to users as that way never made much revenue. Almsot all revenue from consumers came from the selling of OEM licences. Dromo I prefer Windows Nein , the german version .. However I could live with w10 +classic shell , but would prefer not to (w7) Alana Because a lot of people don’t want to use Windows 10. I know someone who codes for MS and the ad situation is only going to get worse in the OS. Some people would rather just pay for a license and then not have to worry about banners and forced updates and unplanned reboots. Howard Kurtus so what update do i have to uninstall to avoid this Brad Adams The question is.. will WSUS install those “restricted” ryzen/kaby lake updates ?? anyone able to test ? I don’t yet have a suitable cpu to test. Mike Yeah… the NSA REEEEEEEEEEEEALY CARES about what you are doing. What do you pirate tons of software or something? Are you into child porn? Do you traffic drugs online? WHY THE FART DO YOU CARE IF THE NSA IS WATCHING YOU? What you are worried this is the start of some secret overthrowing of mankind? That everything is going to be terrible someday or something? We kill our kids in the womb. Can’t get much worse then that. Screw your petty concerns. dineaudio I don’t care. I use Linux. They can shove their rotten spyware attempt at an operating system where the sun doesn’t shine. In the end only MS employers and shills will use Windows 10 because of this disgraceful abuse of a monopolist position for desktop PCs. People generally use desktop PCs less and less anyway. dineaudio Exactly. All x86 compatible OSes have to work with the new processors just fine. They are trying scare tactics again and many not very computer savvy people will believe that their new computers won’t work with Windows 7 at all. dineaudio You’re trying to be funny mister republican? Unsuccessful. Go troll Trump’s Twitter account. Don’t forget the church on Sunday. dineaudio Do I see a MSCE diploma in the background of your avatar? JeremyAtticusFinch Doesn’t seem like a MSFT problem.

Image Credit: Makeblock Makeblock has raised $30 million in a second round of funding for robotics with an educational twist. Evolution Media China and Shenzhen Capital Group led the financing for Shenzhen, China-based Makeblock, which has created a variety of robots — from aerial drones to manufacturing robots to toy robots. The funds support Makeblock’s expansion into new markets, as well as further product development and diversification of science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) education hardware and software, and curriculum resources for educators, children, and hobbyists. Makeblock’s total funding to date is $36 million. Currently, Makeblock is available in more than 140 countries, with 1,600 channel partners and 20,000 schools and educational organizations implementing Makeblock’s products into their educational curriculum. Above: Makeblock’s mBot robot for kids. Image Credit: Makeblock “We’re excited to support Makeblock at this pivotal point in their growth as they continue to elevate STEM education to a new level” said Jason Ding, president at Evolution Media China, in a statement. “STEM education is the next industry to experience deep disruption, following in the footsteps of the mobile, IoT, and virtual reality industries. Over the past few years, Makeblock has been leading the charge in creating practical products for STEM education in the classroom and at home, and we believe this is just the beginning of their path to transforming education.” Makeblock has seen rapid growth in the past year, expanding its workforce to over 300 employees worldwide. In addition to furthering STEM/STEAM education distribution, this latest round of funding will be used for the development of new initiatives built upon the company’s most recent work with Microsoft, Intel, and beyond. The infusion of capital will also allow Makeblock to expand its global offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, North America, Japan, and the Netherlands. The company will be expanding its retail reach in the coming months, deepening its partnership with Barnes & Noble and SoftBank to put Makeblock products in more stores across the globe. Above: Makeblock’s Airblock drones debuts this spring. Image Credit: Makeblock “Creation is happening everywhere at an explosive rate. From schools using Makeblock to teaching STEM concepts, to tech giants like Microsoft, Intel, Apple Education tapping Makeblock to unleash creativity in the classroom, down to parents at home trying to aid in their child’s education, the true power of Makeblock as a platform is to inspire creation,” said Makeblock CEO Jasen Wang, in a statement. “Our goal is to get Makeblock in every school, every home, every creative space to give anyone, at any age the ability to be a creator or inventor.” The funding will support the launch of Makeblock’s first annual robotics competition later in 2017, which will encourage students to compete with their creative projects using Makeblock’s construction platform. This competition is in support of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s “Thirteenth Five Year Plan” on education, which was announced in 2016. Makeblock’s latest product, Airblock, a modular STEM drone that raised $830,000 on Kickstarter in December 2016, will be available for purchase in retail stores starting May 2017. And on March 8, Makeblock took to Kickstarter to announce a new product — Neuron, a programmable electronic blocks platform for open-ended gadget building. The company was started in 2011.

Swatch, which owns Tissot, plans to take on Android and iOS with its own system for its planned Tissot smartwatches. Mark Lennihan / AP Swatch thinks time is right to take on Apple and Google March 16, 2017 Updated: March 16, 2017 06:33 PM Related Swatch unveils Dubai watch in time for UAE National Day SME profile: Timing now ripe for Dubai retailer of vintage watches Sotheby’s showcases one of the world’s largest Swatch collections – in pictures Swatch warns of uncertainty for major market Hong Kong as profits fall Related Swatch unveils Dubai watch in time for UAE National Day SME profile: Timing now ripe for Dubai retailer of vintage watches Sotheby’s showcases one of the world’s largest Swatch collections – in pictures Swatch warns of uncertainty for major market Hong Kong as profits fall Swatch said it is developing an alternative to the iOS and Android operating systems for smartwatches as Switzerland’s largest maker of timepieces vies with Silicon Valley for control of consumers’ wrists. The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, the Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said ion Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Mr Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. His strategy contrasts with that of the LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Mr Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it is trying to "think small" as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Mr Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. "There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system," he said. "I’m not convinced," said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. "People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object." Swatch’s operating system has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialised in miniaturisation, Mr Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that do not want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter​ Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Strata on track for growth through automation and robots Analysis of Idex deals reveals stronger foundations in GCC defence base Swatch thinks time is right to take on Apple and Google Tesla plans cash boost to bring new Model 3 to the masses MOST VIEWED Business | All Fuel-efficient race inspires Sharjah recycling drive ‘This is 100 per cent not going to help the Dubai property recovery’ India’s demonetisation takes its toll ETFs do the hard work for expat investors like you Economics 101: Private sector hiring can help GCC countries solve the resource riddle Frank Kane’s Working lunch: the music lover who regulates the DIFC Bahraini Islamic investment group GFH appoints two new senior executives Abu Dhabi doctor on fixed-term contract must compensate employer for resigning while under probation Light at end of tunnel for Saudi’s contractors, says Al Khodari Mixed reaction across the UAE economy to US Federal Reserve rate hike More Most Viewed New roads could ease notorious Dubai-Sharjah traffic Multiple accidents slow traffic in Dubai Changing face of Karama causes unease among long-term residents Will Hassan Rouhani be Iran’s first single term president?

Great! Now what? What apps do you need to install to turn it into a productivity powerhouse? It’s hard to know where to begin — the Google Web Store boasts more than a million apps, extensions, themes, and games. I’m here to help. It doesn’t matter whether you’ll be using your new machine for work, games, streaming video, or listening to music, there are some apps that every user needs to have Switching to Chromebook: 8 Apps to Replace Your Desktop Favorites Switching to Chromebook: 8 Apps to Replace Your Desktop Favorites The hardest part about switching to a Chromebook is that you cannot install Windows or Mac software, but Chromebooks are perfect for everyday tasks. These top Chromebook apps can replace your desktop favorites. Read More . Here are my top 10 essential apps to install on a new Chromebook. Note: Gmail, Google Calendar, Keep, Drive, Play Music, Hangouts, Remote Desktop, and Maps come pre-installed so have not been included in this list. 1. VLC Media Player VLC needs no introduction. It’s been the Swiss Army knife of media players for more than 15 years. If you’re a video junkie, it’s a must have. It can play almost every video or audio format you can throw at it, it can read network streams, and can even play DVD ISOs. The Chromebook release isn’t quite a feature-packed as its Windows and Mac counterparts, but it has an equalizer, filters, and a media library, it supports gesture controls, and can display subtitles. It’s more than enough for the vast majority of users. Best of all, it’s completely free. 2. Black Menu Do you remember when Google’s suite of apps was available in a black drop-down menu? Black Menu restores the functionality by adding a clickable icon alongside the search box. It’s a godsend. The Chrome App Launcher How to Make the Most out of the Chrome App Launcher How to Make the Most out of the Chrome App Launcher The Chrome App Launcher is a powerful tool that can do so much more than simply open programs. It can make a range of web-based tasks faster, easier, and more streamlined. Here's how. Read More is one of the operating system’s weakest aspects and can be frustrating to use. Given 95 percent of your time on a Chromebook will be spent in the browser, Black Menu can speed up your workflow significantly. The app follows the current Google aesthetic principles of “Material Design” and includes links to the Play Store, Gmail, Maps, Translate, YouTube, and Drive. You can customize the menu further with your most-used Google apps. 3. Microsoft Office Online Yes, Chromebooks ship with the Google productivity suite, but anyone who’s spent a lot a time switching between Google’s products and Microsoft’s ubiquitous Office suite knows that formatting, images, and fonts can often go awry. Add Office Online to eliminate the problems. The app lets you use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Sway without needing to install the full Office package. Any work you produce in the app automatically syncs with OneDrive. 4. JSTorrent Torrent software has a bad name thanks to its association with piracy, but everyone should have a torrent downloader Downloading Torrents on a Chromebook Downloading Torrents on a Chromebook Has the Chrome OS finally managed to catch up to its rival operating systems to provide a high-quality BitTorrent client? MakeUseOf investigates… Read More installed on their machine. BitTorrent technology remains one of the fastest and most reliable ways to download large files quickly. JSTorrent runs on both ARM- and Intel-based Chromebooks, can handle multi-gigabyte files, and saves all the downloaded content straight into your computer’s Download folder. It costs $2 but is worth the money. It’s got 4.5 stars from more than 3,000 reviews! 5. MightyText You should only download this app if you’ve got an Android phone. It’ll display any notifications from your device in your Chromebook’s own Notifications window, it’ll let you send and receive text messages from your machine, and it works with your existing phone number. For the app to work correctly, you also need to install the Android version on your smartphone. 6. WeVideo If you want to do some video editing on the fly, install this app. It comes with two editing modes: Novice and Advanced. Whether you just want to add a soundtrack to that hilarious video of your grandmother dancing around the Christmas tree, or you need to split, splice, and add themes to a professional video for work, WeVideo has you covered. You can add text and music, insert transitions, drag and drop clips onto a storyboard, add animations to slideshows, and a whole lot more. All the content automatically syncs with Google Drive. There are more 100 free effects and audio excerpts for all users, though the free version will add a watermark 3 Ways to Watermark Your Videos 3 Ways to Watermark Your Videos Are you afraid that someone might rip your video and claim it as their own, potentially stealing away viewers and revenue?

Personal Finance Personal Finance is an easy-to-use household budgeting app 15 Cool Tools for Easy Expense Tracking and Budgeting 15 Cool Tools for Easy Expense Tracking and Budgeting Tracking your expenses and budgeting are two crucial parts of being financial healthy. These 15 apps make it easy to do both. Read More . It’s not as powerful as some of the sector’s biggest names like Mint and Quicken, but it gets the job done. The app lets you organize all your expenses using tabs and folders, and you can share accounts with friends and family on a case-by-case basis. Importantly for a finance app, it works offline. You can even make edits when you’ve not got a connection and all the changes will be synced next time you go online. And you don’t need to worry about security: the app encrypts all the data before uploading it to Google’s servers. 8. StreamDor How do 20,000 free movies sound? That’s exactly what StreamDor gives you. Don’t fret: there’s no illegal content here. All the titles are publicly available movies that SteamDor’s community has lovingly curated. Sure, you’re not going to find the latest blockbusters, but if you’re a dedicated cord cutter Everyone Else Is Cutting the Cord, So Why Aren't You?

And just because there are 20,000 movies, don’t worry about finding something to watch — you can filter by year, genre, country, and language. 9. Polarr Photo Editor I’ve already introduced you to a video editor. Now it’s time to install a photo editor. A few years ago, the Chrome Web Store was a wasteland if you wanted a high-quality editor for your Chromebook Four Excellent Image Editors For Your Chromebook Four Excellent Image Editors For Your Chromebook Do you like editing and tweaking images but find the Chromebook's default editor too limited?

It offers an impressive array of features, including color masking, multiple brushes, support for RAW files, and endless filters, effects, and adjustment tools. If you’ve got a different favorite, make sure you let me know in the comments. 10. Numerics Calculator & Converter Yes, Chromebooks come with a built-in calculator. But it’s not very powerful: if you’re a math and statistics nerd, you need something better. Numerics Calculator & Converter is the answer. It offers significantly more math functions than its native counterpart. If the function you need is not available, you can program it yourself using JavaScript. Just click the wrench icon to get started.

By DiversityInc Staff / March 16, 2017 Dell (No. 28 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list), the broadest Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure solutions provider, introduces the new Dell Edge Gateway 3000 Series that offers customers flexibility, connectivity and real-time intelligence from harsh environments and small spaces. The 3000 Series includes three unique models targeted specifically for use cases and embedded solutions in the industrial automation, energy, transportation, and digital signage markets. With these new Edge Gateways, customers will be able to securely transfer and analyze important data at the edge of the network to glean real-time intelligence from the physical world. Ideal deployments include a vehicle, a refrigerated trailer, a remote oil pump in the desert, digital signs in an elevator or inside of the HVAC units on a roof-top of a casino. “As the number of connected devices becomes more ubiquitous, we know that intelligent computing at the edge of the network is critical. The IoT continues to enhance customer experience, drive business growth and improve lives, making it central to organizations’ digital transformation strategies,” said Andy Rhodes, Vice President and General Manager, Internet of Things, Dell. “The small and mighty 3000 Series opens up new opportunities for our customers and partners to get smarter with their data and make big things happen.” Customers are looking for faster, real-time analysis of the massive amount of data produced by devices on their networks, to perform immediate, smart decision-making. For some, it’s too expensive to move all the data from the edge of the network near the devices to the data center. Computing at the edge helps determine which data sets are interesting, relevant and need to be sent back to the data center or the cloud for further analytics and longer term storage, saving bandwidth and reducing costs and security concerns. Dell offers a complete edge to core to cloud portfolio of infrastructure for Industrial IoT solutions that includes everything from Edge Gateways, security and manageability solutions, data center infrastructure and connectivity. “The new Dell Edge Gateway 3000 Series powered by Intel provides powerful edge analytics in a compact form factor. The series bridges the data needs of traditional operational technology with the manageability demands of IT,” Ken Caviasca, general manager, IoT Group (IOTG), Intel. “We’re excited to continue our collaboration with Dell to help our collective IoT customers connect what matters.” The Gateway 3000 Series joins Dell’s award-winning line of IoT-enabling hardware including the Edge Gateway 5000 Series and Embedded Box PC 3000 and 5000 Series. It comes with the Dell Command Suite and an optional upgrade to remote manageability through Dell’s Edge Device Manager, allowing customers to manage all their Dell IoT devices through a single tool. All solutions benefit from Dell’s end-to-end support services, including the base Limited Hardware Warranty, or optional Dell ProSupport for up to five years, and Dell Deployment services. ProSupport on the Gateway 3000 Series includes proactive, automated support, 24/7 access to ProSupport engineers and Advanced Exchange Service to minimize downtime with a quick unit replacement. There’s also pre-qualification with over 65 technology and service providers in the award-winning Dell IoT Solutions Partner Program; inclusion in more than 20 scalable, repeatable IoT blueprints; and financing options through Dell Financial Services. The Gateway 3000 Series is designed by Dell’s expert team of rugged product engineers and put through a rigorous 10-step testing process. The product line was designed for scale per tens of thousands of hours of feedback through customer advisory councils, industry consortiums and market feedback. The rugged 3000 Series is complementary to its big brother, the 5000 Series, which is designed to excel in fixed use cases that require modular expansion, large sensor networks and more advanced edge analytics. The 3000 Series is ideal for both fixed and mobile use cases requiring smaller sensor networks, tight spaces and more simple analytics. All three models include: Intel Atom processor 2 GB RAM and 8 GB eMMC storage (32 GB and SD card for additional storage options) Ethernet, USB, certified for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE Integrated 3G or 4G LTE cellular options for select countries Support for hot or cold operating temperature extremes from -30°C to 70°C Integrated digital GPS, accelerometers, and atmospheric pressure sensors Support for a wide input power range from 12-57 VDC (with vehicle transient voltage protection) Ability to be powered via Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) An ignition pin for easy operation while connected to a battery powered device Differentiating features between the three models include: Industrial Automation and Energy Management, Model 3001; Multi-function I/O port and programmable serial ports (RS-485/422/232). Transportation and Logistics, Model 3002; CAN bus for land/marine protocols, integrated ZigBee for mesh sensor networks. Digital Signage and Retail, Model 3003; Display Port output for video displays (2560×1600) and 3.5mm line in/line out for quality audio streaming. Dell Edge Gateway 3000 Series is available for purchase in early summer 2017.

The new ADATA XPG SX8000 SSD series blows that away with sequential read speeds of up to 2,500 MB/s (2.4GB/s) and up to 1,100 MB/s sequential write speeds. If you haven’t upgraded your storage drive in years and are still running a traditional hard drive, building a new platform and embracing a M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD like this model will really give you a night and day performance difference. The ADATA XPG SX8000 series features Intel/Micron 3D MLC NAND Flash memory, so it has respectable endurance ratings of up to 640 TBW (1TB model) and all are backed by a 5-year warranty. Some enthusiasts are concerned with TLC NAND based Flash drives and that isn’t a concern with the SX8000 series. The Random Read/Write IOPS is also respectable with up to 160,000 IOPS Random Read and up to 140,000 IOPS. The ADATA XPG SX8000 is offered in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and a soon to be released 1TB capacity. We do find it slightly odd that this drive bares the Xtreme Performance Gear (XPG) product series branding by ADATA, but is available in such low capacities. XPG products are said to consist of high-performance PC hardware that it targeted at gamers and overclockers and we don’t know too many gamers getting a 128GB drive here in 2017 as that would be good for basically just a boot drive. Many tier 1 games titles these days are over 40GB each, so you could only install two games along with Windows 10 on the 128GB model. We also don’t recommend the SX8000 128GB drive as the performance ratings are half that of what we talked about earlier due to less NAND chips being used and therefore there are less lanes connecting the NAND to the 8-channel controller. ADATA XPG SX8000 SSD Series Street Pricing: 128GB ASX8000NP-128GM-C – $69.99 shipped ($0.55 per GB) 256GB ASX8000NP-256GM-C – $104.99 shipped ($0.41 per GB) 512GB ASX8000NP-512GM-C – $199.99 shipped ($0.39 per GB) That said, ADATA offers the SX8000 SSD in two ways. You can either get the bare drive (original version) or a more recently added version that features a custom heatsink bearing the XPG logo. Some new motherboards come with a M.2 heat spreaders, so you might want to look into the motherboard you might be buying to see if you really need one. Is a M.2 heat spreader needed on the ADATA XPG SX8000 series? Absolutely not, but they do look neat if you can see the M.2 drive in your built. ADATA XPG SX8000 M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD Specifications:   SMI 2260 Controller 3D MLC NAND Flash – Intel/Micron L06B DRAM Buffer/Cache: 128GB: 256MB 256GB: 256MB 512GB: 512MB 1TB: 1GB Operating Temperature – 0° ~ 70°C MTBF: 2,000,000 hours 4K Aligned Random Read: up to 160,000 IOPS 4K Aligned Random Write: up to 140,000 IOPS Sequential Read & Write Transfer: Up to 2,500 MB/s Read | Up to 1100 MB/s Write (256GB)/Up to 800 MB/s Write (512GB) Low Power Mode L0: 0.95W (For 512GB model) Low Power Mode L1: 0.33W (For 512GB model) Low Power Mode L1: 0.05W (For 512GB model) Max Power Sequential Read/Write: 4.8/4.5 Watts (For 512GB model) Max Power Random Read/Write: 3.7/4.1 Watts (For 512GB model) Endurance: 128GB: 80 TBW 256GB: 160 TBW 512GB: 320 TBW 1TB: 640 TBW Warranty: 5-Years ADATA went with the Silicon Motion SM2260 8-channel controller on this that has four 8Gbps lanes for data flow and has eight NAND channels. This controller has been around for some time and is generally one that we’d classify as being a mainstream client controller for PCIe NVMe drives. So, ADATA’s high-end SX8000 series should perform as a mid-range M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD in our performance charts. The drive that we’ll be reviewing today today is the original ADATA XPG SX8000 PCIe Gen3x4 NVMe SSD that is 512GB in capacity and sold under part number ASX8000NP-512GM-C. This model doesn’t have a fancy heat spreader, but the SM2260 controller does have s thin copper layer over it for better heat distribution. The black PCB doesn’t look bad and on most boards the M.2 slot is located under a video card and can’t easily be seen through a case window. Flipping the drive over you’ll find two more 13D MLC NAND Flash chips and a spot for more memory, but it is actually populated and being used! The 3D MLC NAND Flash chips are labeled ADATA, but they are actually Intel / Micron L06B parts.  The SX8000 does not require special NVMe drivers to work properly on a PC, but the bad news it that the ADATA SSD ToolBox doesn’t fully support this NVMe drive. ADATA says that the SSD Toolbox utility will be updated in early April 2017 to include a secure erase function for Windows 10 & 8.1 users. Right now thesecure erase command only works with the utility on Windows 7 platforms. Let’s take a look at the test system and then jump into the benchmarks.

My conclusion is if the extra 32GB offered here over the MyDigitalSSD BPX 480GB is not a big deal, it’s better to go with the latter. Right? Nathan Kirsch The ADATA SX8000 runs pretty cool, so for a bad airflow case or laptop it might be the better long term solution. The MyDigitalSSD BPX 480GB drive is certainly one of the best values around right now. Seems like the price is starting to go up on that drive though. Any suggestions on the charts? I’m no Excel master, so any tips or advice would be welcomed! I’m always trying to make the charts better. Rhialto Very interesting, I overlooked this. Thanks!

Did you know these five things about this little chipmaker? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 16, 2017 at 10:00AM Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) is primarily known for supplying image processing SoCs (system on chips) for GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action cameras. As a result, Ambarella's stock often rose and fell with GoPro's in the past. But over the past few quarters, Ambarella reduced its dependence on GoPro while increasing its presence in adjacent markets. That's why Ambarella's stock rallied more than 40% over the past 12 months, while GoPro's stock plunged over 40%. Image source: Ambarella. I've discussed Ambarella's core business many times in the past, but today I'll highlight five lesser-known facts about this little chipmaker. 1. Ambarella isn't Fermi Wang's first company Ambarella founder and CEO Fermi Wang was already a successful entrepreneur when he founded the company in 2004. Wang, who holds electrical engineering degrees from National Taiwan University and Columbia University, was previously the co-founder and CEO of Afara Websystems, which developed next-gen SPARC-based processor technologies for servers. Sun Microsystems acquired Afara in 2002 for an undisclosed sum, making Afara's multi-core, multi-thread CPU a core component of its UltraSPARC roadmap. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) subsequently inherited that technology after it acquired Sun in 2010. Prior to founding Afara, Wang worked at C-Cube Microsystems, where his team developed the world's first MPEG codec chip for video compression. Wang's numerous patents for MPEG video technology became the technological foundation of Ambarella. 2. It's loved by its industry peers and employees Ambarella won the Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) 2010, 2011, and 2012 award for the "Most Respected Private Semiconductor Company" in the industry. After going public in 2012, Ambarella received the GSA 2013 award for the "Favorite Analyst Semiconductor Company" and the GSA 2014 award for the "Most Respected Emerging Public Semiconductor Company." Fermi Wang also notably has a 100% rating on job review site Glassdoor, which is extremely rare in the semiconductor industry. Intel's Brian Krzanich has a 60% rating, while Qualcomm's Steve Mollenkopf has a 67% rating. 3. It serves the top drone maker in the world DJI Innovations, the biggest drone maker in the world, uses Ambarella SoCs in most of its drones. Ambarella doesn't disclose how much revenue DJI contributes to its top line, but Wang stated in mid-2015 that SoCs for drones generated 10% of its total revenues. DJI's Phantom 4 drone. Image source: DJI. Last quarter, Wang noted that drone revenues had fallen both sequentially and year-over-year due to product launch timings, and would remain "pretty volatile." But if demand for 4K drones rises over the next few years, that business will likely become a major pillar of growth. 4. It serves the biggest security camera maker, too Another one of Ambarella's major customers is Hikvision, a Chinese company which is the top security camera maker in the world. Last quarter, Hikvision started using Ambarella's new S3Lm IP camera SoCs in its latest H.265 cameras. During last quarter's conference call, Wang noted that Ambarella didn't get its mainstream HEVC (high efficiency video codec) camera SoCs into production with Hikvision and its rival Dahua last year, but that the SoCs would enter the market this year. Wang claims that move would help Ambarella "get some market share and also grow our revenue." 5. An ideal SoC for tracking first-person movements When Ambarella talks about its core "wearable cameras" business, it's generally talking about action cameras. However, that category is now expanding beyond GoPros with customers like Taser (NASDAQ:TASR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP). Taser's Axon Body 2 cameras, which are primarily used by police officers, are powered by an Ambarella HD SoC. Demand for these cameras has been surging -- especially in the U.S. market -- due to a streak of controversial police shootings. Snap's Spectacles. Image source: Snap. Snap's Spectacles, which caught the public eye last year with their flashy, ephemeral vending machines, are powered by Ambarella's A12W SoC. That low-power chipset is frequently used in body cams, while other variants have been installed in dash cams and drones. The key takeaways Ambarella's future growth still relies on GoPro, but that dependence is clearly waning. Rival action cameras which use Ambarella's SoCs could hurt GoPro, but help Ambarella. New design wins for drones, security cameras, body cams, and dash cams will all help Ambarella diversify its top line away from GoPro -- making it a more reliable long-term play for conservative investors.   Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

 There's a raging talent war for AI experts and its costing automakers millions Danielle Muoio Mar. 12, 2017, 11:41 AM 8,337 facebook linkedin twitter email print Waymo The self-driving car space is getting increasingly more cutthroat. The sheer number of lawsuits filed recently are a testament to that. Tesla, for example, is suing its former Autopilot director Sterling Anderson. The lawsuit claims Anderson stole data for a competing venture, Aurora Innovations, that hasn’t even come out of stealth mode yet. Aurora denies the claims. Buried in that lawsuit, though, was some interesting commentary on the competitive nature of the industry and the kind of culture it has bred: "In their zeal to play catch-up, traditional automakers have created a get-rich-quick environment. Small teams of programmers with little more than demoware have been bought for as much as a billion dollars. Cruise Automation, a 40-person firm, was purchased by General Motors in July 2016 for nearly $1 billion. In August 2016, Uber acquired Otto, another self-driving startup that had been founded only seven months earlier, in a deal worth more than $680 million." (Otto is currently at the heart of a lawsuit filed by Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving-car company, alleging Uber stole intellectual property.) So why is it that tiny startups with little to no brand recognition are getting acquired for millions? AI specialists told Business Insider it has little to do with acquiring the startup’s tech and everything to do with nabbing talent. That’s because there’s a serious lack of experts in the field of deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence where computers learn on their own. Deep learning is key to advancing self-driving tech as it allows cars to learn safe driving at a much faster rate than traditional programming. "The growth of demand is much faster than the rate of which we can produce people with PhDs or even master’s in this area," Yoshua Bengio, head of the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, told Business Insider. "There’s just an explosion of interest from the industry... and it’s like a fire growing on the prairie." Growth in demand AlphaGo plays Lee Sedol in the game of Go. Lee Jin-man/AP Machine learning has advanced rapidly in the last five years. In March of last year, a program developed by Google DeepMind, a London-based AI lab, beat a world champion at the highly complex game of Go — a game that has more moves than there are atoms in the universe. That’s not even the latest feat in artificial intelligence. In January, a bot developed by Carnegie Mellon University beat four of the world’s best poker players at Texas Hold ‘Em, sweeping them of $1.8 million. Companies are only expanding their AI teams as the field rapidly develops. "Because machine learning and artificial intelligence is growing, companies are poaching professors all the time," Geoff Gordon, an associate professor of machine learning at CMU, told Business Insider. But automakers, in particular, are making massive investments in experts because they’ve begun their AI efforts late compared to traditional tech companies. Because deep learning has applications far beyond just self-driving cars, manufacturers are having to compete with each other and traditional tech companies. Only 28 companies have more than 10 deep learning specialists on staff, accounting firm KPMG wrote in a 2016 report. What's more, only six technology companies employ 54% of all deep learning specialists: Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, IBM, Intel, and Samsung. "The traditional power and talent of the auto industry was based in their product development group," Gary Silberg, the head of KPMG’s automotive unit, told Business Insider. "So they would hire these amazing mechanical and electrical engineers at the top schools of engineering and they would be part of product development." "You can’t just turn on a dime and say, 'ok, now we are going to go recruit AI geniuses and computer scientists and expect them to come to work with us,'" Silberg continued. The bottleneck effect Business Insider/Corey Protin Companies pursuing self-driving cars have turned to the universities with the brightest minds in the space to acquire talent. In March 2015, Uber gutted Carnegie Mellon University’s AI and robotics center. The ride-hailing service poached over 50 experts, including Anthony Stentz, who had served as the director for the last four-and-a-half years. A few months later, Uber announced a strategic partnership with the university to create the Uber Advanced Technologies Center for self-driving cars. Andrew Ng, a renowned deep learning expert, left Stanford to become Baidu’s chief scientist in 2014. Baidu has a permit to test its self-driving vehicles in California and has tested its cars in China. Universities are struggling to fill the void left by these poachings. Companies have created a bottleneck where they are looking for talent at a rate that’s impossible to produce, said Bengio, the University of Montreal professor who is considered a pioneer in deep learning. It takes about five years for the average doctoral candidate to get his or her PhD. Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University/Facebook The problem is amplified by the fact that professors are leaving universities to work at tech and auto companies. "The demand for people who want to work in this area is growing but the bottleneck is that there are not enough academic labs, not enough professors to supervise all these students who want to get into this field," Bengio said. Gordon said CMU is definitely seeing an increase in the number of people who want to specialize in deep learning. For the upcoming academic year, CMU’s machine learning doctorate program received 800 applications. It had received 300 applications just two years prior. Bengio said he gets 600 applications every year for students who want to study machine learning at the University of Montreal. He can only teach around 20 students. That growing interest in machine learning is encouraging, but classroom sizes can only expand so much with a limited pool of professors. "There are very few experts in this area until quite recently and many of them are being snapped up by industries because they are in so much of a need for that expertise," Bengio said. "So now you have even less professors than you did just a couple of years ago." A $1 billion going rate Ford The shortage of AI talent means the going rate for specialists is high, especially for startups, which allow companies to acquire talent in bulk. GM bought San Francisco-based startup Cruise Automation for $581 million in March 2016. Uber bought self-driving-truck startup Otto in a deal worth $680 million last August. More recently, Ford invested $1 billion in Pittsburgh-based startup Argo AI. That investment will be spread out over 5 years. Julie Lodge-Jarrett, Ford’s human resources director, said the Argo AI investment is indicative of how Ford has changed its strategy to recruit and retain talent as demand for artificial intelligence experts rises. "As we’ve shifted from being an automotive company to being automotive and mobility we’ve seen an increase need for tech talent," Lodge-Jarrett told Business Insider. "So in places like machine learning or AI or robotics… we see a greater need for ourselves at Ford and also a more competitive market for that particular talent." Lodge-Jarret said Ford is looking to buy more talent in bulk because it also helps them recruit in the future. Argo AI is co-founded by Bryan Salesky, the former director of hardware for Google's self-driving-car efforts, and Peter Rander, Uber's engineering lead at its autonomous cars center. Those kinds of connections make it easier for Ford to acquire the kind of talent that has traditionally worked for major tech companies. Bengio said the Argo AI investment is indicative of how "the game has been in the last couple of years." "The sad thing is most of these are just for recruiting," he said. "It’s kind of a loss for the economy because most often the projects these small companies had don’t continue once they’ve been integrated into the company…. It’s kind of a waste of resources and investment in some sense."

Everybody knows that Microsoft and Apple are competing against each other on a daily basis. The competition doesn’t end at operating systems and it extends to gadgets as well. Last year, both companies refreshed their 2-in-1 product offerings and both Microsoft and Apple have enjoyed high success with their Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro devices. Taking in consideration the fact that both Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro have generated huge amounts of profits throughout 2016, everyone is expecting Microsoft and Apple to refresh their lineup once again. Both Microsoft and Apple have done a good job of keeping their mouths shut when asked about their upcoming devices and didn’t unveil any details. Fortunately, both companies have left hints which showed that they are getting ready to refresh their 2-in-1 offerings. Apple iPad Pro 2 vs Microsoft Surface Pro 5: CPU Power Rumor has it that Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 will be powered by either Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 635 chipset or Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processor. Both of them are capable of providing owners with impressive hardware performances and whichever one Microsoft chooses is going to be a wise decision. On the other hand, iPad Pro 2 is also expected to be fueled by Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake chipset. This processor has been built through a special 14-nm manufacturing process. The reason why this process is special is because it increases the processor’s performances by up to 40 percent which is quite a major performance boost. Apple iPad Pro 2 vs Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Display Surface Pro 5 is expected to ship in the 21 inch, 24 inch and 28 inch display models. All panels will use PixelSense technology and will be able to run 4K resolution media content. Even better, the display will feature a high pixel resolution of 3,840 pixels. Traditionally, Apple launches only two variants of its iPad Pro lineup but this year things are going to change. The highly anticipated iPad Pro 2 will be available in the 9.7 inch, 10.5 inch and 12.9 inch variants. The reason why Apple is doing this is because it wants to cater to different budget-ranges. Additionally, these panels will feature True Tone, 3D Touch and Force touch options.

Apple fans should be happy to know that the Cupertino based tech giant is expected to refresh its iPad Pro offering this year. The already existing iPad Pro models have been quite successful in terms of sales and knowing that Apple is always looking for ways to generate profits, we can be sure that iPad Pro 2 is on its way. The reason why everyone is highly enthusiastic about the upcoming iPad Pro 2 is because it’s expected to bring major changes in comparison with the already existing models. For starters, iPad Pro 2 will be available in three variants and it will be equipped with the brand new A10X processor or Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake chipset. Although Apple has done a good job of keeping iPad Pro 2 under wraps, this hasn’t stopped the tech community from speculating about its specs. We have rounded up the most reoccurring rumors and speculations surrounding iPad Pro 2 and we will present them right now. iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 2: Availability As previously mentioned, iPad Pro 2 will ship in three variants. This is quite surprising since Apple traditionally launches only two variants of iPad Pro. The new model will be the 10.5 inches one and it’s going to be mid-budget oriented. The reason why Apple is including another model is because it wants to cater to different budgets. iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 2: Processor The 2015 iPad Pro is powered by Apple’s own A9X processor. Even though this chipset is impressive Apple is required to upgrade it. All major companies upgrade their processors whenever a new product is unveiled. Rumor has it that iPad Pro 2 will be fueled by Apple’s more high-end A10X processor. This will give it quite a boost in performance. Additionally, if Apple does decide to go with Intel’s Kaby Lake chipset this will not be a bad decision either. iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 2: Apple Pencil 2 All iPad Pro models have been bundled with a special stylus. The stylus come in quite handy since it broadens the range of features iPad Pro is able to provide owners with. The new iPad Pro 2 is expected to come with a brand new stylus. In fact, Apple has actually patented a new stylus that’s been fitted with a rechargeable battery.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel Corp. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. © Corinne Gretler BC-SWATCH-OPERATING-SYSTEM “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. Shares of Swatch rose 1.4 percent as of 1:24 p.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 19.4 billion francs ($19.5 billion). Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Separately, Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets as it published its annual report. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 percent to 9 percent this year. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

After nearly a decade since the launch of the Snapdragon brand, Qualcomm is undergoing a brand redesign of sorts ahead of their next-generation product launches. Starting today, Snapdragon is no longer a processor; instead Snapdragon is a platform. More formally, Qualcomm will no longer be referring to Snapdragon as the “Snapdragon Processor”, but rather the “Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Platform”. Meanwhile at the bottom end of the product stack, the Snapdragon 200 series are getting ejected from the Snapdragon family entirely; they will now simply be part of the “Qualcomm Mobile Platform” family. This rejiggering of brand names is, in all seriousness, exactly as weird as it sounds. But Qualcomm has some reasonably thought-out logic behind it. In the US and abroad, Qualcomm has been promoting the Snapdragon brand in various forms for several years now, and they’ve actually had a fair bit of success at it. Snapdragon may not be a household name, but it’s likely to be better known than Qualcomm. So there is a certain degree of emphasis on making sure Qualcomm doesn’t get overtaken by their own brand name. But the bigger shift here – and the real meat of the story – is from a processor to a platform. To be clear, the hardware isn’t changing; a Snapdragon SoC is still a Snapdragon SoC, and the Snapdragon brand continues to refer to the hardware and its supporting bits. However Qualcomm wants to emphasize that a Snapdragon SoC is more than its CPU. It is a collection of various bits and bobs: a CPU, a GPU, a DSP, a cellular modem, RF transceivers, not to mention the various pieces of software and drivers that Qualcomm develops for their SoCs. Consequently, Qualcomm feels that “platform” is a better all-encompassing word of what they do than “processor”. And they’re not wrong, at least to an extent. While we have various kinds of processors (CPUs, GPUs, etc), “processor” is first and foremost thought of as a CPU. This is a low-level liability for a company that is definitely in competition with Intel, and yet their flagship product is a full-on System-on-Chip rather than discrete components like a CPU with integrated GPU. Furthermore while Qualcomm develops their own semi-custom CPU (Kryo), what really sets them apart from even other SoC vendors are the fully custom non-CPU bits like the modem and GPU. At the end of the day, Qualcomm wants to get more attention and focus on the hardware blocks they have developed and believe give them the greatest edge over the competition. And if they can better differentiate what they do from Intel, all the better. The risk for Qualcomm, besides any potential derailment of the Snapdragon brand, is that “platform” is badly overused across the tech industry these days. Windows is a platform, Twitter is a platform, Steam is a platform. Whereas “processor” was a generic term for a specific part of a computer, “platform” is a generic term for just about any kind of computing environment. So while platform is probably a better fit for an SoC, it’s definitely also more generic. Finally, let’s talk about the 200 series of SoCs, which are now no longer Snapdragon, leaving them as the “Qualcomm Mobile Platform”. While Qualcomm is taking this action at the same time as the above platform rename, the rationale is a bit different. Qualcomm is looking to solidify the Snapdragon brand as a brand for high-end processors, and as a budget SoC line powered by ARM’s Cortex-A7 CPU cores and 802.11n networking, the 200 series definitely doesn’t fall under that umbrella. The fact that Qualcomm is not branding the 200 series as something else does, on the surface, feel a bit odd, but at the same time it wouldn’t make much sense to put money and energy behind promoting a low-end brand. In any case, by removing the 200 series from the Snapdragon brand, Qualcomm will be throwing out the lowest performing member of the family. Which, if all goes according to plan, will make it easier for Qualcomm to better communicate that Snapdragon is a high-end brand.

POST A COMMENT 25 Comments View All Comments MajGenRelativity - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I understand the reasoning for changing it, but Snapdragon SoC would sound more specific than Snapdragon Platform. Reply Mo3tasm - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Exactly why they're avoiding it. Reply Murloc - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link SoC is a technical acronym though. Reply DanNeely - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Are all the RF bits integrated into the SOC? AFAIK the analog parts are traditionally left out since they play best with different process configurations than are used for digital transistors. Reply Matt Humrick - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Only the baseband processor (modem) is part of the SoC. The rest of the RF chain is external. Reply Yojimbo - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link SoC implies a piece of hardware. Qualcomm wants to call it a platform because they want to highlight the software and services that are part of what they offer. Reply Meteor2 - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link I do wonder how much typical consumers care. Reminds me of Centrino. I never did really understand what that meant. Reply Yojimbo - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Yeah, who knows. These are the types of things that get passed around at conferences or just by companies looking at what other companies are doing, I think. For instance, all of a sudden it seemed it was popular for universities all over the country to put climbing walls into their recreational centers. I think being a "platform company" is the latest corporate buzz in the technology world. Certainly it's not just a vapid phrase, though. Companies that provide software and services along with their hardware can maintain higher margins than those providing just hardware. Reply lmcd - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Doesn't help that Centrino went from something like "Snapdragon 400" to "Snapdragon augment platform" Reply socalbigmike - Thursday, March 16, 2017 - link Centrino is still used to this day! It means Wi-Fi on the Dye.

Is Gigabit LTE in your future? By Michael J. Miller March 15, 2017 10 Comments 5G sounds great but is nowhere to be found at the moment. But super-fast LTE could be right around the corner. While 5G was everywhere at Mobile World Congress, we still don't have a standard, and it will take even longer before we have phones that support it. On the other hand, phones which support a gigabit connection over the existing LTE standard were unveiled at the show, promising faster connections. One thing to understand about Gigabit LTE connections is that they require two things—a phone with a modem that supports an advanced amount of Carrier Aggregation or CA (the ability to use multiple groups of spectrum at the same time)—and a network that supports these connections, meaning that it has the spectrum available. Of course, your data plan will likely limit how many high-speed connections you can use. But the idea isn't really to be downloading content at a gigabit per second for an extended period of time, but rather to get the content you need very quickly and then get off the network. This reduces the load on the network and boosts network capacity, as well as enables your modem to stop transmitting, which saves power. Qualcomm introduced the first "Gigabit LTE" modem, the Snapdragon X16 chipset, in the run-up to last year's show; this technology is now part of the Snapdragon 835 application processor. This technology includes support for what is known as 256-QAM digital signal processing, meaning it can pack more bits per transmission; support for 4X4 MIMO, so it can receive data on four antennas, as well as support up to four 20MHz blocks of spectrum using Carrier Aggregation (4x20MHz CA). This modem supports both licensed and unlicensed spectrum using LTE-U (for LTE Unlicensed), which is supported by a variety of operators in the U.S., Korea, India and other markets. Technically, it also supports LTE-Advanced, specifically LTE Category 16 for downloads, with a theoretical peak of 1 gigabit per second, and Category 13 for uploads, with a theoretical peak of 150 megabits per second. (Note that the current Snapdragon 820/821 used in many of today's top phones uses the company's X12 modem, which has a theoretical capability of downloads at 600Mbps. In the real world, congestion and spectrum get in the way.) A couple of companies demonstrated phones using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 at the show, including Sony, which showed its Xperia XZ premium, due out in June. Qualcomm demonstrated this on the show floor, with downloads of just less than 1Gbps. ZTE also had its own speed tests on the show floor. Still, it is widely expected that the first phone that will widely ship with this processor is the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8. Meanwhile, the big networking providers to the telecom industry are also pushing this technology, and both Nokia and Ericsson talked it up at the show. Last week, Sprint said it was actually debuting a network that supports Gigabit LTE in New Orleans, using three-channel carrier aggregation and 60MHz of Sprint's 2.5GHz spectrum; they demonstrated this with an unannounced phone from Motorola Mobility that uses a Snapdragon 835. T-Mobile has also said it plans to roll out a gigabit-capable network in the U.S. later this year, and AT&T has said it expects that some of its sites will also be able to reach that speed sometime this year. Qualcomm is no longer alone in the space. The Samsung Exynos 8895, which is now being marketed as the Exynos 9, also includes its own gigabit modem that supports Category 16 downloads with a theoretical maximum of 1 Gbps using 5 carrier aggregation and Category 13 uploads of up to 150Mbps uplink using 2CA (Cat 13). Again, this is manufactured in Samsung's 10nm process and expected to ship with the international versions of the Galaxy S8. In addition, in the run-up to this year's show, Intel announced its XMM 7560 modem, which supports Category 16 for downloads with a peak theoretical speed of 1Gbps, and Category 13 for uploads with speeds up to 225Mbps. The first modem to be built on Intel's 14nm technology, it enables 5x 20MHz CA for downloads, 3x 20 MHz CA for uploads, 4X4 MIMO and 256-QAM, and works on both licensed spectrum and unlicensed spectrum, where it coexists with Wi-Fi using a technology called License Assisted Access (LAA), which is primarily used by carriers in Europe and Japan. Intel expects samples in the first half of this year and a move into production soon afterward. Not to be outdone, Qualcomm showed off its X20 modem, which is even faster, with a theoretical peak speed of 1.2Gbps, support for LTE Category 18 and 5 x 20MHz CA across licensed and unlicensed spectrum using both LAA and LTE-U. The X20 also supports the 3.5GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service in the U.S. This modem is built on a 10nm process, and Qualcomm says it has begun sampling to customers, with the first commercial devices expected in the first half of 2018. It would seem highly likely that this modem will find its way into an applications processor around that time as well. You may not need all this speed right now, but it seems necessary to support higher resolution video and VR applications. In the meantime, if it helps deliver content more quickly and can improve the networks, that's a win for everyone. Michael J.

Along with service disruption, DDoS attacks have a lasting impact that harms your brand, your revenue and your user experience Nick Ismail The sharp spike in DDoS attacks were headed mainly by the Mirai malware – where storms of DDoS attacks targeted and took advantage of unsecured Internet of Things (IoT) devices to build massive botnets, launching DDoS attacks on a scale that the industry had never seen before. The mammoth proportions of these attacks exceeded 1Tbps – which broke into new thresholds. Worryingly, Mirai isn’t being slowed in its tracks. Instead, researchers are beginning to believe that Mirai is just the start of things to come. Making public the code needed to launch an IoT-powered botnet was a first salvo. Leet, a rival botnet malware, has been hot on the heels of Mirai and used SYN payloads different than Mirai. This saga will only progress this year. >See also: DDoS attacks: why size isn’t everything Intel Security senior vice president and general manager Christopher Young warned that Mirai is thriving in his keynote presentation at RSA Conference 2017. “We can’t think of the Mirai botnet in the past tense. It’s alive and well today, and recruiting new players,” he said. So, it looks like this this is the era of the DDoS of Things (DoT), and by 2020 it’s estimated that there will be 24 billion connected IoT devices, which will add to the growing threat. The DDoS of Things is pushing ahead at full steam, already powering bigger,smarter and more devastating multi-vector attacks than ever imagined. Bad actors use IoT devices to build botnets which fuel colossal DDoS attacks. The DoT is reaching critical mass — recent attacks have leveraged hundreds of thousands of IoT devices to attack everything from large service providers and enterprises to gaming services, media and entertainment companies. As an attack method, it’s now even easier for attackers to commandeer IoT devices for nefarious purposes. It’s common knowledge that many devices have unsecure default credentials and the basic instructions that are available online make it easy for criminals to take advantage. The DDoS-for-hire market is developing at a quick rate. >See also: Major sites shut down by DDoS attack after taking over smart devices In fact, this increased activity has lead Deloitte Global to predict that attacks reaching or exceeding 1 Tbps or more will be commonplace in 2017. Deloitte posits that there will be an average of one 1 Tbps attack or larger per month this year, as the total number of DDoS attacks surpasses 10 million globally. Need more proof? This DDoS of Things infographic has numbers that are as startling as they are informative. For example, there are roughly 3,700 DDoS attacks per day, and the cost to an organisation can range anywhere from £10,000 to £2 million per incident. And once a business is attacked, there’s an 82 percent change they’ll be attacked again. DDoS attacks are damaging, so it’s vital to take precautions to stop the attacks in their tracks. Along with service disruption, DDoS attacks have a lasting impact that harms your brand, your revenue and your user experience. You need to fight back.   Sourced by Dr Chase Cunningham, director of cyber operations, A10 Networks Related Topics ddos DDoS attack DDoS of Things Internet of Things (IoT) Mirai Botnet Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Keep Informed by email Subscribe I am happy to receive updates and offers from Information AgeI am happy to receive updates and offers from carefully selected 3rd parties We do not sell or distribute our subscriber details with other companies or individuals for any reason.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 March 2017 | MYT 7:32 PM US tech group urges global action against Chinese 'mercantilism' For free trade: Since US President Trump's November election win, China's President Xi Jinping (pic) has tried to position China as a champion of free trade. — Reuters BEIJING: A US technology group said in a report on March 16 that China's mercantilist industrial policies were a risk to the global economy and trading system, and called for international pressure on China to force a policy "reset". The report coincided with the release of a separate paper by an influential US business chamber criticising Beijing's "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to dramatically increase domestically made products in 10 sectors, from robotics to biopharmaceuticals. The two groups join a growing chorus of foreign business lobbies crying foul over such plans and the Chinese Government's billions of dollars in subsidies they fear will force members to surrender key technology or weaken their global competitiveness. Technology policy group Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) said China's policies threatened the "entire global economic and trade system". Efforts by the three previous US administrations to engage Chinese officials had "failed", ITIF said, and with China no longer as economically dependent upon the United States, Washington has insufficient leverage to counter Beijing alone. "America cannot respond with either flaccid appeasement or economic nationalism; it must assemble an international coalition that pressures China to stop rigging markets and start competing on fair terms," said ITIF, a Washington-based think tank whose board includes representatives from top companies such as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, Google, and Intel. ITIF urged the United States, along with Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Britain, and the European Union, to jointly pressure China into a "fundamental economic policy reset". A new approach is needed that goes beyond the "naive push for further dialogue and instead makes it clear to Chinese leaders that such unfair, harmful policies cannot be practiced with impunity," ITIF said. US President Donald Trump's trade policy should focus on China and not Mexico, it added, warning that the Chinese Government could "capriciously punish US firms" in response. "But doing nothing due to the fear of retaliation should not be an option," it said. Augmenting global markets  Premier Li Keqiang told China's parliament at the opening of its annual session this month that foreign and domestic companies "will enjoy the same preferential policies under the Made in China 2025 initiative". Since Trump's November election win, China's President Xi Jinping has tried to position the country as a champion of free trade. But such pledges have done little to allay the concerns of China's trade partners. "Chinese efforts to exert greater control over where commercial data is stored and how it is transferred are skewing the decision-making process for companies that must decide where products are made and innovation takes place," the US Chamber of Commerce said in a separate report. "China's subsidy policies not only enhance the competitiveness of domestic companies at home, but also help to augment their competitiveness in global markets," it said. A progressive increase in domestic parts used in high-tech sectors to 70% by 2025 is among targets set out in the plan, which is set to use subsidies, standards, financial policy and government-backed investment funds to reach them. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China last week called the plan "highly problematic". The more vociferous complaints from the American business community in China mark a shift from years past, when many companies eschewed the idea of forceful action by Washington out of fear of retribution from Beijing. Trump's choice for US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, who has long advocated aggressive action against China, told senators at his confirmation hearing on March 14 that he expected the administration would have a "very rigorous enforcement policy". — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Many top SPM scorers feel crushed Prostitution to redemption: A farm girl’s journey Inflation: Friend or foe?

Christine Orlando at March 16, 2017 9:00 am. Comments The world came crashing down on Woz and Stahl as they assured one another’s personal destruction on Shades of Blue Season 2 Episode 2.  Our TV Fanatics Stacy Glanzman, Jasmine Peterson, and Christine Orlando debate whether Woz went too far, who is the weak link, and is Julia expendable after “Eye of the Hurricane.” If one member on Woz’s crew were to turn on the rest, who do you think it would be? Stacy: Hmm, maybe Tess. She's in debt, she was shot, she admits she makes bad decisions...that's all kind of a recipe for disaster. I don't really think she will turn on them, but if she were desperate enough, anything is possible.  Jasmine: I can see that, Stacy. I think Lohman is still a wild-card who can blow things up. I never rule him out of anything. Christine: I think if you put enough pressure on any of them, it’s possible. But I’m going to go with Tess. She’s got two kids and I don’t see her risking prison time for her pals. If she’s given an out, she might just take it.  Were their any winners in Woz and Stahl’s game of one-upmanship? Stacy: Nope, two very big losers. They both lost someone important to them, and they have nothing to show for it. This is what happens when you let emotions get the best of rational thought.  Jasmine: Good grief. Not even close. Woz was a total hothead and it interfered with him thinking logically and long-term. Why screw up the chance to gather valuable Intel via the bug, for the sake of petty machismo? He knew Stahl had all sorts of things on him, and he wouldn't be the type to take anything lying down. Ugh. Christine: No. They made sure that both their worlds are crashing. Either of them could have used that information to control the other, but instead they had descended into a measuring contest to prove who was top dog. Problem is, they both ended up on the bottom.  Do you think Woz should have used that video to ruin Stahl’s chances of getting custody of his son? Stacy: No, as I said before, Woz let his emotions get the best of him, and he didn't think that through at all. He would have been better off biding his time, and seeing if anything else came from those cameras before alerting Stahl to their existence. All Woz managed to do was piss him off, and Stahl got his revenge.  Jasmine: I completely agree. It wasn't a smart move at all. What a waste. It was such a low blow, too. Granted, Stahl did start the whole using kids to get to the parents thing, but damn. Someone needs to brush up on "The Art of War." Christine: It was a stupid move. Woz gave away all his leverage in one move. The point of carrying a big stick is in not having to use it to get what you want. I really thought that Woz was smarter than this.  Watch Shades of Blue Season 2 Episode 2 Online Should Harlee turn Julia in in order to get her crew free of Stahl? Stacy: Ugh, I don't know. I obviously don't trust Stahl as far as I can throw him, so if she were to give up what she knows, she'd have to make damn sure she had an iron-clad agreement getting them out of this mess. I don't see Harlee turning Julia in, at least not this early. They'll try to find another way.  Jasmine: She's already in it deep with Woz. She genuinely wants to be on his good side, and turning in Julia will ruin her chances at that. Also, Stahl is a snake who can't seem to keep his word. It's a hell of a risk for Harlee to take if it'll end with Stahl screwing her over. Christine: If she knew it would save her and her crew, she might consider it, but as was already said, Stahl is such an untrustworthy snake that it isn’t worth it. Honestly, other than Stahl’s untimely death, I don’t see how they get out of this.  What, if anything disappointed you on Shades of Blue Season 2 Episode 2? Stacy: I don't think there was anything specific that disappointed me. Obviously, bad decisions were made, but that's what fuels the drama.  Jasmine: Woz blowing their shot at valuable Intel by exposing Stahl's Harlee fetish? Having to sit through another scene of Stahl letting his borderline sexual predator flag fly after breaking into Harlee's apartment again? Nothing really stood out per se.  Christine: Is there some kind of rule that says that every time Harlee wears her bathrobe that it has to hang open to show as much skin as possible? We get it. Jennifer Lopez is beautiful and sexy, but when a man breaks into your apartment, I think securing your robe is high on the list of things to do.  What was your favorite quote or scene from “Eye of the Hurricane”? Stacy: I think my favorite scene was the end between Harlee and Stahl. It was intense, and I definitely felt on edge. Plus, Stahl is just so creepy. Now that he's lost custody of his son, he's a loose cannon. Jasmine: The Hurricane Sandy flashback when drunk Woz had that father/daughter moment with Harlee, ironically while mourning his actual daughter. So many feels. Christine: I loved this Shades of Blue quote when Woz was strangling Stahl as it made me laugh in a really dark way… When I find you in Hell, I'm gonna do this again. Woz Permalink: When I find you in Hell, I'm gonna do this again. Check back in on Sunday for our Shades of Blue Season 2 Episode 3 review.
