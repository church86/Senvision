ASRock Z170M Extreme4 LGA 1151 Intel Z170 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard Ships from United States. Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Based on the Intel Z170 chipset, the ASRock Z170 Extreme4 is a high-end, feature-rich motherboard that accommodates the latest 6th generation Intel Core processor in LGA1151 packaging. It supports dual-channel DDR4 up to 3466+(OC), and features three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, two 10Gbps USB 3.1 ports (Type A + Type C), and one Ultra M.2 connector to take full advantage of the latest storage technology. A great choice for DIY professionals and overclocking enthusiasts, this motherboard also incorporates premium components and a rich array of performance-enhancing features, like ASRock Super Alloy component selection, Digi Power with six power phase design, Full Spike Protection against surge, lightning and ESD, and Purity Sound that refreshes your listening experience from onboard audio. Plus, with high grade matte black PCB color scheme, this motherboard looks as great as it performs and matches perfectly with your elite-class components. Super Alloy Design Dual-Stack MOSFET for CPU Power Dual-Stack MOSFET (DSM) is another innovative MOSFETs design by ASRock. The silicon die area is increased by stacking two dies into one MOSFET. The larger the die area, the lower Rds(on). Compared to traditional discrete MOSFET, DSM with larger die area provides extreme lower Rds(on) 1.2 mO, so the power supply for the CPU Vcore is more efficient. Nichicon 12K Platinum Caps Supreme 12K platinum capacitors with lifespans of at least 12,000 hours. Compared to other counterparts on high-end motherboards that merely have lifespans of around 10,000 hours, ASRock applied Nichicon 12K Platinum Caps that offer 20% longer lifespans and provide more stability and reliability. * Tested under industry standard 105 degree Celsius ambient temperature. I/O Armor A new designed protective cover for all of the crucial parts near the motherboard's rear I/O, so that they won't easily be damaged by static electricity. Matte Black PCB A new mysterious matte black and copper color scheme to match the prestigious components on ASRock's high-end 100 Series motherboards. High Density Glass Fabric PCB What you’ve never understood about your computer is that it is scared to death of water, H2O, humidity or whatever you’d like to name it. And even though you do not see the water, actually there may be lots of excessive moist in the air killing your motherboard silently and slowly. No, your motherboard doesn’t melt when in contact with water like the wicked witch of the west, but it dies of short circuit. Luckily, ASRock has a new High Density Glass Fabric PCB design that reduces the gaps between the PCB layers to protect the motherboard against electrical shorts caused by humidity. Supports NVIDIA/AMD Workstation Graphics Cards Three PCIe Gen3 x16 slots that not only support ordinary graphics cards, but are also fully compatible with professional NVIDIA Quadro and AMD FirePro workstation graphics solutions. Full Spike Protection Some sensitive digital components on the motherboard are vulnerable to power surges, the excessive current may cause your system to malfunction immediately. ASRock Full Spike Protection includes various technologies to prevent your motherboard’s components from being damaged by these unexpected voltage spikes. Ultra M.2 32 Gb/s (PCIe Gen3 x4 & SATA3) The PCIe Gen3 x4 Ultra M.2 interface pushes data transfer speeds up to 32Gb/s. In addition, it also supports SATA3 6Gb/s M.2 modules, and is compatible with ASRock’s U.2 Kit for installing some of the world’s fastest U.2 PCIe Gen3 x4 SSDs. USB 3.1 10 Gb/s Type-A + C A pair of Type-A and Type-C USB 3.1 connectors is built onboard for delivering up to 10Gbps data transfer rates. Supports DDR4 3466+ (OC) Supports the latest DDR4 memory modules and most extreme memory performance! DDR4 OC Originally an Easter egg, now the hidden option DDR4 OC may be summoned from the UEFI using certain memory modules, such as Samsung or Kingston DDR4 memory DIMMs. It unlocks the hidden potential of those memory modules and maximizes the performance! UEFI EZ Mode EZ mode is a dashboard which contains multiple readings of the system’s current status. You can check the most crucial information of your system, such as CPU speed, DRAM frequency, SATA information, fan speed, etc. Intel LAN Intel LAN provides the best throughput performance, lower CPU utilization, enhanced stability and is able to deliver ultimate network experience to users! Digi Power Unlike traditional motherboards that use analog power, this motherboard uses a next generation digital PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) design, which provides CPU Vcore voltage more efficiently and smoothly, so that the stability and lifespan of the motherboard is greatly enhanced. Six Power Phase Design The power phase design offers smooth power delivery to the CPU, unmatched overclocking capabilities, lower temperature for advanced gamers, and reinforced system stability for taking on all sorts of arduous computing tasks. Flexible PCIe Slots A new flexible PCIe Gen3 x1 slot design that allows users to install add-on cards of all kinds of sizes. * The bandwidth of your devices will be limited to PCIe Gen3 x1. Purity Sound 3 7.1 CH HD audio with Realtek ALC1150 audio codec, Pure Power-In and other technologies to deliver the crispest sound effects.

The diagnostic tool checks for brand identification then verifies the processor operating frequency then tests specific processor features and performs a stress test on the processor. The diagnostic can be configured to execute in one of two modes, presence test mode or verification mode. Additionally, it can be configured to enable (run) or disable (skip) individual default configurations that are used for this mode of operation. Intel processor diagnostic tool test system requirements Multiprocessors Systems The Intel processor diagnostic tool is compatible with multiprocessor systems. It is essential that only one Intel processor is tested at a time in this system configuration. Intel processor diagnostic tool does not support multiple processors inserted into a multiprocessor system configuration. Motherboard & Processor It is essential that the motherboard you use to test your processor is fully compatible with your Intel processor. Consult your motherboard manufacturer's support to ensure the motherboard supports your processor. If you are using an Intel® motherboard, please use this utility: Intel Processors and Boards Compatibility Tool. Motherboard BIOS It is essential that the motherboards BIOS is at the minimum BIOS revision specified to support your Intel processor. Consult your motherboard manufacturer's support to ensure the BIOS revision is at the correct revision. Motherboard Architecture IPDT is only compatible with motherboards built using Intel 32-bit architecture. Over-Clocking Over-Clocking should be disabled while running Intel processor diagnostic tool. Power Management Some power management features (e.g. Intel SpeedStep technology) throttle or reduce the operating frequency of components within the system. These types of power management features may result in very low tested frequency results. This does not mean that the processor is operating at degraded performance levels. It means that the enabled power management feature is optimizing the efficiency of the processor, either to save power or to reduce heat within the system. We recommend you disable any power management features such as Intel SpeedStep technology and configure your system to its optimal power management settings when running Intel® processor diagnostic tool.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here. At a recent investor conference, Intel EVP of Sales, Manufacturing, and Operations Stacy Smith shed light on the company’s new sales strategy for the IoT, The Motley Fool reports. Smith, who was recently moved into the position from his old job as Chief Financial Officer, emphasized that the company will shift its focus to crafting a sales force and strategy that's more aligned by vertical markets, supplying the hardware and software needed to fully supply those various markets. To accomplish these goals, the company will look to create a sales force with specific skills in a space to target markets within the IoT most effectively. While Intel has done well in the IoT so far, this new strategy could help it continue to improve and grow as the IoT matures. Intel has seen steady growth in its IoT group, but the unit is still not one of the larger business segments for the chip designer. But the IoT is so broad — ranging from drones to development boards to autonomous vehicles — for which Intel recently carved out a business segment, that Intel, as well as competing chip designers, may find a number of opportunities to continue their businesses and diversify their revenue streams. The IoT Revolution is picking up speed and when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more. From connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them. Imagine “smart mirrors” that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors. It’s not science fiction. This “next Industrial Revolution” is happening as we speak. It’s so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT?

Both laptops have 8GB of LPDDR3 1866MHz memory and 256GB PCIe NVMe SSDs, so it gave us a great opportunity to compare the performance of Kaby Lake versus Skylake on a laptop! The Dell XPS 13 9360 as we have configured is $1,459.99 shipped while you can still buy last years Dell XPS 13 9350 as we have configured for $1,289.98 shipped.  We loaded up the latest drivers on both the Dell XPS 13 9360 (BIOS 1.2.3) and the Dell XPS 13 9350 (BIOS 1.4.10) and ran over 15 performance tests on them to see what the performance differences were. Core i7-7500U Core i7-6500U Intel Series 7th Generation 6th Generation Architecture Kaby Lake Skylake Process Tech 14nm+ 14nm Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 Base Clock 2.7 GHz 2.5 GHz Max Turbo Clock 3.5 GHz 3.1 GHz Cache 4MB 4MB TDP 15 watt 15 watt Max. Memory 32GB 32GB Graphics HD Graphics 620 HD Graphics 520 Graphics Compute Units 24 24 Graphics Clocks 300 – 1050 MHz 300 – 1050 MHz Tray Price $393 $393 The big difference between the on the Intel Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake processor and the Intel Core i7-6500U Skylake processor is that the new Kaby Lake processors are built using the improved 14nm+ FinFET process and that is critical as those process technology refinements have allowed Intel to get higher clock frequencies without increasing power. That has allowed Intel to gain 200MHz on the base clock and an impressive 400MHz max turbo frequency on the Core i7-7500U over the Core i7-6500U. The other big addition inside Intel’s 7th Generation Core series processors is the addition of a new media engine for HEVC 10-bit (H.265) and VP9 hardware accelerated decoding for improved media performance. Having a dedicated media engine handling video decode is a big deal as it helps ensure media playback is smooth and will improve power efficiency for the latest video formats. Since that is pretty much the only difference between the Dell XPS 13 9350 and the Dell XPS 13 9360 that we have in-house (other than the 802.11ac wireless card and SSD) it gives us the ability to look the performance differences between the two systems. This makes for a great apples to apples comparison of the processors. And for that reason in this article we’ll be focusing on CPU performance and not the other subsystem components.

I get that there is more performance to be had on the kaby, but this would not be enough for me to jump ship for such a small incremental performance increase. Spineman Great review. Thanks. Intel should have just waited on this one. Not enough to warrant an upgrade. They need to acquire Nvidia and get some real graphics pros on board. Yawn! It will hopefully lower the Surface Pro 4 pricing even more as rich boys upgrade to this “power” processor. lol. Greg Zeng Running on battery makes the upgrade very worthwhile. These improvements should also be visible on other products with the new CPU. Patrick DuChene Great article. Its not very often we see such thorough information. Thanks for that. Helps clarify a bit more of the true benefits on Kaby Lake over Skylake. Nice work anon 10% more performance for 10% higher clock speed? If scores are not normalized its difficult to compare when products are sooo similar. The performance boost could be alleged to a higher absolute performance, but its not. Also in the power comsumption chart, HEV (page 8) decoding power use seems missleading. You cannot use a line graph to compare different usages of power because the lines between the points mean a progression which is non existant. Should be a bar chart as well. I like very much legit, and I think you should pay attention to this kind of details. anon The claim is the 14nm+ process achieves a higher clock with equivalent TDP. Nathan Kirsch I get your point on the chart, so I updated it! Thanks for the feedback and we always strive to make the reviews as good as possible! anon This kind of feedback is what makes legit what it is. Kudos for you. Earl Keim Excellent article, Nathan. Nice to see one can have a long flight overseas, etc. and never run out of battery.

Intel May Finally Enable Framebuffer Compression By Default For Skylake+ Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 23 December 2016 at 01:45 PM EST. 8 Comments Intel developers are weighing again the possibility of enabling frame-buffer compression (FBC) support by default for Skylake graphics hardware and newer. Frame-buffer compression by default in the Intel driver comes up every so often while to date so far it's only flipped on by default for Broadwell, but users can still easily enable it for other hardware via a module parameter. But Intel's Paulo Zanoni is feeling comfortable now to send out a patch for enabling FBC-by-default with Skylake "Gen 9" graphics and newer. Intel QA has already tested it and confirmed a "100% pass rate" for Skylake, Kabylake, and Broxton hardware. The patch is here and by the time the Linux 4.11 kernel merge window rolls around, hopefully it will be mainlined. Making use of FBC can reduce power consumption while reducing memory bandwidth needed for screen refreshes. Those wanting to try out FBC on an existing Linux kernel release can use the i915.enable_fbc=1 module parameter. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The Linux Foundation The Zephyr Project is still a babe in the technological woods, so it’s only fitting that the open source real-time operating system is driving an innovative wearables solution that aims to improve healthcare for infants. At the recent Embedded Linux Conference Europe, Teresa Cauvel, CTO and co-founder of Chicago-based neonatal health technology startup Neopenda, explained how her company built a neonatal monitoring bracelet for hospitals in the developing world using an Intel Curie module running Zephyr. The complete talk, called “Leveraging IoT Biometrics and Zephyr RTOS for Neonatal Nursing in Uganda” can be seen in the video link below. Cauvel and co-founder and CEO Sona Shah came up with the idea for Neopenda as graduate students in biomedical engineering at Columbia University. The partners hoped that a new U.N. Sustainable Development goal for ending preventable deaths of under 5-year-olds by 2030 would provide numerous opportunities for technological innovation. “With IoT we can reimagine what’s possible in global health,” Cauvel told the ELCE audience. Cauvel and Shah decided to develop a wearable for neonatal patients in the first 28 days after birth. They focused on developing countries where 98 percent of preventable neonatal deaths occur and where every year 46 million newborns have complications at or around birth that require special care and treatment. Some 3 million newborns die from these complications. However, 80 percent of the victims die from preventable causes or could have saved by affordable treatments. “Reducing infant mortality is a solvable problem,” said Cauvel. The problem is being attacked on several levels, from improving transportation to hospitals to developing better treatments for pre-term birth, birth asphyxia, and severe infections. Neopenda is focusing on improving pediatric hospital care. When researching the problem in Uganda in 2015 with the help of the Uganda Paediatric Association, the co-founders discovered there were large unmet needs in monitoring and diagnosis. “Early detection of distress is really key in newborn care,” said Cauvel. “We want to help staff better manage a large quantity of patients. There are so many critically ill newborns that need care and not nearly enough nurses, doctors, equipment, and supplies. Typically, you might see two nurses responsible for 50 to 75 babies. Standard equipment like vital signs monitors is often prohibitively expensive.” In early 2016, the partners founded Neopenda with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, as well as grants from Cisco and Vodafone. They started working on a prototype for a wearable vital signs monitor designed for newborns in low resource hospitals. The wearable, which is due to enter trials in Uganda in 2017, is strapped to infants’ foreheads, and measures heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and temperature. “These are all of critically important vitals to track in newborns,” said Cauvel. “They show danger signs when conditions are changing, and help monitor health status.” The biometrics devices wirelessly communicate to the central monitor, which can be a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, where results are displayed with visualizations. “Health workers can view the status of all the babies and be alerted in real time when newborns are in distress,” said Cauvel. “It helps the staff triage while also providing more detailed information to guide treatment and diagnosis.” Prototyping: From Arduino to Curie In choosing a technology platform, Cauvel and Shah had several key requirements: The device needed to run on batteries using minimum power, and be rugged enough to resist dust, heat, humidity, and wear and tear. It needed good support for wireless and sensor technology, and be sufficiently scalable to support larger hospitals as well as clinics. It also had to be highly affordable. Neopenda aims to reduce the cost to about $50 per wearable, which is very low for medical monitoring devices. The initial prototype was built around an Arduino Uno, followed by a model that used the Uno’s ATMega328 MCU breadboarded with WiFi and the most essential components. Power considerations led quickly to swapping WiFi for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which also raised fewer questions about radiation risks. The current iteration uses the Intel Curie module, which runs Zephyr on an x86-compatible Intel Quark SE CPU. The dime-sized Curie offers the advantage of being smaller, more affordable, and more power efficient than an Arduino. It also furnishes an ARC EM4-based sensor subsystem and a built-in BLE radio, and its 80KB of SRAM makes it more suitable for complex BLE applications. The Curie’s interfaces between these components and the Quark SE saved a lot of time, as did the availability of a Curie-equipped Intel Arduino 101 board, used for prototyping. Meanwhile, the Curie’s pattern matching engine and 6-axis sensor may hold potential for future applications, said Cauvel. The ARC subsystem controls the Curie’s 12-bit ADC, which “enables us to make accurate DSP measurements,” said Cauvel. The device incorporates a LilyPad MCP9700 temperature sensor, as well as a pulse sensor from pulsesensor.com. Neopenda developed an algorithm that derives the respiratory rate from the pulse rate. For pulse oximetry, the developers breadboarded a sensor using red and infrared LEDs with a TSL235 light-to-frequency converter. To generate a blood oxygen saturation measurement from this setup, “we multiplexed between the two LEDs to calculate the absorption ratio, and used the GPIO driver and its callback API to calculate frequency,” explained Cauvel. Zephyr played a key role in the success of the wearable prototype, thanks to its modularity, support for constrained systems, and more advanced capabilities compared to the Arduino IDE. “Zephyr turned out to be a big step up from Arduino because it supports the ARC core, the DSP subsystem, and the x86 host concurrently,” said Cauvel. “Zephyr also supports multi-fibers and interrupts for complex sensor manipulation and communication so it can cleanly handle the data coming in from different sensors simultaneously.” The developers also benefited from “Zephyr’s rich support for drivers and sensors, as well as sample code and a reliable SDK with cross tool chain,” said Cauvel. “There was already a BSP supporting the Arduino 101 with tool chain to compile for the DSP subsystem in the ARC processor and the host processor. This enabled quick installation of the compiler and tool chain in just a couple of hours, and with the help of the Eclipse IDE, we were able to get the GDB debugger working with DSP and host.” Cauvel went into more detail about various past and current modifications of each sensor algorithm. Currently, most sensor readings are close to the reliability range of expensive commercial sensors, except for respiratory. “We may need to add Fourier transforms to get better accuracy on respiratory,” said Cauvel. The company has also developed an Android app that interprets the BLE signals and displays data and visualizations. Cauvel is confident the device will be ready for trials in Uganda in 2017. Neopenda is working on getting a CE mark for certification, and they will need to get approval of the government of Uganda. The plan is to expand in East Africa and beyond. Soon, Cauvel hopes to give thousands of newborns in low resource settings “the healthy start they deserve.” Watch the complete presentation: Log in or register to post comments Print This Like  (0 likes) Click Here!

The Dell XPS 15 computers are designed for performance-demanding users seeking near bezel-less laptops with above-average performance at a moderate price with a plenty of upgrade options. The new XPS 15 9560 will receive Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050-series graphics as well as some other optional upgrades not available on current-gen, but will retain the internal architecture and external design. According to the listing (now removed from the website) Dell’s upcoming XPS 15 9560 notebook will use either a dual-core Intel Core i3-7100HQ, a quad-core Core i5-7300HQ or a quad-core Core i7-7700HQ CPU. The aforementioned chips are not yet formally announced, but it is known that they are based on the Kaby Lake microarchitecture and will thus offer improved performance compared to predecessors due to higher frequencies, Speed Shift v2 technology and other refinements. For those who opt for iGPU rather than a discrete model it is important to note that the Kaby Lake CPUs also has an improved video encoding/decoding engine. The next key enhancement of the XPS 15 9560 over the current-generation XPS 9550 will be NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050 GPU with up to 4 GB of GDDR5 memory. NVIDIA has yet has to announce a mobile version of the GeForce GTX 1050, but it is highly likely that the product is based on the GP107 GPU featuring the Pascal architecture and up to 768 stream processors, similar to the desktop version. The new graphics chip should offer a decent performance upgrade when compared to the GeForce GTX 960M used in the current-gen XPS 15. Meanwhile for those planning to play demanding games it makes sense to look at the GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070, which means the Alienware 15. Since the new Dell XPS 15 9560 will retain the chassis of its predecessor, it will support similar InfinityEdge 15.6” display panels: an IPS FHD (1920×1080) or an IGZO UHD (3840×2160) with 100% AdobeRGB color gamut and touch support. Physical dimensions of the unit also remain intact with the predecessor: it weighs around 1.8 kilograms and is up to 17 mm thick. For storage, the new Dell XPS 15 will use either Seagate’s SSHDs or PCIe SSDs with up to 1 TB capacity. Meanwhile, due to improvements of Kaby Lake’s memory controller, the new laptops should be compatible with DDR4-2400 memory, offering an additional performance boost over DDR4-2133 used today. As for connectivity, the XPS 9550 uses Rivet Networks' Killer 1535 802.11 2×2 Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 controller, has one Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 2.0 headers, an HDMI output, a 720p webcam and an SD card reader, which essentially means that there is nothing for the XPS 9560 to upgrade here (at least, not without a major redesign of the whole PC). However, since the XPS machines are often used like workstations, Dell decided to add a fingerprint reader with Windows Hello support as an option. Since Dell has already taken down the XPS 9560 product page (technically, it is there, but without any data), so prices and exact final configurations / availability dates remain under wraps. Still, being a close partner of Intel and NVIDIA, Dell is typically among one of the first to release PCs based on the new CPUs/GPUs. Therefore we expect the new systems to arrive shortly after CES in the usual XPS 15 price range that starts at $999 and ends at ~$2500 for high-end models.

POST A COMMENT 100 Comments View All Comments rhx123 - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link I wonder if this will again have a poorly implemented TB3 port that only runs at half the PCIe bandwith it should. Reply BillBear - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link It doesn't offer two Thunderbolt controllers yielding four Thunderbolt ports, so why would it run out of available PCI lanes from the CPU? Reply rhx123 - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link The TB3 controller is only connected to the chipset via 2 PCIe lanes. Either a BIOS issue or hardware. Reply ddriver - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link Intel's mobile chips often have a very limited number of pcie lanes. You can't connect to lanes you don't have. Also, for most of the TB devices it is a non-issue, still plenty of bandwidth for even the most demanding devices. Reply Pneumothorax - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link I think the biggest hindrance is the 1/2 PCIe lanes really hits the performance of a eGPU TB3 implementation. Reply ddriver - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link It will be probably like a 5% hit, most likely hidden by the cpu bottleneck. IIRC pci-e 2 x4 vs x16 had negligible difference. And th3 at 50% is pretty much pci-e 2 x4. Bandwidth is mostly important for asset loading, and this usually happens in between levels, not during gameplay. Besides the XPS is not really a gaming product. eGPU will be a corner case. Reply Samus - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link Exactly. You are unlikely to notice a performance hit unless you have a massive GPU. Besides, this already has an embedded GPU, all you need TB3 and USB-C for are accessories, data storage and monitors. TB3 on two lanes can easily drive a pair of 4K monitors. Reply johnp_ - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link I'd rather have a version without the mobile GPU and then connect the now free PCIe lanes to 1 or more Thunderbolt ports + use the space for battery. The Intel HD Graphics is powerful enough for all my mobile usage and and anything more demanding (e.g. gaming) is usually contained to specific places, where one or more external and more powerful GPU(s) can easily be attached to the device anyway. Reply Nexing - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link +1 The Audio PRO world is also needing the XPS 15 mobility with a still large screen, together with a Thunderbolt port (because its extreme low latency), to be used with the now ubiquitous and not expensive Thunderbolt DACs (DigitalAnalogueConvertor). Those standards are nowadays a given, thus it would be welcomed if a second Thunderbolt port feeds either widescreens when at the studio, or translates into USB3, eSata or whatever good connector in order to hook up the Virtual Instruments and extensive Libraries from hopefully biggish SSDs. This way DELL's 2017 15 XPS may very well become the centerpiece of several mobile audio (and possibly video) professionals. It will indeed be the "up to this time" powerful Macbook, that was not released some weeks ago. Reply ddriver - Monday, December 26, 2016 - link Several audio interface makers have already been able to implement a walk-around for USB audio latency by using proprietary protocols supported at driver levels. That pretty much renders the latency advantage of TB obsolete. Plus TB audio interfaces are still at TB2 and adapters are costly. It is simply not worth it, as a TB audio interface comes with a hefty price jack already. TB still has a slight edge, but the difference is not as pronounced as compared to previous generation USB interfaces, so it is really not worth the price premium. Because at extremely low round trip latency, hardware becomes the bottleneck, so when you throw real time processing in the mix, the end difference is minuscule. For example, a TB interface may have as low as 2 msec round-trip latency, while a USB interface comes with an additional 1 msec penalty, so for unprocessed audio TB has a 50% advantage, but when you throw even some basic processing at it, that will add like 2 more msecs, making 4 for TB vs 5 for USB, advantage dwindles to 25%. For a practical real world scenario the advantage of TB vs "hacked" USB is negligible. At this point the price premium for TB is simply NOT worth it. For example, a scarlett 2i2 costs 150$ while a clarett 2 - the comparable TB product is 500$. That's 333% higher price for like 10% lower latency. Simply not worth it. All TB products are shamelessly overpriced, thanks a lot intel...

The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they’ve seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ AP-SITE Intel Group via AP, File TORONTO – The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they’ve seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were kidnapped in 2012 while travelling in a mountainous region of northern Afghanistan. In a video uploaded to YouTube earlier this week, Coleman — sitting next to her husband and two young children — urges governments on all sides to reach a deal to secure the family’s freedom. Boyle’s parents, Patrick and Linda Boyle, said they watched the video on Monday, getting their first glimpse at their young grandsons. “It is an indescribable emotional sense one has watching a grandson making faces at the camera, while hearing our son’s leg chains clanging up and down on the floor as he tries to settle his son,” the Boyles said in a written statement. “It is unbelievable that they have had to shield their sons from their horrible reality for four years.” The parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife have tried to protect their children by pretending their signs of captivity are part of a game being played with guards. “It is simply heartbreaking to watch both boys so keenly observing their new surroundings in a makeshift film studio, while listening to their mother describe how they were made to watch her being defiled,” the Boyles said. The video came to public attention through the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. The group said the video was dated Dec. 3. In the clip, Coleman says her family has been waiting since 2012 for somebody to understand the “Kafkaesque nightmare” they are living. “We understand both sides hate us and are content to leave us and our two surviving children in these problems but we can only ask and pray that somebody will recognize the atrocities these men carry out against us,” she is heard saying. The Boyles said their daughter-in-law could not have used a more accurate term than kafkaesque. “The absence of a clear course of action to escape a complex and bizarre situation that seems it may be somewhere between fiction and reality. Overpowered and constrained by others beyond their control, but striving to break through nonetheless,” the Boyles said. They said the video appears to confirm that those holding their son and family captive “want to bring this to an end soon.” “They prefer to reach an understanding during this brief period of the American presidential transition,” the Boyles said. “It also confirms the seriousness and immediacy of the captors’ threats to our four family members.” The Boyles said they hope all governments involved will bring their son’s case to a safe resolution soon. A spokesman with Global Affairs Canada said the federal government is “deeply concerned” about the safety and well-being of Joshua Boyle and his family and calls for their unconditional release. Coleman’s parents say they are hoping U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will broker her release if President Barack Obama doesn’t succeed before he leaves office. Jim and Lyn Coleman, of Stewartstown, Pa., spoke to ABC’s “Good Morning America” Wednesday, saying they took solace in seeing their daughter and grandkids looking healthy and in seeing the children for the first time. “You just want to reach out, you know, and hold them,” Lyn Coleman said of her grandchildren. “And that’s very difficult.” Joshua Boyle and Coleman vanished after setting off in the summer of 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan. Coleman’s parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an Internet cafe in what he described as an “unsafe” part of Afghanistan. In 2013, the couple appeared in two videos asking the U.S. government to free them from the Taliban. Coleman’s parents received a letter last November in which their daughter said she had given birth to a second child in captivity. A video released in August showed Coleman and Boyle warning that their captors would kill them and their children unless the government in Kabul ends its execution of Taliban prisoners.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News Motherboards ASRock Fatal1ty and Extreme4 Z270 motherboards detailed ASRock's new Kaby Lake-supported Z270 motherboards get detailed ahead of CES 2017 By: Derek Strickland | Motherboards News | Posted: 1 week, 5 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Specs and details ASRock's new Fatal1ty and Extreme4 Z270 motherboards have surfaced, giving us a good look at the boards ahead of their CES 2017 showcase.     With Intel's seventh-gen Kaby Lake CPUs on their way, hardware-makers are busy readying their fleets of new 200-series motherboards, giving consumers lots of possible upgrade mobo paths to Z270 chipset adoption. ASRock's new Fatal1ty Gaming K6 and Extreme4 mobos use the LGA1151 socket and support both 7th-gen Kaby Lake and 6th-gen Skylake processors, and also have native support for Intel's new high-end Optane 3DXpoint 3D NAND SSD storage lineup.     Let's start with ASRock's Extreme4 Z270 motherboard. This is a standard ATX motherboard that features HDMI, DVI-D, and D-Sub display slots (no DisplayPort), three PCIe 3.0 x16 lanes (two of which are outfitted with steel bracing) that support up to three AMD GPUs in CrossFireX or two NVIDIA GPUs in SLI.     The Extreme4 Z270's four DDR4 DIMM slots can power up to 64GB of dual-channel DDR4-3866 memory. Storage outlets include eight SATA III 6Gb/s ports and two M.2 sockets.   The Extreme4 features eight USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 3.1 ports (Type-A and Type-C) on the rear. Onboard LED and RGB lighting on the header splash some style to the mobo.     The ASRock Fatal1ty Gaming K6 Z270 ATX motherboard is almost identical to the Extreme4. The differences include a Dual Intel LAN, Creative SoundBlaster Cinema 3 audio, all-steel PCIe 16x slots, gold audio jacks, and of course the red-on-black color scheme.   ASRock should showcase these motherboards in full at CES 2017 in January, so keep a look out for that coverage.   NEWS SOURCES:Videocardz.com Recommended for You Motherboard makers are excited for AMD's new Ryzen...

By Ian King. Added by Agency Staff on 22 December 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Elon Musk, Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Tesla Tweet Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang When Paulina Sliwinska, a fund manager at Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford & Co, made the trip to Silicon Valley looking for the next big thing in technology, she found it — not in a hot start-up run by a 23-year-old whiz kid just out of Stanford, but in a 23-year-old semiconductor maker that’s had the same chief executive since its founding. Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of graphics chip maker Nvidia, has won over Sliwinska and many other investors this year with claims that his products, once confined to the niche of computer gaming machines, are breaking out to become key components of nascent technologies from voice recognition to self-driving cars. “He’s so engaging,” said Sliwinska. “Even from this point the opportunities in front of it over the next 10 years are astonishing.” After she met Huang in August, the fund added to its position and is now the 10th largest holder. The company is the best performer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year, outpacing the number two stock by a multiple of almost three. Under Huang, Nvidia has built itself into the leading supplier of graphics processors, the chips that deliver the ever-more-realistic images that make computer games so immersive and addictive. For most of its history, that’s been a relatively small market, with the much bigger businesses of computer processors and smartphone chips dominated by Intel and Qualcomm. This year, though, Huang’s longtime belief that the fundamental advantages of his graphics chips would give them a broader role in fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has begun to pay off — and is buoying Nvidia’s earnings. In the third quarter, demand for chips used in data centers and cars helped fuel a 54% surge in sales, and profit doubled to a record. That performance was the result of years of investment in the hardware and software aimed at enabling computers and cars to think for themselves, according to Huang. The stock surged 30% on 11 November, the day after the earnings report. Yet there was no victory lap from the CEO — his company is going to battle in markets also targeted by famously fierce rivals Intel, whose annual R&D spending is twice Nvidia’s revenue, and Qualcomm, which has the largest cash balance in the chip industry. “The only thing we can guarantee is the velocity with which we innovate,” Huang said in an interview at the time. Nvidia declined to make Huang available for comment for this story. Huang, 53, runs Nvidia like it’s still a start-up, making snap decisions and demanding fast execution, according to those who have worked for him. For a semiconductor maker, that’s no small feat: designing a chip, getting it ready for market and then having it manufactured can take years and costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Chip companies publish road maps that reflect those intricate details, and they build their organisations around it. Decisions on what to make in multibillion-dollar plants requires extensive planning. At Nvidia things can happen a lot faster. In the space of a short meeting hosted by Huang, an executive trying to give an update on progress of a new chip design might find himself silenced as Huang calls an engineer to check on a technical question — then instantly decide the project’s dead or make the call to head in a different direction. Huang has long clung to the belief that graphics chips would play a key role in technological innovation. But past efforts to spread their use, such as in phones, have failed to catch on or taken a lot longer to deliver tangible results. While the annual advent of a new high-end GeForce chip from Nvidia has long been viewed as a gift from above for computer gamers — many of whom think nothing of paying more for one component than most ordinary users would for a whole computer — Nvidia as a company had been less revered in general until this year. Its stock has struggled to rise higher than US$35 in the 17 years since it first went public. The shares closed just above $105 on 20 December. Some investors and analysts who follow Nvidia the most closely have missed that run-up. The reason: they’ve heard Huang’s pitches before — such as when he was touting the company’s future as a provider of smartphone chips — and initially wrote off his predictions about artificial intelligence and self-driving cars as no different from previous forays that fizzled. “Jen-Hsun didn’t dial it up or dial it down — he was just as enthusiastic about the automotive opportunity as he was for Tegra,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners, referring to the company’s mobile phone chip, first announced in 2008. Jen Hsun-Huang with Tesla CEO Elon Musk The Tegra line of chips was Nvidia’s attempt to get into smartphones, which Huang correctly pointed out were on the cusp of transforming computing and communication. Yet because he and others underestimated the importance of an integrated cellular connection, Nvidia’s offering failed to win significant business. Unlike other companies that lost out to Qualcomm, Huang didn’t close down the project — instead Nvidia fielded its own game console, called Shield, as a way to try to create a market for Tegra and showcase its abilities to potential customers. While Shield never challenged the dominance of Xbox or PlayStation, the product led to orders for Tegra from Nintendo, which made the chip the heart of one its new game systems. “It was more or less a science project internal to Nvidia, and now Nintendo has adopted it,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “That’s another example of them pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, creating a market and then giving it to their customer.” Little sleep The CEO gets little sleep, even on holidays, because he stays up late into the night reading everything he can get his hands on that concerns Nvidia and its businesses, no matter the language — he is fastidious about translations, which he has staff ready to deliver whenever he needs them. While founding Nvidia and building it into the largest maker of graphics chips has made him a billionaire, he still runs the company with the paranoia and drive of someone scared it might fail at any moment, according to those who have worked for him. In public he speaks in soft tones, using careful pauses for emphasis and employing Silicon Valley’s patois to answer specific questions with broad, lofty discussions that contain grand assertions. Within the company, he has little patience for subordinates who aren’t making the grade and will call them to scream whenever he deems it necessary. The way he describes it, Huang has always been fighting the bigger guy. He likes to tell the story of how his Taiwanese parents sent him to be educated at what they thought was a private school in the US when he was a child. The institution in Kentucky turned out to be more of a reform school, where he was one of the smallest guys in a rough environment having to get by on his wits and form alliances with the big kids. Huang’s grown-up bête noire, Intel, is located just across the 101 freeway, which runs the length of California’s Silicon Valley. This other Santa Clara-based chip maker is also the world’s largest. Analysts who in the past have been unwilling to bet on Huang’s vision and execution have cited Intel’s ability to build other computer functions into its processors as an existential threat to Nvidia. Indeed, Nvidia’s chipset business disappeared almost overnight when Intel decided to build that technology into its products, starting in 2008. Still, Intel has never fielded a graphics chip good enough to persuade high-end computer users to switch from Nvidia. And now Huang’s company is trying to muscle in on the rapidly growing market for chips used in data center servers, Intel’s most profitable business. Data flood Traditional data centres are stacked with machines powered by Intel’s most expensive server chips, and many would-be competitors have been trying to break Intel’s lock on the market. Now, the flood of information created by connected devices and online services is overwhelming conventional computing’s ability to analyze and put this data to use. Based on work Nvidia has been doing for several years, graphics chips are increasingly being programmed to run artificial intelligence systems that can perform tasks such as recognising images and speech lightning-fast, without the help of humans. While Intel processors are extremely fast at performing complex operations, they have a limit in terms of their ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time. That’s where graphics chips have started to make inroads with their ability to perform a much larger number of smaller tasks in parallel. Google and Amazon.com offer graphics-chip-based computing as part of their cloud services. While graphics technology is making headway, the majority of data centre work is done by Intel’s microprocessors and there are efforts by suppliers of other types of chips to tailor their less-power-hungry products for the market. For now, investors think Nvidia is leading efforts to provide the main engine for artificial intelligence. “They’re in one of the hottest spaces,” said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager for Synovus Trust Company. “You’d have to put them at the top of the list right now. They seem to be positioned really well.” In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s data centre revenue, at $240m, was up from just $82m a year earlier. But that’s barely scratching the surface of a market where Intel has more than 99% market share in processors. The larger company’s server chip business delivered more than $2bn in profit on $4,5bn of sales in its latest quarter. In cars, one of Huang’s passions, Nvidia is aiming to provide the computing engines that will someday make vehicles better than humans at driving. While Tegra is used to run entertainment systems, Nvidia has produced more powerful graphics chips to do the work of taking inputs from radar, cameras and other sensors to build an electronic picture of what’s going on around the vehicle. There’s no shortage of competition from other chip makers, though, and last year Nvidia didn’t make it into the list of top 10 providers of silicon to automakers. One chip maker that did, NXP Semiconductor, last year bought another, Freescale Semiconductor. Now that combined company is being acquired by Nvidia’s mobile nemesis, Qualcomm. The Nvidia CEO’s willingness to make rapid changes of direction has already manifested itself in cars. Once famous for his love of Ferraris, Huang is now posting pictures of himself on his driveway surrounded by Teslas. Probably no coincidence: the first new version of his complete computer for self-driving cars was delivered personally to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia’s technology is the basis for Telsa’s next version of its driver-assistance technology.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet sid_SrIDdhar347 And here I am thinking that Musk becoming the Tony Stark of the real world is all but nonsense. Looks like Musk is moving his chips very carefully and strategically. Forming an alliance with one of the most dynamic person on earth for creating some revolutionary technology is all but a Huge Step into the not-so-distant future. WTG, Huang and kudos Musk.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Dec 22, 2016 at 7:04AM NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a great growth stock this year, soaring more than 200% on robust sales of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and CPUs for connected cars. But as I mentioned in a recent article, it isn't a great dividend stock. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's forward yield of 0.6% is much lower than the S&P 500's average yield of 2.1%, and its dividend hikes have been unpredictable, with one hike this year, two hikes last year, but no hikes at all in 2014. Investors looking for better income plays should check out three other chipmakers instead -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Intel Shares of Intel have only advanced 5% this year, due to sluggish growth in its core PC and data center markets. It also abandoned the mobile market after failing to secure a significant market share with billions in subsidies, its Internet of Things (IoT) business faces tough competition from ARM-licensed rivals like Qualcomm, and new x86 chips from a resurgent AMD could throttle its sales of PC chips next year. Despite those challenges, analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 6% and 15% this year -- indicating that its growth will remain slow but steady. Its trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 18 is much lower than NVIDIA's P/E of 66 and the industry average of 22. Intel pays a forward yield of 2.8%, which is comfortably supported by its payout ratio of 48%. Over the past 12 months, Intel spent 46% of its free cash flow (FCF) on dividends, indicating that it has plenty of room for higher payments. But like NVIDIA, Intel hasn't been consistent with its dividend hikes -- its quarterly dividend stayed at $0.23 for three years before finally being raised to $0.25 in 2014, and to $0.26 in 2015. Qualcomm Investors looking for a better balance between growth and income can consider Qualcomm, which has surged 33% this year but still pays a forward yield of 3.1%. That dividend accounted for 53% of Qualcomm's earnings and 44% of its FCF over the past 12 months. Qualcomm has hiked that dividend annually for 13 straight years. Image source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm's rally might seem odd, since analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 1% and 6% this year. Its mobile chipmaking businesses, which generates most of its revenue, faces sluggish smartphone sales, competition from cheaper rivals like MediaTek, and first-party ARM chipsets in Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi devices. Meanwhile, its patent licensing business -- which generates most of its profits -- faces defiant smartphone OEMs and regulators that claim that its cut of the wholesale price of each device sold (up to 5%) is too high. Qualcomm has expanded into adjacent markets -- like wearables, drones, and connected cars -- to offset those declines. Its acquisition of IoT chipmaker CSR and its upcoming purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors will both pivot the company away from mobile devices. Even after crushing the market this year, Qualcomm stock still remains fairly cheap at 17 times earnings. Texas Instruments Investors looking for more predictable dividend hikes should consider Texas Instruments, the diversified chipmaker that has promised to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders with dividends and buybacks. It's raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years, and pays a forward yield of 2.7%. Those payments were covered by 48% of its earnings and 39% of its FCF over the past 12 months. TI doesn't make high-powered application processors like Intel or Qualcomm. It mainly produces cheaper analog and embedded chips for connected cars, industrial machines, wireless infrastructure, consumer electronics, and enterprise systems. That diversified customer base allows growth in certain markets to offset cyclical declines in others. However, TI remains highly exposed to Apple, which accounted for 11% of its revenues last year. Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP, which will create the world's biggest automotive chipmaker, could also hurt its automotive chip business. Analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 2% and 12% this year, but its P/E of 25 -- which was inflated by its 33% rally this year -- remains lofty relative to its industry peers. The bottom line There are plenty of reasons to buy NVIDIA, but its paltry dividend isn't one of them. Intel, Qualcomm, and TI all offer better yields at lower valuations, but investors should carefully weigh their strengths and weaknesses to see if they're good long-term income plays.   Leo Sun owns shares of QCOM.

Qualcomm Investors looking for a better balance between growth and income can consider Qualcomm, which has surged 33% this year but still pays a forward yield of 3.1%. That dividend accounted for 53% of Qualcomm's earnings and 44% of its FCF over the past 12 months. Qualcomm has hiked that dividend annually for 13 straight years. Image source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm's rally might seem odd, since analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively rise 1% and 6% this year. Its mobile chipmaking businesses, which generates most of its revenue, faces sluggish smartphone sales, competition from cheaper rivals like MediaTek, and first-party ARM chipsets in Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi devices. Meanwhile, its patent licensing business -- which generates most of its profits -- faces defiant smartphone OEMs and regulators that claim that its cut of the wholesale price of each device sold (up to 5%) is too high. Qualcomm has expanded into adjacent markets -- like wearables, drones, and connected cars -- to offset those declines. Its acquisition of IoT chipmaker CSR and its upcoming purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors will both pivot the company away from mobile devices. Even after crushing the market this year, Qualcomm stock still remains fairly cheap at 17 times earnings. Texas Instruments Investors looking for more predictable dividend hikes should consider Texas Instruments, the diversified chipmaker that has promised to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders with dividends and buybacks. It's raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years, and pays a forward yield of 2.7%. Those payments were covered by 48% of its earnings and 39% of its FCF over the past 12 months. TI doesn't make high-powered application processors like Intel or Qualcomm. It mainly produces cheaper analog and embedded chips for connected cars, industrial machines, wireless infrastructure, consumer electronics, and enterprise systems. That diversified customer base allows growth in certain markets to offset cyclical declines in others. However, TI remains highly exposed to Apple, which accounted for 11% of its revenues last year. Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP, which will create the world's biggest automotive chipmaker, could also hurt its automotive chip business. Analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 2% and 12% this year, but its P/E of 25 -- which was inflated by its 33% rally this year -- remains lofty relative to its industry peers. The bottom line There are plenty of reasons to buy NVIDIA, but its paltry dividend isn't one of them. Intel, Qualcomm, and TI all offer better yields at lower valuations, but investors should carefully weigh their strengths and weaknesses to see if they're good long-term income plays.   Leo Sun owns shares of QCOM.

McIntyre December 22, 2016 6:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Most of the 30 components of the Dow have risen by double-digit percentages this year. Four are up over 30%. These double-digit stocks have helped put the Dow up over 14% this year to 19,942. Five stocks will keep it from topping 20,000. Pfizer Despite the fact that the huge pharmaceutical company raised its dividend by 7%, it has disappointed investors with three quarters of poor guidance. In its most recently reported quarter, at $0.61 Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) missed Wall Street earnings per share (EPS) estimates by two cents. Looking forward, management was more pessimistic than expected. Pfizer chopped its EPS forecast for the year from a range of $2.38 to $2.48 to a new range of $2.38 to $2.43. Whatever rally the Dow stages, Pfizer will be a boat anchor. Investors have no reason to believe its prospects will improve until early next year, if at all. Coca-Cola Coke’s old CEO is out, and another Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) executive is in. That probably has little to do with Coke’s major problems, which will not be easy to solve. The first is a relentless drum beat from health experts about the dangers of sugar. As obesity and diabetes grow across most of the developed world, the old snacks are being replaced by healthier foods. In the emerging markets, slowing economies may undermine consumer spending. Coke has few large markets where it can turn to for growth. Intel The huge chip company restructured early this year. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) plans to fire 12,000 people, which is over 10% of its global workforce. More recently, it let go the employees from its wearable division. Intel has shrinking opportunities as it moves away from the low-end PC chip market and toward mobile and server markets, which are already awash in competition from firms that have been in those businesses for years. Note that shares of chip maker and rival NVIDIA are up the most of any stock in the S&P 500 so far in 2016. Apple Between fights with the European Union over billions of dollars in taxes and worry that the iPhone 7 will not have a holiday home run, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has reached a near-term cap. In addition, its offshore manufacturing has been a perfect target for Donald’s Trump’s plans to punish American companies with workforces or supplier workforces that are largely overseas. There is also a growing body of evidence that Apple is struggling in China, to a large extent because of competition from local mobile companies Huawei, OPPO and Xiaomi. CEO Tim Cook says Apple’s success hinges on China sales. General Electric The world’s largest conglomerate has failed at a series of reinventions, one of the biggest of which is a recent plan to move away from the financial services business that nearly swamped General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) during the financial crisis. Management recently backed its guidance for the year ahead. And the company plans to sell its water business and part of its industrial division. GE’s aviation business worries investors as the market for large commercial planes slows. GE’s mining and drilling infrastructure operations have a limited future, unless oil exploration and commodities metals prices have a large bounce back.

Think of it like a powerful, do-it-yourself Netflix that gives users remote access to videos and pictures. As a service, Plex continues improving with new community-requested features. However, Plex isn’t as simple as downloading software. Unlike Netflix or Hulu, Plex requires a server. Users are responsible for setting up their own server. And that requires hardware. (For those new to Plex, check out our awesome Plex manual Your Guide To Plex - The Awesome Media Center Your Guide To Plex - The Awesome Media Center Love your digital collection of movies, TV shows and music, but hate using clumsy interfaces to play them on your TV? It's time to check out Plex, the ultimate media center software. Read More .) Plex Media Server Specs When it comes to HTPC hardware, you may assume that the graphics processing unit (GPU) is the essential part. In fact, most recent integrated GPUs are perfectly sufficient for pushing 1080p and sometimes even 4K content. With a Plex server, you don’t even need a monitor. Rather than a powerful GPU, you’ll want a beefy central processing unit (CPU). Plex recommends generally an Intel Core i3 or better. For transcoding, you need a processor with around 2,000 PassMark for a 1080p stream and 1,500 for 720p. Whether you’re building your own or buying a pre-built system, operating system is a major factor. Plex Media Server runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD. Pre-Built Plex Server If you’re opting for a pre-built system, you really don’t need a fancy machine. Don’t be tempted by a gaming PC, as that’s plain overkill. Unless you plan on running your Plex server off of a machine that doubles as your primary computer, you can snag something much more affordable. Mac Mini ($690/£500) Ads by Google The Mac Mini consistently ranks as one of the most popular devices for a Plex server. Notably, it’s also a top pick as a Plex client. Mac World has a great write up on using the Mac Mini as a Plex server. While the Mac Mini does have a higher starting price, its small footprint and stellar specs make it a great choice. The i5 clocks in around $700 with 8 GB of memory and a 1 TB hard drive. For power users, the 1 TB of storage may be skimpy, but higher configurations are available. However, a cheaper solution for adding more storage space to a Mac Mini is simply getting a high-capacity external hard drive. The i5 reportedly carries a PassMark just under 4,000 while the i7 configuration has a 5204 PassMark. An i5 Mac Mini should be fine for one 1080p stream and a 720p, and the i5 should handle two 1080p streams. Although the Mac Mini might not be the most powerful pre-built machine for the price, it makes a solid Plex server. Its small form factor means the Mac Mini may double as a home theater PC (HTPC). Plus, Macs tend to benefit from a long life span anecdotally speaking. Even the 2015 Mac World write up used a 2011 Mac Mini and found it perfectly suitable. So longevity, form factor, and little set up posit the Mac Mini as a top pre-built solution for a Plex server. Pros Long life span. i5 or i7 available. Up to 2 TB. Little to no configuration required. Doubles as an HTPC. Cons Cheaper options available. Limited storage options for power users. No optical drive. System76 Meerkat (Starting at $480) The System76 Meerkat is a neat little device. It’s a Linux PC that’s ready to use out-of-the-box. The Meerkat comes with an Intel Core i3 or i5 and up to 2.5 TB of storage space. What makes it an excellent Plex server is its 4″ footprint and energy efficiency. Thus, the System76 Meerkat provides a great option for a Plex server that won’t jack up your power bill if you have an always-on system. However, the Meerkat isn’t exactly cheap. It starts at $449. I recommend the i5 if you’ll have multiple transcoded streams running. The i3 offers a 3,915 PassMark score and stepping up to the i5  raises it to 4,330. If you have a massive media collection, you’ll want to max out the storage which will further drive up the final price. But it’s easily upgradeable and a quality device that comes preloaded with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or 16.10. System76 also makes a variety of laptops and desktops Three Awesome Linux Laptops You Can Buy Right Now Three Awesome Linux Laptops You Can Buy Right Now Linux is amazing, unless it won't install. Then it just hurts. Fortunately, a number of laptop makers build Linux laptops that don't suffer from any driver or software faults. Read More that run Linux out of the box. Pros Tiny footprint. Doubles as an HTPC. Lots of configuration options. Out-of-the-box Linux solution. Easily upgradeable. Cons Pricey with options. No optical drive. HP Wave (Starting at $530) The HP Wave is not only a rather beefy PC, it comes in a small, visually pleasing package. PCWorld dubbed the HP Wave “pretty and powerful.” It’s also an excellent Plex server with this combination. There’s even a speaker built in, though audiophiles will benefit from a separate set up. Lots of configuration options offer a tailored PC experience. CPU choices range from an i3 to i7. There’s up to 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. Storage options go up to 2 TB for standard hard drives and there are even SSD options. Its graphics hardware won’t top benchmarks in The Witcher 3 or Titanfall, but the HP Wave boasts support for up to two 4K displays with either the Intel HD 530 or optional AMD R9 M470. Unfortunately, the graphics aren’t upgradeable. In fact, the Wave is not very expandable so this may be a downfall for power users. But for those who want an aesthetically pleasing, powerful, and flexible PC as a Plex server, the HP Wave is perfect. Pros Aesthetically pleasing. Powerful. Lots of configuration options. Small footprint. Good GPU. Cons Not easily upgradeable. DIY Plex Server You can easily make your own server. There are nearly limitless options, but the main factors you’ll want to prioritize are CPU performance (PassMark rating), size, and energy efficiency. Though AMD typically offers a better price to performance ratio, its lower PassMark scores mean Intel is likely the better choice. If you’re going the DIY route, you may want to consider a Linux distro as your operating system since it’s free and helps to cut down on the overall cost. Raspberry Pi ($60) Oh, the Raspberry Pi. Arguably the most utilitarian and functional product ever made, a Raspberry Pi is capable of performing the functions of both Plex server and client 3 Ways to Set Up Your Raspberry Pi as a Media Server 3 Ways to Set Up Your Raspberry Pi as a Media Server Which media center application should you install on your Raspberry Pi? Several options are on offer, and we're going to walk you through them now, looking at the features, advantages, and disadvantages of each. Read More . Most use the Pi as a client. However, RasPlex or Kodi plugins can turn the Pi into a cheap Plex server solution. Check out Element 14 for a spectacular write-up on running a Plex server off of a Raspberry Pi. For this solution, I recommend the Raspberry Pi 3 as it’s currently the most powerful Pi board available. However, you can probably guess that transcoding will be poor. The Pi 3, equipped with its quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A53 simply isn’t up to heavy or even moderate 1080p transcodes. But for a cheap Plex server, the Pi can’t be beaten. It’s likely the most inexpensive option aside from re-purposing hardware you’ve got lying around. Pros Inexpensive. Easy to set up. Energy efficient. Small footprint. Cons Under-powered for transcoding. Intel NUC ($125/£120) The Intel NUC line is excellent as an HTPC and a Plex server. htpcBeginner published a fantastic write-up on why you should use an Intel NUC as a home theater PC. For a bit more info on what a NUC is and why you would want one, check out our awesome breakdown What's a NUC and Why Would You Want One? What's a NUC and Why Would You Want One? NUCs can best be described as barebones, small form-factor PCs -- and they're pretty awesome under the right circumstances. Read More . The same logic follows for a Plex server. They are quiet, utilitarian, and well priced. There’s even a Reddit Plex thread on using a NUC as a server. An i7 costs around $450 and can handle two to three simultaneous 1080p transcodes. The Skylake i5 can handle about two, with the Skylake i3 capable of running one or two. On the low end, a Broadwell i3 can take a single 1080p transcode. Energy savings and small footprint make the Intel NUC a winner. Unfortunately, while RAM and hard drives are upgradeable, the CPU and GPU are not. GPU performance isn’t as essential, but since the CPU is the biggest factor in transcoding and streaming, this could be a downfall for some users. Still, it’s an inexpensive device and offers excellent specs for a Plex server. Alternately, go with the high-end line (UK) of NUC for even more power. But be forewarned these only take m.2 SSDs so you’ll pay a premium for storage. Pros Small footprint. Energy efficient. Range of CPU options. RAM and hard drives upgradeable. Cons CPU and GPU not upgradeable. Requires m.2 SSDs. Gigabyte BRIX ($500/£880) Gigabyte’s brand is synonymous with awesome mini PCs. The BRIX line provides a smattering of options. But for a Plex server, a Gigabyte BRIX equipped with an i5 or i7 is your best bet. The GB-BXi7-5775 features an i7 CPU and Iris Pro 6200 integrated graphics that are capable of pumping 4K video. The BRIX supports an mSATA SSD and traditional 2.5″ laptop hard drive. Plus, it’s compact and may even be mounted to a monitor. The BRIX is a stellar PC for either an out of the way Plex server or HTPC. Even so, it suffers from minor drawbacks. The CPU and GPU are non-upgradeable. However, small size mixed with the powerful i7 help this ultra compact PC overcome any potential downfalls. Notably, the i5 variations are still awesome choices and save a bit of cash at the expense of a slightly lower PassMark score. Pros Small footprint. Powerful Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Up to an i7 processor. Cons Nonupgradeable CPU and GPU. i7 is pricey. ThinkServer TS140 ($220) The ThinkServer TS140 is marketed as a server, but it’s essentially a desktop. IBM’s hefty ThinkServer is a powerful and capable potential Plex server. Outfitted with either an i3 or a Xeon CPU, it’s a fantastic solution that consistently gets plugged in Plex communities like this Reddit thread. And this one too. The i3 boasts a PassMark score of 4,764 whereas the Xeon ThinkServer TS140 clocks in at 7,042. The base model Core i3 can, therefore, handle two 1080p streams while the Xenon can tackle almost four. Yet the ThinkServer TS140 does not include an operating system or hard drive. You’ll need to supply those yourself. Additionally, the TS140 has VGA out, lacking DVI, HDMI, or Displayport. You may add a graphics card which alleviates this potential nuisance. But especially if you plan to run a headless server, this should not present a problem. Pros Excellent PassMark score. Just add an operating system and hard drive. Can handle almost four 1080p streams (Xeon). Good overall value. Cons No hard drive. No operating system. Large footprint. NAS Plex Server While lots of users employ a desktop or laptop as a Plex server, Network Attached Storage (NAS) are perfectly suitable. Opting for a NAS-based Plex server affords loads of storage at a lower price. However, the tradeoff comes at computing power. Usually, NAS devices have low-power. While this is excellent for power-saving if you’ve got an always-on Plex server, a NAS Plex server may struggle with transcoding. There’s a useful compatibility doc that gives a detailed spec breakdown. Not convinced you need a NAS? Here are seven reasons 7 Reasons to Use a NAS for Data Storage & Backups 7 Reasons to Use a NAS for Data Storage & Backups External hard drives are great for data storage, but there are many more benefits to using a network-attached drive instead. Here's everything you need to know. Read More to use a NAS for data storage and backups. Western Digital My Passport Wireless Pro ($250/£196 for 2 TB) Western Digital remains at the forefront of storage with consistently high-performing hardware. The My Passport Wireless Pro is a breakthrough. The ready-made Plex server is the first NAS that’s Plex ready from the get go. It’s even battery-powered making it a portable solution. PC World dubbed the My Passport Wireless Pro the equivalent of a “self-contained Netflix.” Yet this newfound freedom doesn’t come cheap. The 2 TB iteration retails for $230, while the 3 TB version is $250 at regular price. Sure, that’s quite a lot of storage, but the My Passport Pro is unable to transcode on-the-fly. Thus, you may need to convert media to properly ensure that your Plex client is able to stream your content. However, this is a common downfall of NAS-based Plex servers, and if you’re going the NAS route the WD My Passport Wireless Pro is absolutely your best bet. Pros Wireless built-in. Battery-powered. Ready-to-go Plex server. Cons No on-the-fly transcoding. Pricey. Synology DS-216+ ($300/£220) The Synology DS-216+ lends itself well for use as a Plex server. 9to5Mac even reviewed the Synology as a Plex server with glowing feedback. Synology makes Plex available as an app for the DS-216+ and it’s just like downloading an app on your iPhone or Android. Since set up is pretty simple this could be a great option. As long as you don’t have to transcode much. If you do, you may find the Synology a bit under-powered. Pros Energy efficient. Lots of storage options. Easy Plex install. Cons Under-powered for transcoding. Expensive. QNAP TS-x53A  ($580/£395) and TVS-x71 ($950/£1179) QNAP offers a solid NAS that’s Plex server ready. A neat feature, QNAP includes the QvPC feature that allows a NAS so serve as an HTPC. Flaunting HDMI out and decent processors, QNAP produces some of the best NAS Plex solutions available. The TVS-x71 series is available with up to an i7, 16 GB of RAM, and four to eight hard drive bays. It’s got an HDMI out and can handle 720p and 1080p transcodes. The TVS-x71 features a maximum capacity of 64 TB. The mid-range TS-x53A features Intel Braswell Celeron quad-core processors. Its 8 GB of RAM, up to eight hard drive bays, and two HDMI outputs shape this QNAP NAS as a viable Plex server. However, the Celeron processor may not handle larger 1080p transcodes very well. But it’s available for less money and should address the average user’s needs. Pros NAS can act as a PC/HTPC. HDMI out. Lots of storage and configuration options. Cons Slower transcodes with TS-x53A. CPU not upgradable. Final Thoughts: What’s the Best Plex Server? Setting up an awesome Plex server for your multimedia needs is a lot easier than you think. Chances are you may have an old desktop or laptop lying around that’s suitable as a Plex server. However, buying or building a PC or NAS offers the convenience of a separate device than your daily driver. Regardless of your decision, you’re probably better opting for an Intel CPU (sorry AMD) because of transcoding and power efficiency. But for AMD fans, there are options for pretty cost-efficient and energy-saving builds like this one Build a Leaner, Greener, Meaner HTPC with AMD's New AM1 Platform Build a Leaner, Greener, Meaner HTPC with AMD's New AM1 Platform This article covers the various components, with suggestions, for building an AM1-based media center or office productivity desktop.

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU Industry News 2 Intel seeks to adapt silicon transistors to quantum computing by Mark Tyson on 22 December 2016, 12:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadcji Add to My Vault: While computing rivals such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google are looking at completely new technologies from which to develop quantum components, Intel is seeking to adapt silicon transistors for the task in hand. As the MIT Technology Review reports, Intel engineers in Portland, Oregon, and researchers in the TU Delft's QuTech quantum research institute in Holland, are working together to adapt Intel's silicon based technologies and manufacturing for quantum computing. A $50 million grant was established last year to provide funds for these research activities. Last month Intel engineers asserted that they "can now layer the ultra-pure silicon needed for a quantum computer onto the standard wafers used in chip factories," wrote Technology Review bureau chief, Tom Simonite. Now it seems that Intel is in one way more advanced than its competitors and yet in another way it is behind. In its favour it has the expertise and equipment used to make conventional chips with billions of identical transistors - required for any kind of broadly useful computation power. Furthermore, it has just achieved the above milestone of ultra-pure silicon layering. On the negative side for Intel, its rivals can already run code on prototype chips with several qubits. Silicon qubits can't be demonstrated right now but they are likely to get to that point, says Jim Clarke, Intel's director of quantum hardware for this collaborative project. "The hope is that if we make the best transistors, then with a few material and design changes we can make the best qubits," said Clarke, summing up the impetus behind the research project.

Parents of Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan speak out about new video by Diana Mehta, The Canadian Press Posted Dec 22, 2016 9:14 am EST Last Updated Dec 22, 2016 at 10:16 am EST National This undated militant file image from video posted online in August 2016, which has not been independently verified by The Associated Press, provided by SITE Intel Group, shows Canadian Joshua Boyle and American Caitlan Coleman, who were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012. The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they've seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ AP-SITE Intel Group via AP, File The parents of a Canadian man held hostage in Afghanistan say a recently released video of their son and his family marks the first time they’ve seen their two grandchildren, who were born in captivity. Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman, were kidnapped in 2012 while travelling in a mountainous region of northern Afghanistan. In a video uploaded to YouTube earlier this week, Coleman — sitting next to her husband and two young children — urges governments on all sides to reach a deal to secure the family’s freedom. Related stories: Canada calls for release of kidnapped couple in Afghanistan US evaluating Taliban video of captive couple in Afghanistan Videos show Canadian-American couple held in Afghanistan Boyle’s parents, Patrick and Linda Boyle, said they watched the video on Monday, getting their first glimpse at their young grandsons. “It is an indescribable emotional sense one has watching a grandson making faces at the camera, while hearing our son’s leg chains clanging up and down on the floor as he tries to settle his son,” the Boyles said in a written statement. “It is unbelievable that they have had to shield their sons from their horrible reality for four years.” The parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife have tried to protect their children by pretending their signs of captivity are part of a game being played with guards. “It is simply heartbreaking to watch both boys so keenly observing their new surroundings in a makeshift film studio, while listening to their mother describe how they were made to watch her being defiled,” the Boyles said. The video came to public attention through the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online. The group said the video was dated Dec. 3. In the clip, Coleman says her family has been waiting since 2012 for somebody to understand the “Kafkaesque nightmare” they are living. “We understand both sides hate us and are content to leave us and our two surviving children in these problems but we can only ask and pray that somebody will recognize the atrocities these men carry out against us,” she is heard saying. The Boyles said their daughter-in-law could not have used a more accurate term than kafkaesque. “The absence of a clear course of action to escape a complex and bizarre situation that seems it may be somewhere between fiction and reality. Overpowered and constrained by others beyond their control, but striving to break through nonetheless,” the Boyles said. They said the video appears to confirm that those holding their son and family captive “want to bring this to an end soon.” “They prefer to reach an understanding during this brief period of the American presidential transition,” the Boyles said. “It also confirms the seriousness and immediacy of the captors’ threats to our four family members.” The Boyles said they hope all governments involved will bring their son’s case to a safe resolution soon. A spokesman with Global Affairs Canada said the federal government is “deeply concerned” about the safety and well-being of Joshua Boyle and his family and calls for their unconditional release. Coleman’s parents say they are hoping U.S. president-elect Donald Trump will broker her release if President Barack Obama doesn’t succeed before he leaves office. Jim and Lyn Coleman, of Stewartstown, Pa., spoke to ABC’s “Good Morning America” Wednesday, saying they took solace in seeing their daughter and grandkids looking healthy and in seeing the children for the first time. “You just want to reach out, you know, and hold them,” Lyn Coleman said of her grandchildren. “And that’s very difficult.” Joshua Boyle and Coleman vanished after setting off in the summer of 2012 for a journey that took them to Russia, the central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and then to Afghanistan. Coleman’s parents last heard from their son-in-law on Oct. 8, 2012, from an Internet cafe in what he described as an “unsafe” part of Afghanistan. In 2013, the couple appeared in two videos asking the U.S. government to free them from the Taliban. Coleman’s parents received a letter last November in which their daughter said she had given birth to a second child in captivity. A video released in August showed Coleman and Boyle warning that their captors would kill them and their children unless the government in Kabul ends its execution of Taliban prisoners.

This chip giant's dividend has a lot of room to grow based on its recent financial performance, but don't expect it all in one shot. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 22, 2016 at 5:01PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) pays a solid dividend of $1.04/share on an annual basis. As of a recent check of the stock price, that works out to around 2.81% yield. Although the company is far from high-yielding in absolute terms, it's solid relative to what its large-cap, dividend-paying semiconductor peers pay. Data source: Google Finance. Intel has generally done a good job of delivering annual dividend increases to its stockholders. There was, however, a 10-quarter stretch between August 2012 and November 2014 during which the company didn't boost its dividend (presumably since Intel's revenues were declining as it boosted operating expenses). The company did return to form in early 2015, raising its quarterly dividend from $0.225/share to a $0.24/share. It raised the dividend again in early 2016 to $0.26 per share. I believe Intel will raise the dividend again to try to further boost the attractiveness of its stock, particularly to more income-oriented investors. Let's look at by how much Intel could reasonably raise its dividend. Dividend is paid from free-cash-flow A key metric to look at when trying to analyze a company's dividend potential is its trailing-12-month free cash flow per share. Dividends are paid from a company's free cash flow, so the more free cash flow a company generates (and can generate on a consistent basis), the more cash it can put into stockholders' pockets. Over the last 12 months, Intel generated $10.54 billion in free cash flow, translating to around $2.163 per share. This is well below Intel's current annual dividend payments of $1.04 per share, suggesting the company has plenty of room to grow the amount it pays out in dividends even if its business stays stagnant. Expect a modest increase It wouldn't be smart for Intel to just jack up its dividend payout to the maximum its trailing-12-month free cash flow could support. Such a move would limit Intel's ability to deliver future increases, especially if it continues to have a tough time growing its top and bottom lines going forward. It's smarter to leave a hefty amount of margin on the table, "just in case." With that in mind, I expect Intel to deliver a modest dividend increase when it announces its financial results in January. A bump from $0.26 per share on a quarterly basis to, say, $0.28 per share would represent a solid raise (roughly 7.7%). Such a dividend raise isn't going to dramatically change the fortunes of current Intel stockholders or be something that will get investors who just don't like the story to finally hop on board. Still, it would be a welcome move. If Intel's business performance dramatically improves, so will the dividend A company's dividend payments and its business performance are very closely tied together. If Intel were to see a substantial and sustainable boost in profitability (say, all of those big investments in R&D that the company is making today pay off in a nice way five years from now), then it could have a lot of room to improve the dividend more dramatically. At the same time, though, if Intel could boost its dividend substantially because of much better business performance, then the stock price would also likely trade quite a lot higher than it does today. In that case, the dividend yield for new buyers of the stock might not be much higher than it is today, but for shareholders who got in earlier, the dividend yield relative to one's initial investment would go up a bunch.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Haswell OpenGL 4.0 / FP64 Support In Mesa Might Finally Be Close To Merging Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 22 December 2016 at 01:00 AM EST. 8 Comments It appears that ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 for Intel Haswell graphics hardware might finally be merged soon into Mesa and thereby exposing OpenGL 4.0 support. While Broadwell and newer Intel hardware has OpenGL 4.5 support in Mesa, the Haswell support is left behind as while it can reach OpenGL ~4.1, it's currently at OpenGL 3.3. The blocking extension from Haswell having OpenGL 4.0 is the big ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 extension, but the code has been sitting around for a while. Back in October Igalia revised their FP64 patches for Haswell, but sadly they've been spending the past few months basically sitting idle on the mailing list. Fortunately, it looks like Intel developers are finally moving forward with reviewing the massive patch-set and things are looking good. This week Matt Turner commented on the series and gives his "reviewed-by" to the work. And he commented, "Again, thank you so much. This was a large amount of work, and the way you guys handled it was extremely impressive. I'm only sorry that the review of your work wasn't executed as well as your actual work!" Hopefully these patches will finally land soon (perhaps a Christmas present?), albeit GL4 isn't the most necessary for Haswell owners especially considering the slow graphics performance for most of these older chips. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! 2016: The Year That Was By Rob Enderle Dec 26, 2016 11:00 AM PT 2016 really was a year like no other. We had yet another election defined by the misuse of analytics -- and folks seem to be getting worse rather than better at this. We had a rush to robotics, particularly self-driving cars, and some firms even leaped ahead to self-flying, people-delivering drones (which we called "flying cars" just a few years back). We had a wave of fake news, mostly paid for by Google, because that company, as always, has no compass. It appears to be shaming nations into regulating it, suggesting it has no sense, either. We also had a lot of interesting products, but I think one stood out as the next iPod, and it didn't come from Apple. I'll go further into all of that this week, as you recover from what I hope was a wonderful Christmas day full of presents, family, and a sense of dread for January, when we all have to go back to work. Sorry, that was my inner Scrooge. Analytics Miss If one thing stood out for me this past year, it was the election. After two elections in which Obama, a Democrat, out-executed his Republican rivals with analytics, we had Trump do the same thing to Clinton in the last 10 days of the election. That was in spite of the fact that Clinton was the candidate tech loved, suggesting someone really missed a meeting. This takes me back to the oft-heard criticisms of Clinton's opponents who maintained she showed bad judgment. The lesson here is that tech can't fix bad judgment, and it is a force multiplier. So, if you have bad judgment, it likely will make things worse. You know, it still strikes me that if folks spent more time understanding why someone screwed up so badly rather than just finding folks to blame and shoot, things might improve over time. Just saying... Bad Judgment Speaking of bad judgment, Meg Whitman likely takes the cake. She came out late against Donald Trump and for Hillary Clinton, even though she is tied at the hip to the Republican Party. Maybe it would have resulted in a minor cabinet post for Whitman had Clinton won, but getting this wrong made her look not only like a traitor to her party, but also like a foolish one. This is the sad part: HPE sells analytics products, suggesting Whitman has no better handle on that technology -- even though her firm sells it -- than Clinton does. I guess this means she'll have to go back to executing a strategy that will make HPE small enough to fit in the garage it started from. Good Judgment Peter Thiel stands out as the tech executive of the year, largely because he was the only one who saw that there were enough people in both parties who were sick of politicians to get Trump elected. Unlike virtually every other tech exec, he focused on tech, which is what he knows -- not politics. Thiel has had a material and largely positive impact on Trump's agenda, so much so that at a meeting earlier this month, Trump asked what he could do to help tech firms rather than yelling at them for their lack of support. In the end, I think Thiel may showcase how tech and government should work together to make the U.S. a better place. It won't be by donating money, as tech leaders did with Clinton, but by sharing and using the very technology they sell to make the nation better -- and that should be a bipartisan goal. Sadly, Thiel is the exception and not the rule, but the industry learns from example and he is one hell of an example. Fixing Judgment That is a sharp contrast on judgment. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, backed by my old friend Genevieve Bell, earlier this year made a timely announcement on focusing AI to help folks with their judgment. Both Clinton and Whitman should sign up for the alpha test. This is really the eventual promise of analytics. It's not a tool that multiplies the impact of a decision, good or bad, but a tool that helps people ensure their decisions are good ones. I think we all could use a tool that would help us with our judgment from time to time. Dell Technology In 2016, we saw the birth of the new super-company in tech, Dell Technologies. Instead of mucking around with politics, Michael Dell buckled down and took EMC private, saving Joe Tucci's legacy and creating the most powerful hardware company in tech. This is important in a market increasingly defined by cloud companies like Amazon, Google, and now even Microsoft. It still strikes me that Dell has the best acquisition and merger process, yet largely stands alone when using it. However, I did talk to an Intel exec who told me Intel recently adopted something similar, so that's good news for you folks in smaller tech firms. If this is a trend, you are less likely to get a surprise layoff in 2017 due to a bad acquisition. Product of the Year Runners-Up Dell's XPS 13: This was my go-to laptop for much of the year, though I actually came to prefer the XPS15, largely because it was better for playing Ashes of the Singularity, my new favorite strategy game. The XPS 13 is a nice balance of size, style, battery life and functionality, with the only downside being the lack of a good fingerprint reader. Dell XPS 13 Lenovo Yoga Book: At launch, this was a breakout product -- ultra-thin, ultra-portable and very reasonably priced. Artists raved over it. It reminds me a lot of the Courier tablet that Microsoft's advanced development team came up with, which effectively led to its being disbanded. Sadly, I'm not an artist -- it is best for those who are. Lenovo Yoga Book Varonis: As I noted last week, this product and its entire class of intrusion and behavior monitoring tools could have changed the U.S. election outcome, had both the U.S. government and DNC had used them. Varonis would have prevented the hack of the DNC (and other) email servers. However, it wasn't used and didn't have the impact it should have had (granted, if it had, we never would have known). (By the way, Varonis has posted a series of videos on how to secure your home for the holidays that is worth watching, and it's free.) BlackBerry DTEK 60: This phone showcased that you actually could have a secure BlackBerry. Thin and with glass on both sides, a decent camera, a fingerprint sensor (sensibly placed on the back of the camera, not the front), and a full Android implementation, this is the phone that BlackBerry should have made a long time ago, and it has been serving me as my primary phone ever since I got it. In a world increasingly defined by breaches, this phone is a godsend because it is secure. BlackBerry DTEK60 Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Solution: This was big -- the only ARM solution that has been blessed by Microsoft for Windows. Microsoft hadn't considered another platform since the 1980s, and to make the jump to Snapdragon was a huge win for Qualcomm and for users who want laptops with battery life comparable to tablets. It also suggests that Apple is likely close to a similar decision, since it's rumored that it has been exploring the same jump for MacBooks. However, products won't show up until 2017, suggesting we'll revisit this next year. Mercedes GLA 45 AMG: I liked this car so much I bought it. The car has been a dream -- Mercedes not so much. First, we had a trip from hell to pick it up in Germany. Then, to make it up to me, the company put me through its advanced driver course. However, Mercedes so overburdened the instructors that the thing became unsafe as a consequence, and there was an accident. Finally, Mercedes actually configured my car wrong, making a last-minute change that eliminated one of the features I expressly had ordered and paid for. It's a great car, but I think I'm done with Mercedes. AMD RX-460 Card: We are ramping to VR, but the best solutions are way too expensive as you jump from a US$100 dollar range headset for your smartphone to a $3,000 solution for a full PC with an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift solution. Well, AMD pushed back and brought out its Radeon 460 card, which dramatically lowered the cost of entry for those wanting to get in on VR. Nvidia Drive PX2: Perhaps the greatest sleeper product in the market was the Nvidia Drive PX2. Basically it is an AI system in a box, and I'm convinced it is capable of much more than driving cars. This product and its predecessor vaulted Nvidia into the lead with autonomous cars, and likely will help move it into autonomous aircraft at some point. There no doubt will be other circumstances where having an AI in a box that can see and make decisions would be useful. The Amazon Echo Dot is the product Apple should have built. The Dot and its siblings have everyone from Google to Microsoft and Intel, among others, looking to build similar offerings. It is the critical link between homeowners and their IoT future, and it has cut through the market like a hot knife through butter. The Dot was my go-to gift to relatives this year, and at under $50. it remains one of the true bargains available. I think the Amazon Echo is this decade's iPod, and we'll soon see if Amazon can do as good a job locking everyone else out of the market as Apple did. It is licensing the technology, suggesting that next year we could be up to our armpits in Echo clones and competitors. Overall, though, the Echo has become the core driver for in-home IoT. When a product spins a market on its head, that showcases true market power, and my product of the year needs to showcase leadership and power. Amazon did that -- first with the Echo, and now with the Echo Dot, making the Echo Dot my product of the year. Congratulations, Amazon and thanks also for offering it in bundles of six, because I now have one in nearly every room of the house.

The new mobile PCs are upgraded with Intel’s new Core i5/i7 Kaby Lake processors, new displays as well as a slightly different design that is slightly thicker, but is also slightly lighter. In fact, Samsung claims that its new Notebook 9 13” is the lightest laptop on the market at 816 grams (1.8 lbs), although some would claim that the 13.3-inch Lavie-Z holds that title starting at 720 grams (1.72 lbs). Samsung positions its Notebook 9 machines for business travelers who have rather special requirements and who are willing to make certain tradeoffs. Apart from the new Intel Core i5/i7 processors featuring the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, the key improvement of the Notebook 9 are their new display panels with FHD resolution and a maximum brightness of 500 nits (their typical brightness is 350 nits), which is especially useful for those working outdoors. Quite naturally, at 500 nits the screens consume a lot of power, but the Notebook 9 laptops come batteries that have 30 Wh capacity, which is lower when compared to thin and light systems from Apple (41.4 Wh), Dell (60 Wh) and HP (38.4 Wh), but which helps to reduce weight (at the end of the day, not a lot of people have to work under direct sunlight). Samsung claims that the Notebook 7 can last seven hours on one charge, enough for office workers and even long-haul flights. As an added bonus, the Notebook 9’s monitors can display videos with HDR enhancements (the manufacturer does not reveal whether we are dealing with HDR10, but that is a likely situation). The Notebook 9 laptops from Samsung can be equipped with up to 16 GB of dual-channel DDR4 memory, which is a rare option for contemporary ultra-thin laptops, many of which come with 8 GB of DRAM (but this may change in 2017). Meanwhile, when it comes to storage, Notebook 9’s SSDs top at 256 GB, but Samsung integrated a MicroSD card reader and hence road warriors may easily add storage space if needed. Connectivity-wise, Samsung’s Notebook 9 machines offer two USB Type-A, one USB Type-C as well as an HDMI port. For connectivity, a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 wireless module is present. The key selling points of the Samsung Notebook 9 range are their weight and dimensions: the 13” model is 13.9 mm thick, weighs 816 grams, whereas the 15” model is 14.9 mm thick, and weighs 984 grams. The laptops are thicker when compared to HP’s Spectre and Apple’s MacBook, but they are still thinner than Dell’s XPS 13. Moreover, when it comes to weight, the Notebook 9 are considerably lighter than (almost all) laptops in their class.

As for pricing, it is likely that the market segment that the manufacturer targets with the Notebook 9 family will not change with the arrival of new models, so we are looking at something like $1000+ for 13” models and something that starts at $1200 for 15” models. In the meantime, for a limited period Amazon in the U.S. is selling out the previous-gen Samsung Notebook 9 13” (NP900X3L-K06US) for $749.99 and the Samsung Notebook 9 15” (NP900X5L-K02US) for $849.99.

POST A COMMENT 42 Comments View All Comments T1beriu - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link The chart is missing the screen size. Reply Samus - Friday, December 23, 2016 - link I would say it's 9" based on the model number but as usual, Samsung marketing at its finest. They spend billions on advertising and calling a 13 and 15 inch laptop a Notebook 9 was somehow green lighted? It would perhaps make sense if the Notebook 1-8 where well known products...but at the end of the day it's a very confusing naming scheme for average consumers. Reply lilmoe - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link For the average consumer visiting a Samsung store, it's inline with most of their electronics product naming scheme. Most people know what a Series 9 Samsung TV is. Reply name99 - Saturday, December 24, 2016 - link Seriously? I follow tech closer than most people, and I don't have a clue what a Series 9 Samsung TV is or what the "Series 9" brand represents. Reply lilmoe - Sunday, December 25, 2016 - link Hmmmm. Have you ever been to a samsung store? Hard to believe you missed their flagship product. They usually have the series 9 in the middle of the store with big fat fonts. Reply blzd - Monday, December 26, 2016 - link Samsung has stores? Reply andychow - Sunday, January 01, 2017 - link +1, I never heard that Samsung has stores. In Korea? Reply MrSpadge - Monday, December 26, 2016 - link +1 Reply Samus - Sunday, December 25, 2016 - link LMAO, I own a Samsung TV, a UN46-6500 something or other, 46" 3D etc... No f'ing clue what a series 9 is. The fact my TV is a series 6500 and the one under it was like a 4300, you saying they now have a series 9 almost reinforces my point. They went from a 4 digit series scheme to single digit? But the actual model tag says 9000 I bet right? As I said, they are all over the place. The company spends more on advertising than any consumer electronics company on the planet and you really have to question how well those returns are when only half of their divisions are turning profits. The smartphone and appliance divisions are likely to run record losses this year due to the Note 7 and recalling every top load washer made since 2013.

I'd ask any engineer in 2015 when they thought we'd have full (i.e., SAE level 5) self-driving vehicles and the answer was always "ooh, that's another 20-30 years away." Fast forward a year, and all of a sudden that target has moved: BMW, Intel, Mobileye, Uber, Volvo, Ford, Delphi, and others have all set 2021 (or earlier in the case of Delphi) as the year by which steering wheels become optional. The big breakthrough is down to the use of machine learning and deep neural networks, a field that has come along leaps and bounds in a relatively short space of time. For example, Nvidia will sell OEMs and tier one suppliers an open AI platform for automotive uses that leverages the company's GPUs and machine learning—tech that it ably demonstrated with its BB-8 technology demonstrator: Nvidia's deep neural network allowed BB-8 to figure out how to drive on and off road in a short amount of time. But along the way, the automakers and tech firms working on the problem have diverged into two groups: the ones who plan to get there in an incremental, stepwise fashion, and the others who plan to skip the intermediate step. To explain, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) breaks down autonomous driving into six different levels. (Perhaps confusingly, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also had a scale for self-driving vehicles that went from 0-4, however the industry has coalesced around the SAE scale of late, and that's the one we'll use at Ars.) Drive a car with no traction control, electronic stability control (ESC), or antilock brakes (ABS)? Congratulations! You have a level 0 vehicle. Add some—or all—of those driver assists and it's now a level 1 car. The kinds of advanced driver-assistance systems like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping, or blind-spot monitoring, that keep tabs on the driving environment to help the driver make for level 2 is where most of the industry is right now—even industry leaders like Tesla, Audi, or Volvo. And so the scale progresses, up to level 5, where human interaction isn't required to complete a journey. Level 3 is the tricky one. Under most circumstances, the car will do the driving. But if it all gets too much for the computers to handle, control gets returned to the human. And as far as companies like Ford and Volvo are concerned, that's problematic. For one thing, driver assists are specifically being developed to be better than a human; things like ESC and ABS are literally life savers. For two, it means getting the attention of the human operator (who may be engrossed in a book or half asleep) and then safely returning control to them. Far better, some say, to simply pass over this intermediate stage and go for level 4 or level 5 autonomy. Meanwhile, OEMs like Audi think they can make level 3 work. Audi's 2018 flagship A8 sedan promises to be the first true level 3 car on sale to the public, and it's believed that it will use cameras and image recognition to determine if the human behind the wheel is paying attention or not. Audi's system is also being designed to pull over safely in the event that the human isn't able to resume control. Buying vs. renting A second philosophical difference is also beginning to emerge in the industry, regarding whether or not you'll own or just rent these self-driving vehicles. Assuming Ford or Uber or whoever else gets its self-driving vehicles ready by 2021, they won't be vehicles you or I could go out and purchase. Instead, we're talking about fleets owned by the manufacturers, which we'll summon when needed, paying just for the ride. Probably the biggest reason for this is the as-yet unresolved problem of insurance and liability. It is much easier for a company with deep pockets like Ford to own and commercially insure a fleet of autonomous vehicles, assuming liability for crashes, than passing those problems on to the end user. Volvo was first out of the gate to state that it would assume liability for its vehicles when in autonomous mode. "When you drive manually, the driver is responsible," CEO Håkan Samuelsson told Ars last year. "When it's automatic, we as the manufacturer are liable. If you're not ready to make such a statement, you're not ready to develop autonomous solutions." Contrast that with Tesla's position—Elon Musk recently told journalists that Tesla won't consider itself liable in the event of a crash, likening the situation to being in a stuck elevator. If we cast our crystal ball further out—20 or 30 years into the future—those different paths are all headed to the same place, and it's one where humans driving themselves will be in a distinct minority. Policy makers are salivating at the life-saving potential of autonomous vehicles; NHTSA blames human error for 94 percent of all crashes, and more than 35,000 people have been killed on US roads this year. It's not hard to imagine that restrictions on human drivers will start to appear, first on highways (like HOV lanes), and I can easily imagine ideas similar to London's congestion charge being used to discourage humans from driving themselves in cities. "I don't think new vehicle ownership will even exist by then," Jeremey McCool, CEO of HEVO Power (a company that makes wireless charging systems for vehicles) told me recently. "Manufacturers will own the assets, and they'll be able to overcome the problems they're having with cost by having people pay premiums for a monthly service. That'll probably eliminate Lyft and Uber, because they're just a middle facilitator at that point." What that means for the Ferraris and Porsches of the world, that build and sell vehicles that by design are supposed to engage and delight the driver, remains unclear. The insurance industry is also in for a big change by then, explained Andrew Rose, CEO of compare.com. "If you don't wreck cars, why do you need insurance? It's a $200 billion industry that's going away in the next few decades." Of course, that assumes a homogenous transportation ecosystem, something I'm less convinced we'll see for quite some time. The automobile comes with a deeply ingrained sense of freedom for many people out there, and any restrictions to that—like the idea of no longer owning a car but renting an autonomous pod—will sit badly with them. My colleague Lee Hutchinson expressed severe misgivings with the idea, citing the need to evacuate Houston in a hurry in the event of a hurricane. For that reason, and plenty of other edge cases just like it, I think we're looking at a much more multimodal transport future for quite some time.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums SK Hynix's new fab will boost production of 3D NAND flash and DRAM by Wayne Manion  2:33 PM on December 23, 2016 Intel and Micron may be trying to upend the chip memory market with their 3D XPoint non-volatile memory technology, but that isn't stopping SK Hynix from investing ₩3.15 trillion ($2.6 billion) in additional fabrication space for regular DRAM and 3D NAND flash. The company will spend this money to build a new fabrication plant in Cheongju, South Korea and expand clean-room operations in an existing plant in Wuxi, China. The design phase for new Korean plant begins in January, with shovels hitting dirt in August 2017 and production starting by the end of 2019. The new fab is expected to cost ₩2.2 trillion ($1.8 billion) and will be used to construct 3D NAND chips for use in storage devices. According to Anandtech, the investment is somewhat smaller than the amount the company spent on its largest plant. Anandtech goes on to explain that factory will produce 3D NAND exclusively during the initial stage, but will eventually diversify into DRAM chip production. The company also plans to spend ₩950 billion ($790 million) to expand operations at its Wuxi plant in China. SK Hynix's Wuxi operations currently produce about half of the company's current DRAM production. The chipmaker expects the output per area of floor space to decrease over time due to the emergence of more complex manufacturing processes. The expansion of the Chinese factory is intended to help make up for this projected decrease in productivity.

Home Industry Technology Asus Transformer Pro3: Delivers on performance but the battery is a letdown Asus Transformer Pro3: Delivers on performance but the battery is a letdown Microsoft and Intel have been pushing for the world to move towards 2-in-1 convertibles for quite some years now. But it is only with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 that this segment has come to near perfection, with Windows 10 running. By: Shruti Dhapola | Updated: December 22, 2016 7:27 AM Asus Transformer Pro 3. Microsoft and Intel have been pushing for the world to move towards 2-in-1 convertibles for quite some years now. But it is only with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 that this segment has come to near perfection, with Windows 10 running. Of course, for those who are comfortable with the iOS universe, the 12-inch iPad Pro is an option, and a powerful one at that; there’s the smaller 9-inch iPad Pro as well. However, there are other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Asus, Huawei and Acer, too, vying for a share of the pie. The Asus Transformer Pro 3, which was first showcased at Computex 2016 in Taiwan, is now available in India. With a premium price tag of R1,44,990, this device is not just a Surface replacement, it’s a straight competitor to the Microsoft device. So is Asus Transformer Pro 3 a good enough option? Here’s our review: At first glance, the Transformer Pro 3 looks and feels exactly like the Surface, which isn’t that exciting. But on closer inspection, you can see that Asus has done a stunning job. The all-metal design is very premium, and the gold looks classy. It has an integrated metal kickstand at the back and Asus says you can set it up at a 170 degree angle as well, which is pretty cool, but a little unnecessary. There’s a separate keyboard; Asus says the keys have 1.4mm travel. From a design perspective, Asus has done an excellent job, although it’s hard to ignore the similarities with the Surface. What is good? The display on the Asus Transformer Pro 3 is 2880×1920 pixels with 3:2 ratio, and when you switch on the device, it’s evident this is a gorgeous one. The blacks are deep, the colours are crisp and vivid. Whether you are just typing out text or looking at spreadsheets, or planning to watch Netflix all day on this device, the screen does not disappoint. The overall audio quality is also quite good. If you’re one of those who like to consume video content on their portable devices, then the Asus Transformer Pro 3 is more than capable of delivering on that front. The display and the sound quality don’t disappoint, and since you can use this as a tablet which has its own stand, portability is not an issue. With 16GB RAM and Intel Core i7 processor, this is more than capable of handling your daily tasks, especially if that includes spending considerable hours on the Microsoft Office Suite. The touch feature on the display is also fast and responsive, and I didn’t notice any lag as such when relying on this functionality. The keyboard lives up to the claims and while it takes some time to get used to the smaller surface area, I had no trouble typing out articles, including this review on the Transformer Pro 3. Asus Transformer Pro 3 also has support for a stylus. I am not much of an artist, but I found the stylus to be responsive even with a fairly light touch. What is not so good? It’s not all perfect for Asus Transformer Pro 3. Despite the beefed up specifications, there is a lag at times with the device. On one instance, the device refused to boot-up for me, and I had to rely on the Power and Volume down button to reboot it. This also has support for Microsoft’s Windows 10 Hello log-in, but that never worked accurately. I am not sure what happened here; I tried logging in more than once, but it refused to work. The battery on this is not impressive at all. I would say the Asus Transformer Pro 3 will give around 6-8 hours at best, which is not good considering this thing comes for a hefty price. I would expect a device costing close to R1.5 lakh to have a 10-hour battery life at the very least. Verdict Let’s face it, not all of us need a convertible device which costs a bomb. Not all of us are artists either, and require a stylus at all times. Asus Transformer Pro 3 is for those who need a powerful, yet easy to carry device that won’t let them down. The stylus is an addition for your creative needs, should you have time, inclination and skills to try it out. Asus delivers on the performance front, and the keyboard is certainly one of the better ones. But the battery is a problem. If you are considering a Surface alternative, and don’t want an iPad Pro, then Asus Transformer Pro 3 can be an option. But is it better than getting a Surface Pro 4? I am not entirely convinced.

It’s impossible to take exception to that conclusion, which is offered in a new audit by the secretary of state’s office of programs that offer tax breaks and loans to companies that promise to create jobs. It is, however, necessary to be clear about what such spending really entails. The biggest economic development program by far involves property tax exemptions offered in local enterprise zones and by the state Strategic Investment Program. These exemptions will total $535 million of the $680 million in the two-year budget period. But no one is writing checks for that amount. Rather, the $535 million is the amount that would be collected if exempt properties were fully taxed. That’s a very big “if” — in many cases, and ideally in all cases, the incentives result in development that would not have occurred without them. The best example is Intel, Oregon’s largest private employer, which will claim about 60 percent of all economic development property tax exemptions through the Strategic Investment Program. In the depths of the recession of the early 1980s, the administration of Gov. Neil Goldschmidt crafted the SIP in an attempt to attract investments by capital-intensive technology companies. Washington and Multnomah counties would not have extra millions in property taxes to spend if Intel had located elsewhere, which it probably would have done without the SIP. That’s not to say that every property tax exemption is fully justified — in some cases, investments might have occurred even without the tax breaks. The audit recommends that Business Oregon develop better ways of measuring the results of incentive programs, in addition to the job-creation and income-level requirements that already exist. The audit also found a troubling disparity in the performance of urban vs. rural economic development incentives. Development has tended to be concentrated in the Portland area, where the economy is healthiest. In 2015, tax exemptions in rural enterprise zones averaged $54,500 per job created, compared to $4,200 in urban enterprise zones. The disparity points to the difficulty of stimulating job growth in rural Oregon — as well as to the fact that the biggest tax exemptions outside the Willamette Valley have gone to such companies as Apple and Facebook, whose capital-intensive data centers employ relatively few people. Aside from property tax exemptions, the audit recommends a tighter rein on tax credits and forgivable loans offered through the state Strategic Reserve Fund program. The state evaluates how long it takes for Oregon to recoup the cost of these benefits through increased taxes and fees. The audit notes that the payback period would in many cases be longer if all state incentives were included in the calculations. The state’s net return on these programs ought to be positive, and only a comprehensive accounting of the public expense can yield a reliable assessment of whether incentives are in the state’s interest. Such accountability depends on transparency — and the audit found that companies are not always required to provide the information needed to evaluate the effectiveness of incentive programs. Businesses are often reluctant to disclose the information that would make such evaluations possible, but a company seeking a tax break or other incentive cannot expect the state to make its decisions in the dark. Public acceptance of economic development incentives will weaken without solid evidence that the investments yield dividends. Support for economic development programs tends to move in the opposite direction of the economic tides — it’s a top priority in times of recession, and is downgraded during periods of growth. The state is best served by programs that remain consistent over time, backed by reliable means of tracking their effectiveness. The recommendations in the secretary of state’s audit can help move Oregon toward that goal.

The entry-level version costs $2399 and includes an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a Radeon Pro 450 graphics chip. It also has Apple’s love-or-hate Touch Bar. Laptop Magazine gave Apple’s new high-end notebook four-and-a-half stars. “The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar offers a slew of neat touch controls, a beautifully slim design and the most blazing performance you can find on a Mac.” The review especially compliments the “innovative” Touch bar, the slim design, the display, and the overall fast performance. However, the lack of an SD card slot, the lack of regular USB ports, and the high price get slated. Some consider the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro overpriced. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Still, there have been some dissatisfied Apple fans. David Gewirtz from ZDNet explains why he cancelled his 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro order. “Apparently, some new 15-inch MacBook Pros are experiencing failure conditions. I first became aware of the problem in a MacRumors article a few days ago. Users are reporting glitches and crashes, along with weird screen artifacts,” Gewirtz claims, adding that when one spends this much money on a laptop, it needs to work perfectly. Some of the commenters after the article slate Apple. “Apple sucks! I wouldn’t spend thousands for their cheap products made in China. Just buy an HP,” says Joel Aldo. “Switched to windows laptop… quarter of price and 4x the performance. With VR/AR coming, Apple is truly and utterly out of touch. Tim Cook is Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer,” claims Adam Musk. Well, there is good news for those who are looking for a MacBook Pro alternative. The current high-end Dell XPS 15 has already received excellent reviews. The version with specs compared to Apple’s MacBook Pro costs $1849. However, like the new MacBook Pro, it contains 2015’s 6th generation processor. According to CNET, the 7th generation Kaby Lake version of the Dell XPS 15 is about to be unveiled. Dell could unveil the next XPS 15 at CES 2017. [Image by Bloomberg/Getty Images] “Right now, the Dell XPS 15 is the only machine with portability and performance to match Apple’s largest laptop. Problem is, its CPU and graphics are about to be a year out of date. It looks like that will change at this year’s CES in January, though, because Dell just leaked the product page for a new XPS 15 — one with Intel’s unreleased quad-core Kaby Lake CPUs and an unannounced Nvidia graphics chip.” The article adds that according to a listing that has recently been removed, the XPS 15 will come with a choice of an Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processor; an optional Nvidea GeForce GTX 1050 graphics chip; and an optional fingerprint sensor. Dell usually keeps the same prices for upgrades as their previous versions, so one will probably be able to save more than $500 when compared to the current 15-inch MacBook Pro, which runs an outdated processor. There is a lot of excitement for the new Dell XPS 15 on Twitter. Very excited – Watch "New Dell XPS 15 Kaby Lake GTX 1050 is [almost] here (9560)" on YouTube https://t.co/g2Ul2YDRwA — Eugene Rosenfeld (@erosen03) December 20, 2016 Website wardrobe malfunction lets slip the new Nvidia-powered Dell XPS 15 – PCGamesN https://t.co/YnHQ7sf3H2 PCGamesN Website wardrobe m… — Dyl Does (@dyl_does) December 21, 2016 For those who want a laptop like the XPS 15 that’s smaller and has the latest 7th generation Kaby Lake processor, the new Dell XPS 13 is now available. Unfortunately, the XPS 13 doesn’t offer a discrete graphics chip, but its high-end version, at $1599, offers enough power to comfortably edit 4K videos. It’s also a lot cheaper than the 13-inch version of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar that has the same specs.

Based in Unterschleissheim near Munich, the new campus will be home to 2000 experts working on every aspect from software development to real-world testing. But the decision to create a base of operations in Munich is also an attempt to ensure Europe is firmly on the map as a hotspot for next-generation automotive technology development. "The road to fully-automated driving is an opportunity for Germany's automobile manufacturing base. The decision to develop and road-test these vehicles in the Munich area illustrates how the BMW Group and the whole region can benefit from this shift in the automotive industry," said Klaus Fröhlich, member of the Board of Management, responsible for Development at the BMW Group. Detroit and Silicon Valley are also trying to establish themselves as the de facto home of the car of the future so it makes sense that European carmakers, whose legacy stretches back 130 years, would want to court and keep the world's leading experts within their own continental borders. However, in a fully connected world, it is impossible for any single company to work in isolation. In order for BMW to bring the iNEXT -- the name it has given its self-driving car -- to fruition on schedule, it has already forged a long-term partnership with US firms Intel and MobilEye. Intel's role in the alliance is to develop in-car processors and to help crunch through the huge amounts of data the project will create. "Highly autonomous cars and everything they connect to will require powerful and reliable electronic brains to make them smart enough to navigate traffic and avoid accidents," explained Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. MobilEye's expertise is in sensing and localization, and its partnership with BMW is one of several it has announced in recent months. For instance, at the 2017 CES in January, MobilEye will be demonstrating the fruits of its partnership with autonomous driving tech company Delphi over a specially created real-world course in Las Vegas. The companies claim the system, called the Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning (CSLP) automated driving system, is the most advanced autonomous driving system currently in existence. As for the partnership with BMW, officially announced in July, the companies are already on target to start testing a prototype autonomous vehicle fleet in urban conditions in early 2017. "[This] future development site for autonomous driving will enable us to launch the BMW iNEXT, the first self-driving BMW, onto the market in 2021," said Fröhlich.

Mark Warner, the new top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, is not currently endorsing a select committee. | Getty Some Dems resist new Russia select committee By Burgess Everett 12/22/16 05:14 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The bipartisan push for a special congressional committee to investigate Russian meddling in the election is running into a new hurdle: Senate Democrats. Several members of the party, particularly those on the Intelligence Committee, are noncommittal about setting up a new select committee specifically devoted to cybersecurity that would also investigate Russian influence on the presidential election. Instead, some Democrats will wait to see whether Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) will follow through on his pledge to “expeditiously” investigate the electronic break-ins and preside over public hearings about the matter. Story Continued Below Democrats are also protecting their turf. Intelligence Committee members have little to gain right now by breaking with Burr, because they already have access to intelligence briefings that other members are hoping to get access to as part of a broader special panel. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are making a bipartisan push for a special select committee to tackle the Russia hacking — and cybersecurity more broadly. That panel would, under one proposal, take key members from across the various committees with jurisdiction over cybersecurity and create one central clearinghouse for oversight over the Russia hackings as well as cyberthreats from other countries like North Korea and Iran. Schumer, Reed and McCain will all have access to the Intelligence Committee briefings regardless; Reed and McCain are "ex-officio" members of the committee and Schumer will get new intelligence briefings because he is leader of the Democrats. Presidential Transition Lewandowski brokered Trump-Slim meeting By Kenneth P. Vogel, Josh Dawsey and Isaac Arnsdorf Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the new top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, is not currently endorsing a select committee as he looks to forge a partnership with Burr. Still, he's leaving the door open to call for an investigatory shake-up in the future if the current Intel panel investigation stalls. But in the meantime, he's “actively engaged in discussions with Senator Burr” about the course of the current probe rather than calling for a new panel that would step on the Intel Committee's jurisdiction, a spokeswoman said. “Senator Warner believes Congress is obligated to conduct — and the American people deserve — an investigation that is timely, thorough, and bipartisan,” said Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Warner. “One of the goals of the investigation should be to release as much information as possible, while protecting sources and methods, so that the American people can understand exactly what happened.” Warner’s hesitancy reflects the divisions among the committee’s seven Democrats as a whole. They all say they want to get to the bottom of the Russian hacking, but there’s no agreement among them about how to do it. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN Tuesday that he’s “not taking a position as to whether it should be a new committee set up just for this purpose or whether the Intelligence committee can handle it.” Ditto Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who is not calling for a select committee after just being added to the Intelligence panel. “The intelligence community has raised serious issues about Russia’s attempts to influence our electoral process, and Senator Manchin believes we have a responsibility to investigate what occurred. That said, any investigation now and in the future, must put politics aside and focus solely on how we can protect our Democratic institutions in the future,” said spokesman Jonathan Kott. Presidential Transition Trump’s terror-fighting team yet to take shape By Michael Crowley Democratic staffers said that Intelligence Committee members are loathe to start off 2017 by antagonizing Burr. They’d rather give Burr plenty of time to pursue his own investigation — and seek answers from both the outgoing Obama administration and the incoming Trump administration — while making as much public as possible. “You can see why those members who want to have a thorough investigation would want to do it in [the Intelligence Committee]," said a senior Democratic aide. And if there are early signs that Burr isn’t keeping his word, aides said, then Democrats on the committee could change their tune. Burr’s office declined to comment on the divisions among the committee’s Democrats. A pair of Democrats on the panel, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, both support select committees. "The Russian hacking in the 2016 election — in this case on behalf of an unprecedentedly pro-Russian candidate — strikes at the core of our Democracy and cannot be brushed under the carpet,” Heinrich said in a statement on Wednesday. “There needs to be an independent, bipartisan commission designed solely to investigate Russia's interference in our election." And while Wyden supports a select committee, he’s most concerned with transparency, whatever the exact committee structure is. “His overriding concern is that the government get the facts out to the public quickly, whether they’re being investigated by the intelligence committees, other standing congressional committees, a joint congressional committee, or an independent commission. That includes open hearings,” said Keith Chu, a spokesman for Wyden. Donald Trump's Cabinet-in-waiting: What we know so far By Andrew Restuccia Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who is leaving her post as the committee’s top Democrat, has so far declined to weigh in on the select committee question. She’s called for a bipartisan, bicameral independent commission on the Russian hacking that would report the results to Congress within 18 months, which she believes would “keep the politics of individual members of Congress out of the equation," according to aide. Newly elected Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who will sit on the panel, did not respond to a request for comment. The top four Senate Democratic leaders — Schumer, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan — all support a select committee as do many rank-and-file members. So while there is resistance among Intel Committee Democrats, Schumer is more concerned with convincing Republicans to back his push. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a Russia hawk who sits on the Intel committee, said on Wednesday evening that he opposes the panel. "Lankford supports a full bipartisan investigation, but believes the sensitive classified information involved with this type of investigation should not be publicized. Therefore, he believes the Intelligence Committee should investigate this," said D.J. Jordan, a spokesman for Lankford. Currently just three Republicans — Graham, McCain and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) — have endorsed Schumer's approach. “They know that Sen. McConnell had not come out for it so they’re keeping their powder dry,” Schumer said on an ABC podcast on Wednesday. “But the informal chatter I get is they think it’s a good idea.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Burgess Everett @burgessev This story tagged under: Dianne Feinstein Mark Warner John McCain Russia Senate Senate Intelligence Committee Cory Gardner Richard Burr Lindsey Graham Elections Hacking 2016 Elections James Lankford Jim Lankford Angus King Cyber Security Show Comments Politico Magazine Putin’s Real Long Game By Molly K.

-- The technology sector is a naturally changing, developing and innovative environment. There were several new developments that took place in the automation industry sector recently. According to a research conducted by Global Market Insights, Inc. the automotive electronics market is projected to reach $352.92 billion by 2023, from $185.05 billion in 2015. The projected growth is explained by an increasing adoption of automation technologies by manufacturers across the industry. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) Innovative developments which make vehicles more efficient are taken into consideration alongside the projections. Like for example the new lithium-ion batteries coupled with electronic compressors for hybrid as well as electric vehicles designed to minimize the production costs. Another research by PWC has indicated that demand for the new digital technologies associated with connected and autonomous cars will grow, and with it the list of potential suppliers from outside the traditional automotive supply base. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) operates in a range of business segments and provides solutions to manufacturing industries. Through its Electronics Manufacturing Services group the company provides end-to-end electronic manufacturing services including product design and sustaining engineering services, systems integration, testing services and assembled electronic products. Cemtrex Inc. announced today that, "its consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30th, 2016. Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights: • Revenue increased by 65% to $93,704,560 for the twelve months ended in September 30, 2016 compared to $56,887,389 for the same period in 2015 • Net Income was up 76% to $4,994,045, equaling $0.59 per share, in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income of $2,838,116 or $0.41 in the same period in 2015. • EBITDA was up 120% to $9,053,839 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to EBITDA of $4,107,748 in the same period in 2015. Commenting on the yearly results, Mr. Saagar Govil, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company remarked, "This past year we were able to complete two strategic acquisitions that allowed our revenues to increase 65%. Out net income also increased 76% mainly due to the increased income from the acquired operations. We have been able to establish a repeat customer base through our proven technologies, cost-effective manufacturing, and on-time delivery of equipment which creates a positive outlook for sustainable revenue growth." "Overall, this year was a great year for Cemtrex with as we have seen our number of shareholders increase substantially and a significant increase in our average trading volume. Additionally, we have recently filed for a Rights offering with Source Group, through the issuance of preferred shares, which when completed, would provide us additional resources for pursuing larger acquisitions. Furthermore, with the incoming Trump administration's plan for increased infrastructure spending, we believe there is a lot to look forward to, as we continue to create value for our shareholders in the coming year," continued Mr. Govil." Automotive company, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), tests its wireless car chargers for EVs, self-driving vehicles. General Motors floor pad prototype wireless charging will allow its company's self-driving cars to charge on its own by driving into a parking spot or garage capable of wirelessly charging at 7.7 kilowatt and 11KW charge. "Wireless charging is a technology that our customers have told us they are interested in," Pamela Fletcher, GM executive chief engineer for electrified vehicles, said in a statement. "By testing the WiTricity prototype system, we can ensure that wireless charging systems will comply with proposed industry standards, which benefit the entire industry and consumers." Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Panasonic Corporation has had a long partnership together when it comes to the supply of Tesla's car batteries. Conversely, Tesla is looking at other options to decrease risks, leaning more towards suppliers from South Korea. According to Teslarati, a source for Tesla News, the company has met with electronic giants Samsung SDI, LG Chem and SK innovation, to talk over the possibility of supplying car batteries for Tesla's electronic cars. Tesla cars will be provided with tires from Hanjook Tire tires, and the OLED panels for the automotive systems will be by LG Display. An official from Tesla has released a statement saying: "Tesla intends to use more Korean technology on its Model 3... Tesla is testing the manufacturing capability and production of LG Chem, Samsung SDI and SK Innovation."

Latest Global Business Brief: the Trump effect, the F-35, Boeing and 2016’s big business stories. A New Military Jet Flies Just One Year After It Was Designed The American Leader in ISIS General Fires Back at Trump: F-35 ‘Not Out of Control’ What Are Turkey and Russia Doing in Syria? Sponsor Content Managing and Improving Military Readiness in a Timely and Cost-Effective Manner Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas DNC Hackers Linked to Russian Activity Against Ukraine Two Years Ago By Patrick Tucker Read bio December 21, 2016 CROWDSTRIKE AA Font size + Print A Crowdstrike Illustration of the FANCY BEAR group believed to be linked to the Russian military intelligence service. Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio December 21, 2016 The same malware a Russian group used to attacked the DNC was targeting Ukrainian soldiers, says cybersecurity group. In the same way that a masterpiece bears the distinct signature of its maker, so does a masterpiece of malware. Consider the case of FANCY BEAR, one of the two groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee’s, or DNC, networks and which the intelligence community and cybersecurity pros believe to be connected to the Russian military intelligence service, or GRU. Crowdstrike, the company that found hackers on the DNC network, on Thursday published a report showing that FANCY BEAR used the same malware as part of combat operations in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, which enabled the Russian troops to better target Ukrainian artillery positions. It’s one of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge to show the connection between the Russian military and the concerted effort to influence the 2016 presidential election through the publication of stolen emails. The malware in question is called X-Agent. Cybersecurity group TrendMicro originally discovered it in 2015 and connected it to a broad espionage operation from the Russian government aimed at political and military targets in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. It’s a piece of malware well known to the Putin-backed group that hacked the DNC, also known as FANCY BEAR. As Crowdstrike’s Dimitri Alperovitch describes in his June blog post on the DNC hack, the environment was sick with  “X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging.” Here’s what’s new, according to Crowdstrike. In 2013, a Ukrainian soldier named Yaroslav Sherstuk, with the 55th Artillery brigade developed a mobile phone application to help aim its long guns. The Android app was intended “to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. It was a math app for real time combat. Ukrainian soldiers using Soviet-era Howitzers had to  figure out the elevation of the target and the curvature of the earth, etc., using pen and paper, which took too much time. Sherstuk’s app did the same job quickly and easily: plug in the coordinates of the targets and the app would tell you settings that you needed to set for the Howitzer. Targeting time went from minutes to 15 seconds. When fighting began in Ukraine, the app spread among users on VK (the Russian-language Facebook knock off) and the like, eventually reaching more than 9,000 downloads. The Russian military realized that they could simply infect the app with X-Agent and the malware would spread as quickly as the app. “On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014,” Crowdstrike writes in their report. The pro-Russian fighters could find Ukrainian soldiers who were using the app to plan howitzer fires because the Ukrainians had given away their position through the app. As a result, Russian artillery launched more than 120 attacks on Ukrainians in 2014 between the July 9 and Sept. 5. As open source investigative group Bellingcat makes clear in this post: “In the days and weeks that followed, the units at the border were subjected to dozens of additional artillery attacks. By late July 2014, the massive bombardment reversed Ukrainian gains and contributed to the encirclement of portions of the Ukrainian armed forces. A separatist offensive across eastern Ukraine began simultaneously with the artillery attacks, leading to the separatists capturing much of the Russian-Ukrainian border along with vast areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts. “The pressure of sustained artillery attacks through early August led Ukrainian armed forces to lose control of hundreds of kilometers of border territory.” By some estimates, they lost more than 80 percent of their D-30 Howitzers, well beyond what they lost for other artillery pieces. Bottom line: The presence of the same bit of malware on the phones of Ukrainian soldiers just before they were fired on in 2014 – and then in the DNC servers just before embarrassing emails were published to Wikileaks in 2016  — is more than a coincidence. X Agent is not the sort of thing you find on GitHub. “We have only seen it used by FANCY BEAR. The source code for it has never been found on any public or underground forum,” Alperovitch told Defense One. What this shows is that the same Putin-backed actors that targeted the DNC were targeting soldiers in Ukraine in 2014. And it is unlikely that a 400 pound U.S. hacker (or for that matter, the Chinese) were helping Russian forces target Ukrainian Howitzers in the Donbass in 2014.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 22, 2016December 22, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Companies Involved in the Automotive Electronics Market NEW YORK, December 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — The technology sector is a naturally changing, developing and innovative environment. There were several new developments that took place in the automation industry sector recently. According to a research conducted by Global Market Insights, Inc. the automotive electronics market is projected to reach $352.92 billion by 2023, from $185.05 billion in 2015. The projected growth is explained by an increasing adoption of automation technologies by manufacturers across the industry. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) Innovative developments which make vehicles more efficient are taken into consideration alongside the projections. Like for example the new lithium-ion batteries coupled with electronic compressors for hybrid as well as electric vehicles designed to minimize the production costs. Another research by PWC has indicated that demand for the new digital technologies associated with connected and autonomous cars will grow, and with it the list of potential suppliers from outside the traditional automotive supply base. Cemtrex Inc. (NASDAQ: CETX) operates in a range of business segments and provides solutions to manufacturing industries. Through its Electronics Manufacturing Services group the company provides end-to-end electronic manufacturing services including product design and sustaining engineering services, systems integration, testing services and assembled electronic products. Cemtrex Inc. announced today that, “its consolidated results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30th, 2016. Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights: • Revenue increased by 65% to $93,704,560 for the twelve months ended in September 30, 2016 compared to $56,887,389 for the same period in 2015 • Net Income was up 76% to $4,994,045, equaling $0.59 per share, in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income of $2,838,116 or $0.41 in the same period in 2015. • EBITDA was up 120% to $9,053,839 in the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to EBITDA of $4,107,748 in the same period in 2015. Commenting on the yearly results, Mr. Saagar Govil, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company remarked, “This past year we were able to complete two strategic acquisitions that allowed our revenues to increase 65%. Out net income also increased 76% mainly due to the increased income from the acquired operations. We have been able to establish a repeat customer base through our proven technologies, cost-effective manufacturing, and on-time delivery of equipment which creates a positive outlook for sustainable revenue growth.” “Overall, this year was a great year for Cemtrex with as we have seen our number of shareholders increase substantially and a significant increase in our average trading volume. Additionally, we have recently filed for a Rights offering with Source Group, through the issuance of preferred shares, which when completed, would provide us additional resources for pursuing larger acquisitions. Furthermore, with the incoming Trump administration’s plan for increased infrastructure spending, we believe there is a lot to look forward to, as we continue to create value for our shareholders in the coming year,” continued Mr. Govil.” Automotive company, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), tests its wireless car chargers for EVs, self-driving vehicles. General Motors floor pad prototype wireless charging will allow its company’s self-driving cars to charge on its own by driving into a parking spot or garage capable of wirelessly charging at 7.7 kilowatt and 11KW charge. “Wireless charging is a technology that our customers have told us they are interested in,” Pamela Fletcher, GM executive chief engineer for electrified vehicles, said in a statement. “By testing the WiTricity prototype system, we can ensure that wireless charging systems will comply with proposed industry standards, which benefit the entire industry and consumers.” Tesla Motors Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Panasonic Corporation has had a long partnership together when it comes to the supply of Tesla’s car batteries. Conversely, Tesla is looking at other options to decrease risks, leaning more towards suppliers from South Korea. According to Teslarati, a source for Tesla News, the company has met with electronic giants Samsung SDI, LG Chem and SK innovation, to talk over the possibility of supplying car batteries for Tesla’s electronic cars. Tesla cars will be provided with tires from Hanjook Tire tires, and the OLED panels for the automotive systems will be by LG Display. An official from Tesla has released a statement saying: “Tesla intends to use more Korean technology on its Model 3… Tesla is testing the manufacturing capability and production of LG Chem, Samsung SDI and SK Innovation.” Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said the company will use $250 million over the next two years toward the development of self-driving cars. It’s a clear sign that the computer chip giant wants to play a huge role in the future of automobiles. In a statement, Intel says the investment will help “push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more.” Beforehand, the BMW said it was partnering with Intel and Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY), the Israeli supplier of driver assistance systems and sensors that supplies a large percentage of the auto industry, to produce fully autonomous vehicles by 2021.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio December 21, 2016 The same malware a Russian group used to attacked the DNC was targeting Ukrainian soldiers, says cybersecurity group. In the same way that a masterpiece bears the distinct signature of its maker, so does a masterpiece of malware. Consider the case of FANCY BEAR, one of the two groups that broke into the Democratic National Committee’s, or DNC, networks and which the intelligence community and cybersecurity pros believe to be connected to the Russian military intelligence service, or GRU. Crowdstrike, the company that found hackers on the DNC network, on Thursday published a report showing that FANCY BEAR used the same malware as part of combat operations in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, which enabled the Russian troops to better target Ukrainian artillery positions. It’s one of the strongest pieces of evidence to emerge to show the connection between the Russian military and the concerted effort to influence the 2016 presidential election through the publication of stolen emails. The malware in question is called X-Agent. Cybersecurity group TrendMicro originally discovered it in 2015 and connected it to a broad espionage operation from the Russian government aimed at political and military targets in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. It’s a piece of malware well known to the Putin-backed group that hacked the DNC, also known as FANCY BEAR. As Crowdstrike’s Dimitri Alperovitch describes in his June blog post on the DNC hack, the environment was sick with  “X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging.” Here’s what’s new, according to Crowdstrike. In 2013, a Ukrainian soldier named Yaroslav Sherstuk, with the 55th Artillery brigade developed a mobile phone application to help aim its long guns. The Android app was intended “to more rapidly process targeting data for the Soviet-era D-30 Howitzer employed by Ukrainian artillery forces.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. It was a math app for real time combat. Ukrainian soldiers using Soviet-era Howitzers had to  figure out the elevation of the target and the curvature of the earth, etc., using pen and paper, which took too much time. Sherstuk’s app did the same job quickly and easily: plug in the coordinates of the targets and the app would tell you settings that you needed to set for the Howitzer. Targeting time went from minutes to 15 seconds. When fighting began in Ukraine, the app spread among users on VK (the Russian-language Facebook knock off) and the like, eventually reaching more than 9,000 downloads. The Russian military realized that they could simply infect the app with X-Agent and the malware would spread as quickly as the app. “On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014,” Crowdstrike writes in their report. The pro-Russian fighters could find Ukrainian soldiers who were using the app to plan howitzer fires because the Ukrainians had given away their position through the app. As a result, Russian artillery launched more than 120 attacks on Ukrainians in 2014 between the July 9 and Sept. 5. As open source investigative group Bellingcat makes clear in this post: “In the days and weeks that followed, the units at the border were subjected to dozens of additional artillery attacks. By late July 2014, the massive bombardment reversed Ukrainian gains and contributed to the encirclement of portions of the Ukrainian armed forces. A separatist offensive across eastern Ukraine began simultaneously with the artillery attacks, leading to the separatists capturing much of the Russian-Ukrainian border along with vast areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts. “The pressure of sustained artillery attacks through early August led Ukrainian armed forces to lose control of hundreds of kilometers of border territory.” By some estimates, they lost more than 80 percent of their D-30 Howitzers, well beyond what they lost for other artillery pieces. Bottom line: The presence of the same bit of malware on the phones of Ukrainian soldiers just before they were fired on in 2014 – and then in the DNC servers just before embarrassing emails were published to Wikileaks in 2016  — is more than a coincidence. X Agent is not the sort of thing you find on GitHub. “We have only seen it used by FANCY BEAR. The source code for it has never been found on any public or underground forum,” Alperovitch told Defense One. What this shows is that the same Putin-backed actors that targeted the DNC were targeting soldiers in Ukraine in 2014. And it is unlikely that a 400 pound U.S. hacker (or for that matter, the Chinese) were helping Russian forces target Ukrainian Howitzers in the Donbass in 2014.

There is Intel’s Andy Grove, the chief executive who helped guide the computer industry into its modern era. Google has Sergey Brin. Microsoft? Satya Nadella. Run through nearly any big tech company and you’ll find its executive ranks filled with people who were born outside the United States. That brings us to Jan Koum, a founder of the messaging service WhatsApp, which Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014. Photo That Mr. Koum is also an immigrant is not unusual in Silicon Valley. What does make him unusual is the popularity of WhatsApp among immigrants. As Farhad Manjoo writes, WhatsApp has become a low-cost communications line between countries, even as some countries occasionally try to block its use. The popularity of WhatsApp, with more than a billion users, is by no means limited to the world’s immigrants, of course. People of all sorts have found it a useful — and simple — means of communication. But as Farhad writes, because it is free and has a fairly strong record on privacy and security, WhatsApp has become a part of immigrant life around the world. And its early adoptees often are older people who encourage their children or grandchildren to start using it so they can stay in touch. As Mr. Koum put it, the app “was designed in part by someone living the immigrant experience every day.” Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

The change, which comes just four weeks before the end of President Obama’s last term, removes the skeleton of a program that hasn’t been in use since 2011. When it was active, the “special registration” program—the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or NSEERS—had two parts, and applied only to people from 25 countries named by DHS. Twenty-four of them were Muslim-majority countries. One half of NSEERS was a domestic “call-in” registration program that required men ages 16 and up living in the U.S. to report regularly to immigration officials. The other half was an entry and exit tracking system, which limited the airports, seaports, and land borders that registrants could use to travel, and required them to register before leaving and after arriving. Related Story America Already Had a Muslim Registry NSEERS began in September 2002. The domestic call-in program was ended in December 2003, and the remaining entry and exit program was suspended in 2011, when DHS removed all 25 countries from the list of required participants. At the time, civil-rights groups asked the Obama administration to remove the regulations entirely, to prevent the program from being resurrected, and had intensified their calls recently, after Trump suggested using “watchlists” or “registries” to surveil Muslims in the U.S. The complete dismantling of NSEERS doesn’t prevent Trump from creating a new program to track people from Muslim-majority countries. But nor is it only a symbolic rejection of similar programs from the outgoing president. Leaving the program in place would have given Trump a turnkey registry in waiting. “DHS ceased use of NSEERS more than five years ago, after it was determined the program was redundant, inefficient and provided no increase in security,” a spokesperson for the agency said Thursday. “The intervening years have shown that NSEERS is not only obsolete, but that its use would divert limited personnel and resources from more effective measures.” A 2012 report from the DHS inspector general found that the program used buggy technology, relied on faulty databases, and cost the government $10 million per year to run. The inspector general recommended dismantling the program entirely, but the agency declined to follow that recommendation at the time. On Friday, when the government’s official notice will be printed in the Federal Register, the regulations behind the special-registration program will no longer exist.

It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Marc Burckhardt The Unbelievable Tale of Jesus’s Wife Ariel Sabar A hotly contested, supposedly ancient manuscript suggests Christ was married. But believing its origin story—a real-life Da Vinci Code, involving a Harvard professor, a onetime Florida pornographer, and an escape from East Germany—requires a big leap of faith. On a humid afternoon this past November, I pulled off Interstate 75 into a stretch of Florida pine forest tangled with runaway vines. My GPS was homing in on the house of a man I thought might hold the master key to one of the strangest scholarly mysteries in recent decades: a 1,300-year-old scrap of papyrus that bore the phrase “Jesus said to them, My wife.” The fragment, written in the ancient language of Coptic, had set off shock waves when an eminent Harvard historian of early Christianity, Karen L. King, presented it in September 2012 at a conference in Rome. Never before had an ancient manuscript alluded to Jesus’s being married. The papyrus’s lines were incomplete, but they seemed to describe a dialogue between Jesus and the apostles over whether his “wife”—possibly Mary Magdalene—was “worthy” of discipleship. Its main point, King argued, was that “women who are wives and mothers can be Jesus’s disciples.” She thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether “marriage or celibacy [was] the ideal mode of Christian life” and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro The War on Stupid People David H. Freedman American society increasingly mistakes intelligence for human worth. As recently as the 1950s, possessing only middling intelligence was not likely to severely limit your life’s trajectory. IQ wasn’t a big factor in whom you married, where you lived, or what others thought of you. The qualifications for a good job, whether on an assembly line or behind a desk, mostly revolved around integrity, work ethic, and a knack for getting along—bosses didn’t routinely expect college degrees, much less ask to see SAT scores. As one account of the era put it, hiring decisions were “based on a candidate having a critical skill or two and on soft factors such as eagerness, appearance, family background, and physical characteristics.” The 2010s, in contrast, are a terrible time to not be brainy. Those who consider themselves bright openly mock others for being less so. Even in this age of rampant concern over microaggressions and victimization, we maintain open season on the nonsmart. People who’d swerve off a cliff rather than use a pejorative for race, religion, physical appearance, or disability are all too happy to drop the s‑bomb: Indeed, degrading others for being “stupid” has become nearly automatic in all forms of disagreement. Continue Reading NBC Seth Meyers Proves He's the Anti-Fallon David Sims The Late Night host ripped into Donald Trump’s history with the birther movement, just days after his NBC colleague’s softball interview with the candidate. When Jimmy Fallon talked to Donald Trump on The Tonight Show last week, he ruffled the presidential candidate’s hair. Seth Meyers, the host of Fallon’s former show Late Night, had a slightly different message for the Republican presidential candidate last night. “Obama was born in the United States, period?” he asked mockingly, repeating Trump’s recent specious assertion that he was no longer a believer in the “birther” movement. “Fuck you, exclamation point!” Sadly, Meyers couldn’t say this to Trump’s face—in fact, until last week, the late-night host had jokingly banned the candidate from appearing on the show as a response to Trump’s ban of The Washington Post from his press events. He recently lifted that ban after Trump did the same, but joked to The Huffington Post that Late Night was “pretty booked up” on guests from now through November. But even if he were invited, it’s hard to imagine Trump appearing on Meyers’s show, which has become an appreciable counterbalance to the much more light-hearted antics of his hair-ruffling network partner. Continue Reading Olaf Blecker The Binge Breaker Bianca Bosker Tristan Harris believes Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones. He’s determined to make it stop. On a recent evening in San Francisco, Tristan Harris, a former product philosopher at Google, took a name tag from a man in pajamas called “Honey Bear” and wrote down his pseudonym for the night: “Presence.” Harris had just arrived at Unplug SF, a “digital detox experiment” held in honor of the National Day of Unplugging, and the organizers had banned real names. Also outlawed: clocks, “w-talk” (work talk), and “WMDs” (the planners’ loaded shorthand for wireless mobile devices). Harris, a slight 32-year-old with copper hair and a tidy beard, surrendered his iPhone, a device he considers so addictive that he’s called it “a slot machine in my pocket.” He keeps the background set to an image of Scrabble tiles spelling out the words face down, a reminder of the device’s optimal position. Continue Reading Sara Wong / The Atlantic No Spanking, No Time-Out, No Problems Olga Khazan A child psychologist argues punishment is a waste of time when trying to eliminate problem behavior. Try this instead. Say you have a problem child. If it’s a toddler, maybe he smacks his siblings. Or she refuses to put on her shoes as the clock ticks down to your morning meeting at work. If it’s a teenager, maybe he peppers you with obscenities during your all-too-frequent arguments. The answer is to punish them, right? Not so, says Alan Kazdin, director of the Yale Parenting Center. Punishment might make you feel better, but it won’t change the kid’s behavior. Instead, he advocates for a radical technique in which parents positively reinforce the behavior they do want to see until the negative behavior eventually goes away. As I was reporting my recent series about child abuse, I came to realize that parents fall roughly into three categories. There’s a small number who seem intuitively to do everything perfectly: Moms and dads with chore charts that actually work and snack-sized bags of organic baby carrots at the ready. There’s an even smaller number who are horrifically abusive to their kids. But the biggest chunk by far are parents in the middle. They’re far from abusive, but they aren’t super-parents, either. They’re busy and stressed, so they’re too lenient one day and too harsh the next. They have outdated or no knowledge of child psychology, and they’re scrambling to figure it all out. Continue Reading Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP What Americans Don’t Get About Nordic Countries Anu Partanen When U.S. politicians talk about Scandinavian-style social welfare, they fail to explain the most important aspect of such policies: selfishness. Bernie Sanders is hanging on, still pushing his vision of a Nordic-like socialist utopia for America, and his supporters love him for it. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is chalking up victories by sounding more sensible. “We are not Denmark,” she said in the first Democratic debate, pointing instead to America’s strengths as a land of freedom for entrepreneurs and businesses. Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Sanders’s Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they’d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That’s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too. A Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I’m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I’m told, because they are small, homogeneous “nanny states” where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family. This, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don’t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I’m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good. What this is mostly taken to mean is that Americans will never, ever agree to pay higher taxes to provide universal social services, as the Nordics do. Thus Bernie Sanders, and anyone else in the U.S. who brings up Nordic countries as an example for America, is living in la-la land. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Democrats Have a Religion Problem Emma Green A conversation with Michael Wear, a former Obama White House staffer, about the party’s illiteracy on and hostility toward white evangelicals. There aren’t many people like Michael Wear in today’s Democratic Party. The former director of Barack Obama’s 2012 faith-outreach efforts is a theologically conservative evangelical Christian. He is opposed to both abortion and same-sex marriage, although he would argue that those are primarily theological positions, and other issues, including poverty and immigration, are also important to his faith. During his time working for Obama, Wear was often alone in many of his views, he writes in his new book, Reclaiming Hope. He helped with faith-outreach strategies for Obama’s 2008 campaign, but was surprised when some state-level officials decided not to pursue this kind of engagement: “Sometimes—as I came to understand the more I worked in politics—a person’s reaction to religious ideas is not ideological at all, but personal,” he writes.

Reno of First Things is feeling “guardedly optimistic.” The editor of the conservative, religious magazine cautiously supported the Republican’s candidacy. Reno does not believe Trump will fix what he sees as America’s frayed social contract. But he does think the incoming president will disrupt the current political system, which he considers deeply flawed. I spoke with Reno about his outlook for the coming administration. We discussed Reno’s reasons for supporting Trump (“I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for [Trump’s] policies,” he said); the alt-right (a kind of performance art, he argues); and how Christian principles should influence policy (“Americans are uniquely tempted to imagine that we are a church … This is one of the reasons why we’re such a dangerous country,” he said). At its center, though, our conversation was about the possibilities and limits of multi-cultural democracy—what makes a nation, and what’s happening to visions of a global, open-borders world.

Perhaps the clearest takeaway from the November election for many liberals is that Hillary Clinton lost because she ignored the working class. In the days after her shocking loss, Democrats complained that Clinton had no jobs agenda. A widely shared essay in The Nation blamed Clinton's "neoliberalism" for abandoning the voters who swung the election. “I come from the white working class,” Bernie Sanders said on CBS This Morning, “and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to where I came from.” But here is the troubling reality for civically minded liberals looking to justify their preferred strategies: Hillary Clinton talked about the working class, middle class jobs, and the dignity of work constantly. And she still lost. Continue Reading How to Turn Anxiety Into Excitement Jeremy Raff and Olga Khazan It takes three words.

The age of loanership Internet of Things Back to Home Vodafone demos NB-IoT technology with Nokia and Telit in Germany Increase / Decrease text size Byomakesh Biswal 23rd December 2016 0 0Shares 0 0 0 0 Add to favorites Narrow band IOT technology will be commercially available from early 2017. Vodafone has demonstrated the use of narrowband internet-of-things (NB-IoT) at its lab in Dusseldorf, Germany, working with Nokia and IoT specialist Telit. The project used Nokia’s radio access network and elements from the company’s cloud packet core solution. Device manufacturers and applications developers will use the system in trials of new products and solutions to extend the IoT ecosystem. The system used an Intel chipset integrated into a NB-IoT module. In the trial, it was embedded into a Shitek ultrasonic gas meter to transmit data on gas flow over a 4G Vodafone test network. The technology allows radio signals to reach further inside buildings to connect sensors and supports lower power consumption, with battery life prolonged for about 15 years. NB-IoT is a 3GPP Rel. 13 radio access technology, which will co-exist with operators’ existing networks to benefit from mobile security and privacy features. The improved coverage of NB-IoT compared to conventional LTE will enable for the tracking of objects deep within buildings and in rural areas. Vodafone Group Research & Development and Technology Strategy head and GSMA NB-IoT Forum chairman Luke Ibbetson said: “NB-IoT will be commercially available from early 2017 and, because it has strong support from across the telecoms industry, will be the technology used to connect millions more things to the Internet. “We are very pleased to make the Vodafone Open Labs available to companies that want to exchange ideas and to develop and test connected products and services powered by NB-IoT.” Nokia global customer business team head Roberto Loiola said: “The low power attributes and reach of NB-IoT make it an ideal technology to connect the Internet of Things. The trial with Telit showed how NB-IoT is perfectly suited to manage a network comprised of devices and sensors from multiple vendors. “At Nokia we are constantly innovating to allow our customers to evolve their offer and anticipate the needs of their subscribers and our work with Vodafone at the Open Lab is a prime example of this.” Tags Homepage News List IoT Previous ArticleSoftware flaw overstated Twitter’s video advertisement viewership Next ArticleEconomics of Big Software: What you need to know Most read UK Gov scheme will fast track tech to boost £22bn cyber sector Hannah Williams 21st December 2016 OpenStack becomes ‘de facto’ private cloud James Nunns 21st December 2016 Airlines face hacker hijack threat from vulnerable Panasonic systems James Nunns 20th December 2016 ECB goes Advanced in search for next England cricket stars James Nunns 19th December 2016 BT Tower becomes world’s highest IoT base station Byomakesh Biswal 19th December 2016 AI in 2017: 14 funny things that could become a (crazy) reality Ellie Burns 16th December 2016 Have you been pwned?

With many businesses bringing in new technology for efficiency and success, digital change reduces processes, and increases productivity. According to a global survey commissioned by Dell and Intel, the influx of digitally native candidates entering the workplace value high tech perks more than free food; making it imperative for HR to keep up with the shift.  Furthermore, the study found that 42% of Millennial employees are willing to quit their job if office technologies are not up to standard – with over half of employees expecting to work in a ‘Smart’ office in the next five years. Therefore, it is important that the online habits of employees be taken into account. Having information at our fingertips has fuelled the growth of chatbots, backed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). As messenger apps become increasingly popular, the way service departments interact with their customers is evolving. The same applies to global mobility and the interaction between mobility specialists and employees on assignment. MAIA, the intelligent global mobility chatbot, can support employees around the clock by providing direct access to the employee's assignment details in a simple conversational interface. MAIA accesses the relevant data in MoveAssist's flagship product mai-assignment - a complete global mobility software solution that facilitates assignment management - and provides detailed answers to employee questions. Integrated with both Facebook Messenger and Slack, employees do not need to navigate away from the everyday messenger apps that they are already using. By combining Slack and Facebook Messenger the accessibility and usability of MAIA has further improved, so all employees get the benefit of MAIA’s knowledge directly in the social apps they use every day - enhancing the on-assignment experience and increasing employee satisfaction.   Have your say Guide to Outplacement and Career Transition The digital dilemma Skype, FaceTime, text , email, direct message, webinars; all technological advances...

The New Features & Exciting Changes Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 23 December 2016. Page 1 of 3. 14 Comments Linus Torvalds is expected to release the Linux 4.10-rc1 kernel this weekend ahead of Christmas and thereby marking the formal end of the 4.10 merge window, but with all of the major pull requests already submitted and Linus tending not to honor last-minute pull requests of big changes, here is our usual look at the exciting changes and new features you will be able to find with the Linux 4.10 kernel. While you can try out the Linux 4.10 Git code today or any of the weekly release candidates, those sticking to stable releases will find Linux 4.10 debut around the middle of February if there are no delays in Torvalds' usual release practices. The one sentence overview would be lots of open-source graphics driver work (as always), the open-source NVIDIA driver is killing it with this release, Intel TBM3 support, UBIFS file-encryption, more AMD Zen/Ryzen code, more ARM SoCs/platforms being mainlined, DAX iomap support, and a fair amount of other new hardware support. The detailed highlights of Linux 4.10 from my perspective of "interesting stuff" are: Graphics: - The open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) DRM driver this time around is quite exciting after missing out on their changes for Linux 4.9. Work here includes atomic mode-setting, DisplayPort MST, performance-improving BOOST support, a LED driver for the light-up cards, and more. If atomic mode-setting or boost support doesn't get you excited in the open-source NVIDIA driver for Linux 4.10, at least you can now control the green LEDs on relevant NVIDIA graphics cards with 4.10... - The AMDGPU DRM driver has power management fixes, RPM fan information exposed, and GPU VM manager work. - The GCN 1.0 / Southern Islands support in AMDGPU is still experimental and disabled by default but there are some improvements for interested users. - Intel GVT support is being prepped and should be in good shape for Linux 4.11. A lot of other GVT-related code landed via the other pull requests for this graphics virtualization technology out of Intel Corp. - The Intel DRM driver also had scheduler prep work and priority boosting as some of their latest feature work. - The Raspberry Pi VC4 DRM driver has ETC1 texture compression and fragment shader threading support. - Freedreno's MSM DRM driver has initial Adreno A5xx support thanks in part to work by Qualcomm's Code Aurora group. - Three new DRM drivers: the ZTE VOU ZX, Amlogic Meson, and MXS FB. - Outside of DRM, the Linux kernel now has no one left as FBDEV maintainer. Next section the AMD Zen/Ryzen fun and more...

On December 9, US media reported that the CIA allegedly concluded in a "secret" assessment that Russia had meddled in the November presidential elections and helped Republican candidate Donald Trump win.

Cloud Services Elevate the Profile of DevOps The increased use of cloud services has brought with it unprecedented complexity, which has led directly to the growing profile of DevOps within organizations. IaaS Rules the Cloud More than 51% of IT respondents whose companies have deployed cloud solutions chose Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). 22% selected Platform as a Service (PaaS), and 20% chose Software as a Service (SaaS). DevOps Dominates Workweek DevOps professionals spend an average of 25.1 hours of their 40-hour workweek using, monitoring or evaluating DevOps tools and solutions. Big Workloads Breaking down the DevOps workload, respondents reported spending 10.1 hours a week on tuning infrastructure, 9.5 hours on remediation analysis, and 5.5 hours on cloud application performance management. Bigger Infrastructure = More Tuning DevOps workers in organizations with at least 500 employees spend more time each week (12 hours) tuning the infrastructure than do employees in organizations with 250 or fewer employees (8 hours). Performance Tools Get Raves Between 50% and 67% of respondents had positive views of the performance and supporting tools of solutions such as VMware, OpenStack and Docker. Projects, Communities Score Poorly Conversely, favorability ratings of VMware, OpenStack and Docker fell between 28% and 38% for the amount of supporting projects, and between 9% and 17% for the activity of their communities. Focus on Strategy 84% of responding VMware users said they have a container deployment and management strategy, indicating that companies are matching the evolution of technology with a more concentrated strategic focus. Noisy Neighbor Problem 69% of respondents said they are aware of the "noisy neighbor problem," which happens when a cloud infrastructure tenant hogs resources and negatively impacts the performance of other users. Problem Solved 82% of those who said they're aware of the noisy neighbor problem also said they have a strategy for dealing with it. Preference for Containers, Bare Metal About half of respondents from organizations with cloud management strategies emphasize container use (55%) or implement on bare metal (50%).

This reality has led directly to the growing profile of DevOps within organizations as more hours are devoted to maintenance, monitoring and operations. In fact, a recent Intel data center survey, "The State of Enterprise Cloud Services," found that DevOps teams are spending the majority of their time on these lower-value activities. "Most enterprises are not leveraging sophisticated tools currently available that would decrease these hours by at least 50 percent and instead require a team's valuable resources to spend their time performing manual, tedious, time-intensive work," said Jeff Klaus, general manager of data center solutions for Intel. "If you don't see how advanced solutions free up your talent to focus on higher output tasks that look ahead on the product roadmap or impact the bottom line, you're really only doing a disservice to your enterprise." The report was conducted by Morar Consulting, which polled 204 IT executives, software engineers and DevOps decision-makers.           Tony Kontzer, a Baseline contributor, has been writing about the intersection of technology and business for more than 20 years and currently freelances from Grass Valley, Calif.             Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters Baseline Briefing Baseline Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend Smarter Technology             Most Popular News Slideshows Chatbot & AI Help Mall Engage Guests, Build Brand Cyber-Attackers Target IP Assets Cloud Services Elevate the Profile of DevOps A Critical Shift in Thinking About AI and Big Data Managing Personal & Work Identities in the Office Why Producing Presentations Is Still ...

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Gadgets Ultrabooks - Dell XPS 13 VS MacBook Pro 13” Elroy Bethell - December 23, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Here are two Ultrabooks that offer great features for this classification of laptops. They are both highly portable, very thin and light, and boast excellent battery life. But let’s see how they compare. Ultrabooks have garnered quite a following lately.  They are thin, lightweight and come packed with features that make them a viable choice for anyone looking for a computer that they can take with them wherever they go. Let’s take a quick look at how the Dell XPS13 and MacBook Pro 13” stack up. I picked both models with close specs for a fair assessment, so both have the same amount of RAM, and SSD storage.     According to the SPECS Chart below, we see the following:   Processor: The MacBook Pro 13” has the faster processor of the two ultrabooks. The MacBook features Intel’s fifth-generation dual-core processor that houses the CPU, L3 cache, Intel Iris Graphics 6100, and fast 1866MHz memory controller on a single chip. These processors feature Turbo Boost technology that automatically boosts the processor clock speed based on workload, giving you extra processing power when you need it. And Hyper-Threading technology allows two threads to run simultaneously on each core. Screen: The Dell XPS 13 has a stunning Quad HD+ display that outshines other 13-inch laptops. It features the world’s first infinity display which is almost borderless 13-inch screen inside an 11-inch laptop. When compared to the Apple MacBook Air 13, the XPS 13 is 23% smaller with the same screen size. Size: At its thickest point, the Dell XPS measures 0.59 which makes it thinner than the MacBook Pro. Weight: The Dell also has the MacBook Pro 13” beat in this category by weighing in at 2.9 pounds compared to the MacBook Pro’s 3.48 pounds. Battery: The MacBook Pro wins in the area by providing 12 hours of battery life compared to the 11 hours listed for the Dell XPS.   Here are the SPECS:   Dell XPS 13 MacBook Pro 13” Processor Intel Core i5-6200U 2.30 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology up to 2.80 GHz 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz   RAM 8GB 8GB Storage 256GB SSD 256GB PCIe-based flash storage Screen Size 13.3 in QHD+ LCD InfinityEdge touchscreen 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display Screen Resolution 3200 x 1800 2560 x 1600 (Retina) Touchscreen 10-point multi-touch No Thinness 0.35-0.59 inch 0.71 inch Weight 2.9 Lbs 3.48 Lbs Pen No No Biometric log-in No No Voice Activation Cortana personal assistant No Security Complete, built-in, Continuous NO Battery Life Up to 11 hours Up to 12 hours   "If you can find a PS3 anywhere in North America that's been on shelves for more than five minutes, I'll give you 1,200 bucks for it." -- SCEA President Jack Tretton Latest Headlines Honor's new “EPIC “ Smartphone - Unveiling at CES 2017 January 2, 2017, 3:00 AM LG V20 Smartphone, is this a good deal?

Meet The Publisher Meet The Team Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Home Mobile Gadgets Trending Business Women & Tech Contests Christmas Gifts, New Gadgets Can Compromise Your Online Security, Safety  By: Lee Rickwood December 23, 2016 The holiday gifting season is in full swing, but so too, the potential for holiday hacking. Yes, even Christmas lights themselves – accessed through a connected smartphone and mobile app – can compromise your online safety, security and privacy. Connected devices and consumer gadgets such as laptops and PCs, streaming media devices, drones, wearables, smart home products – even Christmas lights themselves – can compromise your online safety, security and privacy. In fact, hackable holiday gifts can be a threat to all of us if they are not used wisely or if they are left unprotected when hooked up to the ever-widening Internet of Things. IoT devices have been used in recent cybersecurity incidents that compromise the privacy of their owners and the security of the Internet overall. Barely two months ago, a major Web attack took down Shopify, SoundCloud, Spotify, Twitter and other popular websites; hackers can use unsecured webcams and other things connected to the Internet as their break-in tools. Another website was streaming live video from literally tens of thousands of connected webcams that had been hijacked; the cameras (being used in both residential and commercial settings) were unsecure because users did set them up properly – or safely. Video cameras and many other connected devices come with built-in username and password options so that owners can use and manage their gadgets. But factory default settings are easy to hijack, and connected gadget owners must take the steps needed to ensure the device has the latest updates, patches and individually customized password settings. Potentially value and revealing data can be collected from numerous smart devices and connected gadgets if passwords and other protections are not used. So, while gadget manufacturers surely have a duty to design privacy, safety and security tools into their products, so too, consumers have a duty to protect themselves and each other by being educated about their device and using safety tools that are available. “Connected devices are a popular holiday present because they offer convenience and entertainment,” said Brenda Moretto, Canadian consumer manager with Intel Security. “But Canadians need to be aware that connected devices that aren’t properly secured can expose important personal and financial information.” # # # Intel advises holiday gift- and gadget-loving techies to heed its tips for safe, secure and private uses of devices connected to the Internet of Things: Securing the devices itself, not only through use of robust passwords and user IDs, but also with the installation of security enhancement and virus protection software. Of course, connected devices are only as secure as their connection, and the use of smart home apps or any connected device across public Wi-Fi can expose users to risks. Device software should be kept up-to-date with authorized updates and software patches, and of course, strong passwords, PINs, even biometric authorization (fingerprint or face scanning) should always be used with any connected device. # # # Last year tech analysis firm Gartner estimated that over 5 million new things get connected every day, and the company said over 20 billion connected devices will be in use by the year 2020. Wearables devices and personal fitness gadgets are very popular gifts, but they too are connected to the Internet and thus are vulnerable to hacking and hijacking. Seeking some ways to come to grip with those 20 billion potential threats, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC) has participated in a Global Privacy Enforcement Network’s annual privacy sweep, in which 25 data protection authorities from around the world looked at 314 devices. The OPC focused on health devices, like fitness trackers and heart rate monitors, while the other partners looked at everything from connected toys to smart TV’s and cars. In describing what risks and potential threats the survey found, the OPC’s Director of Technology Analysis Luk Arbuckle noted that great potential, promise and power of the Internet of Things also comes with great responsibility, again, both from the manufacturer and the user community. Intel Security’s chief consumer security evangelist Gary Davis has posted his holiday advice about hackable gift-giving in a recent blog post, and the OPC has also launched a privacy blog filled with tips that can help all of us have a safe and secure holiday and a happy New Year.   -30-   Featured Gadgets Mobile Trending apps cameras Canada gadgets privacy security smart home smartphone software technology wearables About Lee Rickwood Lee Rickwood covers developments in media and technology with particular interest in how such developments affect our social, political and economic activities and interactions.

NEW DELHI: The first phase of this year's placement at IIT Madras has 56 per cent of its registered students placed in 176 companies. Placements that started on December 1 at Madras had a total of 14 sessions interviews in which 672 out of 1195 registered students were placed. Along with the 57 students who have accepted pre-placement offers, the total number of students placed so far is 729. The first phase saw 176 companies making job offers to the students, according to the release issued by the insititute. Companies that made large number of offers include Intel, Citicorp Services, Eaton, Samsung R&D Bangalore, Ersnt and Young, EXL Services, Belcan and Axis Bank. A total of 9 international offers were made including 3 in the graveyard session. 90 participating companies were from the core and R&D sectors. This was followed by 43 in IT related sector. There were also more than 35 companies in Analytics and Consulting. 45 start-up companies made 137 offers, in which 116 students ultimately were placed. Among the major start-up recruiters were Belcan, Citicorp Services, Enfrein, My Ally and Noodle Analytics. Apart from Indian Navy, ISRO and ONGC that had conducted their placements before December 1, IIT Madras saw participation from Coal India, BEL, and CDAC among the government sector companies during the first phase of placements. More PSU and government sector companies are expected on campus during the next phase (from the middle of Jan 2017). “The first phase of campus placements saw almost 60% of our registered students getting job offers, which is a similar situation as last year. Despite the unanticipated break in the placement schedule on 6th and 7th December due the unfortunate demise of the Chief Minister of the State, and the difficulties faced during the Cyclone Vardah, the placement season was successful," Manu Santhanam, Advisor Training & Placement said.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home Reviews Cases, Cooling & PSU CPU Air Coolers Thermalright Le Grand Macho RT CPU Cooler Review Thermalright's Le Grand Macho is one of the best CPU air coolers we've tested in a long time. You need to take a look at this one. By: Chad Sebring | CPU Air Coolers in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: 1 week, 3 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 97%Manufacturer: Thermalright Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging] Page 3 [Thermalright Le Grand Macho CPU Cooler] Page 4 [Accessories and Documentation] Page 5 [Installation and Finished Product] Page 6 [Test System Setup, Thermal Tests, and Noise Results] Page 7 [Final Thoughts] Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing     Even though we just had a look at the Macho Direct, Thermalright has also introduced a cousin to this cooler, still sporting the Macho name as well. This time around, we are still offered a semi-passive CPU cooling option, but improvements have been made to what we just saw from their previous submission. In this design, there are more fins added to the stack, the base is larger to take on the LGA2011 CPUs, and along with an added heat pipe in the mix, this time the cooler is dressed to the nines as well. While similar at a glance, for those who thought he Macho Direct was a bit on the dull side, Thermalright still has an option for those of you who need the coolers appearance to be dressed up.     Adding more fins and an extra pipe does take up some of the available room the previous design offered, but it also does one vital thing on top of that as well. Rather than the 200W TDP that the Macho Direct has, this cooler offers an astonishing 280W TDP. This means that whether going AMD or Intel for your processor, this cooler has the grapes it takes to handle anything you can throw at it, even the most extravagant overclocks for suicide runs if that is the type of thing you enjoy doing. Of course, to do so, you will want to use this cooler with a fan to actively cool the tower. On the flip side, the TDP is so high, so that when and if you decide to run this cooler without a fan on it, depending on only the chassis cooling to pass air over it, you can still manage temperatures without any noise associated from this cooler at all.   If this were just the Macho Direct with a bit of lipstick on it, we would have no issues telling you that, but this is not the case. The Le Grand Macho RT shipped from Thermalright is a level above, while just resembling a more affordable solution. Something to pay attention to though is that there are two versions of this cooler. There is one sold as Le Grand Macho, which ships without a fan, and then there is the Le Grand Macho RT shipped with a TY-147 fan to cool it actively. As for our needs, we will be testing the cooler with the fan that accompanies it, as our test rig is not made to test passive coolers adequately. Since we run without an exhaust fan, our results in semi-passive mode would have shed a bad light on the Le Grand Macho, as it would be left to stew in its juices inside of the D-Frame chassis. That being said, we should move on, and see what this Thermalright Le Grand Macho is all about, and just what this 280W TDP cooler is capable of.     Our chart for the specifications is taken directly from the product page of the Le Grand Macho from Thermalright. In it, we are first shown the dimensions of the cooler, where we are shown that it is 150mm from side to side, it is 120mm from front to back without the base included, and 125mm with it included, and to the top of the pipe tips from the base, this cooler stands 159mm tall. We also see the weight has drastically increased from the Macho Direct, and that 900 grams does not include the 160 additional grams of the fan. We see there is a total of seven heat pipes in this design, all of which are 6mm in diameter. The aluminum fins are 0.4mm thick with a 3.1mm gap between each of them, and there are 35 fins in total. There is a mention of the C1100 Pure copper used in the base, but no mention of the copper that comprises the heat pipes, and there is also no mention of the nickel coating applied to both of them.   The fan that comes along with the Le Grand Macho RT is the Thermalright TY-147B fan. This fan is 140mm wide, 152mm tall, and 26.5mm in thickness. The speed of it can range from 300 to 1300 RPM, pushing a range of air flow from 16.9 to 73.6 CFM, but no mention of the air pressure level. We also see that this fan is shown to be only 21 dB(A) in noise level when fully powered, but normally it will be below that while using the 4-pin PWM controlled connection to the motherboard. The last couple of things to note in this chart are that the fan uses a fluid dynamic bearing, and the Le Grand Macho is indeed rated at 280W of TDP.   From earlier emails, we were shown the MSRP for both the Le Grand Macho, as well as the Le Grand Macho RT, where the former is offered at €59.99, and the latter was to release for €69.99. With the Euro nearly identical currently to the US dollar, pricing should still be close to what the MSRP is on the other side of the pond. We were able to find listings for the Le Grand Macho, where Newegg is asking $69.90 for it, and Amazon is asking $69.99 right now. So, there is a $10 increase on US shores. However, while the fan-less version is easy to get your hands-on, we only found one listing of the Le Grand Macho RT, and it is shown without a price as it is currently unavailable from Amazon at this time.   If we had to take a stab at the pricing, we would expect it to fall in the $79.99 to $89.99 range to add the TY-147B to the cooler. Considering the Le Grand Macho has a near $40 increase on the asking price over the Macho Direct, this cooler better look the part and play the part even better. The bar was raised high once we saw what the Macho Direct brought to the table. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find the Thermalright Le Grand Macho RT CPU Cooler for sale below.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it In this Dec. 12 photo, National Security Advise-designate Michael T. Flynn, waits for an elevator at Trump Tower in New York. (Kathy Willens/AP) By Jerry Markon December 23, 2016 Follow @JerryMarkon President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for national security adviser partnered in recent months with a technology company co-led by a businessman who pleaded guilty to trying to sell stolen scientific material in the 1980s to the KGB, the former Soviet intelligence service. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn joined the advisory board of Brainwave Science in February, company documents show. The Massachusetts firm develops controversial “brain fingerprinting” technology designed to assess whether people under interrogation are being truthful by measuring their brain waves. The firm offers training in how to use the technology, in partnership with Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, according to Brainwave’s website. One of Brainwave’s two-member board of directors was Sabu Kota, an Indian-born software engineer who pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to an FBI agent posing as a Soviet spy. Prosecutors said the sale stemmed from what they called Kota’s involvement in a spy ring that passed sensitive defense technology to the KGB between 1985 and 1990, according to a Defense Department summary of the case. Brainwave Science removed Kota’s name from the company website sometime between Thursday and Friday, when Bloomberg News published a report about Flynn’s ties to the firm, according to a search of archived Google data. Company officials and officials from Trump’s transition team did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, and Kota did not respond to messages left at his home. Kota’s lawyer denied that he had any connection to spying when he was charged in 1995, and Kota told Bloomberg that the criminal charges were a misunderstanding and stemmed from a patent dispute, not espionage. Bloomberg also quoted a Trump transition official as saying that Flynn had no dealings with Kota during his time working with Brainwave and that he has ended his association with the firm. The connection between Flynn — a decorated military intelligence officer and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency — and the company is the latest controversy involving relations between Russia and Trump or members of his team. Trump has faced criticism for expressing his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and on Friday the president-elect released what he called “a very nice letter” from the Russian leader. Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Putin at a lavish gala for the state-run channel RT, a trip Flynn admitted he was paid to make. Former U.S. officials said Flynn, seen dining next to Putin in photos published by Russian outlets, was used as a prop by the autocratic leader. Flynn defended the trip, saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels such as CNN, and that he had pressed Putin’s government to behave more responsibly in international affairs. The length and precise nature of Flynn’s contacts with the Brainwave firm could not be determined on Friday. Bloomberg reported that Flynn was supposed to help drum up new business for the firm with U.S. agencies, and that he has met with company officials at least 10 times. The meetings reportedly were held as late as September, when Flynn helped pitch Brainwave’s services to officials from the Bangladeshi defense forces. Independent scientists have disputed the accuracy and reliability of brain fingerprinting, and Brainwave has not released research supporting its claims that the tool is highly effective. But Bloomberg quoted Brainwave President Krishna Ika as saying that Flynn had tested the device himself, donning a helmet-like headpiece fitted with sensors. “He found it very convincing,” Ika told the news service. 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Here’s a look at Trump’s administration so far View Photos The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team.

News Nation & World National politics Michael Flynn had role in firm co-led by man who tried to sell material to the KGB Michael Flynn Andrew Harnik / AP Retired Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for national security adviser, listens as Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016. Retired Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for national security adviser, listens as Trump speaks to members of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016. (Andrew Harnik / AP) Jerry MarkonThe Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for national security adviser partnered in recent months with a technology company co-led by a businessman who pleaded guilty to trying to sell stolen scientific material in the 1980s to the KGB, the former Soviet intelligence service. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn joined the advisory board of Brainwave Science in February, company documents show. The Massachusetts firm develops controversial "brain fingerprinting" technology designed to assess whether people under interrogation are being truthful by measuring their brain waves. The firm offers training in how to use the technology, in partnership with Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, according to Brainwave's website. One of Brainwave's two-member board of directors was Sabu Kota, an Indian-born software engineer who pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to an FBI agent posing as a Soviet spy. Prosecutors said the sale stemmed from what they called Kota's involvement in a spy ring that passed sensitive defense technology to the KGB between 1985 and 1990, according to a Defense Department summary of the case. Trump's national security adviser shared secrets without permission, files show Craig Whitlock, Greg Miller A secret U.S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, "inappropriately shared" classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents... A secret U.S. military investigation in 2010 determined that Michael T. Flynn, the retired Army general tapped to serve as national security adviser in the Trump White House, "inappropriately shared" classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan, newly released documents... (Craig Whitlock, Greg Miller) Brainwave Science removed Kota's name from the company website sometime between Thursday and Friday, when Bloomberg News published a report about Flynn's ties to the firm, according to a search of archived Google data. Company officials and officials from Trump's transition team did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, and Kota did not respond to messages left at his home. Kota's lawyer denied that he had any connection to spying when he was charged in 1995, and Kota told Bloomberg that the criminal charges were a misunderstanding and stemmed from a patent dispute, not espionage. Bloomberg also quoted a Trump transition official as saying that Flynn had no dealings with Kota during his time working with Brainwave and that he has ended his association with the firm. Trump adviser's son dropped from transition team amid conspiracy fallout Greg Miller The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn... The son of the top national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump was removed from the new administration's transition team on Tuesday after backing a bogus conspiracy theory that inspired a shooting incident in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael Flynn... (Greg Miller) The connection between Flynn - a decorated military intelligence officer and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency - and the company is the latest controversy involving relations between Russia and Trump or members of his team. Trump has faced criticism for expressing his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and on Friday the president-elect released what he called "a very nice letter" from the Russian leader. Flynn stunned former colleagues when he traveled to Moscow last year to appear alongside Putin at a lavish gala for the state-run channel RT, a trip Flynn admitted he was paid to make. Former U.S. officials said Flynn, seen dining next to Putin in photos published by Russian outlets, was used as a prop by the autocratic leader. Flynn defended the trip, saying he saw no distinction between RT and U.S. news channels such as CNN, and that he had pressed Putin's government to behave more responsibly in international affairs. Trump's pick for national security adviser brings with him military intelligence experience, harsh criticism Greg Miller The most influential national security job in the still-forming Trump administration will likely go to a retired three-star general who helped dismantle insurgent networks in Afghanistan and Iraq but then surprised - and sometimes dismayed - colleagues by joining the political insurgency led by... The most influential national security job in the still-forming Trump administration will likely go to a retired three-star general who helped dismantle insurgent networks in Afghanistan and Iraq but then surprised - and sometimes dismayed - colleagues by joining the political insurgency led by... (Greg Miller) The length and precise nature of Flynn's contacts with the Brainwave firm could not be determined on Friday. Bloomberg reported that Flynn was supposed to help drum up new business for the firm with U.S. agencies, and that he has met with company officials at least 10 times. The meetings reportedly were held as late as September, when Flynn helped pitch Brainwave's services to officials from the Bangladeshi defense forces. Independent scientists have disputed the accuracy and reliability of brain fingerprinting, and Brainwave has not released research supporting its claims that the tool is highly effective. But Bloomberg quoted Brainwave President Krishna Ika as saying that Flynn had tested the device himself, donning a helmet-like headpiece fitted with sensors. "He found it very convincing," Ika told the news service. Julie Tate and Laura Helmuth contributed to this report.

To make sure you never miss an issue, subscribe to my weekly email briefing. News Twitter testing notifications for breaking news—Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey insists that Twitter is a news platform, a channel for sharing what’s happening right now. Reflecting its desire to be a news app, the company has started testing notifications of breaking news. When a truck crashed into a Berlin Christmas market, Twitter pushed a news alert of the event to some users via the Twitter Moments tab; it had done the same when Fidel Castro died. The takeaway: While I don’t often check Twitter Moments, I do first see a lot of news in my Twitter feed. Pushing news notifications is a great idea, as long as users have the ability to turn them off (which they do). Read more Live audio comes to Facebook—Live Audio is Facebook’s latest feature for brands, enabling them to broadcast audio-only to audiences that can comment and react. It’s also an opportunity for fans to listen while doing something else, one of audio’s biggest benefits. Android users can keep listening even if they leave the app or lock their phones; iOS listeners have to remain on Facebook.  Facebook will test Live Audio with the BBC World Service and others in the next few weeks. The takeaway: Don’t expect Facebook to become the new king of podcasting with Live Audio because, well, it’s live and podcasts are on-demand. Still, it could be interesting to broadcast the recording of a podcast live over Facebook to see if it attracts more listeners to the recorded show. Read more Google launches podcasts for agencies—Speaking of audio, google will publish a podcast series early in 2017 that will feature agencies sharing their digital marketing expertise. The podcast will be hosted by Alex Langshur, co-founder and senior partner at digital data analytics company Cardinal path. Listeners will be able to submit questions and request topics to cover. The first episode will focus on turning leads and prospects into sales, will be available on January 9. The takeaway: Podcasting’s star continues to rise, leading me to ask yet again why so many companies aren’t jumping on board. Read more Twitter search now based on relevance—Without much fanfare, Twitter has changed the way it displays search results. Until now, results were chronological with the most recent tweets showing first, but now they’re based on relevance. The change mirrors what users see on their timelines; Twitter switched to relevance ranking for timelines nearly a year ago. The takeaway: I’m still not crazy about not seeing the most recent tweets on my timeline, but for search it makes sense. If I search for something, I definitely want to see the most relevant tweets, not just the most recent that happen to contain the word or phrase I’m searching. Read more Error in metrics leads Twitter to overcharge for ads—Facebook must be thrilled to see headlines about ad measurement errors involving a competitor. This time it’s Twitter whose measurement of video ads running on Android was inaccurate, leading to overcharging. Advertisers have been issued refunds. The takeaway: One more reason the industry should consider third-party audits and measurement services like Nielsen does for TV. And one more reason for marketers to approach social media ad metrics with a grain of salt. Read more Reddit gets a mobile competitor—Amino is a mobile community news site that mirrors Reddit but just for mobile. With nearly $20 million in funding, the service is expanding internationally, hiring regional staff, and curating communities unique to different countries. The takeaway: The fact that a community news site is building a base of users so quickly and so broadly on a mobile-only platform is one more sign that we’re fast become a mobile-only society. That doesn’t mean anyone should abandon the web, but it is important to understand your audience’s behaviors when selecting platforms on which to engage them. Read more TSA takes traveler questions via social media—The U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) gets a lot of criticism—much of it well-deserved—but its use of social media has been consistently brilliant. For the holidays, if you have a question about what you can carry on a flight, you can send a picture of the item through social media and get an answer in 20 minutes or less.  The takeaway: If you haven’t followed the TSA’s Instagram account, you’re missing some amazing photos. The TSA is an example of an organization using social media strategically and building a sizable following that not only makes it easier for the agency to do its job, but also to offset the negative perception the agency has built over the years. Read more JWT, Black Lives Matter create map of black-owned businesses—JWT New York and the activist group Black Lives Matter have connected a database of black-owned businesses with Google maps to create a map-based directory of black-owned businesses. The beta launched with 300 businesses, most in major metropolitan areas. The takeaway: Regardless of your opinion of Black Lives Matter, this mashup should spark some creative thinking. Finding all the Best Buy stores or CitiBank locations on a Google map is nothing new, but what else can you do with the Google Maps API and a database? How about mapping all the no-kill animal shelters? (That’s just off the top of my head.) What other locations that don’t all belong to one organization can you map as a public service? Read more Personalize your Facebook updates with color—When my wife and I were dating, she had only ever seen “The Wizard of Oz” on a black-and-white TV. Watching it at my place one Easter (when one of the three TV networks aired it annually), she was stunned when Dorothy stepped out of the house into a full-color Oz. (Yes, we’re that old.) Since then, color has been ubiquitous on TV and everywhere else. So it’s kinda hard to get worked up over Facebook’s new feature is the ability to select a color to appear behind your text status. The feature is rolling out globally for Android users, though everybody will be able to see Android-created colored updates in their news feeds. The takeaway: One good thing: Brands will be able to tint their updates with their brand colors, I guess. The goal is to encourage more people to share personal posts. Read more Trends Brands publish with Instant Articles—Facebook’s Instant Articles was created to make publisher content open quickly on mobile devices, but brands are starting to get in on the action, too. Turner Broadcast System is publishing on Facebook using Instant Articles to promote its sitcom, “People of Earth.” The series has just 44,000 Facebook fans, so consider the use of Instant Articles an experiment, with the network publishing fictional diary entries from the show’s characters. Few brands have taken Facebook up on its offer to use Instant Articles; they “lack the infrastructure and expertise to publish on a regular basis.” Intel, however, distributed its branded content magazine, iQ, via Instant Articles. The takeaway: There are plenty of brands that publish magazine-like content, such as Whole Foods, which could easily repurpose magazine content through Instant Articles. There’s no cost to do so, which will make it interesting to see if there’s any uptake by brands, which also should be converting content to the web-wide Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) version of HTML. Read more Operations, supply chain could lead to Millennials dumping your brand—A YouGov survey found nearly 70% of Millennials have switched a favorite brand in the past year, motivated by product quality, availability issues, working conditions, and sustainability. The factors usually assumed for Millennial disloyalty—a social media presence, user-friendly apps, and great websites—actually have little impact on brand loyalty. It’s the “behind-the-scenes” issues associated with operations, logistics, and supply chain management that make a difference. The takeaway: This surprises me not at all given the ever-growing body of evidence that a company’s behavior in society matters more and more to people (and not just Millennials). Your organization not only has to be a good corporate citizen; you have to engage audiences so they’ll know about it. That’s not only how you keep the customers you have. It’s how you attract those defecting from your competitors. Read more Print newspapers still serve a sizable audience—Nearly 170 million Americans read a newspaper at least once a month, according to a Nielsen Scarborough study, including the print edition. Eighty-one percent of monthly newspaper readers consume a print edition and 51% read print exclusively while 30% read both digital and print. Lest you think it’s just older readers favoring print, the data shows the ages of print readers mirror the general population. For instance, 13% of the population is 70 or older; they represent 15% of the newspaper audience. Millennials, on the other hand, represent 25% of the population and 24% of newspaper readership. The newspaper-reading audience is also affluent and educated. The takeaway: Some media analysts are wondering if the industry was hasty in shrugging off print. Just because everything can be done digitally doesn’t necessarily means it’s the best platform. Read more Do Millennials read email?—It’s hit and miss, according to a recent study, with 18% of American Millennials saying they always open marketing emails (compared to 9% of people 30 and over). But 24% are more likely to never open marketing emails (compared to 19% of those 30 and over). Fifty-five percent of Millennials say they open marketing emails sometimes; 49% of those over 30 said the same. Another study found that even if marketing emails are opened, it doesn’t mean the message got across. The takeaway: I would have liked to see data on opt-in email newsletters vs. plain old marketing emails. I have seen other data that confirms people do read well-constructed newsletters to which they have subscribed. Read more Marriott launches reality series—Joining a number of other companies that have taken to full-scale TV-like program production as a means of brand marketing, Marriott has introduced a half-hour reality series called “Hotel Countdown” that gives viewers an inside look at hotel openings. The series is, of course, available on YouTube. The takeaway: While I question how many people care about “the architectural design, interior decorating, staff hiring and the planning of (a) grand opening event,” the trend of producing programming—rather than just the ads that interrupt it—is gaining steam. From documentaries like this to fiction series (like “Carmella,” a youth-oriented vampire series from a feminine hygiene products company), brands are building fan bases with original programming content. Read more Fake News Search engine tracks fake news—Hoaxy is a search engine from Indiana University’s network Science Institute and its Center for Complex Networks and System Research that tracks fake news. The search engine, currently in beta, indexes stories from more than 130 sites that produce fake news so you can see how the links spread across social media. Hoaxy lists all fake news stories related to any search term, then lets you view how any one of the stories has spread. The takeaway: Hoaxy has two challenges (though I have to admit that I love it). One is capturing all fake news rather than just some. The other is to get the people most inclined to believe fake news to determine its veracity. The latter is the bigger challenge, given the next item. Read more The public is concerned about fake news—The Pew Research Center has found that most Americans believe fake news is having an impact, with 64% saying it creates confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events. This belief is consistent across incomes, education levels, partisan affiliations, and other demographic categories. The public is also confident that it can tell fake news from real news. Nearly a quarter of Americans say they have shared fake news; 14% said they knew it was fake when they shared it while 16% said they realized after sharing that it was fake. The takeaway: Compare this data to the next item. Most Americans are confident that their news sites are reliable—Fifty-eight percent of Americans are confident that the sites they use to find and read news are reliable, even though many say Facebook is their only news site. As a result, it’s safe to assume a lot of people believe everything they read on Facebook. An Ipsos study found that American adults are fooled by fake news 75% of the time. The takeaway: Companies will have to work hard to make sure they get correct information out to stakeholders once they have been targeted by fake news. One key tool is owned media. In other words, if you don’t have your own company blog, now’s the time to build one up. Read more Video and Livestreaming Assassination demonstrates the risk of autoplay—You’re scrolling through Twitter with videos automatically playing as they fill your screen and suddenly you see the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey. That happened to untold numbers of Twitter users, leading some to suggest Twitter turn off autoplay of videos showing people being killed. The same issue materialized for people scrolling through Buzzfeed, where a warning of graphic content didn’t display long enough to keep some people from seeing unwanted violent footage. The takeaway: This issue reflects the challenge facing companies introducing technologies before figuring out what the social issues could be. As one Twitter use put it, “I can’t accept an auto launch video where we can see the facial expression of the victim at the moment of bullet’s impact within two seconds. There is no choice whether to view this or not. It’s a snuff film forced on Twitter users without warning. Hard to believe this is where we are.” Yes. Yes it is. And to make matters worse, it’s where your ad may appear. Read more Consumers watch six hours of video on social networks every week—Research from Brightcove found that 67% of respondents are watching more video on social networks than they did a year ago, and 60% plan to watch even more in 2017. On a daily basis, consumers in the US watch 60 minutes of social network-based video daily, followed by 51 minutes in Australia, 46 minutes in the UK, and 44 minutes in Germany. Music videos top the genres watched, followed by user-generated videos and movie trailers. Half of social video views happen on YouTube, 36% on Facebook and the other 14% spread among several other networks. Forty-five percent say they watch brand videos on social media. The takeaway: What, you’re still not producing videos for social media? How much evidence of its growing influence do you need? Read more Facebook upgrades livestreaming for brands, social media teams—Public figures engage Facebook audiences through the Facebook Mentions app. A series of Mentions updates includes Team Prompts, which let social media managers draft posts a public figure can review before it’s published. Facebook has also added scheduling tools to set reminders to go live. You can also add tags to live posts to make it easier for fans to find them through Facebook Search. Other new features: comment moderation and improved live broadcast quality. The takeaway: Facebook clearly is paying no attention to the livestreaming naysayers, investing heavily in features designed to make it the platform of choice for celebrities, brands, and individuals to broadcast. Read more Twitter to livestream Golden Globes red carpet show—Twitter is also betting the farm on livestreaming, inking deals with the NFL, Wimbledon, news organizations, and others as fast as its senior executives are bolting for the door. (Two left in the last week.) The latest deal will have the Red Carpet event from the Golden Globes broadcast over twitter, featuring exclusive interviews, celebrity content from Twitter itself, and the red carpet event realtime video feed. “Twitter is where the conversation about the Golden Globes happens,” according to Twitter’s COO, expaining why the broadcast makes sense. The takeaway: Turning a two-screen experience into a single-screen experience might be appealing to some, but I suspect many will still want to watch the red carpet event on a big screen and confine their use of a mobile device to engaging with others watching at the same time. What would be better? “Casting” the Twitter broadcast onto a big screen. Of course, those not near a TV or computer monitor will be thrilled to have access to the stream—at least, those who give a damn about the Golden Globes red carpet event, among whom I don’t count myself. Read more Vine’s not completely dead, just mostly dead—Twitter announced the death of Vine in October, but it’s more of a transition. Next month, the Vine app will be renamed Vine Camera, a tool you can still use to create 6.5-second looping videos for sharing to Twitter or saving to your phone. The Vine team insists there will be a way to migrate your followers from Vine to your Twitter account. The takeaway: You have to wonder how many Vine creators will just move on to Snapchat or Instagram, even with the continued ability to create Vines. It has been a while since I have seen a brand partner with a Vine creator, which used to be a big deal. Read more Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality Linden Labs brings Second Life to VR—Sansar is the name Second Life creator Linden labs has given a tool it hopes will be “a WordPress for social VR.” As was the case in Second Life, anybody can make their own world by buying or importing their own assets to the environment, where they will be able to interact via avatar with others. The takeaway: I have already participated in a VR social space that reminded me for all the world of Second Life. Linden Labs’ vision is far more sophisticated. If creating a virtual space really is as easy as creating WordPress site, expect to see a flurry of social spaces emerge. The question is whether people will want to visit them. That’ll require a compelling value proposition, though I suspect most efforts will created based on a “build it and they will come” mentality—and they won’t come. Read more Oculus joins the social VR party—As Linden Labs prepares its Sansar project, Oculus is also jumping into social VR with a system due for release in 2017. Rooms and parties are two oculus offerings that enable social interaction inside a virtual environment. Parties are voice-only calls that accommodate three people at a time within a VR environment. When connected in a Party, participants can join a room to participate in group activities like watching videos and playing games. The takeaway: Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of Facebook’s future entails people gathering together in virtual environments, though the need to be engaged in real time seems limiting to me. I do see utility in virtual gatherings; the ability to engage a focus group, for example, without anyone needing to leave their home or office is intriguing. But if millions didn’t want to gather in virtual environments in Second Life, I don’t see a a significantly bigger demand for it just because the environment is immersive. Read more Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots GE blends a science kit with an Amazon Echo skill—Labracadabra is a series of six $30 science kits, each of which demonstrates a scientific concept like sound waves. You (or your offspring) are guided through each experiment with a skill created for the Amazon Echo, a kind of science teacher in your living room. The takeaway: I’m definitely wowed by this integration of the real world with an Echo skill. More of this is definitely inevitable. One thought I’m giving away free to Blue Apron, the service that delivers fresh ingredients for a meal: Deliver the instructions over the Echo—including the ability for the cook to ask questions—and play music in between instructions. It’s a no-brainer! Read more Have you chatted with a holiday gift bot?—Buzzfeed and Time Inc. are both offering holiday gift finders via chatbots that ask whom you’re shopping for, how much you want to spend, and other criteria. Buzfeed’s Ultimate Gift Finder on Messenger will offer 100 suggestions, while Time’s Real Simple is more focused on last-minute shopping. The takeaway: Both of these bots, despite having some kinks to work out, address genuine consumer needs. As people get more accustomed to using bots, making useful bots available will promote more one-to-one interactions with customers. Read more Marketers like AI a lot more than they use it—Seventy-seven percent of marketers responding to a Demandbase survey believe Artificial Intelligence will be “the next big thing;” only 23% see it as hype. Further, 79% say AI will revolutionize marketing within five years and 78% are confident they know how to use it for marketing purposes. That’s just aspirational, though, since 90% say they’re not using it, 60% are having trouble integrating it with their current tools, and 54% say they’d have a problem training employees to use it. The takeaway: These survey respondents are right about the role AI will play in marketing. You can beat 90% of them to the punch by figuring out how to take advantage of it now. Read more Alexa, how did my marketing campaign do?—Users of Datorama’s cross-channel marketing analytics offering can now ask the Amazon Echo for information about a campaign. Supplementing information available to clients via a web dashboard, the Amazon Echo “skill” could be useful during board meetings when someone asks for information. Rather than scroll through a web screen looking for answers while everyone else waits, the CMO could just ask. The takeaway: It’s this kind of interaction that convinces me that voice and chat tech will be the biggest transformation of the next five years. Read more What do users want from chatbots?—A report based on qualitative research and usability studies found that people using chatbots want the chats to be more focused and relevant and cluttered with less fluff so they deliver more helpful information as quickly as possible. They also want a single search bar that unifies all sources for user questions, one chatbot represent all departments or groups in a company, a face or icon to represent the chatbot, and for the chatbot to figure out what the user is likely to ask next. The takeaway: Too many companies are building chatbots quickly because of the growing trend without considering the user experience. Gathering information like this—as well as figuring out what frustrations your customers have that can be eased by a chatbot—is critical. Read more Microsoft’s Cortana coming to an Echo-like home speaker—That’s the speculation, anyway, since Microsoft released a software developer kit (SDK) for Cortana that will let companies build hardware that use the Artificial Intelligence tool that people will be able to use to set reminders, get weather updates, and even (perhaps) dictate Word documents. One company, Knowmail, is integrating its email automation engine with Cortana so it will be able to flag important messages as urgent and read them to you. Given Microsoft’s AI-driven translation tool (which enables real-time Skype translation), it’s not hard to see Cortana handling real-time translated audio conferencing. The takeaway: More fodder for my argument that voice and bots, not AR glasses, is the next significant step in digital evolution. Read more Mobile and Wearables Citi uses Spectacles for recruiting—Last week I reported on a surgeon’s use of Snap’s Spectacles wearable camera to livestream a surgery. This week comes news that Citi has embraced Spectacles to show candidates what working at Citi is like. The first series of first-person POV videos using the sunglasses is a day in the life of a junior employee. Citi has acquired 14 pairs of Spectacles to spread the POV videos to various locations. Citi hopes to attract younger talent, something Wall Street has had a difficult time doing in recent years. The takeaway: Cisco Systems uses a Snapchat account—We Are Cisco—for similar purposes. These tools are a great way to show instead of tell people about your employer brand. Read more Facebook adds video group chat to Messenger—Up to 50 people can join a group vide chat via Facebook’s Messenger app. If six or fewer people are participating, you can view all the videos at once or use a carousel that highlights the active speaker. The carousel is the default with more than six participants. The takeaway: This is a feature Messenger users have been asking for; it’s also an expansion of Facebook’s focus on livestreaming and a natural evolution of chat app-based video. Brands looking to tap into Messenger now have another option, since engaging groups of people in a video chat can lead to all kinds of brand-to-customer interactions. Just one thought: You know all those user groups that used to get together in the early days of computing? I can easily see user groups re-emerging (well beyond computing) as long as all you have to do is join a video call. Read more Consumers willing to engage with brands on messaging apps—Most companies haven’t yet figured out how to make the transition from web pages and social networks to messaging apps despite clear evidence that consumers are way ahead of them. One study finds 53% of people in the UK and France who use messaging apps (like Messenger and WhatsApp, both Facebook properties) have interacted with a company on a messaging app or are open to doing so as long as they can block companies with which they don’t want to interact. The takeaway: You have to make the transition, but you have to do so carefully, ensuring your interactions are personalized and responsive. There are also opportunities to innovate. For instance, 15% of respondents liked the idea of group interactions with brands. Creating a group to discuss specific issues or products could appeal to some consumers. Read more Snapchat avoids influencer marketing—Instagram is littered with celebrities boasting high follower counts who take money to share pics and videos they’ve been paid to share in order to shill products. You won’t find much of that on Snapchat, though, which won’t let celebrities (or anyone else) see how many followers they have, opting to treat celebrities like every other user. Its terms of service prohibit anyone from sharing snaps they’ve been paid for, so paid influencer marketing is absent from the platform. The takeaway: The authentic experience on Snapchat is how its parent company, Snap, can charge as much as $700,000 for some kinds of ads. Whether the inability of celebrities and influencers to build large followings will ultimately help or hurt Snapchat is a gamble on the company’s part, though. Read more Marketers can take advantage of Instagram “Saved Posts”—Users can now bookmark Instagram images and videos. It only took a few hours following the introduction of “Saved Posts” for Audi to turn the feature into a game. The company shared nine random pieces of a picture of one of its cars and invited users to bookmark them in the correct order to display the full photo. More than 3,200 people had solved the puzzle by the time Digiday published a story about it. Beyond these clever kinds of hacks, the bookmarking feature has implications when combined with other Instagram features, like links in Instagram stories and shoppable photo tags, both of which customers can save to interact with later. The takeaway: It’s not mentioned anywhere in the article, but bookmarks make Instagram more competitive with Pinterest. My daughter planned her wedding on Pinterest and, as the article notes, it’s now easy to do the same on Instagram.

Linux Workstation/Server Distribution Benchmarks For Winter 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 21 December 2016. Page 1 of 5. 12 Comments The latest for your enjoyment of our year-end comparison articles and benchmarks is a fresh comparison of various workstation/enterprise/server oriented Linux distributions when looking at relevant workloads. Testing for this distribution comparison being done from a Core i7 6800K Broadwell-E system while a desktop-focused Linux desktop comparison for winter 2016 will be posted still before year's end. For this workstation/server-oriented distribution benchmarking, tested for this comparison was Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10, CentOS 7 1611, openSUSE Leap 42.2, Debian GNU/Linux 6.8, and Intel Clear Linux 12210. The distributions used were basically those popular in enterprise environments while the EOY2016 Linux desktop distribution comparison will feature more of the common enthusiast/gamer distributions. All of the tests for this article were done with an Intel Core i7 6800K + MSI X99A WORKSTATION + 16GB DDR4 + Samsung 850 EVO 128GB SATA 3.0 SSD + NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X setup. Each system was cleanly installed with the given distribution for testing and best efforts to test each Linux distribution in an "out of the box" configuration for being able to reproduce our results and for being most comparable. If you're new around here, the same hardware was used for testing, the illustrated differences on the system table just come down to how the software/drivers reported different components, such as the CPU scaling driver reporting e.g. boost vs. stock processor frequencies. All of these server/workstation/enterprise oriented tests were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

USB Type-C: What Is It and How Is It Better Than Its Predecessors? USB Type-C will soon be a standard, and there are a few good reasons behind it. By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Thursday, December 22, 2016, 10:05 [IST] While you may have never noticed it, USB and connectivity go hand-in-hand. From desktops to smartphones, as far as connectivity is concerned, USB is the standard. For instance, pick any device lying around your house, and it’s most likely that you’ll at least find one device with USB.  Though it’s been a while since USB received a major update (USB 3.1 in 2013), the technology itself has come a long way since its inception in January 1996. From a massive, single oriented plug to a micro (or even mini), reversible equipment, it sure did improve a lot over time.  Also Read: Does the Position of Fingerprint Scanner on Smartphones Matter? Alongside the USB 3.1, the USB Type-C connector was introduced in the year 2013. We will get back to what a USB Type-C connector is in a moment. But, we are pretty sure you have been hearing the term USB Type-C from smartphone manufacturers (even from the biggies in the industry) very frequently, right? Well, what’s all the fuss about it and how is it better than its predecessors? We are here just to explain that. What is USB Type-C? Developed by USB Implementers Forum, the USB Type-C is just like any other connector (for example Micro-USB) used to transmit power as well as data. It is quite similar to the USB 1.1, USB 2.0, USB 3.0 or the latest USB 3.1, except for the fact that at 10Gbps, it’s twice as fast as USB 3.0 and can be plugged in any orientation — something which had been a major problem with the previous connectors.  The USB Implementers Forum has more than 700 partner companies including Apple, Microsoft, Dell, HP, Intel, and Samsung. Meaning, it’s going to be ubiquitous soon, if not it already is, no matter what device you use — computers, laptops, smartphones, hard drives, flash drives, and much more. Also Read: IFTTT Explained For The Laymen What are the advantages? USB Type-C will soon be a standard on most electronic devices and should eventually replace all the previous standards. The reason behind this is not only the fact that it is the latest standard out there but also because it brings along several advantages that make managing devices much easier. Let’s take a look at a few benefits of USB Type-C here.  Higher transfer speeds: The USB Type-C by default supports USB 3.1 for data transfer, which means its cables offer transfer speeds of 10Gbps, which is double the transfer speed of its predecessor.   Faster charging: The USB Type-C cables offer 20 volts and 5 amps of power in comparison to the 5 volts and 1.8amps of its predecessor. This means it will charge your devices significantly faster, which is welcome by all of us. Can be a headphone jack alternative: Let's get this straight out of the way. Headphone jacks are bulky and restrict smartphone vendors from building slimmer smartphones. Whether people need slimmer devices or not is an argument for another day, but that's not the only reason behind USB Type-C killing the headphone jack.  Also Read: Honor Magic Gleans Its Sorcery From Artificial Intelligence: Here’s What You Should Know The 3.5mm headphone jack dates back to 1960s, and since then, it’s been used only for one thing — transmit sound. On the other hand, unlike the headphone jack, USB Type-C can multi-task.   Reversible: Okay, this is one of the most common and irritating issues with the previous USB standards. You never plug it right the first time as there will always be the second attempt. However, getting rid of this issue, USB Type-C allows you to plug it in any orientation. Can be used to charge Laptops: Like mentioned above, the USB Type-C has higher power available at disposal. As a result, it can be used to charge laptops as well which usually require higher power.

Ultra-Thin $299 Windows 10 Laptop with 8mm Bezel Announced by China’s Chuwi GO The device goes on sale today for only $299 Dec 22, 2016 07:45 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Chuwi is one of the Chinese companies that are trying to offer the best possible value for the money, and we’ve already found out on our own that these efforts are paying off at some level. And now Chuwi is going one step further with a new laptop that’s supposed to offer premium quality at a price that’s more appropriate for mid-range devices. The new Chuwi LapBook 14.1 notebook goes on sale today with a price of $299 and the company promises it offers uncompromised experience on Windows 10. Looking at the specs, however, it’s pretty clear that this is no workhorse, but the kind of laptop that you can use for daily activities, such as browsing the web, emailing, and maybe watching a movie. 8mm screen bezel The device comes with a 14.1-inch full HD IPS display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and is powered by a 7th generation Intel Apollo Lake N3450 CPU. It also features Intel Gen9 integrated HD graphics, so while it won’t let you play the latest games, it should be good enough for titles that have moderate system requirements. In addition to this, Chuwi is also offering 4GB DDR3 RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage, so additional storage might almost certainly be needed. On the other hand, the device features two USB ports, so you shouldn’t have any problems in attaching an external hard drive. The laptop has an 8mm screen bezel and tips the scales at 1316 grams, which makes it one of the lightest notebooks in the 14.1-inch category currently on the market. It features a 9,000 mAh li-polymer battery, but its performance figures are still unknown. It goes without saying that it runs the full version of Windows 10. At first glance, the Chuwi LapBook 14.1 notebook is quite a compelling choice for those who want an affordable device with better specs, but it takes more than a spec sheet to convince a potential buyer. We’ll soon review the device and let you know if it’s worth the money or not.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #Chuwi#laptop#ultrabook#Windows 10 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Chuwi LapBook laptop (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Laughs at Apple, Says Its New MacBook Is “Disappointing" Microsoft’s Latest Video Highlights What Apple’s MacBook Can’t Do Microsoft “Absolutely” Had to Be in Hardware, Former CEO Steve Ballmer Says Microsoft to Start Trial Production of Surface Phone with Pegatron - Report New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" 6 photos    Chuwi LapBook laptop New Apps Babylon: Get one-click translation in any desktop application and term search results within an extensive collection of dictionaries and glossaries Chameleon Startup Manager Lite: Software utility which enables you to edit and manage the processes running on your computer, with support for multiple languages Chameleon Startup Manager Pro: A startup management tool that enables you to quickly remove unneeded startup items and monitors the system for new apps set to launch with Windows Portable CDBurnerXP: CD/DVD and Blu-ray burning software solution that can be launched directly from a removable drive, without requiring prior installation Collectorz.com Movie Collector: A fully-featured application that helps users create a movie database, group movies into folders, perform searches, and catalogue DVDs by their barcode ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application GPU-Z Portable: A reliable and useful software solution that comes in handy to all those who want to keep an eye on the data regarding their video and graphics cards Reader comments Leaked Windows 10 Build 14997 Blocks Flash by Default in Edge Browser more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The small refresh was said to be the addition of 4G LTE connectivity with a launch date of 23 December, which is tomorrow. However a new report is now suggesting that the upcoming laptop will not just be a tiny refresh, but will be a new addition to the existing lineup. If the latest leak is true, then Xiaomi might launch the Mi Notebook Pro. The ‘Pro’ moniker means that it will be the most high-end offering from the company. Currently, the Mi Notebook Air offers an Intel i5 6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, an Nvidia 940MX graphics card and 256GB of storage with a 13.3 inch Full HD screen. The high-end specifications of the Pro could include a 4K display, Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M graphics card, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Now that’s a notebook we’d want! Of course, it will come at a higher cost as well, with rumours suggesting a CNY 6,000, (around Rs 60,000) which is a lot more than the introductory pricing of the Mi Notebook Air, which starts at $520 (around Rs 35,000). It is still cheaper than most notebooks out there with a similar configuration, though. Be sure to tune back in tomorrow for more information on the device.

Edsall DEC. 22, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Keith Ellison speaking at a rallying of striking federal contract workers in December. Credit Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Leaders on the Democratic left who want to represent the have-nots face an obstacle: their own voters. Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, argues that Democrats “have to stand for a strong, populist economic message.” He warns that “the way the working class is always controlled is that it’s divided.” A key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship, Senator Bernie Sanders, believes that Democrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class, but has ignored to a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and low-income people in this country. For a certain stripe of liberal Democrat, free trade agreements have become emblematic of what Sanders describes as a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker rights; dismantling labor, environmental, health, food safety and financial laws; and allowing corporations to challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court system. The problem facing Ellison, Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanders’s presidential campaign, the Democratic electorate has actually become less receptive to populism over the past two decades. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mark Muro, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinton and those that backed Donald Trump. The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu, a Brookings research assistant, suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return to progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expect. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In their Nov. 29 essay, “Another Clinton-Trump divide: High-output America vs low-output America,” Muro and Liu determined that: The less-than-500 counties that Hillary Clinton carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015. In other words, the Clinton counties are the ones in which the economy is booming; they are hardly fertile territory for a worker insurrection. Muro enlarged on his findings in an email: America’s most important, competitive, and often export-intensive industries — what we call its “advanced” industries — cluster tightly in such metro counties. Some 70 percent of these crown-jewel industries are concentrated in the 100-largest metros — the core of what Hillary won. In a separate February 2015 study, “America’s Advanced Industries,” Muro and four colleagues report that the 50 industries in this heavily high-tech sector are crucial to America’s future growth: These industries encompass the nation’s “tech” sector at its broadest and most consequential. Their dynamism is going to be a central component of any future revitalized U.S. economy. As such, these industries encompass the country’s best shot at supporting innovative, inclusive, and sustainable growth. The importance of these industries does not stop there: At the same time, the sector employs 80 percent of the nation’s engineers; performs 90 percent of private-sector R & D; generates approximately 85 percent of all U.S. patents; and accounts for 60 percent of U.S. exports. Advanced industries also support unusually extensive supply chains and other forms of ancillary economic activity. On a per worker basis, advanced industries purchase $236,000 in goods and services from other businesses annually, compared with $67,000 in purchasing by other industries. When Ellison announced his opposition to the trans-Pacific Partnership on Feb. 15, 2015, he was not speaking to communities that benefit from technology-intensive industries. Ellison declared: The upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing: Americans who work hard for a living. It’s about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people — those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how they’re going to make ends meet. Ellison’s argument rings especially true in those counties Clinton lost, but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly, free trade has been enormously beneficial. Take two examples. In Santa Clara County, California, voters chose Clinton over Trump 73-21. Advanced industry companies with headquarters or major facilities there include Adobe, Apple, Cisco, HP Inc. and Intel Corp. On the East Coast, in Cambridge, Mass., where Clinton won 87.8 percent of the vote to Trump’s 6.4 percent, major corporate employers include Google, Microsoft, and Biogen. According to the Muro study, “advanced industries produce $2.7 trillion in value added annually — 17 percent of all U.S. gross domestic product. That is more than any other sector, including health care, finance, or real estate,” and, directly and indirectly, “the sector supports almost 39 million jobs — nearly one-fourth of all U.S. employment.” In other words, as Muro made clear in his email: The basic fact is that a huge portion of the nation’s globally competitive economic activity occurs in those blue places. Dominated by highly productive, export-oriented advanced industries, high-tech enterprises, and professional services including the management of companies, this Democratic base is already biased toward globalism — with trade something of a core tenet. Moreover, these places are winning at trade. Muro has produced a map that shows that trade dislocation (measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications) is far less concentrated in Clintonite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural counties. Not only is expanded trade in the economic interest of economically powerful metropolitan areas that vote Democratic, but Democratic voters themselves are becoming increasingly pro-trade. Here’s the trend data from 2009 to late October 2016, collected by Pew. Trading Places Percent who liked or disliked trade agreements involving the United States. Are or lean Republican Are or lean Democratic Said trade agreements are a good thing for the U.S. 68 60% 57% Good 56 48 50 40 37 30 Bad 31% 31 Bad 20 24 10 ’09 ’11 ’14 ’16 ’09 ’11 ’14 ’16 70% 68 Are or lean Republican Are or lean Democratic Said trade agreements are a good thing for the U.S. 60 57% Good 56 50 48 40 Bad Bad 37 30 31% 31 20 24 10 Apr. ’09 Mar. ’11 Mar. ’14 May ’15 Oct. ’16 Apr. ’09 Mar. ’11 Mar. ’14 May ’15 Oct. ’16 Source: Pew Research Center DEC. 22, 2016 By The New York Times From 2009 to October 2016, Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm pro-trade stance, 48-37, 11 points in favor, to a decisively pro-trade position, 56-31. The Democratic electorate is moving in a pro-trade direction, in opposition to Ellison and Sanders. Conversely, the Republican electorate, egged on by Donald Trump, has flipped. As recently as March 2014, before anyone gave a thought to a Trump presidential bid, Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp, 55-36. By October 2016, Republican voters had become decisively anti-trade, 68-24. Even though Hillary Clinton pointedly withdrew her support for the trans-Pacific Partnership in October 2015, 55 percent of her voters, according to Pew, described the TPP as a “good thing” compared to 24 percent who said it was a “bad thing.” In contrast, Pew reported that 58 percent of Trump loyalists said the TPP was a bad thing, and 17 percent looked on it favorably. Advertisement Continue reading the main story If anything, Trump’s adamant opposition to free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies, are likely to push Democratic voters who oppose Trump to shift even further in favor of trade. This push-me, pull-you phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas — in attitudes toward the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and toward Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks. Before the 2016 campaign began, Republican voters were far more critical of both Putin and WikiLeaks than Democrats, in part because of the stronger tradition on the right of anti-communism and hostility to government leaks.

'14 July ’16 Dec. ’16 Jan. '14 Dec. '14 July ’16 Dec. ’16 Source: YouGov DEC. 22, 2016 By The New York Times Among Republicans, over the course of Trump’s candidacy, assessments of Putin steadily improved. In December 2014, two years ago, 80 percent of Republican voters viewed Putin unfavorably and 8 percent were favorable. By December 2016, Putin’s unfavorable ratings among Republicans had fallen to 47 percent and his favorable ratings had risen to 37 percent. This is the period during which Putin was accused of allowing Russian hacking of Democratic Party emails, the public release of which proved damaging to the Clinton campaign. Among Democrats during this same period, Putin’s negative ratings worsened, from minus 52 to minus 62. An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks, the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emails. In June 2013, well before the campaign, when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents, Republicans were adamantly critical by negative 47 points. By August 2016, when the damage by WikiLeaks to the Clinton became apparent, Republicans had turned favorable, by 9 points; by December, Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks, by 27 points. This is a 74-point shift in just under three and a half years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Democrats once more moved in the opposite direction, with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013 to negative 28 points this month. Looking again at free trade, the problem for Democrats struggling to find common ground on the issue is that, as Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, observed in an email, the pull is stronger than the push; people react more strongly to losses from free trade than to prospective gains. In effect, even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade, the minority has, in many cases, suffered from the uneven distributional impact — shuttered local factories and jobs shipped overseas. Those harmed by a policy are much more likely to vote on the issue than those helped. Although Trump’s protectionist proposals to deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous to economic growth over time, he has offered the business community carrots (tax breaks and contracts) and sticks (tariffs and tax penalties) that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump to win over millions of voters. Democrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues, but also growing difficulties in the party’s traditional responses to employment dislocation. Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffective. An August 2016 study by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, “Recent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium,” shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and, even more so, from a graduate degree, have leveled off. The swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call “skill downsizing.” Those with graduate degrees are forced to take jobs that a college graduate could do, college graduates are forced to take jobs that someone with less education could do, and so on down the line, leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrained. What would a progressive approach to globalization look like? A call for a radical reform of the trade negotiation process to curb the leverage of corporate and special interests is one Democratic alternative. Advertisement Continue reading the main story This leverage has been institutionalized through the creation of Industry Trade Advisory Committees that grant special access to trade negotiations to corporations ranging from pharmaceuticals to aerospace, energy to investment banks, steel to textiles. Two critics of current trade policy, Jared Bernstein, a former economics adviser to Vice President Biden, and Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, wrote a September 2016 essay for the American Prospect, “The New Rules of the Road: A Progressive Approach to Globalization” in which they acknowledge some basic facts: Despite Trump’s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue. Global trade volumes — imports plus exports — have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today. In the United States, that same metric has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent. Bernstein and Wallach go on to point out that trade agreements are not mainly about cutting tariffs to expand trade nor are they about jobs, growth, and incomes here in the United States. Rather, they’re about setting expansive “rules of the road” that determine who wins and who loses. The problem is not with trade itself, which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable, but lies instead in the design of the negotiation process: With 500 official U.S. trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access to the policy process while the public, press, and largely Congress have been shut out, it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the ‘winners’ under these rules. Bernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt to deal with one aspect of the Democratic Party’s key dilemma: the struggle to prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies — including the conflict between the Sanders-Warren-Ellison wing and the free-trade wing. Conciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries, indifferent to domestic regulation and legislation. The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority status. The nation’s displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and African-Americans who are loyal to the Democratic Party. Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade, automation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential to encourage defecting whites to return to Democratic ranks — and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nation’s growing population of minority voters. In this regard, the political desires of the two groups are not irreconcilable.

(AMD) Stock Is STILL a Red-Hot Buy AMD stock is worth buying on any decent dip Dec 21, 2016, 10:28 am EST  |  By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer     View All   Calling 2016 a “good year” for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders would be a considerable understatement. AMD stock is up 305% year-to-date, decisively ending a three-year dry spell. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Too much, too fast? Many would say so, pointing out that sales have been deteriorating since 2011 and the company has booked net losses in each of its past four years. Although the top line perked up a bit in the third quarter, the computer component maker is still regularly in the red. AMD is going to have to pull off some sort of mini-miracle if it’s going to justify the stock’s current price anytime soon. Thing is, it may well have a miracle or two up its sleeve for 2017. Advanced Micro Devices to Rise With Ryzen? It’s a rarity for a technology company’s fortune to be altered by the introduction of a new product. But, this is one of those times. The 10 Best S&P 500 Stocks of 2016 When Advanced Micro Devices unveiled its new “Zen” microprocessor technology in August, the market was hopeful, but cautious. AMD hasn’t been especially competitive in any market for a while, ceding to rivals like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), and though the specs for Zen looked good, doubts lingered that it would be able to do what it was supposed to do when the architecture was put to its pre-launch test. Those worries, though, may not have been necessary. Zen is shaping up to be everything it was touted to be in front of its commercial debut in the first quarter of 2017. It may be the biggest and most successful launch Advanced Micro Devices has seen in a long, long while. Indeed, it wouldn’t be hyperbole to say Zen may end up saving the company. The processor truly is an engineering marvel. Renamed Ryzen in the meantime, the first entry in the Summit Ridge line of desktop processors are a true 8-core, 16-thread CPU that operates at a minimum of 3.4 GHz. That’s a bit stronger than the most comparable processor from Intel: the Core i7-6900K, which operates at a base frequency of 3.2 GHz. The i7 can be boosted up to 4.0 GHz, and it’s not clear exactly how far the Ryzen can be pushed. It’s likely to be in that 4.0 gigahertz ballpark though, and it’s going to require less power to get there. Ryzen has another dimension owners of AMD stock can get excited about — it’s got its own artificial intelligence technology built in that allows it to operate better. The Neural Net Prediction algorithm remembers which pathway a particular app runs best on, while Smart Prefetch tracks software behavior so it can best prepare the computer to run the program. It will likely be price competitive too. Although no official word had been given, initial estimates peg the processor’s price at between $500 and $600, versus the i7-6900K’s (current) sticker price of just over $1,000. And analysts have taken notice. Jefferies & Co. analyst Mark Lipacis recently upped the firm’s target on AMD stock to $13, up 22% from its current value of $10.66, explaining: “We’ve argued that AMD’s IP is undervalued and that it is in the midst of a turnaround, and AMD’s demos this week of its new Zen MPU in high-end performance applications reinforce the latter part of this thesis. Our checks continue to indicate AMD’s Zen MPU is being well received in the enthusiast DT channel, and the Asia Cloud Server market.” Next Page   1 2 View All View All   Article printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/12/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-stock-still-red-hot-buy/. ©2017 InvestorPlace Media, LLC More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 More on InvestorPlace 10 Experts' Top Picks for 2017 3 Trump Stock Winners That Will Lose BIG in 2017 4 Job Stocks Rallying on Trump's Promises 3 of the Worst ETFs for Long-Term Investors 3 Top Tech Stocks You’ve Never Heard Of 7 Stocks That Won’t Be Around in 2018 Comments are currently unavailable.

How Rogue One's Imperial stormtroopers SAVED Star Wars and restored order More like this Google Android Nest Software 'Twas Brillo but then Android Things, which watched as Google Weaved its Nest The Internet of Google Things 22 Dec 2016 at 13:03, Wireless Watch Comment Google has launched the developer preview of Android Things, updating and rebranding the Brillo IoT operating system which was unveiled over a year ago. Designed for medium-complexity devices, like home hubs, thermostats, and security cameras, the stripped-down version of Android has had zero success in the market. The new push, under a new name, aims to change that, and push the OS as the answer for developers of consumer-oriented IoT devices. A key component will be the ability to push images and over-the-air updates to Android Things devices, a key security requirement for the IoT, and one that appears to be a core feature of the updated OS. With Google able to push all mandatory updates to IoT devices, this would be a promising step forward for consumer IoT equipment – which has been plagued by headlines recently. It’s also in stark contrast to Android updates for smartphones, which suffer from a complete mess of different vendor and carrier barriers to the transmission of security fixes. Along with its Weave framework, Google is again using Android to position itself at the heart of the devices, by providing the cloud infrastructure and applications that add value to the devices and so generate traffic which can be monetized. The developer preview of Android Things supports Intel’s Edison, NXP’s Pico and the Raspberry Pi 3 on the hardware side. Qualcomm has announced that it expects the OS to be deployed on its Snapdragon platform in 2017, and while it was quick to issue a statement of support, it appears that Android Things isn’t running on Snapdragon SoCs currently – though of course, Qualcomm will soon own NXP and its Pico line. Android Things will allow developers to tie their devices into Google’s services, using the normal Android Studio SDK – an apparent improvement on Brillo, which had a different development environment. The challenges of a unified IoT platform Brillo was launched as a lightweight Android-based operating system for devices, aimed at speeding up development time given the industry’s collective experience with Android. However, it appears that there has been almost no traction in the market for the OS, and its developer mailing lists are very quiet – not a good sign for a project that was positioned as the future for smart home devices. But not even Google seemed inclined to use the OS. Its smart thermostat subsidiary Nest didn’t use it in its own devices, and Google’s new Home and WiFi products passed on the OS too – opting for Chromecast System Software, which is based on both Android and Chrome OS. It remains to be seen how far Google unifies its software platforms for its various hub and medium-scale IoT devices, though the common Android roots should help create a somewhat more harmonized developer base in future. And there was some indication that the search giant wants to get its IoT house in order, and preempt some of the Android fragmentation problems which have plagued the smartphone version. Also announced was the overhaul of Nest – the underwhelming subsidiary that decided to publish its own version of Weave (Nest Weave) in order to link its thermostats and cameras to other ecosystems. Nest’s software development team is now being merged into Google, a step towards commonality, but also a sign of how far the iconic smart home business has fallen. Meanwhile Weave, launched at the same time as Brillo, is a communications framework that dictates how compatible connected devices speak to each other via Google’s cloud (mostly), and also to the outside world. It takes a different approach to the other prominent connectivity and discovery frameworks, the OCF’s IoTivity and AllSeen Alliance’s AllJoyn, now merged. That combined platform is more focused on the device discovery and communication aspects of IoT devices, so that a node is able to discover other nodes on a local network. Weave is aimed more at the upper layers of the stack, in the applications themselves, and therefore the cloud-focused interactions. However, in the IoT, the cloud is getting closer and closer to the network edge, so one day these cloud interactions might end up taking place in the local networks (especially if local networks expand in physical footprint). Weave is also getting a public device SDK, and its current schema support for a small group of devices (outlets, light bulbs and switches, thermostats) is being expanded to add new devices “soon” - and will include an iOS mobile API (application programming interface). Currently, Google says Philips Hue and Samsung’s SmartThings are using Weave to connect to its Google Assistant service, with Belkin’s WeMo, LiFX, Honeywell, Wink, TP-Link, First Alert, and more” also pursuing Weave adoption. Notably, there was no mention of Fuchsia, a super-lightweight OS for micro-IoT devices that is not based on the Linux kernel which powers Android. Unveiled in August, there hasn’t been much news of development progress since, but Fuchsia is pretty expandable – meaning that it could potentially be the foundation of a non-Linux version of Android, for more complex devices, in future. That would fit in with the nascent trend to move away from Linux as the default basis of IoT operating systems, and learn more lessons from the really stripped-back real time OSs. However, if Fuchsia did move to the same type of devices on which Android and Chrome OS reside, there would be further confusion and potential fragmentation in the Google ecosystem. For now, though, the Android Things brand and supporting updates suggest a real effort to present a functional and unified platform during 2017.

Image: Clare Keogh Cork’s tech scene punches above its weight, but has always lacked a focal point. Teamwork co-founder Daniel Mackey says the company’s new incubator space will help fix this anomaly. The Teamwork story is one that should inspire future generations of school and college-leavers, especially in Cork, a city whose history over the last 30 to 40 years has been synonymous with that of the global tech industry. Unlike Dublin, which has its Digital Hub and Silicon Docks districts, the city has lacked a real focal point. Instead, Cork’s silicon chutzpah is seen in its people and in particular, in the global exploits of Cork entrepreneurs like Pat Phelan of Trustev and Liam Casey of PCH; or high-flying executives like Intel’s Ann Kelleher and Margaret Burgraff, and Apple’s Cathy Kearney, to name a few. And don’t forget CoderDojo was founded five years ago by James Whelton and Bill Liao at the National Software Centre in Cork. ‘We always wanted to be a product company; we never wanted to do consultancy. We just wanted to make stuff’ – DANIEL MACKEY But a new narrative in Cork’s digital story has been brewing for nine years now. Teamwork – notorious for buying the Teamwork.com domain for €500,000 two years ago – is one of Ireland’s fastest-growing tech companies and a global brand in productivity software. There are over 268,000 companies using Teamwork products across the globe, with almost 2.8m users. Customers include PayPal, eBay, Disney, Forbes and Spotify. The Teamwork story Teamwork founders Peter Coppinger and Daniel Mackey. Image: Clare Keogh Founded in 2007 by Peter Coppinger and Daniel Mackey, the company is entirely self-funded and hasn’t taken on a cent of venture capital. Since its founding, it has increased turnover year-on-year and in 2015, Teamwork is understood to have recorded €8.8m in revenues and projects worth €12.4m for this year. It is eyeing a €20m revenue target by 2020. The company invested €2m of its own funds in a new state-of-the-art building – with the unique position of giving every programmer their own office – and plans to turn its old offices into an incubator space for Cork software start-ups. ‘It has never been easier to start a software company. All you need is AWS, a laptop and a clear vision of what you want to build’ – DANIEL MACKEY The move, Mackey hopes, will provide a place where start-ups can get space to work, but also where a community will develop and entrepreneurs and techies can coalesce and help to sort out technical and business problems. “Through the years in Cork, we couldn’t just go out and meet people in our industry and just talk shop, no one we could bounce ideas off – there just wasn’t that kind of a community,” said Mackey. “Hopefully, with this new incubator we are launching, it will be the kind of place where software start-ups can meet, have coffee and talk through tech problems like caching or whatever. We also got a bit disillusioned with the meetup scene in Cork, where the same people attracted by the idea of start-up culture [rather] than the reality would turn up every time. We want to build a place where people can hang out, foster ideas and build something.” For Mackey and Coppinger, it was always about building stuff. They met in college in 1998 at Cork Institute of Technology. “He was one of the only other people in our class who was genuinely interested in coding. Everyone else joined the tech courses because they were told it was a good idea to. We had been running separate web development businesses to make money during college and kept finding we were competing. It was the kind of work where you would get three hundred quid for doing a website for a bar or restaurant. It was only one day when we spoke in the lab for the first time that we realised we had a lot in common and hit it off. “We both had a passion for game programming but quickly realised it would have been impossible. “We always wanted to be a product company; we never wanted to do consultancy. We just wanted to make stuff.” To make ends meet after college, Mackey and Coppinger set up their own consultancy business. “We found that we became busy fools. A lot of consultancy businesses fall into that trap, running around pleasing everybody.” It was when trying to implement a productivity platform to keep themselves organised that the idea for Teamwork was born. As the story goes, they reached out to the software vendor with suggestions to improve the platform but were dismissed with a lofty attitude. “We said ‘Screw those guys, we are going to do this ourselves’. And we did,” Coppinger recalled in a recent interview. Now the company has grown to 73 people and recently announced plans to create 50 new jobs. The only investment in Teamwork has been time In a first for a tech company in Ireland, developers at Teamwork are to get their own offices so they can work without interruption. Image: Clare Keogh “When we started, we had no idea how things would go. The first month, we made €186 and the following month, we doubled it. This became €30,000 a month, then €40,000 and we just kept growing to the point where we are bringing in revenues in the region of €1m a month. “When we started, we were young and naïve and we had no idea what went into building a product. There were no cloud services like AWS around at the time, we didn’t think of all the language support that would be required and dealing with all the time zones. “But that is more than made up for, by the fact that we don’t have people telling us what to do; we can build the best product we want to build. The only investment we made in Teamwork was our time.” Mackey and Coppinger share the view that anyone with the skills can establish a software company and the barriers to entry are much lower, thanks to cloud services. “It has never been easier to start a software company. All you need is AWS, a laptop and a clear vision of what you want to build. That’s why we are using our old offices as an incubator because we want to give people like us a place where they can work away from home and use their money to pay for hosting or get a new laptop, and we’ll look after the light, heat and the rest. “Hopefully, this new incubator will help drive a new chapter in Cork’s tech story.” Returning to the €2m building where developers will get their own office, Mackey believes it is time to call a halt on cubicle or open-plan culture for coders and programmers. “Being developers ourselves, we understand the importance of concentration and being in the zone and being able to concentrate for 10 hours without interruption. It’s amazing what you can accomplish in that time. Other roles in the company like HR and testing are more collaborative and that suits open plan, but we always believed developers need their own private space to get in the zone.” Mackey credits software authority Joel Spolsky of the Joel on Software blog as sparking the idea. “We make software, we are not plumbers. What programmers do is a lonely, personal thing and they need to concentrate.” A pet peeve of Mackey’s is Teamwork being labelled as a start-up. “We are nine years in business, yet we still get labelled as a start-up. Fair enough, the tech industry is a glamorous business right now, but I’ll never understand why people go to tech conferences to hear someone who has been in business for a year or two discount sage advice. I mean, a plumber in business 15 years will never be asked to speak about their business in a fireside chat, would they? “We are nine years in business and we still don’t have all the answers.” Mackey said that the Cork entrepreneurial scene has so much potential yet no one hears about it. “There are lots of young companies you never hear about but they are plugging away and building steadily. “We are lucky in [that] what we created only required the skills to do it, and we never had to take on investment because we had the consultancy to bootstrap us. It began as just one day a week and the weekends while we looked after clients the rest of the time and eventually Teamwork became more and more the full-time job. “If an investor offered us €10m in the morning, we wouldn’t know what to do with it.” As previously mentioned, Teamwork, or TeamworkPM as it was originally known, famously spent €500,000 on the Teamwork.com domain. “That was every single penny that we had in the bank at the time but we knew it was the right thing to do. People thought we were lunatics but our attitude was that if it didn’t work out, we’d just try again because we have loads of ideas and will just build something else.” Next on the horizon for Teamwork will be a new set of complementary products to the company’s existing line-up of chat, support desk and workflow platforms. “Our guiding principle is that there are products we could use, but we know we would do a better job of building them ourselves, so let’s do that. “Our golden rule is this: only work on things that make you excited.” Related: entrepreneurs, funding and investment, coding, software, The Interview, Cork Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Start-ups 500 Startups’ Elizabeth Yin: ‘Selling is the key to success at SaaS’ 16 Sep 2016303 Shares Hiring Now Help develop the future of sales and trading Be part of a globally successful team One of Europe’s best IT workplaces Informing, entertaining and connecting the world Start-ups Is it time to fix Ireland’s venture funding imbalance? 12 Sep 201688 Shares Start-ups Phorest’s Ronan Perceval: ‘Start-ups should be under less pressure to sell’ 16 Nov 2016414 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

There's a growing number of MacBook Pro power users out there looking at the 2016 Touch Bar models and not liking what they see. The next question that comes to mind is, "what's a good alternative?" Dell's XPS laptop range features high on that list, and a leak suggests Dell is set to cater to those power users looking for a MacBook Pro alternative. Dell's existing range of XPS 15 laptops include a 4K display option, 6th generation Intel Skylake processors, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M GPU with 2GB of dedicated memory if desired. They are very capable machines. However, as Windows Central reports, the Dell website accidentally listed a new model referred to as the XPS 15 9650. The 9650 listing, for the brief time it was allowed to stay up, included options for three different 7th generation quad core Intel Kaby Lake processors carrying the model numbers Core i3-7100HQ, Core i5-7300HQ, and Core i7-7700HQ respectively. Related Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016 Rose Gold Edition) Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016 Rose Gold Edition) They will certainly offer a performance boost, but the news gets even better for power users. Dell is also replacing the GTX 960M 2GB GPU with a new GTX 1050 GPU complete with 4GB of dedicated memory. Combined with up to 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, you've got a mobile powerhouse to make any MacBook Pro owner jealous. The final additional new feature is the option of a fingerprint reader (and Windows Hello support) for added security. And if you're spending the cash to get the quad-core Kaby Lake chip and a GTX 1050 GPU, you'll likely want as much protection as possible built-in. With the listing being pulled it's unclear when Dell will launch the 9650 and how much it costs. However, the fact this listing exists and was added to the site suggests Dell won't keep us waiting much longer.

Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times. Mark Religioso, a brand manager for the video game publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment, wants more women to be involved in the professional gaming arena known as esports, where players compete in video game tournaments to win thousands of dollars in prize money. So this year, Mr. Religioso began planning “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments, where esports teams consist of one man and one woman. He also began laying the groundwork for a mentoring program to foster interest in esports among women. “These are baby steps so that we can get more women on the team,” he said. “We need to make the scene a welcoming place.” Mr. Religioso’s efforts are one of several recent moves by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports, which is rapidly becoming one of the video game industry’s most visible segments. As more women play video games, the esports industry is starting to focus on getting more of them involved in professional competition to help the effort expand and become mainstream. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Revenue from esports is expected to surpass $1 billion worldwide by 2018, yet the viewership for esports is only 15 percent female, according to the market research firm SuperData. There is little data on the number of women who actually play esports, but anecdotal evidence suggests the figure may be small. Photo Diane Tran at her computer, training for video game competition. Credit Jake Michaels for the New York Times. Efforts to increase diversity in esports go back more than a decade but have started gathering momentum. In 2003, the French esports company Oxent began organizing annual women-only tournaments; 40 teams competed in the 2016 tournament in Paris, an increase of 25 percent over the previous year. Twitch, the Amazon-owned site that livestreams video game play, began hosting Misscliks, a support community for women in gaming, three years ago after some of its founders became dismayed by the lack of women in esports. Twitch also established Inclusivity City, an area for diversity organizations, at its annual convention, TwitchCon, which ran Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 in San Diego. Advertisement Continue reading the main story And this year, apart from Bandai Namco’s efforts, Intel and the esports company ESL partnered to form AnyKey, an advocacy organization that seeks to create support networks and provide opportunities for women in esports. Many women gamers welcome these efforts. With a predominance of professional male players, the culture of the video game industry has long been perceived as misogynistic. Women in esports have frequently faced heckling from teammates and anonymous threats of rape and murder. “It’s an extremely toxic environment for women,” said Stephanie Harvey, 30, who is a top competitor in esports tournaments for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. “To be a woman in esports, you have to have a thick skin.” How effective these efforts will be in drawing more women to esports is uncertain. Although Oxent, which has run the Electronic Sports World Convention for 13 years, has organized women-only tournaments for years for Counter-Strike, there is little evidence that they are encouraging more women to play competitively. Some gamers think the events reinforce the idea that women are not capable of competing with men. Lâm Hua, the head of content at Oxent, said the women-only tournaments were not entirely successful in drawing more women to esports, but after much debate, the company decided that they were “the first step in the grand scheme of women recognition in the sport.” For now, he said, they were “a necessary evil.” Other diversity efforts in esports have focused on normalizing the idea of women in gaming. Anna Prosser Robinson, a programming manager and onscreen personality at Twitch, helped push the company’s diversity initiatives after seeing women rise up, then drop out of esports. “We would see these awesome, compelling women be excited” about esports, she said. “Six months later, they would be gone.” The goal of Misscliks, she said, was to provide support and resources to encourage those women to create a network on Twitch and stay in esports. Ms. Prosser Robinson also helped bring diversity to TwitchCon this year with Inclusivity City, a physical space on the convention floor that hosted several diversity organizations like AnyKey and Hack Harassment, as well as a Smash Sisters tournament for women who play Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. fighting games. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Inclusivity is a core value of our brand,” Chase, a Twitch spokesman who goes by one name, said of the diversity effort at the convention. “It was a success this year and definitely something we could consider for next year.” AnyKey, the creation of Intel and ESL to increase the number of women in esports, focuses on two areas. One is research and discussion of the diversity issue, headed by T. L. Taylor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the other is initiatives and solutions, led by Morgan Romine, a former esports player. Photo Coach Erik Stromberg observing his team in a training session. Credit Jake Michaels for The New York Times. AnyKey organized a women-only esports tournament in March at one of the industry’s largest events, the Intel Extreme Masters competition in Katowice, Poland. Ms. Romine said she saw women-only tournaments as a way to strengthen players’ skills and move them into open competition. “There is a lot of work that needs to be done, giving more women confidence and experience in that space,” she said. Mr. Religioso of Bandai Namco said he began noticing the lack of female esports players at regional esports tournaments last spring, like Final Round in Atlanta and Combo Breaker in Chicago. With the growth in esports, he saw an opportunity to reinvigorate interest in the company’s Tekken franchise. Next year, Bandai Namco will release Tekken 7, a one-on-one fighting game that the company hopes will be popular among esports competitors. Women make up about 23 percent of the fan base for the Tekken fighting games, Mr. Religioso said, but few are playing them competitively. Rather than segregate men and women, Mr. Religioso wants them to work together in the “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments. He also wants to introduce Western audiences to the Tekken Girl’s Club, a mentorship program in Japan in which professional players teach women to master the game’s mechanics. Another solution to encourage more women into esports would be to change the way video games are made and marketed. Stephanie Llamas, director of research and insight at SuperData, said women should be participating more on the business side of the industry and developing games with women in mind. “It’s difficult to understand the demographic if you are not part of that demographic,” she said. Correction: December 23, 2016 An article on Thursday about efforts by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in esports misidentified the city in California where the TwitchCon convention took place this year. It was in San Diego, not in San Francisco. A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Esports Sees Profit in Attracting Female Gamers.

Mozilla's Firefox browser is a massive open source project supported by its community of volunteers - many of whom also develop apps and need to know about the hardware used by their target audience. Introducing the Firefox Hardware Report in a blog post, Andre Vrignaud and Rebecca Weiss explain the motivation behind it: Suppose you’re developing a sophisticated web game or application, and you’re wondering — will it actually be able to run? What hardware should I be targeting to get the widest possible audience? Existing hardware reports (such as those from Valve and Unity) are excellent, but represent a different group of hardware users than the majority of people who use the web. The source data for the Hardware Report was collected through the in-built Firefox Telemetry system, which automatically collects browser and platform information from machines using Firefox unless users disable it. Having been aggregated and anonymised it appears as the interactive Firefox Hardware Report. The report summary is:     By clicking More details > you can discover more useful information, including the trend over the six month period covered in the report, mid-March to mid-September 2016. For example with regard to Flash, it was available on 82% of machines at the start of the period and declined steadily to 77% by its end. The Operating System Trend shows that Windows 10 (the green line) showed a notable increase in the period achieving a final share of 26%. This was reflected almost perfectly by the decrease in Windows 7, which still retained the lion's share of 45%. Add in Windows XP's 10% and Windows 8.1's 8% and earlier Win OSs, and Windows share amounts to 93%.     Additional data about OS reveals that whereas the share of 32-to-64-bit operating systems was a third, the  share of 32-bit to 64-bit browsers showed a massive 92% for the former. With regard to CPUs  Intel has 86% of the market and AMD 14%. Nearly 70% of users have dual-core machines; over 20% have dual cores;  7% of machines are single-core, which leaves 1.5% having 3 or 8+ cores. The following chart shows CPU speeds, revealing that the most common speed is between 2.3 GHz and 2.69 GHz and if you do some arithmetic you discover that over 80% have speeds of  2 GHz and above.    A similar chart for memory, shows that 4GB is the most common with 30%, 27% of machines have more than this and only 6% have less than 2GB.   Perhaps the most interesting data relates to graphics hardware. The GPU market is more fragmented than the overview suggests, with the most popular, the Intel Haswell GT2 being used by only around 10% of the sample. The next eleven most popular GPUs are also Intel products and overall Intel, color-coded blue, have 63% of the GPU market. There are five AMD (red) GPUs, each with less than 2% of the market and AMD's total share is 18% of the market. There are only two Nvidia (green) GPUs with more than 1% of the market. Throughout the report any product or characteristic with less than 1% is put into the "Other" category which for GPU model amounts to 3%, consisting primarily of AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.   When it comes to display resolution, 1366x768px and 1920x1080px stand out as the most highly used, with the latter showing an upward trend over April to September.       All this information will be of use to web developers in knowing what limitations their target audience face and deciding which hardware to cater for and which can be ignored with little consequence.       More Information Firefox Hardware Report for Web Developers Firefox Hardware Report Related Articles Mozilla Funding - Crisis Averted For Now Firefox Losing Share As Desktop Browser Firefox 42 Developer Edition To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.  Commemorating the Birthday in 1791 of Charles Babbage 26/12/2016 Today we celebrate the birth on December 26th, 1791 of Charles Babbage, the man who invented calculating machines that, although they were never realised in his lifetime, are rightly seen as the  [ ... ] + Full Story Arduino 1.8.0 IDE For Reunified Arduino 29/12/2016 This new version of the Arduino IDE was announced at the beginning of October 2016 at the New York Maker Faire as the official, unified, desktop editor for all Arduino boards. + Full Story More News Malmo AI Available On Github //No Comment - The Blockchain, Technology Beats Algorithms & Bridges in Complex Networks IBM Watson and Project Intu for Embodied Cognition Pygame Updated Microsoft and Intel Partner For Project Evo Amazon Strengthens Lambda Offering App Insight From Vision Mobile - Infographic Xmas Tech Videos The Recruitment Dilemma Android Things - Google's IoT Knuth's 22nd 360 Degree Not Christmas Tree Lecture ReSharper Adds Support For C#7 BBC Micro Turns 35       Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Last Updated ( Thursday, 22 December 2016 )     Follow @Iprogrammerinfo     RSS feed of news items only Copyright © 2017 i-programmer.info.

(IBM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons 7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50% Upside in 2017 View All Posts Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) chips and technologies, may be over 20 years old, but the company has been acting like a red-hot startup. And investors have certainly pumped things up. For the year, Nvidia stock is up a sizzling 227% and the market cap is at $58 billion. Source: via Nvidia But can the momentum continue? Or perhaps investors may want to get cautious with NVDA stock? Well, the valuation metrics are definitely at nose-bleed levels. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio on NVDA stock is at 40. By comparison, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 13 times earnings and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is at 13.5. Then again, when it comes to momentum plays, the valuations may not mean much so long as the growth continues. And yes, it seems like a good bet that there will not be a slowdown anytime soon. During the latest quarter, NVDA posted a 54% spike in revenues to $2 billion and earnings more than doubled to 94 cents a share. 5 Blue-Chip Stock Charts to Watch in 2017 But hey, NVDA is targeting huge market opportunities, which should provide lots of runway for the growth ramp. So let’s take a look at three: NVDA Stock Megatrend #1: Gaming & VR Gaming is one of the oldest tech businesses. As a result, growth has not necessarily been strong. After all, the market size is at about $100 billion. But going forward, there are some key drivers that will likely juice things up. Of course, NVDA’s GPU systems will be a big part of this. Games will soon get to the point where the visuals will be life-like. Oh, and then Virtual Reality (VR) will allow gamers to immerse themselves in the environment. The forecast for this market is nearly 4 million units shipped this year and 16 million by 2020. Yet NVDA is already reaping the benefits from the favorable trends. For the past year, gaming revenues spiked by 54% to $1.244 billion. No doubt, a key has been the next-gen Pascal GPU system. Something else: About 70% of existing gaming systems are on older GPUs. So there is quite a bit of opportunity for upgrades. NVDA Stock Megatrend #2: AI and the Cloud OK, so what does a GPU have to do with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cloud computing? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. Keep in mind that companies want to do much more than just manage documents and track workflows. Rather, they want to leverage cutting-edge technologies to help identify trends or provide insights. But to do this, there needs to be tremendous computing power — and this is spot-on for GPU systems. As for NVDA, it has invested heavily in building an end-to-end AI platform that allows for deep-learning. There is also the Tesla Accelerated Datacenter Platform, which has standout metrics on speed and costs. Just some of the global customers include Barclays PLC (ADR)(NYSE:BCS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB).

Granular de Mark Cooper generally doing thing I'll basically get you've got guys up. Thursday. And that humans soared to meet Kenny Britt news. Anything. It's a sort of it's bad genes the rest that we can. You know I I thought that this is a team could win but. Didn't work out so. And it's gonna start over again yes here is all is next there's always next airs this but this you know people who work for the cubs and New York. Exactly. You have to give up.

People I'm like what. He's even do for Intel is coming act. Forty point is it from the preach it's eat wet Derek Carr and act passed. Did terrible. Well I was forty pointed to her idol and Ian liking to you. Incredible on top but the image on an easy Alley. At like 888 baseball. I mean they were they were two guys sort of entity in the years are very highly ranked and I remember going to draft that was a little bit sort of skeptical obviously it as a rookie in the house this good. And David Johnson second year and we knew adequate ability but. I was a little bit skeptical and now look we've sixteen these guys and not the past two BP's higher year. At a premium position both angry at both an electorate. And you know you have those resident senior probably cost him now hands you know position which it. Exactly and especially apples a team that's at New Hampshire who I had eaten Ian and our plane passengers.

He share are out and write the play Ottawa and immediately act football games lines it's just a few people are still out better. Yet. But for fantasy than anything for me this week at its slate all you hear news own. Is. Incredibly. This guy is sort of in the past years. Here is becoming in the year the pre and drop us whether big money raised quarterback. They just have gone. Out report. At no connection and at. Here it's violent Brian. Brings in Tom my comments that. It's eight catches 87 yards not use but it shows that there's something right I'm already seeing or rap or between. That age and Hopkins. All Antony. And so it's like now you're certainly wait all year for someone that the team to form. And now it finally happened. That Tom savage. Reached X team. You know you play an iPod is I. You figure saliva does it. Feel more comfortable this -- all. I think that. Eight that this is the time you play and sell. Its. And then you know like we do most recent illnesses who is on the waiver wire. And slotted in these guys knew this matchup. Neither the review that's. One do you Lewis jitterbug and the patriots. It was great last. Sort of took us about storm me your home. There's Aziz Al comes back this year and sort of he's been eased in the rotation. Hasn't on the lines and then last week first entry things. One. Analysts at 95 rushing yards over under total yards looks grades has away or back. And now you know that the jets this audiences. Stupid and match up and of the papers this agreement. Getting warmed up it's not is there. May. This year and it really cat and asked me you know I think abuse that was in the masters in. A raid the office line lot more continuity to rot actual profits of one. So I think you know Lou obviously want. Someone. This week. From your team. Robbie Anderson. Right he's looked ready is reckless car and eat it all it's it's an. We are talking about this early sort of a big place taxes currently enormous boom bust right. Get fat get attached out at a past like her. You know I think. When the pictures so it's a tough close game stores and that's when you mean patty. The jets planes from planes and married him and it has so much to. Catch. Every. Cancer expert but I didn't think you know the jets from behind the throw the ball media audiences if its efforts to illegal. Acts. And the last listed in some cardinals. Another touchdown last week before and we have. Injuries art and help it lost Michael what matters to you accurately and so it's sort of more opportunities for our Olson now. Mr. Obama in.

Adding these ads that he's questionable past I had I had and I keep an eye and out because it has been an injury is questionable an out one week but even when he does play it's not. It's not an exciting pinnacle flight was their only option outside outlets are out at out at Lancaster house it's now that he's gone back and it gives them different.

The House intelligence committee released the report to provide what the panel’s chairman called “a fuller account of Edward Snowden’s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U.S. national security.” In a rare example of bipartisanship, the panel’s top Republican and Democrat joined in castigating Snowden, who in 2013 revealed U.S. government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. House Intel Committee report finds Snowden was no whistleblower Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said it “will take a long time to mitigate the damage” Snowden caused. The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden isn’t a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. “Most of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans’ privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America’s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,” Schiff said. Edward Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Release of the report comes as the intelligence community has accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections. The Kremlin gives rave review to 'Snowden' Snowden’s supporters have pressed President Barack Obama to pardon him before he leaves office in late January. But the details in the intelligence committee’s report, coupled with the intense focus on Russia’s hacking of Democratic emails, could doom the push for a pardon. Lisa Monaco, Obama’s adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, said last year that Snowden “should come home to the United States and be judged by a jury of his peers — not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he’s running away from the consequences of his actions.” The report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliament’s upper house, who asserted that “Snowden did share intelligence” with the Russian government. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer, dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. Edward Snowden continues campaign for presidential pardon “The House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,” Wizner said. “The report wholly ignores Snowden’s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.” Tags: edward snowden russia congress Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Zotac's Zbox Magnus EN1070 mini-PC reviewed Pascal produces a mini-monster by Zak Killian  11:24 AM on December 22, 2016 Remember LAN parties? In some parts of rural America, we still don't have fancy DSL or cable internet connections, and we certainly didn't back in the mid-90s. Everyone was happy to lug their full-tower ATX PCs and 50-pound CRT monitors across the county just to play a few hours of Quake II or Starcraft. That's all ancient history now for most, but we're still having LAN parties, and so are folks elsewhere. The thing is, the machines you're likely to find at a LAN party these days are less Chieftec and more like that Gigabyte P57X gaming laptop we just reviewed. Gaming laptops have come a long way in the last few years, and even more so with the ridiculously-efficient mobile graphics chips from Nvidia that have recently become available. While the complete package of a mobile gaming laptop might not perform as well as a full-blown desktop, it comes close. You can get laptops with adaptive-sync displays, SLI, and even external liquid-cooling these days, too. Life is good if you need to take a powerful machine with you. Even so, laptops still have a lot of limitations. You have to worry about saving space for the battery, and you have to make sure it doesn't get so hot it will scorch the user. You also need to account for the display's power usage, and the whole thing has to fit within a certain thickness and weight envelope. What if you wanted a PC that was small enough to carry around anywhere, yet had some really serious gaming chops? Like ultra-settings-at-four-megapixels gaming chops? Say hello to Zotac's Magnus EN1070, the successor to the Magnus EN970 we reviewed a while back. From the pictures, I really thought this tiny terror would be larger. I have some experience with Zotac's mini-PCs, and the machines I've had using AMD low-power APUs and ULV Intel chips have been pretty dang small. Given the hardware on offer and without much visual context, I was expecting this machine to be more the size of a Playstation 4 or Xbox One. But it isn't! It's flippin' tiny. It has around the same footprint as a mini-ITX motherboard, but it's barely thicker than a Wii U. It's about as thick as four stacked DVD cases. This thing is so small my best lady-friend can stick it in her handbag. The solid copper cooling hardware inside makes it a bit heavy for that to be comfortable, though. My analog postal scale puts it at right around four pounds. The actual dimensions of the machine are 8.3" x 8" x 2.4" (21 x 20.3 x 6.2 cm.) Despite the tiny size of this box, Zotac packs a desktop Skylake quad-core CPU and a GeForce GTX 1070 inside. The GTX 1070 is the same mobile graphics card in the Gigabyte P57X we tested recently, with 2048 Pascal shaders running at a base clock speed of 1442 MHz and a boost range of 1645 MHz. Meanwhile, Intel's Core i5-6400T handles more general-purpose math. Those in the know will already be aware that this is a low-power version of the base-spec, sixth-generation Core i5 series. It starts out at 2.2 GHz, and it can Turbo up to 2.8 GHz if thermals permit. The CPU gets a pair of DDR4 SO-DIMM slots for RAM, and storage can slip into an M.2 socket and a 2.5" SATA drive bay. The M.2 socket supports SATA and PCIe drives, although it didn't like the OCZ RD400 we stuck in it when we first put together the EN1070. After some correspondance, Zotac pinned the EN1070's reluctance to boot the RD400 to a hardware or firmware problem with our pre-production EN1070 that shouldn't be present in production units. In the RD400's place, the company lent us a HyperX Predator PCIe AHCI SSD, which went nicely with the pair of 8GB DDR4-2133 CL13 SO-DIMMs HyperX provided for use with the machine. I want to take a moment and say thanks to Toshiba for the RD400 SSD, as well as to HyperX for the memory we used in the machine. The RD400 is one of the fastest SSDs we've ever tested, and I sorely missed its high capacity during testing. Meanwhile, the low-latency HyperX Impact memory is on sale at Newegg right now. Without these contributions from OCZ and HyperX, this review wouldn't have happened. Let's get a closer look at this mighty mite.

The House intelligence committee released the report to provide what the panel’s chairman called “a fuller account of Edward Snowden’s crimes and the reckless disregard he has shown for U.S. national security.” In a rare example of bipartisanship, the panel’s top Republican and Democrat joined in castigating Snowden, who in 2013 revealed U.S. government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. House Intel Committee report finds Snowden was no whistleblower Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the committee chairman, said it “will take a long time to mitigate the damage” Snowden caused. The committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said Snowden isn’t a whistleblower as he and his defenders claim. “Most of the material he stole had nothing to do with Americans’ privacy, and its compromise has been of great value to America’s adversaries and those who mean to do America harm,” Schiff said. Edward Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then to Russia to avoid prosecution. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Release of the report comes as the intelligence community has accused Russia of interfering in the U.S. elections. The Kremlin gives rave review to 'Snowden' Snowden’s supporters have pressed President Barack Obama to pardon him before he leaves office in late January. But the details in the intelligence committee’s report, coupled with the intense focus on Russia’s hacking of Democratic emails, could doom the push for a pardon. Lisa Monaco, Obama’s adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, said last year that Snowden “should come home to the United States and be judged by a jury of his peers — not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he’s running away from the consequences of his actions.” The report pointed to statements in June 2016 by the deputy chairman of the defense and security committee in the Russian parliament’s upper house, who asserted that “Snowden did share intelligence” with the Russian government. Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer, dismissed the report and insisted that Snowden acted to inform the public. Edward Snowden continues campaign for presidential pardon “The House committee spent three years and millions of dollars in a failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation,” Wizner said. “The report wholly ignores Snowden’s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.” Tags: edward snowden russia congress Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

By Rebecca Moore editors@plansponsor.com | December 22, 2016 Page 1 of 3 View Full Article Right out of the gate in 2016, a number of Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) lawsuits were filed. The pace of litigation gained more momentum throughout 2016. Aside from the typical excessive fee cases and company stock litigation of the past, Charles G. Humphrey, Employee Benefits and ERISA counsel at Fiduciary Plan Governance LLC, who is based in Buffalo, New York, says, “I think if you look at Bell v. Anthem, White v. Chevron, Ellis v. Fidelity and Johnson v. Fujitsu, I see something I haven’t seen in great volume before—a probing at quality of fiduciary process.” Stephen Rosenberg, Esq., partner at The Wagner Law Group, who is based in Boston, adds, “The year 2016 saw an expanding panoply of theories for attacking investment options and other aspects of the administration of 401(k) plans, and more of the same can be expected going forward.” Humphrey notes, for example, in Bell v. Anthem, Anthem offered a Vanguard fund charging 4 bps and was called out for not using its bargaining power to get a similar 2 bps investment. In the Chevron and Fidelity cases stable value fund use as opposed to money market fund use was questioned; a case against Intel filed last year included an allegation of too many nontraditional assets in its target-date fund (TDF) offerings; and the Johnson case challenged the use of custom TDFs. Nancy Ross, partner and head of ERISA litigation practice at Mayer Brown LLP in Chicago, adds that cases filed in 2016 have also targeted fee disclosures and arrangements between plans and service providers.    Ross says her firm is seeing a lot of sponsors who make changes being targeted with lawsuits claiming it must have been wrong before. “These are not remedial measures, but plan sponsors genuinely trying to improve their plans. They are improving on a perfectly acceptable arrangement,” she states. An example of this is the recent lawsuit filed against Starwood Hotels. In it, plaintiffs note that Starwood did reduce its fees, but for five years prior to that, participants paid excessive fees. Targets of litigation have also changed. Ross notes that in 2016, not only corporate plan sponsors, but university and college retirement plan sponsors were hit with excessive fee suits. And, while not new to 2016, church plans have faced lawsuits challenging their non-ERISA status. A split in the circuits has led to cases being taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court’s decision to grant certiorari with respect to the definition of church plan under ERISA and the Code could produce a significant increase in litigation against these church-affiliated organizations if the Supreme Court agrees with the three Circuit Courts of Appeals that have addressed this issue and concluded that the long-standing view of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was incorrect and defined benefit plans of these church-affiliated organizations are not church plans,” says Barry Salkin, of counsel at The Wagner Law Group, who is based in Boston.

This tiny 32-bit Motorola 68030, with 273,000 transistors - each with data caches of 256 bytes - was captured by Miami-based photographer Christoph Morlinghaus for his Computerwelt series.

Each transistor - shown here as the densely packed blocks that make up the "roofs" of the cityscape - is only one millimetre in diameter, so getting them in focus wasn't easy. "Nobody has taken photographs of something so small on 8 x 10 film before," he says. WIRED Big Picture ADVERTISEMENT Morlinghaus has photographed chips by manufacturers from Cyrix to Intel. So, having seen their rapid growth up close, what does he think about the inevitable slowdown to come?

Detected as BKDR_ALICE.A. the “Alice” malware is the leanest ATM threat of its type ever analyzed by Trend Micro, the firm’s senior threat researchers David Sancho and Numaan Huq claimed in a blog post. Probably in the wild since at least October 2014, it first checks to see if the ATM is running an Extensions for Financial Services XFS environment before beginning. Once the hacker enters a four-digit PIN based on the ATM’s terminal ID, it will bring up an operator panel displaying the various “cassettes” loaded with money inside the machine. The attacker can then empty each cassette at will. The four-digit code is apparently included to prevent individual groups of mules sharing the malware with each other and bypassing the rest of the cybercrime operation. “Several things stand out about Alice. It is extremely feature-lean and, unlike other ATM malware families we have dissected, it only includes the basic functionality required to successfully empty the money safe of the ATM,” wrote Sancho and Huq. “It only connects to the CurrencyDispenser1 peripheral and it never attempts to use the machine’s PIN pad. The logical conclusion is that the criminals behind Alice need to physically open the ATM and infect the machine via USB or CD-ROM, then connect a keyboard to the machine’s mainboard and operate the malware through it.” Although Alice uses a commercial off-the-shelf packer to make analysis and reverse engineering more difficult, as ATM malware goes mainstream it is expected that the black hats will develop custom packers and other obfuscation techniques. In related news, Positive Technologies is trumpeting research which led to the discovery of a zero day vulnerability in Intel Security’s Solidcore ATM product designed to protect Windows-based cash-points. Hackers could have used the bug to successfully target banks using customized malware, according to the vendor. “The core protection for ATMs has to be regular security audits, the creation of secure ATM configuration policies, combined with continuous monitoring for compliance with these requirements. Such monitoring would significantly increase ATM protection from attacks exploiting simple vulnerabilities - such as Kiosk mode bypass and the absence of BIOS passwords,” explained lead security evangelist, Alex Mathews. “For real-time detection of targeted attacks, the recommendation is to use security information and event management systems (SIEM) to detect suspicious activities or event sequences – such as the connection of any devices to an ATM, an unexpected reboot, the repeated depression of keys, or the execution of unauthorized commands.” Why Not Watch? 10 Mar 2016Out Think Mobile Malware - Learn How to Protect Your Mobile Devices 5 Mar 2015How to Build a Next-generation Security Programme 14 Jan 2016Securing Your Windows 10 Estate 29 Jan 2015Sony Pictures Entertainment: The Fallout from 2014’s Biggest Breach Related to This Story Cobalt Group Linked to ATM Jackpotting Across Europe London Authorities Nab Suspect in $2.6Mn ATM Heist Dairy Queen Dipped with Backoff Malware Breach Bugat Malware Adds GameOver Functionality Goofing off at Work Can Lead to Malware Infections and Data Breaches What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

TSMC has reportedly obtained 10nm chip orders from Apple, HiSilicon and MediaTek, with volume production set to kick off in the first quarter of 2017. Nevertheless, yield rates for TSMC’s 10nm process technology are not what the foundry expected, the sources said. TSMC is scheduled to start making Apple’s A10X chips for the next-generation iPad series slated for launch in March 2017. Unsatisfactory yields for the foundry’s 10nm process could disrupt the schedule, the sources indicated … Digitimes tends to publish absolutely everything it hears, so its reports always have to be taken with a sizeable pinch of salt. Even if the reports of lower-than-expected yields are accurate, there’s time to identify and resolve the problems prior to A10X production. In the worst of cases, it seems likely that TSMC might prioritize its highest-profile customer over other clients, so even continuing low yields may not impact iPad production. Then there are also other foundries, though Samsung would seem highly unlikely at this point. Apple has recently warmed up to Intel however.  The challenge of creating such densely-packed chips is, however, substantial. The same source reports that Samsung is also seeing low yields, promoting Qualcomm to grow less ambitious in its own plans, so the underlying claim – that yields are so far low – is a credible one. There have been multiple reports that Apple plans to rejig its iPad line-up in early 2017, introducing a new 10.5-inch(ish) machine specifically targeting the enterprise and education sectors. One suggestion is that the existing 9.7-inch line would continue but be pushed downmarket, while the 10.5-inch machine would be the Pro model – alongside the existing 12.9-inch one. A KGI report said that Apple will be sticking with its IPS LCD screens next year, OLED making it into only one iPhone model. 2018 iPads would then feature OLED displays, KGI says.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Laptops Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 4G goes official Laptops Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 4G goes official By Bertila Helena - Dec 23, 2016 Xiaomi’s officially unveiled the Mi Notebook Air 4G in collaboration with China Mobile, blessing the laptop with a couple of improvements over its predecessor. As can be guessed by its name, one its top attractions is its in-built LTE support. The Mi Notebook Air 4G will be sold in two variants measuring 12.5-inch and 13.3-inch. The two are priced at CNY 4699 (roughly Rs 46500) and CNY 6999 (approx Rs 69500), respectively. Both have been launched bundled with a free China Mobile offer which serves up 4GB of data on a monthly basis for a total of 48GB a year. The LTE-ready Mi Notebook Air is pretty similar to the older model which came out earlier this year. Other than the added connectivity option, another factor which sets it apart from its predecessor is the 13.3-inch version’s sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor compared to the non-4G iteration’s Intel i5 CPU. Here’s a neat summary of the top specs of the Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 4G: – Display: 12.5-inch/13.3-inch, 1080 x 1920 pixels – OS: Windows 10 – CPU: Intel Core m3 (12.5-inch), Intel Core i7 (13.3-inch) – Battery: 37Wh (12.5-inch), 40Wh (13.3-inch) – Storage: 128GB/256GB SSD, expandable – RAM: 4GB (12.5-inch), 8GB (13.3-inch) – Connectivity: 4G, Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth 4.1, HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0, USB Type-C Also Read: 4.6-inch Xiaomi Mi S with Snapdragon 821, 4GB RAM leaked Xiaomi claims the faster i7 processor offers a 10% improvement over the i5 one. The company’s also come out with a new Piston Fresh in-ear headphone. The accessories will set buyers back by just CNY 29 (approx Rs 300). We’ll keep you updated if the firm decides to bring its new products outside China anytime soon.

There might always be a time when you would want to run a Windows program on an Android platform, and that is not easily done. Apart from the still experimental Crossover app, enter the ExaGear emulator. We want to warn you right at the beginning, ExaGear is not perfect – it will probably not run modern Windows-based games on your Android device. But for apps like those in the Microsoft Office suite and other smaller apps like that, this might be your solution. Originally, you would just transfer over to your Windows laptop or desktop should the need arise to use a Windows program. ExaGear might be an option where you wouldn’t have to. People who have used game emulators will be familiar with the mechanics here. ExaGear will not come with any Windows software – you have to own the Windows installers (EXE or MSI) so you can use them on your device. On Android, you need to have a mouse and a keyboard installed – have fun figuring that out. And on a Chromebook – it will run only on an ARM-powered one and not on an Intel-powered x86 device, which means the only one, the ASUS Chromebook Flip. So the Windows apps you might use with this is hit or miss, you will have to try them out. And you will need to have the keyboard and mouse hardware on an Android device. If you have all that, the ExaGear app is not cheap to try – you will need to pay USD$30 just to see if you can use it. If that’s alright with you, get it at the download link below.

Saturday, December 24, 2016  |  Rabea Al Awwal 25, 1438 World Things to do today UAE Prayer Times People & Politics UAE Weather Sign In Things to do today UAE Prayer Times People & Politics UAE Weather Edit Profile Sign Out UAE World Business Sport Arts & Life Opinion Blogs Middle East and North Africa Yemen South Asia Americas Europe Asia Pacific Africa Central Asia East Asia Southeast Asia Turkish soldiers stand in an army tank driving back to Turkey from the Syrian border town of Jarabulus on September 2, 2016, soon after Turkish forces entered Syria for the first time in the country’s civil war to battle ISIL and Syrian Kurdish forces on its border. Bulent Kilic / AFP Anger in Turkey over ISIL video of soldiers burned alive December 24, 2016 Updated: December 24, 2016 12:38 AM Related Arab Gulf states should join Syria meeting with Russia, Turkey and Iran: Erdogan Turkey urges international air support for its assault on ISIL-held Syria town Five die in air strike on rebel town near Aleppo Killer of Russian envoy had provided security for Erdogan: report A new alliance emerges in Syria’s proxy war Topics: Syria Turkey ISIL Beirut // Turks reacted angrily on Friday after a video released by ISIL that purportedly shows two captured Turkish soldiers being burned alive, although there was no comment from the government. The 19-minute video posted on extremist websites shows two uniformed men being hauled from a cage before being bound and torched. Despite difficulty in accessing some sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, the video was widely discussed among internet users in Turkey, with one describing it as a "nightmare". The video was supposedly shot in the ISIL-declared "Aleppo Province" in northern Syria, where Turkish troops and Turkey-backed Syrian rebels are trying to recapture the town of Al Bab from the extremist group. Turkish air strikes on the town killed at least 88 civilians since Thursday, including 24 children, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday. The raids followed the deaths of 16 Turkish soldiers in ISIL attacks on Wednesday, the heaviest casualties suffered by Ankara’s forces in one day since its incursion into Syria in late August. According to the pro-government news agency Anadolu, Turkish police arrested 31 people suspected of links with ISIL on Friday and were hunting for 10 more. It was not clear if the arrests were linked to the video. Speaking in Turkish, the killer of the two soldiers in the video criticised Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and called for "destruction to be sowed" in Turkey. The two soldiers are first shown in a cage, chained back-to-back as two other armed men in ISIL garb stand outside. The soldiers are then forced to walk on all fours to an open field, still chained, and are then burned alive via a fire that starts at the end of their chains. The video was shared on Twitter by the SITE Intel Group, which monitors extremist social media. Turkish authorities blocked access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube immediately after the video became public. Access to social media websites was restored Friday morning, with noticeable slowing. Before being burned, the two victims gave their names in Turkish as Fethi Sahin, born in Konya in central Turkey and Sefter Tas, a 21-year-old serving in Kilis in the south-east. According to Turkish media, a soldier by the name of Sefter Tas was kidnapped by ISIL on September 1 last year, but Ankara never confirmed the capture. The Turkish army however did confirm last month it had lost contact with two of its troops in Syria and the ISIL-linked propaganda website Amaq had claimed they were captured by the extremists. * Agence France-Presse and Bloomberg Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Arab Gulf states should join Syria meeting with Russia, Turkey and Iran: Erdogan Turkey urges international air support for its assault on ISIL-held Syria town Five die in air strike on rebel town near Aleppo Killer of Russian envoy had provided security for Erdogan: report More Europe Family’s tears for Layan, ‘just a shy, innocent child’ murdered in Istanbul ISIL admits Istanbul New Year nightclub massacre I ‘acted dead’ to survive Istanbul nightclub rampage - video Survivors describe terror inside Istanbul nightclub MOST VIEWED World | All Family’s tears for Layan, ‘just a shy, innocent child’ murdered in Istanbul Escape from Aleppo: a reporter’s story of leaving the city he grew up in Saudis, Jordanians, Lebanese and Indians among victims of Istanbul attack Pakistani man exchanges daughter, 13, for a second wife Syria’s government makes gains near Damascus despite truce Beheaded prisoners among at least 60 killed in Brazil jail riot Snap!

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Tech’s 8 biggest winners of 2016 Chris Burns - Dec 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The biggest winners of the year this year really shine a light on where our priorities are as a collective unconscious. This list is not based on the “most popular stories” or “most searched topics” or anything scientific like that – instead it’s based on my perception of the tech world as a reporter and a participant. It’s also important to note that I consider “tech” to include technology, science, and science fiction entertainment, as well – so those that have any items to add, please, by all means speak up. 1. Amazon Echo and Alexa A surprise success for Amazon over the past two years has been the Amazon Echo with the automated smart assistant Alexa. Over the past year we’ve seen an intense amount of 3rd-party brands integrating products and services with Alexa skills. Amazon’s Echo family has grown by several products, and there’s no end in sight for the expansion of this ecosystem. What’s good for the rest of the industry is the light Amazon has shined on AI, in the process. Sure, there’d been audio-based smart assistant tech before, but Amazon’s persistence with Alexa has spread the bug in a big way. Even Google is getting in on the AI for one’s Smart Home trend with their own Google Home platform. Alexa was granted the skill to summon a Tesla to drive to its driver autonomously, too. 2. Google Pixel Since Android was first acquired by Google, we’ve been waiting for a proper Google Phone. Here in the year 2016, Google launched the Pixel, a device like their developer-aimed Nexus smartphone line, but here aimed at consumers. Unlike the Nexus, Google’s Pixel is a headliner smartphone, made to take on the big guns like Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S and Note. According to Kantar Insights, Pixel phones accounted for .5% of worldwide smartphone sales in the three months ending in October of 2016. This might not seem all that fantastic, but consider the fact that the Pixel was only revealed on the 4th of October and put in physical store locations (at Verizon) soon after. Less than a month and 1 in every 200 phones purchased around the world was a Google Pixel. 3. Live Video Live video became a much more widely used platform for people of all sorts. This was thanks in part to the sustained support of Facebook Live Video and YouTube launching live mobile streaming and live 360-degree video. Instagram also joined in on the trend by launching Live Video within their Stories feature. Having a Live Video or Streaming Video option on many different types of social networking apps democratizes the medium in a big way. In the recent past, sharing a memory with video required some measure of skill in recording, saving, editing, and uploading media captured with a camera. Now it’s only a matter of opening Facebook and tapping a couple of buttons to begin a live feed – particularly great for amateur newscasters in the field, recording events as they happen. 4. Nintendo Nintendo basically killed it this year. Not only did they launch their hottest-selling console in years with the NES Classic Edition, they launched several super-successful games, too. Nintendo’s Super Mario Run was downloaded 40-million times in four days – thats success by many measures. The company revealed the Nintendo Switch near the end of the year to some hearty applause. We won’t know how well it’ll sell until it actually goes on sale in 2017, but for now – things look promising. Nintendo is also one of three joint owners of the Pokemon franchise, which also had a monumental year. 5. Pokemon The Pokemon brand hasn’t really had a bad year since they started doing big business back in the late 1990s. Here in the year 2016, 20 years after the launch of the original Pokemon Red and Blue video games for Gameboy, Pokemon saw a big resurgence in popularity. This was due in a giant way to the mega-success of the mobile game Pokemon GO. Niantic was probably the biggest winner in the launch of Pokemon GO aside from The Pokemon Company – owners of the Pokemon brand. The launch of Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon further solidified the year 2016 as a landmark year for the Pokemon universe. See our early review of Pokemon GO called Pokemon GO is the best game EVER to see how this all started. 6. SpaceX and the Reusable Rockets The tech world wasn’t all about personal gadgets, social networking, and games this year. There was also a rocket landing. One of the most important moments in the history of space travel happened this year thanks to the CRS-8 SpaceX rocket and countless scientists and engineers involved. Above is a video showing the takeoff and landing of the CRS-8 that made history. This event took place in April of 2016 and changed the way we travel to (and back from) space forever. This was one of the most historic moments in recent space exploration history. 7. Autonomous (Self-Driving) Cars We started the year discussing the California DMV’s new automated automotive rules – partially self-driving, that is, so long as a driver was present. President Obama’s State of the Union called for the United States to become a haven for self-driving vehicles. This month Michigan became the first state to pass a fully self-driving car law. We saw – and got to ride in -concepts for autonomous cars from Kia and Hyundai, and plenty of other companies dolled out the concept car driver tests throughout the year. Apple’s long-rumored self-driving car program was spoken about by the company in a letter to the NHTSA – without any imagery or video or anything, but still – it’s real. Tesla made self-driving technology standard on all of its future-aimed vehicles. BMW, Intel, and Mobileeye formed an autonomous car super-group that aims to bring automated vehicles into “series production” by the year 2021. Lyft suggested that by 2021, the majority of Lyft rides will be in self-driving cars. Alphabet got extra-serious about its self-driving car aspirations by spinning out an entirely new company called Waymo. Autonomous, self-driving vehicles are coming. The year 2016 acted to solidify the conceptual nature of this future with announcements, brand collaborations, and real-life ride-along tests around the world. 8. Star Wars In early 2016 it became apparent that Star Wars: The Force Awakens was set to become one of the most successful movies ever released. Over the course of the year, the resurgence of Star Wars popularity was cultivated by Disney and Lucasfilm through initiatives like ILMxLAB. The group ILMxLAB released Star Wars experiences like “Trials on Tatooine” for the HTC Vive virtual reality headset and, more recently, the Rogue One X-Wing experience for YouTube VR and Android’s Daydream devices. Disney and Lucasfilm made another big push for Star Wars merchandising with the #GoRogue initiative, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was released in December of 2016. Rogue One had the second-biggest December film debut opening ever, just behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In other words: this Star Wars thing isn’t just a fad. Wrap-up Again, this list is not indicative of the popularity or scientifically-tracked success of any one item. The items on this list are also not in any particular order. The fact that there are 8 items should not be seen as indicative of a lack of awesome things to have happened over the course of the past 12 months – these 8 just made the most sense to me. Bookmark this article and look back upon it in a year to see how far we’ve come in the 12 months that begin in January. The year 2017 could be a real disaster for science and technology and a real eye-opener for the prophesies of the most notorious of science fiction stories. Or it could end up being really great. We’re crossing our fingers for the latter.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums TR's 12 days of giveaways: Toshiba's big gift in a small package by Bruno Ferreira  5:26 PM on December 21, 2016 Evening's greetings and all that, dear gerbils. As we're sure you're aware by now, it's that time of the day when we await with bated breath for another delivery from the TR Santa to offer to an unsuspecting (or expectant) gerbil. We have our cameras pointed at the sky and... what's that? Northern lights? But this isn't exactly the place to... oh, wait, the lights are resolving to what appears a bright circle with a Santa head outlined in the middle. This is eerily familiar, but we can't quite pin it. We can spot the sled now, even in this dark sky. Santa apparently has a new paintjob, and he appears to have gotten himself a cape, too. The reindeer, meanwhile, all have dark leather armor, surely because of the cold. The sled's coming in pretty hot, though, and it's zipping past us! He's dropped a package, but it's actually attached to a parachute. When we said we wanted a surprise, maybe he misunderstood. Okay, let's see what's in that box over yonder. And it's... small, but certainly very enticing: a Toshiba OCZ RD400 512GB NVMe SSD! Great, now I have gift envy too. TR reviewed the Toshiba OCZ RD400 SSD (a $330 value) a while ago, and the drive posted some insanely-good performance, even nipping at the heels of the datacenter-oriented Intel DC P3700. The drive should be capable of up to 2,600 MB/s in sequential reads and 1,600 MB/s in sequential writes, and has a massive endurance rating of 592 TBW. Toshiba also offers a five-year warranty on these drives, too. And now for the big reveal! Hold your horses, dear gerbils, you all know that we need a countdown. Today, we'll have an easy one: we'll count down from the number of passes done by Kobe Bryant. Done already? Great job. Today we have a community award, and the winner is... chuckula! Officially, the man has collected the most upvotes in the front-page comments. Unofficially, we picked you because you're very "smart" in a particular way—but we'll obviously deny this statement in court. Congratulations chuckula. You're certainly not the hero we need, but perhaps the one we deserve. No, Krogoth, we're not impressed enough to give you that label. Let's offer a round of applause to Toshiba for the prizes it sent us from its storage division. The company's taken the OCZ branding and is making very good use of it, at least as far as we're concerned. Please go ahead and follow its Twitter feed, and hit Like on its Facebook profile. Don't forget to sign up for the remaining random draws in TR's 12 days of giveaways. TR Santa still has goodies to deliver over the next few weeks, and you still have good chances. We'll have another giveaway tomorrow, but in the meantime, you can gaze at an item that may or may not be up for grabs: Tags: Storage Miscellaneous Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

Learn more from the Guide to the Open Cloud. Creative Commons Zero Pixabay Is virtualization still as strategically important as it was now that we are in the age of containers? According to a Red Hat survey of 900 enterprise IT administrators, systems architects, and IT managers across geographic regions and industries, the answer is a resounding yes. Virtualization adoption remains on the rise, and is integrated with many cloud deployments and platforms. Red Hat's survey showed that most respondents are using virtualization to drive server consolidation, increase provisioning time, and provide infrastructure for developers to build and deploy applications. According to a Red hat post: "Over the next two years, respondents indicated that they expect to increase both virtualized infrastructure and workloads by 18 percent and 20 percent, respectively. In terms of application mix, the most commonly virtualized workloads among respondents were web applications, including websites (73 percent), web application servers (70 percent) and databases (67 percent). At the same time, virtualization does face challenges. Nearly 40 percent of respondents to Red Hat’s survey called out budgets and costs as a key challenge, likely related to the cost implications of migrating workloads to and maintaining virtualization environments. That is precisely where free and open source virtualization solutions are making an enormous difference. Open virtualization tools can be part of a broader strategy to provide developers and applications with the best possible infrastructure, integrating with containers, private clouds and public clouds. The Linux Foundation recently announced the release of its 2016 report "Guide to the Open Cloud: Current Trends and Open Source Projects." This third annual report provides a comprehensive look at the state of open cloud computing.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Trump is missing the biggest offshoring companies Rick Newman Columnist Yahoo FinanceDecember 21, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share IBM never makes a public announcement when it moves American jobs to other countries. But it offshores aggressively all the same—even though its CEO, Virginia Rometty, is now advising incoming President Donald Trump on how to keep more jobs in the United States. Filings with the Labor Department show at least two dozen instances during the last two years in which former IBM (IBM) employees applied for federal aid because the tech giant moved their jobs to other countries. There’s only one such filing during that time for United Technologies (UTX), the firm Trump attacked recently for a plan to move 700 jobs from Indiana to Mexico. There are none for Ford Motor Co., another company Trump has criticized—most likely because Ford plans to open new factories in Mexico, but hasn’t actually moved any US work there. Trump seems to base his sporadic attacks on companies moving jobs overseas on anecdotal information gleaned from news headlines. But a lot of companies offshore jobs without ever making the news, as a look at federal records reveals. American workers who lose their jobs because of offshoring are entitled to a federal benefit called trade-adjustment assistance, or TAA. To get the benefit, the workers or somebody acting on their behalf—usually state government officials—must file a petition with the Labor Department. The forms are supposed to include the number of workers affected and a basic explanation for why the workers lost their jobs. The Labor Department certifies the petitions before granting benefits. Such filings indicate that at least 450 IBM workers have lost their jobs since the beginning of 2015 because the company moved the work overseas. But the real number is most likely higher, since one-third of the filings either don’t say how many workers were affected or contain redactions that obscure the information. One filing, on behalf of laid-off workers in Connecticut, said “IBM refuses to provide this information.” IBM moved American jobs to India, China, Bulgaria, Egypt, Brazil and Costa Rica, according to the filings. On some of the forms, workers indicated they were required to train their foreign replacements in order to receive severance pay. “We were managers who laid off our staff (and then were let go too),” one petition reads. “My staff was, at its peak, a couple hundred people. We were only part of the large scale movement of production from IBM’s GTS [Global Technology Services] organization in the US to India.” IBM did not respond to questions for this story, but Trump could get the details straight from the company’s CEO, since Rometty has joined a panel of business leaders meant to advise Trump on jobs and the economy. Trump, of course, has been focusing on manufacturing jobs leaving the United States, which often disappear in big lumps when an entire factory closes. Technical jobs, such as those at IBM, often disappear in smaller numbers that don’t generate a lot of attention, but add up all the same. ‘Strategically outsourcing’ Yahoo Finance looked for clues about unannounced offshoring by first asking outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks layoffs, for data involving companies that have announced job cuts during the last 18 months. We then looked for TAA petitions involving those companies and tallied the number of workers who seem to have been affected by offshoring since the beginning of 2015. A handful of companies stood out. The 24 TAA petitions relating to IBM were far more than any other company we looked into, but 9 petitions filed on behalf of Intel (INTC) workers listed more than 1,600 jobs lost to offshoring during the last two years, mostly in Oregon, Washington, Arizona and New Mexico. One petition filed by Washington’s Employment Security Department involving the loss of 77 jobs in Olympia this month says, “Intel Corporation has been strategically outsourcing and shrinking its US footprint for years. This closure in Washington state is one of many across the country. As US jobs are lost, Intel is expanding global operations.” Eight petitions filed on behalf of Verizon (VZ) workers list about 470 jobs offshored during the past two years. One filed in Texas in 2015, for instance, says “Verizon conducted a workforce layoff … and moved our positions to the Manila, Philippines offshore location.” (Disclosure: Verizon is in the process of purchasing Yahoo, Yahoo Finance’s parent company.) Intel and Verizon both declined to comment for this story. The biggest offshorer of recent years is probably Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), one of the two companies spun off last year from the old Hewlett-Packard. This, however, was no secret. CEO Meg Whitman said during the split that a key unit of HPE, its consulting division, would need to increase the portion of employees based in low-cost countries from 36% to 60%. A TAA filing from last year put the total tally at 10,000 US jobs being sent offshore. The stated reason: “Services are being outsourced to a foreign country.” Like the other companies, HPE declined to comment. Expanding global workforce, shrinking US workforce Big companies move jobs offshore because they operate in many parts of the world and need to keep costs down in order to compete with other companies doing the same thing. Plus, shareholders and Wall Street analysts demand peak profitability, which often means cutting labor costs. IBM has responded to that sort of pressure by shrinking its work force by about 13% since 2010, to about 378,000 people at the end of 2015; it doesn’t break out the portion based in the United States. At Intel, a larger portion of the jobs are based overseas, but since the overall labor force has grown, there’s been a net gain of about 9,000 US workers from 2010 to 2015. That may be changing, however, on account of a big restructuring plan announced earlier this year. Verizon has shrunk by about 17% since 2010, to about 162,000 workers—with most of them in the United States, where the company’s business is. HPE has 195,000 employees worldwide but expects that to fall by 30,000 through 2018. Like IBM, it doesn’t publish the portion of its workforce based in the United States. Trump has already claimed one success in his crusade to boost US employment. United Technologies modified its offshoring plan, at Trump’s insistence, and decided to keep some jobs in Indiana, in exchange for new tax breaks. But that may turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory for Trump and the workers whose jobs he saved: The company’s CEO said some of the jobs now remaining in Indiana were likely to be replaced by automation in coming years. Meanwhile, another Indiana manufacturer, Rexnord, is going ahead with plans to move 300 jobs to Mexico–despite Trump’s protestations. Trump is late to the game, anyway. American companies have been offshoring jobs for more than two decades, with multinationals such as IBM and Intel surviving many bouts of bad publicity due to offshoring and other controversial employment practices. One important study found that China alone accounted for the loss of 985,000 US manufacturing jobs between 1999 and 2011, and 2 million jobs overall. The overall number of jobs offshored is presumably higher, since India, Vietnam, Taiwan, Mexico and other low-cost countries have all gained work that was once done in the United States. Overall US employment has grown since then–new jobs are created as old ones disappear. And millions of consumers have benefited from the lower prices that come with cheaper imports. But it’s undeniable by now that some American workers have been hurt by free trade and globalization, with programs such as TAA doing little to offset the damage. Trump’s appeal to such workers carried him to a stunning election in November. But the scale of the problem he has identified will require more than the opportunistic reaction to a few headlines.

RADV Radeon Vulkan Code Enables More Driver Features Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 22 December 2016 at 05:00 AM EST. 9 Comments The RADV Radeon Vulkan driver in Mesa has seen some activity last night to enable more fine-grained features. RADV now enables shaderImageGatherExtended. The image gather extended functionality for shaders is described via the Vulkan registry as "indicates whether the extended set of image gather instructions are available in shader code. If this feature is not enabled, the OpImage*Gather instructions do not support the Offset and ConstOffsets operands. This also indicates whether shader modules can declare the ImageGatherExtended capability." That was followed by shaderStorageImageExtendedFormats support in RADV. Again from the registry, "indicates whether the extended storage image formats are available in shader code. If this feature is not enabled, the formats requiring the StorageImageExtendedFormats capability are not supported for storage images. This also indicates whether shader modules can declare the StorageImageExtendedFormats capability." For those wondering what the overall state of VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures -- what specifies the supported fine-grained features -- is for the driver: RADV still has yet to support geometry shaders, tessellation shaders, sample rate shading, support for multiple viewports, ETC2 texture compression, ASTC LDR texture compression, pipeline statistics query, multisampled storage images, shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat, 64-bit float, 64-bit integers, 16-bit integers, variableMultisampleRate, and inherited queries. If you are wondering how the VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures of the Intel ANV driver compares: the Intel driver still has to land tessellation shaders, multi-draw indirect, depth bounds, pipeline statistics query, shader image gather extended, shaderStorageImageMultisample, shaderStorageImageReadWithoutFormat, 64-bit floats, 64-bit integers, 16-bit integers, shaderResourceMinLod, variableMultisampleRate, and inherited queries. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us ASUS Zenbo ready for pre-order in Taiwan starting January 1 By Rei Padla - December 22, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter 2016 may not be the year robots invade our homes but next year, expect see the likes of ASUS Zenbo doing many things for the family including offer entertainment. In a recent press event in Taiwan, ASUS announced that Zenbo will be up for pre-order beginning January 1. What a nice way to start the new year especially if you’ve been wanting to get a hold of the cute robot since it was unveiled back in May. The smart little companion, or should we say robots, surprised the audience by rendering a special holiday song number. Ten Zenbos sang Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You” in chorus. The main Zenbo singer has the voice of child so there was no any robot voice singing. After the robot choir’s performance, ASUS Chairman Jonney Shih showed off once again the many features of the $599 Zenbo. He shared his company’s vision to enable robotic computing in every home in the near future. Zenbo is more of a hi-tech companion you can talk to you, ask anything, and show you stuff on the Internet. We’re now living in the future where robots can replace humans. Well, we’re still far from that age when robots look like humans (we’ll get there someday) but Zenbo is a good start. Actually, it already has a rival in Omate’s Yumi robot. That one speaks the Alexa language and looks a lot like Zenbo. ASUS Chairman Shih also shared that they have already teamed up with several partners and developers to work on apps and add new capabilities for the Zenbo. They are aiming to enrich and expand the whole Zenbo experience. In the coming months, we expect to hear more Zenbo apps related to e-commerce, transportation, cleaning, entertainment, and education. The possibilities are endless and we’re excited to know this is only the beginning for such smart robots. We have a feeling other big OEMs will follow suit. For one, ASUS and the National Police Agency of Taiwan already worked on an app that allows a household to contact the police in case of an emergency. There was a live demo during the event with Chairman Shih and the National Police Agency’s Director General Kuo‑En Chen. Achin Bhowmik, Vice President of the New Technology Group and General Manager of the Perceptual Computing Group for Intel, also joined the event and expressed his excitement over the project. He said: “For nearly thirty years, Intel and ASUS have been collaborating to bring some of the most leading innovations in PCs and devices to market. We are excited to continue that collaboration on Zenbo, and we look forward to continue working with ASUS on enabling intelligent and interactive devices with Intel RealSense technology.” Watch the ASUS Zenbo Holidays Song Performance below: ASUS Zenbo will cost 19,900 TWD for the 32GB version and 24,900 TWD (around $778) for the 128GB model. Each Zenbo robot will come with a special battery dock for charging.

Mobile by Marguerite Reardon December 22, 2016 5:00 AM PST @maggie_reardon Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Faster networks, more "free data" and a dismantling of net neutrality rules could be in the works for 2017. Photo by Getty Images Get ready for a wild 2017 when it comes to the world of wireless. From the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States to ever-growing hype around 5G wireless technology, the signs of change are unmistakable. It could mean anything from a shift in who provides your service to how exactly your connections get made. Trump may be an unpredictable president-elect, but that won't keep us from trying to peer into our crystal ball. Here's a list of the top 7 predictions for mobile in 2017: 1. Zero rating is a thing Thanks to Trump's victory, you're likely to see more services that are zero-rated, meaning the wireless data for a specific service doesn't count against your cap. AT&T's new DirecTV Now service is one example, with AT&T customers streaming as much video as they want despite their data limits. Verizon has done the same with its Go90 video service. T-Mobile has BingeOn, but argues that it's different because it offers the no-data perk to outside video services like Netflix and YouTube, not just its own. Comcast is also expected to launch a streaming TV service next year that will be available to anyone over the internet. This could be zero-rated on the home broadband side, as well as on the wireless service. While customers are happy to take the "free" data, critics warn that such practices stifle competition. (If you're happy with DirecTV Now, why would you try anyone else?) That could ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers and fewer innovative services. The outgoing Federal Communications Commission chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been skeptical of zero-rating offers. Earlier this month, the agency went so far as to accuse AT&T of violating its net neutrality rules by offering the zero-rated DirecTV Now product. But with Trump FCC appointees in charge, net neutrality is likely to be dismantled and zero-rating will likely face little to no resistance. This could mean more creative forms of the practice in 2017. 2. Merger mania The company that delivers you wireless service may not carry the same name by the time 2017 is over. While merger proposals received a chilly reception under President Obama, that's likely to change during a Trump presidency. Who's likely to pair up with whom? Although the current FCC threw cold water on Softbank's hopes to merge Sprint with T-Mobile, that idea may be back on the table again. There's renewed interest in this combo after SoftBank earlier this month said it plans to invest $50 billion in the US, aiming to create 50,000 jobs. Other possibilities include a deal involving satellite TV provider Dish Network, which has wireless spectrum it needs to use, according to UBS analyst John Hodulik. T-Mobile, Verizon and Comcast are all potential partners. Verizon and Comcast could also try to merge. Verizon could use Comcast's access to video content, and Comcast, which is introducing a wireless service later this year based on its Wi-Fi network, could benefit from Verizon's expertise. The two companies are already partnering on Comcast's wireless service, which will also resell Verizon service. But this deal -- even for deal-friendly Republicans -- may be too big to accept. In this case, there are other options like Comcast hooking up with T-Mobile or Verizon with cable operator Charter Communications. 3. Long-distance drones Imagine your pizza being delivered by a drone. Companies like Alphabet's Google are already experimenting with using drones to deliver products. Amazon just delivered its first package via drone earlier this month. But the short-range Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals used today to control recreational drones won't cut it for longer distances. Instead, these companies need wireless control via cellular networks. Industry heavyweights are stepping up. Equipment and component companies like Ericsson and Qualcomm have been experimenting with long-range drone control. Qualcomm and AT&T have begun testing the technology in San Diego. Verizon in October announced its Airborne LTE Operations (ALO) initiative, which, among other things, envisions using drones to help first responders in disaster recovery efforts and encourages developers to create ALO-enabled apps. While these companies will likely make some progress in 2017, don't expect pizza delivery to go nationwide just yet. What's really needed for this technology to take off are 5G wireless networks, which will reduce the lag time on the network, ensuring these unmanned aircraft can respond instantly to commands. 4. 5G...close but not yet Speaking of 5G, watch for 2017 to be the year of "testing" for the technology. AT&T and Verizon have already lined up trials of their 5G networks for 2017, and Sprint and T-Mobile are also gearing up for 5G testing. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam announced this month that the company will launch precommercial field trials in the first quarter of 2017. AT&T has one test customer, Intel, in Austin, Texas. But before you get too excited, keep in mind that Verizon and AT&T envision the initial deployments of 5G not for mobility, but as a wireless replacement for your physical home broadband line. 5. Video throttling will be the norm Can you tell the difference if your video streams at DVD- or HD-quality resolution on your mobile device? You may not have much choice about it soon. T-Mobile and Sprint have already downgraded the quality of some video to conserve data. AT&T said it will also add this feature starting next year. It won't be long before Verizon joins them. For now, each of these programs is optional. But once the threat of net neutrality goes away, throttling could become the norm. On the bright side, this more efficient use of the network could help consumers get a better deal on data. Lower-quality video is what's allowing T-Mobile and Sprint to continue offering unlimited data. For wireless customers on plans with data caps, it can help ensure you don't bust through your data cap watching a season's worth of "Game of Thrones." 6. Wi-Fi-first to hit the mainstream So-called Wi-Fi-first networks, like Google's Project Fi and Republic Wireless, could become more mainstream in 2017 thanks to the debut of a Wi-Fi-first network from cable giant Comcast. These networks use a combination of cellular coverage and local Wi-Fi networks to provide inexpensive wireless internet connectivity. When Wi-Fi isn't available, they use cellular networks to provide service. Project Fi and Republic Wireless added support for more devices in 2015, which has helped grow the potential audience for these services. People will get interested in a big way come mid-2017 when Comcast gets involved, pairing its 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots with Verizon's 4G network. The big unanswered question is how Comcast will price its new service. Will it be enticing enough to drop traditional cellular service? 7. Fiber's not dead Google's announcement in October that it was pausing Google Fiber deployments crushed the super high-speed broadband dreams of many who hoped Google would come to their city next. But the decision to pull the plug is not the end of fiber or high-speed internet access. Google Fiber has helped spur rivals like Comcast and AT&T to increase speeds on their broadband service. And AT&T has been rapidly expanding its fiber network, which will continue into 2017. Fiber is still a key part of the wireless industry's ambitions to build 5G service. The big difference in 2017 and beyond is that Google, AT&T and others will be looking to wireless to provide high-speed broadband for that "last mile" directly into the home instead of fiber.

Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich The Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee are apparently having a hard time giving up the idea that they're getting super-duper special information, and they don't want other Democrats to have it. So they're resisting the calls of their new leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer, for a select committee to investigate Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Several members of the party, particularly those on the Intelligence Committee, are noncommittal about setting up a new select committee specifically devoted to cybersecurity that would also investigate Russian influence on the presidential election. Instead, some Democrats will wait to see whether Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) will follow through on his pledge to “expeditiously” investigate the electronic break-ins and preside over public hearings about the matter. […] Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the new top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, is not currently endorsing a select committee as he looks to forge a partnership with Burr. Still, he's leaving the door open to call for an investigatory shake-up in the future if the current Intel panel investigation stalls. But in the meantime, he's “actively engaged in discussions with Senator Burr” about the course of the current probe rather than calling for a new panel that would step on the Intel Committee's jurisdiction, a spokeswoman said. And of course Sens. Angus King of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia are puffing themselves up and holding out, saying the haven't made up their minds. This is undoubtedly them hoping to have their egos stroked and extract some trade-off from Schumer, who has called for the special select committee along with Democrat Jack Reed and Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham. There are two stand-up stalwart Democrats on the intelligence committee, however, who are calling for the special committee. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and New Mexico’s Martin Heinrich are demanding both transparency and a commitment from the Senate to conduct a complete and focused investigation. "The Russian hacking in the 2016 election—in this case on behalf of an unprecedentedly pro-Russian candidate—strikes at the core of our Democracy and cannot be brushed under the carpet," Heinrich said in a statement released by his office Wednesday. "There needs to be an independent, bipartisan commission designed solely to investigate Russia's interference in our election."  86 Comments Share this article 73 73 73 86 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

There’s a chill in the air as Moore’s law grows more complex and expensive and the semiconductor industry matures and consolidates. But it’s also a vibrant season with new kinds of processors for artificial intelligence, new types of memories, a whole new layer of 5G wireless communications in the works, and a small but brilliant new market in virtual reality emerging. A year ago, analysts were divided over whether virtual reality would gain traction in 2016 or just crash and burn again. Some suggested it might be “a belly flop.”   Jon Peddie Research started 2016 with a projection that VR headsets would have a brief rise and then fall. Before the end of the year, the Khronos group recognized the need for an open applications interface to smooth the growth path for a sector that had already spawned a dozen products. Meanwhile, developers working on real-time remote presence apps for 2017 are suggesting that gaming may not even be the biggest use of VR headsets. Long term, the road map leads to augmented reality. Along the way, mobile VR is pushing smartphone electronics to the max while Intel and others are crafting a new generation of integrated headsets. The high prices of the high-end headsets and PCs to drive them are still holding back mainstream buyers (like myself). But enthusiasts (like my colleague, Max Maxfield) are hungry for the latest apps, controllers, and experiences. Skeptics admit that the low-cost mobile VR experience can be exhilarating, though it still has kinks to work out.

Consoles also offer a bit more convenience in the mainstream, easier for a parent to just buy one. There are plenty of PC gamers but the current headsets priced themselves out of the market. As a comparison, 27 inch 1080p PC monitors retail for as low as 120$ (best deals) in the US and budget 4K displays (monitors or TVs) can be had for well bellow 300$. With Oculus, just the touch controller is 200$, more than what normal people pay for their PC displays. PC enthusiasts are not the folks that pay 2k$ for a PC for no good reason, the vast majority are always looking for the best bang for the buck. They have certain needs and wants and a certain budget and they try to put together the best PC they can, value is fundamental. Oculus and HTC are addressing a different target audience ,people that buy a Macbook as an impulse buy but very few PC gamers are that. You can't sell Prada to factory workers, that's what FB wants to do and it's silly. Right now they are only addressing a tiny niche.They must understand the target audience and properly address it. A few days ago, in China, a new headset was launched at 360$ with 2x 1440x1440p displays, one for each eye, and high end phone guts-Snapdragon 820, 4GB RAM. Good value products are starting to show up, the standards and the software must mature now. As for the future, VR headsets like these are a stopgap product. Hopefully, in a matter of just a few years, VR only headsets are gone.  AR+VR headsets are the future, i've been  just calling them glasses for a couple of years now. Glasses will be the best computing form factor yet by a large margin. With a phone, the field of view is a few degrees, with glasses you can achieve a very wide field of view and do that with a tiny display - very important cost wise. Glasses will have a lot more functionality than a PC, tablet, phone, TV and will replace them all. The only problem is how do you fit enough computing, sensors and the battery to power all in a mechanical volume that tends towards zero. With AR it is easier as most of the time only a fraction of the display is active and ,if you track the eye, you don't even need to render at full resolution all the time. Going to full VR mode would increase the computing needs quite a bit so maybe some early glasses will still require a phone ,a PC or even cloud in VR mode. Who knows, maybe cloud gaming finally takes off with 5G and VR - while considering cloud gaming costs, i've remembered that costs will keep declining for solar and wind (one of the great things with renewables). This means that , if electricity gets cheaper, computing becomes cheaper. In server, the cost of electricity is quite a lot and not much could be done about the actual cost of electricity before. We might as well factor this into Moore's Law and it could be quite substantial. If electricity costs end up falling 5-10% per year for the next few decades, it's a lot in this era when scaling is suffering.   Since it's the 24th, Merry Christmas to anyone that celebrates it.

WD seems to have their 3D ReRAM in the second half of 2018 on their public roadmap. PC VR was crippled by poor product design and absurd pricing. They should be shipping 10 million units in Q4 not tens of thousands. This has allowed for console and mobile to take the lead. Canalys, IDC, TrendForce all have projections for VR headset sales, Sony is crushing Oculus and HTC and Sony itself could have done much better if they didn't had shortages. AI related fields are the key area going forward. From cars and robots to smart homes or glasses. From managing the electric gird to context aware UI, from gaming to education and so on.

provided by Research and Markets Dec 22, 2016, 12:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Dec 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Internet of Things (IoT) 2017-2027" report to their offering. This unique report on the Internet of Things IoT has over 140 data filled pages including over 150 images. It is intended to assist investors, participants and intending participants in the value chain including developers and academics, interested government officials and users seeking the truth based on new investigation. The focus is on identifying genuine capabilities and needs from a commercial point of view. The largest potential applications will be multi-sensor so, for many reasons, component count will increase making cost reduction more difficult. We look at expenditure on IoT enabling technology which currently runs to billions of dollars yearly, mainly coming from governments and aspiring suppliers. However, we reveal how most of those reporting these and other IoT figures are puffing their data with things that may never be a part of the IoT scene such as sensor research in general. Expenditure on buying and installing actual IoT networks is much more modest, contrary to heroic forecasts made by most analysts and manufacturers in the past. The author was disbelieving about the huge projections by others for the last four years and we have been proved right so far. Nevertheless, even our node forecasts have now been reduced in the light of what has happened, though our systems figures have been increased. It adds up to $20 billion in actual networks including nodes in ten years from now and rapid progress after that. See the number and dollar breakdown by application. Learn which players do what. What are now looking to be the important IoT applications and why? What are the important open source options at node and system level? What has come right lately that will boost IoT and what is still problematic? These and many other questions are answered. Key Topics Covered: 1. Executive Summary And Conclusions 2. Introduction 3.

Anfrage an Radio Jerewan: Stimmt es, dass der Akku in dem Laptop wirklich über 10 Stunden geht ? Antwort: Im Prinzip ja. Wenn ich den MBP standalone mit einigen Apps nutze (Word, iaWriter, iMindMap, OmniOutliner und OmniGraffle und Evernote) komme ich locker bei ca. 75% Helligkeit auf über 10 Stunden echte Laufzeit. Wichtig: grundsätzlich lokales Arbeiten, WLAN ist aktiv, aber nicht viel surfen. gestern war die Laufzeit mit FruitJuice am Anfang auf über 12 Std kalkuliert. Wenn ich mit fast gleicher Konstellation (Programme) mit meinen zwei Adaptern (Apple USB-C-HDMI an Monitor und noname-RJ45-USB-C GBit Adapter (Apple Adapter gibt es angeblich erst in 7 Wochen ) am Schreibtisch arbeite sind es "plötzlich" nur noch 3-5 Stunden. Beide Adapter werden zu dem wirklich warm (nicht heiss, aber auch diese Wärme kostet kostbaren Akkustrom!). Ich denke auch das Thema "GrapKa" ist hier mit im Spiel (die Intel 530 läuft ja bei der ext. Monitornutzung immer, oder ?). Diesen Unterschied bei der Laufzeit kenne ich von meinem MBA 2011 mit einen DP-HDMI-Adapter (ohne 2. GrapKa) und einem DP-RJ45 (100 Mbit/Apple) so überhaupt nicht ... Daher relativiere ich für mich das Thema / Diskussion der Akkuleistung der neuen MBP. In der obigen Umgebung passt der Akku mit der wirklich langen Laufzeit für mich. tpau17 Kommentare macscout23.12.1603:01 Dazu passt ja dieser Bericht: New MacBook Pros Fail to Earn Consumer Reports Recommendation The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another. As a result, these laptops are the first MacBooks not to receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. Da gibt es auch riesige Unterschiede bei den Tests. Aber wenn man unterwegs ist, möchte man nicht Lotterie spielen, sondern eine halbwegs vorhersehbare Akku-Laufzeit haben. Andy8523.12.1606:14 ging geht auch andersrum aber ich habe aktuell auch keine Probleme; scheinbar mit der aktuellen beta (ich hab sie nicht drauf) soll es noch mal besser sein MacRudi23.12.1608:14 In dem Bericht steht, dass deshalb auch die Vorhersage der wahrscheinlichen Restnutzungsdauer eleminiert wurde. Wenn ein und das gleiche Szenario von 19,5 Stunden bis 4,5 Stunden Arbeitsdauer ergibt, dann ist da ja irgendwas am in die Suppe spucken. 19,5 Stunden zeugt ja jedenfalls schon mal, dass man eigentlich lange damit arbeiten kann, fragt sich bloß, wer ist der unbekannte Stromfresser, der die 4,5 Stunden bewirkt. „Entdecke die Möglichkeiten“ Hot Mac23.12.1608:20 Ich komme mit Mühe und Not auf vier Stunden. Allerdings hab ich auch die Helligkeit immer voll aufgedreht. „Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends!“ MacRudi23.12.1608:27 Da siehst Du, wofür das gut ist „Entdecke die Möglichkeiten“ tpau1723.12.1608:47 @Hot Mac: sind Adapter im Einsatz ? Ich vermute wirklich dass diese Teile große Stromverbraucher sind... derzeit läuft mein MBP ohne jeglichen Adapter und mit WLAN, 90% und 20:00 STd. lt. FruitJuice (okay wird die nächsten Stunden deutlich runter gehen, aber zweistellig bleibt es ganz sicher ohne einen Adapter) mit ca. 75% Helligkeit. Hot Mac23.12.1608:58 tpau17 @Hot Mac: sind Adapter im Einsatz ? Nein!

Co. Ltd.? This Fool takes a look at several risk factors that this chip giant faces. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 22, 2016 at 5:06PM Before investing in any company, it's important to have a solid understanding of how risky that investment is. This means understanding what factors could potentially drive the company's financial performance to come in worse than what the investment community at large might expect. Image source: Intel.  Although I am generally positive on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) long-term prospects, there's plenty that could go wrong for the chipmaker in the coming quarters or even years. Let's dig deeper into those potential risks. A mobile slowdown TSMC is the most popular contract chip manufacturer for mobile applications processors (APs), and many of the top mobile AP vendors rely on it to build their chips. The good news for TSMC is that it doesn't need to worry too much about share shifts among its customers; if its customers are winning business, it doesn't really matter to TSMC which one it is. The bad news is that, with 60% of its revenue coming from "communication" products (i.e., smartphones), it is extremely sensitive to the health of the broader smartphone market. If the smartphone market slows down (perhaps due to macroeconomic factors, or simply due to a saturation of the market), there's real risk to TSMC's financial performance. The impact of a significant, unplanned slowdown in smartphone sales would have two highly negative effects on TSMC's business. The first is that its revenue would simply be lower than planned, which naturally hurts profitability. Just as bad, if not more so, a major smartphone slowdown would likely lead to lower factory utilization rates for the company. Lower factory utilization means that the depreciation expenses that TSMC incurs -- which are based on fixed equipment/building depreciation schedules -- would be spread out across fewer silicon wafers. In effect, this would increase TSMC's cost structure per wafer, negatively impacting its gross profit margins. Potential market-share loss One risk that TSMC faces is that it could lose market segment share to competitors. TSMC doesn't operate alone in the world of contract chip manufacturing, and it will likely continue to face competition out in time. Right now, its main competitor in leading-edge technologies is Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and it has several competitors in mature technologies, including Samsung, Global Foundries, United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE: UMC), and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (NYSE: SMI). Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has also said that it's working to build out a contract chip business that offers leading-edge technologies as well. TSMC has done a good job fending off that competition, though. The company's market share at the 14/16-nanometer generation is already quite high, and the company is projecting market share increases at the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technology generations. In fact, there are now rumors that Samsung might spin-off its logic chip manufacturing business altogether, which could allow TSMC to further strengthen its position in higher-end technologies. For more mature technologies, TSMC has been aggressive in rolling out enhanced versions of those technologies to keep customers around -- a strategy that appears to be working as TSMC recently reported that utilization of its 28-nanometer factories is currently maxed out. An earthquake Per Wikipedia, Taiwan is "located in the Ring of Fire, making it prone to intense earthquakes." In Feb. 2016, Taiwan experienced a doozy of an earthquake, leading to the death of 117 individuals and the injury of 550 more. TSMC reported that the earthquake affected about 1% of its wafer shipments in the first quarter of 2016. Luckily, not a lot of equipment was damaged as a result, with TSMC spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun telling Taipei Times that its "initial estimate is that more than 95% of the tools can be fully restored to normal in two to three days." Nevertheless, because TSMC's 12-inch wafer fabs are located exclusively in Taiwan (and most of its eight-inch wafer fabs are in Taiwan as well), the company faces greater geological risks than some of its peers might. If an earthquake were to cause extensive damage to its production facilities, this could lead to product shortages. In the near term, such shortages could hurt revenues. Longer term, it might encourage once-loyal customers to seek out dual-sourcing options to minimize risk.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

I'd buy that MSI M7 (M9 will probably come out sooner or later) but I already have a 5960x on an Asus Rampage V Edition 10 board (and I also have an original MSI Godlike Gaming, a Godlike Gaming Carbon, and an MSI Xpower X99).

Image: Maura Hickey Having swapped the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for the Department of Education and Skills, Minister Richard Bruton, TD, reflects on the year that has passed in terms of Irish research. Last December, as Jobs Minister, I published Innovation 2020, together with An Taoiseach and Minister of State Damien English. Innovation 2020 is Ireland’s five-year strategy on research, development, science and technology. In it, we set out a roadmap for progressing our goal of making Ireland a global innovation leader, driving a strong, sustainable economy and a better society. Among the other ambitious targets to be delivered by the strategy are: The number of research personnel in enterprise will be increased by 60pc to 40,000. Research master’s and PhD enrolments will be increased by 30pc to 2,250. Private investment of R&D performed in the public research system will be doubled. 40pc increase in the share of PhD researchers transferring from Science Foundation Ireland research teams to industry. Ireland’s participation in international research organisations will be expanded – we became a full member of Elixir this year, and we will explore membership options for CERN and ESO. The network of research centres will be further developed, building critical mass and addressing enterprise needs. A successor to the programme for research in third-level institutions will be rolled out to include investment in the creation of new – and the maintenance and upgrading of existing – facilities and equipment and ensure full utilisation. €1.25bn funding under the EU framework programme Horizon 2020 will be drawn down. A new programme of funding for frontier research will be introduced, providing resilience and responsiveness to meet new challenges or opportunities as they emerge. Challenge-centric research to stimulate solutions-driven collaborations bringing together enterprise, higher-education institutions and public sector to identify and address national challenges. A formal horizon-scanning exercise has commenced to identify areas of strategic commercial opportunity for Irish-based enterprises. This process will feed into the next research prioritisation exercise in 2018. International benchmarking – we will benchmark Ireland’s performance in these areas against other comparable economies, and develop steps to improve our comparative performance. In recent years, we have built up a base of performance in innovation that has brought us into the top 10 of the international rankings. The aim now is to improve on this and truly make Ireland a global leader in this area. Innovation 2020 sets out a range of ambitious actions for delivering on this, and I am confident that we can deliver, with massive impact on our ability to grow the economy and create the jobs we need. Our ambition in this area has been reiterated in our Action Plan for Education, which aims to make the Irish education and training system the best in Europe within a decade. The Action Plan for Education aims to increase the numbers of funded postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers, as well as the initiation of a new programme of funding for frontier research across all disciplines. Irish Research Council The Irish Research Council (IRC) is central to ensuring we achieve our targets in relation to research and innovation. As 2016 draws to a close, I am delighted to reflect on the council’s achievements over the past 12 months, and I would like to congratulate all those involved in delivering another successful year for Ireland’s research community. This year, the Irish Research Council continued to support excellent, groundbreaking, important research – research that plays a vital role helping us, in Government, to address and tackle Ireland’s current and future challenges. 286 researchers received funding from the council under the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship and Postdoctoral Fellowship schemes. From developing personalised cancer treatments to studies on the genealogy of women in Irish theatre, these schemes are funding projects across all disciplines and helping to develop Ireland as a country rich in knowledge and skills. ‘These schemes are funding projects across all disciplines and helping to develop Ireland as a country rich in knowledge and skills’ 87 researchers were funded by the Irish Research Council under their Enterprise Partnership Scheme and Employment-Based Programmes in 2016. These programmes involve collaborations with a wide range of industry and NGO partners, including the likes of Boston Scientific, Kerry Group, Pfizer, Intel, the Gaelic Players’ Association, the Science Gallery and the Disability Federation of Ireland. Providing researchers with access to employment and supporting them to undertake research in an industry setting is key to delivering on our ambition of enriching the country’s pool of knowledge and expertise and competing at the highest levels on the international stage. Love Irish Research Building bridges between education, research, enterprise and the community is a key priority for me as Minister. Using innovative models and incentives to create these connections is vital. One of the achievements of the Irish Research Council this year was its #LoveIrishResearch campaign. This saw different research themes celebrated and promoted each month, and brought research very much into community settings, with the IRC holding special events to mark Culture Night, Science Week, the 1916 commemorations, and much more. We need to make sure that the general public values the role that research plays in driving our country’s success and recognises the groundbreaking work being done by researchers in Ireland. The #LoveIrishResearch campaign is playing a key role in this regard. ‘Building bridges between education, research, enterprise and the community is a key priority for me as Minister’ Looking to 2017, I predict another exciting year for Irish research. In Budget 2017, I announced funding for the new frontier research programme, which will be operated by the Irish Research Council. This initiative will help us, as a nation, to leverage further success in the international arena and will lead to exciting new breakthroughs and discoveries across diverse disciplines. As a Government, we want to ensure that Ireland’s ongoing economic recovery improves people’s lives. Research being supported by the Irish Research Council has the power to improve, enlighten and cultivate our society. By Richard Bruton, TD Fine Gael’s Richard Bruton, TD, was appointed Minister for Education and Skills in 2016 after serving as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the previous Government. He has been a TD since 1982 and represents the Dublin Bay North constituency. This article also appears on the Irish Research Council blog.

The video was released by news websites close to IS, and the two victims identify themselves as Turkish soldiers taken hostage. One of them had been reported kidnapped by Islamic State in Syria last year, and had been held in a prison in Raqqa, according to local media reports. Three Turkish soldiers were believed to be in the hands of Islamic State, though any information regarding their fate requires confirmation, Turkey’s Defense Minister Fikri Isik said Friday, according to state-run Anadolu Agency. “We have information that 3 of our soldiers are held by Daesh so far. Yes, we are evaluating that 3 of our soldiers are in the hands of Daesh,” Isik said. “However, any comments beyond that are not confirmed information. We say these information should not be respected without confirmation.” Turkish troops and opposition forces from Free Syrian Army have captured a strategic hill from Islamic State overlooking the northern Syrian town of al-Bab, Isik said. Earlier, Anadolu reported that 31 suspected Islamic State members were detained in raids in Istanbul on Friday. Another 10 suspected members of the group couldn’t be located, it said. The release of the footage comes amid a rising casualty count in Syria for Turkey, which has had 35 soldiers killed since the military started a cross-border operation in August.

Reuters/Lucas Jackson Microsoft will launch the Surface Phone sometime in 2017 but it may not be during the Mobile World Congress (MWC) from Feb. 27 to March 2. However, tech enthusiasts and fans should not be disappointed as the MWC 2017 will be a key event in the build up of the Surface Phone launch. This is mainly because Windows 10 will be the primary focus and Nadella with his team can support one of its long-standing hardware partners. Windows 10 performance will be massively upgraded in the second half of 2017 as the Redstone 3 update is arriving that time. This could be the main feature in the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017. Along with this, the handset will sport some premium specs and exquisite styling, writes Forbes. The phone can even rival Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has already hinted that the company is developing the ultimate mobile device. Thus, tech enthusiasts have to wait till the handset is released. Till then, the Windows 10 Mobile flag has to be carried the conventional way via Microsoft's hardware partners. The Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 may run full desktop-bound Windows 10 apps. As per Digital Trends, the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 could come in three variants - a consumer model, a business model, and an “enthusiast” model, a high-spec version for tech geeks. This cannot be confirmed at the moment though many believe the Surface Phone 2017 could have a 64GB internal storage and 4GB RAM option and a 128GB internal storage and 6GB RAM option. Other rumoured specs of the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 include Intel Kaby Lake chipset, 20MP rear camera with Carl Zeiss lens and Surface Pen. The handset will be able to rival any other top releases in 2017 including Samsung Galaxy S8, Note 8 and Apple iPhone 8.

The company will use the cash that it receives through Cash on Delivery (CoD) to operate this facility, it said in a media statement. “As the country transitions to a more digitally-enabled economy, we’ve launched a series of timely initiatives – from wallet and card on delivery, to extending FreeCharge partnerships to smoothen this transition. The launch of the cash on demand service is intended to further help our consumers tide over any cash crunch that they might face in addressing their daily needs,” said Rohit Bansal, co-founder, Snapdeal. At the time of cash delivery, the customers will need to swipe their ATM card on the PoS machine, which Snapdeal’s courier partners will carry for all such deliveries. The company will charge a nominal amount of Rs 1 as convenience fee, which the users will need to pay through FreeCharge wallet or through a debit card at the time of booking the order. For the service, a user can request Rs 2,000 per booking and any bank’s ATM card can be used to pay for the cash. The company said the customers are not obligated to order anything else from Snapdeal to access the “Cash@Home” facility. The company added that the service is currently active in Gurgaon and Bengaluru and will be extended to other major cities in the coming days. Last month, The Economic Times reported that Future Group’s Big Bazaar had tied up State Bank of India (SBI) to help consumers withdraw cash from mini-ATMs across 260 stores. Last week, Gurgaon-based hyper-local delivery startup Grofers partnered with YES BANK to deliver cash to customers across three cities – Mumbai, Gurgaon and Bengaluru. Snapdeal, founded in 2010, has been trying to cut costs and focus more on profitability. In August, VCCircle reported that Snapdeal has initiated preliminary talks with staunch rivals Flipkart and Amazon to explore a possible merger. Snapdeal has raised around $1.65 billion from about two dozen investors. These include SoftBank and SoftBank-backed Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, Taiwanese contract electronics maker Foxconn, global online marketplace eBay Inc., the ad-for-equity investment arm of Indian media firm Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd, and venture capital investors such as Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital and Kalaari Capital. SoftBank had led a $627 million round of investment in the company in late 2014 followed by another round of $500 million last year. Last month, Softbank pared down the value of its investment in the e-commerce platform as well as in cab-hailing company Ola. Like this report?

The Twitter account is back under Netflix's control, but the incident reminded me that people routinely have their own Netflix accounts hacked, and many don't know. Just a few weeks ago, a colleague of mine noticed some suspicious viewing activity of the TV show "Arrow" on her Netflix, and figured out her account had been compromised. Netflix lets multiple people use an account at the same time, and this feature is great when it allows you to mooch off a friend’s account without inconveniencing them. But one problem with this policy is that it has inadvertently created a black market for “access” to stolen Netflix accounts. A report by McAfee Labs last year revealed you can buy access to Netflix accounts in “Dark Web” marketplaces, which can only be accessed using a special internet browser called TOR that hides your computer's digital footprint, known as an IP address. Hackers in these marketplaces are selling lifetime access to Netflix accounts for as little as $0.50. While some of these accounts are likely purchased with stolen credit card information, others used hacked login information, Raj Samani, the CTO of Intel Security, told Tech Insider. And sometimes hackers don't even sell the stolen accounts, but rather, just dump the login credentials on the internet for people to use. Luckily, there's an easy ways to check if you've been hacked, and fix it. Here's how:  View As: One Page Slides First, log into your Netflix and go to the "Your Account" section. Business Insider Then check your viewing activity. Business Insider If you see some suspicious activity there, you can check out your recent account access. Note that since your viewing activity can be modified (you can "x" out certain things), if you think your Netflix has been hacked, go to recent account access even if there isn't unusual viewing. Business Insider Here you'll be able to see all the places your account has been accessed from. If you don't recognize any of them, it's likely your account has been hacked. Business Insider If it has been there's an easy fix. Navigate back to your settings and choose "Sign out of all devices." Business Insider This will kick everyone who is logged into your account off. Then you can change your password, and they won't be able to get back in. Business Insider Once you've done that, you should try and figure out how you were hacked. A good place to start is haveibeenpwned.com. Haveibeenpwned.com gives you a rough idea of whether your personal information has been leaked onto the internet. Last year, when writing about her Netflix account being hacked, a Motherboard writer found that her family’s login info had appeared on Pastebin, a site for dumping plaintext files, in a document with the title “BunchaNetflixAccounts.” The information from 2,400 other users had also been compromised. My colleague also found out, via haveibeenpwned.com, that some of her accounts had been compromised in a data dump. She then knew it was wise to change her passwords on more than just her Netflix.

You can deputy who took them. Talk Sports Radio telling you we. Our 7 o'clock. Or 77 in Boston it's Friday and Alex. I was sort of hoping like. A access Ayers thing on the acronym that's it's. AT. That. I like treading gay guys. Adding text to the art or leaves me out that's not there you're talking point. It's a pain was after world comes ready token not hurt I liked about the token throw in girl thrown about another month. Less than him and Donald. OK no more right always straight like guys can send back to prominence act now where you're times I can't Callahan.

You know hides behind Jerry's Jerry. Though that's a but guys you know job critic feels axle work grosses mixture. So yes I was always here somehow he's now the white guys just less than them. And Ella market to rise again don't worry about the Gramm. Made maker is. It just you know. Actually what is its second I want money. Because I'm not famous and rich and that's with Errol there. Our callers. Asked do you still missing and room. I mean Michael like lots to do that I'm going to be able to me he's famous and so. Dynamic media pass out it's a good job and it just bill Belichick's legacy here. We'll Belichick obviously is no problem not sitting at trump on endorsement. Not Bill Belichick cool with extreme view buys in cool wait sexual it's this one there though. Mature at all. I feel like as a member of the patriots organization I'm just stepped in the little. May have crossed the line there'll extreme. As cross the line Steve is out according to call street's steepest hits at a Alec I like it used by its enemies of this is a Korey Rowe host Laura and I love it I'll second Stephen attract. Laughter from Steve. Well joining what you said is is made a lot of sense also any that Alex. Can ask you if you averaged ribbon. After a few drinks as that's just a question you're kidnapped anybody but. We all know that a lot of us to dump danger we shouldn't do little right and shouldn't have done and we just get very. We've been very fortunate that real rocky. And what anybody to judge somebody that got caught and it got caught we got lucky he didn't get caught. Where it and hopefully what Smart enough to know not to take get a chance to give me a look at a window and realize. I did get caught by the unit judge somebody and you I guess so. Hell bent on making this man out to be such a monster. When you know what he did was wrong. And when we do that we're wrong we don't know. Anybody who drives drunk or anybody who drives after drinking with the these things we have out there right at out disposal burn everything like that no excuse no. DP got hot though because he was tossed out. At a stoplight I think. And you would have thought he weighs 220. Right would act out at least twenty drinks avid BAC at that level I admit I've probably driven when I shouldn't. Drinker to two men I have never driven when I've had twenty drinks like this guy up there. Do you believe I drive the trucks and not that I'm only allowed to be a barrel OJ so good you'll imagine maybe. Abby. How much acreage rights what do you think yeah. 217. Steve this is as her dream that EU wide. And he could serve 45 days in prison produce steam it's not your run of the mill. He was why don't want to honest. I'm upset about is you know judging somebody does something. No go. Steve we've not all done this we have not all passed out at a stoplight a daily has let me just add something great call Steve. Like passion La. Russa. Remembered constituent I do. It was I believe in Arizona protects and he passed out at a stop you know it is BAC woods. Give it to me point 093. Barely above. The legal limit of point away same situation same exact thing he passed out didn't hit anybody didn't kill anybody could have right. And his blood alcohol level was a third of what Lloyd's was so that's my point. You're breaking the law you're doing something that could kill them but either way back yeah I don't alert after that I oldest when he orders. Six the two aren't anybody at Wallace 62 had so now you're bringing eight yes OK if your age matters as well as the sport to twenty. I'm 27 year old at all I don't know. I think he's 61 now I'm I'm pilot I mean we can't do what you say that would recite theme required. That recently asked a question that you brought an age doesn't age matter on the other side. It was a no better. Oh the body 63 years to learn his lessons as opposed to 25 with a lot that I would say that the body at 63 op probably response I'll call a bit differently in the body of the twenty DiPietro practiced or technical spouse I did look better. I think like like Andy's point pre app goes back to when you don't seated video don't have would be basically that there's good reason I perceive that. It was terrible remember. The whole like eakins the output I grew and then right at the audio button but go back to aids. My first initial reaction to its knees. That you don't see eight dies it doesn't come across as severe it's easy all action will be and I think a lot of advocates Mothers Against Drunk Driving those people are they would say absolutely talking about asking these apps to be why they don't need necessarily be. Point 21 the he was asleep when they were getting older like how different would these calls the if Michael Floyd one eyes. Hot you know shooting dine at an intersection. Where. You know hitting his girlfriend hitting his wife hitting out having different calls and different receipt of these patriots or G and it the team's nine I mean I mean let's be clear on. The eyes pictures and the credit and I don't I don't now they have like the pre is just let out that I'm. I like I love your iPod. I just I feel like this the reason that this is different is the highs and so many people park all. Being. What happened Michael Floyd is that all of us have been in this situation if it ever never. Anybody in my entire life. Like I've ever really hauled off and really hit my sister and Brothers. In my fight Paul hare orbit. So can you drop down. But I never never hit and never hit child I've never been involved in domestic. Violence that it. All of us are. At too much injury time real car most. Don't sit well hell I would never again attorney would you would you be in a situation where you were so inebriated Buick. I would hope Alex eye opener when I think back to some of the things that I did in my early early early when he was totally. Plus I don't know that would pass I don't know what I myself am I not have. Excusing his action. And at about like mothers against driving it very careful how we talk about is because people who have lost loved ones. They don't bets and there should be zero town that's because it's awful it's terrible. But again I think the reason people are more apt to say this isn't passing year this is it whites. This isn't the same as some of the other things that happened and yet felt the great parties that rate rice's aides Peterson is because all of us at some level unit that cost personally know someone who's at a DUI. Most as bad position to date. A mistake and that's why people are a little more. And I also think. The NFL sometimes gets in trouble with a you can criticize them or accept it. What bill said it's an ongoing legal situations sometimes they just fall back on we're gonna let that play out and see what the legal system does in. You know what you are all worked up about this I think you should also be worked up should I be on the street if you think this is the heinous issue and how many times you hear that. The you know this guy had eleven do you lies and ultimately on the twelfth or this person was free on the island that only half front when it got him where it do you bylaws are discussed so. And and that was sort of what bill was following back onto it would that we are rare situation we're not gonna comment on an on going legal and how you you know all the time it's it's. In easy out on time but I admit that time point used as this happened on them Monday December 12 you sign is here there's data fifteenth. Three days late and and at my place at Varian Jenkins who did the same thing with the jets that I's dotted potentially catching passes in this game on Saturday who. Within days of a DUI lost their jobs gained jobs immediately I didn't make it any less reprehensible. I I recently I was in second at an archery she was that it happens across the total and that there's no I go back to it I mean. We're not all agree on how to patriots probably should have held so you would not have touched is that let's just get that out I would. Would not talk I probably wind up just because now or ever. Now just I would outlook on optics of it right like everybody passes out of except for you but if everybody passed them on this in the spring. Say he didn't get claimed. And you know he entered rehab facility made sort of show that with the attorney or whatever and it's mid march. He indoor facility would change no one has signed. And you're like. Signing Michael. The patriots and the re how we cows out Leon one million dollar one Europe every have the rehab if you would go to rehab that would change at army. That that would because that would at least be. Thank critical back to again it didn't come out right away came over the weekend Michael Pitt well. Talked about how part again despite lip service cart office two wide Atlanta and now it sentencing hee-seop on the field we can't say that it was lack of remorse we lose six million dollars if we can save one point to let her know I was really disappointed with how he handled his approach to the game in his approach to conditioning and and anyway not to say that he didn't seem remorseful after everything that happened it story chain story changed it might take responsibility. Those things to be as those tea Ito started to emerge also viewed this differently beat highs. To me again you're feeding into this entitlement you're feeding into that I clearly needs help and now does it feel necessarily now maybe that's what license Michael Floyd wine. He got a promotes. He got a better job. Because of this now like it's the way that's all right bring it out and he gets to go to the playoffs and maybe that's a big catch BS that they divisional round game. And he'll make money off of this and he did not. And appears that this is so pervasive in the NFL with these players from viewers why did thirty other teams pass up a clearly more count the wide receiver ball to ran. Right but they're also most teams don't wanna rent them there are most outlets are out of the playoff cheat too and could use another big play wide receiver sir I did they sign him. That's a requirement patriots the only team and what my point is I think you're right the chiefs are in yeah I think there's probably six teams eight teams that would be even considered at the others say. I can just sign him in the spring I want in my season's over this year and one point two. And the other I just wanna throw this out there because of her a lot of people talk about this. And just for the whole story the whole compensatory pick thing which. Is part of it I guess I don't know but you know a lot of the sort of cap geeks in rank. If the patriots. Picked him up off waivers and then he leaves as freeagent he counts as part of their compensatory pick formula so they could get a fourth round selection so you can essentially by by their pay a million but outside those compensatory fourth round it can trade him now to bury. Draft weekend entry follow patrons. Actually it will not as Spain. And equip the world traveler tree. Let's go to the phone line it's it's like I. Well she struggles with a because well microphone is one place I. Yes they hit weighed over I got gadget are I was sad not go go gadget but I can't point out that I actually use this out here. You pick up our futuristic even know go go gadget I go out I figured yet yo you know inspector at. What does that mean you don't watch cartoons. Yes it had evidence Alex cartoon and a child and certainly a lot I ravaged house not actually. Looks like it is Alex rab get more. Our. Guys know no borders Kabul but. Not. You know Scott and and an important. What we're haven't. Yet so. White tracked well all football you don't eat more that's why. I mean it's a stern call. Just bought it it's no where as I. On its well what our problem. All the problem or it's. Not a lot it will not at. All. And I overstep the ear that. It's about how elsewhere. And I went curable. While I don't know it's fair to say that ain't so hot that of course it. I think that's a bit of belief that how could you watch that video and say this guy that we need a Ares read that passes for is he better here under the programs that they have an NFL after every NFL team has programs in the director of player while law and they approach bill brought that up yesterday everybody in the organization can get the help they need wheeled bag ba. Blah blah. But isn't that better than. Mean he could potentially be sitting in some apartment somewhere well I go back and how are effective and well but in a week for six years five years. How can we say that the programs not mean you have no idea how many people helped discuss one guy get another do you rank up there. Are there are obviously not helpful for this. People like guys are our program at a 100% helpful for alcoholics or drug addicts or in my notes I don't know how much of the programs required I didn't like wraps eyes that you know we have these. If you violate the substance abuse policy and now he gets suspended. You would know better I is also a contingent that suspension and it says jury next time you need you are were wired. Again. I do not know I mean I don't know that it's already been priest facing a two game suspension based on because exits the invulnerable. So immediate area but certainly the union is probably not gonna fight for a guy to not make you mildly of course they'll ever and claimed by I've ever and has their interests out of politics interest is on football I mean you know wrecks but think Michael Floyd goes to you know coach. I know we have a team meeting her position meeting today by you know you really need to meet up with a counselor something. When it's shared goal I think you would you do eat it cutesy to miss out on the item on a meeting yeah. Before that what that situation offer to a counts yes I do and he would say and I expect to be back here at eleven tonight. We've your position coach making up for that lost time. Water resources to do with us. And I I and he lot of guys skip the entire offseason of the Olympics because he felt it was something that was important to him and he trusted the guy to make up the time and come back in need Abner. I think you're underestimating how much. A compassionate Bill Belichick as to his actual not to us. Not to general strangers not to meet united health but his players I I think your yeah I like I put a lot of Ted Johnson disagree. Will Johnson would disagree that he had issues playing time in a lot going. You know Ted Johnson a lot of skeletons an all out well what I don't think Bill Belichick has their their teachers coaches put players on the field of people act out there for me it's okay itself. Let's not pretend that he's this great he's great humanitarian. I said he would not allow guys to go now to an alcohol counseling meeting I think that is wrong and you don't know that I don't know that for sure I think the conflict with football he would say you're here appointment I think your girls with us at minute a man. And there day. I'm just I I can tell you bill has vehemently. Vehemently. Come out and said. In the past when people say stuff like that there's nothing I care about more than my players and I I'd buy it I don't buy everything he says I'm not gonna tell you when you go to the podium that. Griff Whalen for Michael Floyd was just to swap receivers that's all it is I don't buy everything. But I do think he cares about his players I think it's hard to be in that position and not on some level about you. Again and I go back to witnesses at a personal attack on Bill Belichick page if I look at the and a pilot hole and I think that the falcons to a better job. Implementing. Regulations that say if somebody gets in trouble if you get a DUI if you have a past that this is something that is required of you. To play football well you can go to another team I just to me and I felt sort of and I know these people are adults and they can make their own decisions. But they're also. Human beings and I think that the way to the NFL is constructed it. You hear me and yet like these weird looking. Pops in my year coming inviting create ethnic studio up and running today again it did beat team got a dollar and hot tested out yesterday it's good for us. I had. You battery could be dying in that's the problem arose the battery is not dying I don't have the island. And appointed. Policy of the nose in. The batteries for the in. This is terrible. As our ticket costs that. What does that that would cut out of the break up my point is I think that and I said to be getting I think and found no pun intended drops the ball all the time. I'm ways that they can better help their players BA getting on a field in pumping ample drugs and making sure that they're out there at no cost. You know having a guy you get the DY get suspended for substance abuse problem is it that it's not part of bear rehab part of their their suspension that they have to get help. I think their could be Sam. Rules in place that are for the betterment of the entire player and I just don't think I don't maybe I don't and it's not that big Bill Belichick cares I think the end now as a whole as an institution. Especially that park avenue office because they don't act these guys daily does not care about these guys all are more worried about money in the product on the field. And Michael Floyd could possibly make the patriots better could make a more dynamic and so they don't care. That that that's my opinion. Heard a click that and see. Guys are at a time until let's integrate a graphics are forgot my knowing how to how to better use my engineer this pretty engineer ran headphones and I would clicks are in the headlines are next train by the way it's teased. It is a way to predict who told that it's true that little birdie told mean might you aren't headline that time and I repeat it does have. 730. Is that what headlines all year it was just you know helping to set the table you know now should she feels like she's backed into a corner now were attacked you you should know decision on the well I feel like I feel like they should have told me in my and it's a vicious meaning he'll listen. I do but I don't listen to. Some headlines in your mind to be 1 o'clock at night when your media byters have. Headlines or when I get up in the morning and I listen to this on the podcast because I do not get up but I can assure you I rarely up at 7:30 in the morning.

There had lives and our proxy eighteen mobilizing you know our world real quick trip real headline yesterday. Answer the Indians well it wouldn't speak. Or Smart parts of Kirk and Al let's listen to mornings ago in New England.

Again maybe 20% after decade and you so at bats to get them it's it's really sort disrespectful it's home ice you do they're taking advantage of them I think maybe.

And longer by the minute to same apparent there definitely places he could probably go to make of this us. It's O and. The studio to some. Copies they don't think straight out a football field would be would be the place no and the reason we are talking about south pleasure is because these C security guard has been fired with the chargers because it does here in the hot and Desmond says security. Art appears to be after beating your cheerleaders during the chargers gave it seems is that I don't think it seems as if they got is whacking off and he's clearly done before because. If you look at the video is not straight on the front of the pants. Aside pocket which means that he is. A hole in his pot and hit it pleasurable in his own pocket to take your. A glory holes. Where we eat is nicely in my hands is just it's like. It's funny it's also super disturbing that this is just a ball field and this pants. Rob off with the cheerleaders like we've seen I actually look at this big white. Beads just year thing it's not just the cheerleaders there's a note the chargers games that it is doubtful. There are 60000 people are watching and clearly people in the front row eight. We're obviously saw Dutch player that you respected now cents a no reason. It is now guy is so brazen he's going to rub one out. In front as he says 60000. People maybe that's part of my heart I assumed it was the cheerleaders that were. The track but it might mean much more than that feud that's why don't like and I don't. Find him. Admirable OK because I think that's probably I mean it's just like at the precursor other TV like if you. And sport you're futures are illegal acts this is like this is like a guy who eighties lived. In Milwaukee. There was a and it was like halfway house or something. In Montana was like standing waiting for a friend at an apartment booked up and I was staring down meat is taken its talent.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Dec 22, 2016 at 11:00AM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report a net loss this year, making 2016 the fifth consecutive year that AMD has failed to turn a profit. 2017 is shaping up to be better for AMD, with the launch of its new Ryzen CPUs and high-end Vega GPUs on the horizon. The success of those products will determine whether AMD will return to profitability next year and beyond. AMD investors are no doubt looking forward to 2017, and the company made some good moves this year that have improved its chances of success. The balance sheet is stronger and its prospects are brighter thanks to AMD's best moves of 2016. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. A year of dealmaking At the end of the first quarter of 2016, AMD's balance sheet was looking stretched. The company's cash balance was barely above $700 million, near the low end of its target range, and debt topped $2.2 billion. Book value had plunged to negative $500 million thanks to years of losses. In April, AMD sold its semiconductor assembly and test assets into a joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, retaining a 15% stake and receiving about $320 million in cash, net of taxes and other expenses. This deal provided AMD with some much-needed cash as it was preparing to launch Polaris, its mainstream-orientated GPU. Around the same time, AMD signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. to form another JV, this one focused on bringing x86 server SoCs to the Chinese server market. AMD licensed its high-performance processor and SoC technology to the JV, receiving a $293 million licensing payment with the potential for additional royalty payments in the future. These two deals greatly strengthened AMD's balance sheet, giving it the necessary resources to forge ahead with its turnaround plan. Taking advantage of investor euphoria Shares of AMD have soared this year, driven higher by optimism that the company's new products will drive revenue and earnings growth. The stock is up nearly 300% year to date, reflecting an extreme shift in investor sentiment. AMD data by YCharts. AMD took advantage of its soaring stock price in August when it announced that it was selling $600 million of new shares of its common stock, along with $700 million of 2.125% notes. The company planned to use the proceeds to knock down some of its debt, thus reducing its annual interest payments and making the path to profitability a little bit easier. AMD paid $160 million in interest payments in 2015. AMD now has $1.26 billion of cash on its balance sheet, and it has reduced its total debt to about $1.63 billion. The company's financial situation, precarious earlier this year, is now much stronger, giving it the resources to launch its new CPUs and GPUs next year. Existing investors were diluted by the stock sale, but they should be thrilled that AMD used the opportunity to raise cash. A win in the cloud For those wanting to utilize graphics cards in the cloud, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has long been the only real option. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud all offer NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs exclusively. The company's focus over the past few years on deep learning and GPU compute has paid off. NVIDIA's data center business is nearing a $1 billion annual revenue run rate, with third-quarter sales nearly tripling year over year. AMD's GPUs aren't available on any of those platforms, and it's fallen far behind NVIDIA in the market for accelerators. An analyst at Nomura estimates that NVIDIA controls 80% of the accelerator market, with AMD and Intel fighting for the scraps. Image source: Google. AMD made some headway in 2016. Alphabet's Google announced in November that it planned to offer AMD's FirePro GPUs through its cloud platform, along with NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs as well. While this is win for both AMD and NVIDIA, it narrows the gap a little between the two companies. AMD built on this momentum with the announcement of Radeon Instinct in December, the company's upcoming line of graphics cards built specifically for deep learning. The company is playing catch-up in this area, but the potential opportunity to accelerate A.I. workloads is significant. NVIDIA is still the undisputed leader in the accelerator market, but AMD made some noise in 2016. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

In a telephone interview with EE Times after Micron's Q1 2017 conference call, he noted that other vendors, particularly Samsung, have struggled with 3D NAND, whereas Micron appears to making good progress. Micron's transition time is going to be longer than other technologies because they have to buy new equipment. That includes whole new factory in Singapore, noted Handy. There's something that eluded everyone else that Micron seems to have got right. He speculates that its decision to use a floating gate process might have been a factor, as other vendors went the charge trap route. I wouldn't be at all surprised that Micron has shown everyone the need to go with floating gate instead of charge trap." Micron CEO Mark Durcan said Micron exceeded the guidance provided in its fall update, which was when accelerated market conditions began, and prices have been strengthening across all segments for the company. This is trend is expected to continue into the next quarter. As a result of current industry conditions, Durcan said Micron expects 2017 supply bit growth for DRAM to be in the 15%-20% range under the assumption that suppliers won't add significant wafer capacity. In the longer term, bit demand growth is forecast at approximately 20%-25%. On the NAND front, Micron anticipates 2017 supply bit growth in the high 30% to low 40% range; this takes in mind the impact of 3D NAND conversions, said Durcan. In the longer term, the company expects bit demand growth of approximately 40%-45%. From a dollars and sense perspective, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $3.97 billion and were 23% higher compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 19% higher compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Micron attributes the jump in revenues of 23% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was due primarily to 18% and 26% increases in DRAM and trade NAND sales volumes, respectively, and a 5% increase in DRAM average selling prices. Micron's prototype SSDs with 3D Xpoint memory chips on a PCIe Gen 3 interface handle writes at less than 20 microseconds and reads and less than 10 ms, ten times faster than existing NAND SSDs, but so far, there's no product actually shipping. In a nutshell life is good," said Handy of the overall picture Micron painted. It is largely because of market conditions." He did note that NAND GB shipments jumped 26% quarter over quarter. That's an annual growth rate of 152% if they were to keep it up. Given that they see market growth as 30-40% per year this is really high," he said. It will work out to a big increase in market share for them for the quarter. This is probably attributable to their steep 3D NAND ramp." Other highlights for Micron were its embedded business, where it serves the growing automotive demand for memory. Meanwhile, its Mobile Business Unit was up 54%, which Handy noted was high compared to other business units that were up 13-18%. This is clearly much more than a shortage-driven phenomenon. Micron continues to highlight its diversification and how that's healthy for its business. Handy said the company would prefer not be dependent on the cycles that come with being in the DRAM business, but added that the NAND business isn't any less prone to ups and downs. The long qualification cycles in the automotive sector works well for them, he added. Micron is not saying the cycles will go away, but its corporate structure is able to make it less abusive." While it would appear that Micron has a handle on its DRAM (including its conversion to 1X) and NAND, it didn't provide specifics on its 3D XPoint technology. Durcan said the company is talking to a number of different customers, but won't commit to what the end market is for the technology it developed with Intel, although storage, data center and mobile are all candidates. Two or three years in, it will over time cannibalize part of the DRAM business." Handy said Micron needs to have a shippable product, as well as a market for it. Both of those need to happen. Intel can create a market for 3D XPoint, he said, but if the technology doesn't go anywhere it won't be all that detrimental to Micron. It will be business as usual." After this quarter ended, Micron closed its acquisition of Inotera Memories Inc., which the company said will improve its strategic and financial results going forward. —Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.
