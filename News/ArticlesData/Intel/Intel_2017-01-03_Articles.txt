Skip to main content PC Games news and reviews from PCGamesN.com Reviews Hardware About Intel|4 January 2017 Intel Core i5 7600K review: Kaby Lake’s overclocking hero and new gaming king By Dave James If I’m being honest the new Kaby Lake launch has been a bit of a damp squid. I’m aware that’s not the traditional phrasing, but the new Intel Core i7 7700K bears more relation to a soggy cephalopod than it does a firecracker. As ever though, for us gamers, it’s the cheaper Core i5 which is arguably more interesting and the i5 7600K right now is looking like the go-to Kaby Lake chip for gaming. A good solid state drive can make a big difference to your machine’s performance, so check out our guide to the best SSDs for gaming. I rarely give a pair of fetid dingo’s kidneys about a new Core i7 unless it’s got more cores in it than a boozy West Country cider. And so it has come to pass with the new Kaby Lake Core i7 - it’s a frickin’ yawn-fest. A CPU generation’s K-series i5 however is still able to deliver almost identical levels of gaming performance but for a significantly reduced price. And the same is true here, with the 7600K at $243 (£230) being over $100 cheaper than the 7700K. Click on the jump links below to get to your favourite techie bits quick. Intel Core i5 7600K benchmarks Intel Core i5 7600K performance Intel Core i5 7600K verdict Intel Core i5 7600K specs As it’s a Core i5 processor the big difference between it and the i7 is its lack of HyperThreading. Intel’s HyperThreading allows a single CPU core to process two threads simultaneously, giving it greater multithreaded grunt than it would normally possess. That means, while the Core i7 7700K is able to effectively operate with eight virtual cores, the Core i5 7600K has to make do with only four actual cores. If you’re doing a lot of CPU-intensive media work, such as image manipulation or video/3D rendering, those extra processing threads make a huge amount of difference, but when you’re talking about gaming, not so much. We may be living in a world where games consoles have many, many CPU cores but still our games benefit most from having really good single-threaded throughput. That’s why AMD’s previous processor architecture foundered so badly - Bulldozer hedged its bets on a multithreaded future which still hasn’t quite happened - and why Intel still rules the roost in terms of the best CPUs for gaming. Like the i7 Kaby Lake chip, the i5 7600K has also had a relatively healthy speed bump over its predecessor. The Skylake version runs at 3.5GHz out of the box, with a 3.9GHz Turbo, while this Kaby Lake chip starts at 3.8GHz and Turbos up to 4.2GHz. Straight away that gives the new chip an advantage. Though the same could be said for the rival Kaby and Skylake i7 chips, and look how that turned out… Elsewhere it’s much the same story as with the previous generation’s i5. It’s still rocking a 91W TDP, 6MB of cache and the same socket and memory compatibility configuration. As it’s a Kaby Lake chip though it does come with the new media engine inside it, which means you can now stream 4K content from Netflix to your PC. If you get the upgraded Netflix sub, have a 4K monitor and remember to use the Edge browser.  The Edge browser. The one Windows keeps telling you to use. No, it’s not Internet Explorer. Well, it kind of is. Anyway, it’s the only one that’s allowed to talk to Netflix’s 4K catalogue, so just use it for that and don’t blame us. The i5 7600K also has some CPU graphics silicon inside it too, but we’ve all got graphics cards in our PCs, right? So we can pretty much ignore that right now… Intel Core i5 7600K benchmarks   Intel Core i5 7600K performance Inevitably the straight CPU performance of the Core i5 7600K is off the pace compared with the much more expensive, eight-threaded i7 7700K, but because of its relatively high out-of-the-box clockspeed it’s mighty close in terms of single-threaded grunt. That higher clockspeed also means it’s got the jump on its i5 6600K predecessor.  Those single-threaded performance numbers here are key when you shift focus to the gaming performance of the 7600K. Because the i5 performs so closely to the i7 when it’s prioritising a single thread the gaming frame rate difference is, to all intents and purposes, invisible. Even in the CPU-aware DX12 and Vulkan APIs it’s difficult to discern any variation in gaming performance. The synthetic Time Spy DirectX 12 benchmark does though highlight the disparity on the CPU side, with the i5 7600K showing a much lower CPU score than the i7 7700K. Maybe when games are built from the ground up for DX12 the differences will become more stark in frame rate terms, but until then why would you, as a gamer, need an i7? There are, however, obvious differences when it comes to the relative storage performance of the two CPUs. When plumbed into the system’s PCIe bus the sequential speeds are almost identical, but when you look at the random write performance there is a drop-off with the i5. The Core i5 7600K is also a touch slower in terms of compressing and unpacking a mixed media folder. Where things get more exciting is in the overclocking stakes. This is more like it. This is what we were hoping for from the 14nm+ lithography of Kaby Lake. Without the HyperThreading of the i7 7700K our Core i5 7600K blasted past the 5GHz mark with ease. Our sample ran all the way up to a rock-solid 5.1GHz, only tapping out when we pushed it up towards 5.2GHz - and even then it was still booting. Looking at the 5.1GHz Time Spy benchmark you can see the differences between the two Kaby Lake K-series chips really shrink down. That is though all at the expense of the thermals. Realistically you’re not going to want your expensive silicon to be running at 99°C for long… That’s where features like the Overclocking Temperature Control in the Asus TUF Z270 Mark 1 motherboard really comes into its own. Intel Core i5 7600K verdict The Kaby Lake generation isn’t going to set the world alight the way some of Intel’s previous chips have done. Rather than Process>Architecture>Optimisation it’s seeming a little more like Process>Architecture>Flog horse. The tertiary optimisation phase of Intel’s CPU release cadence is more about consolidation than anything else; certainly not innovation. But the Core i5 7600K still has more about it than the superbly uninspiring i7 7700K. The price is right, the gaming performance is there and it’s able to overclock like a champ. Sure, if you’re sitting on an i5 from any of the last couple of generations you’re not going to gain much from making the upgrade switch, but if you’re starting from scratch then the i5 7600K is great place to build from. You can bet there are going to be some impressive pre-overclocked full rigs released with the 7600K at their hearts. The caveat here though is that if you’re starting from scratch I’d personally be sitting on the fence to wait and see what AMD’s Ryzen CPUs are going to deliver when they finally launch. Normally that technological wait-and-see approach means you're always waiting for the next big thing, but these times are unprecedented - AMD could genuinely bring something worthwhile to the CPU table, and very soon too. The eight-core, 16-thread chip is likely to go head-to-head with the i7, and there’s also going to be an i5-rivalling quad-core, eight-thread Ryzen which could well give the 7600K a real run for its money. But AMD’s Ryzen is still a largely unknown quantity. We’ve seen the demos, the leaked benchmarks and the marketing hype, but until we can put the Intel and AMD chips up against each other on our own test bench I won’t be satisfied. What we do know though is that if you were looking to build an affordable, but high-end, gaming PC right now, you’d want to be sticking a Core i5 7600K inside it. And overclocking the nuts off it too. Intel| Hardware| CPU| Try these free to play games ?

My original Z170 stock-clocked scores vs. the 7600K's Z270 numbers show Cinebench R15 results of 162 against 178 and 582 against 658 for single threaded and multi-threaded performance. The X264 v5 encoding numbers are 14.98fps vs. 16.15fps. The overclocking numbers are 4.8GHz and 5.1GHz for maximum stable OC frequency. Having that extra headroom and slight efficiency/temperature improvements of the 14nm+ architecture (and essentially similar pricing) makes the 7600K the overall better CPU. 1 Reply using your Steam account 29 BJDUK 1 Week ago Aiming to buy a new PC, but doing so during CES... 0 Reply using your Steam account 139 Dave James 1 Week ago Hehe, yeah it just keeps throwing out little nuggets that make you go 'oh, hold on, if I just wait...' 1 Reply using your Steam account Sign in Intel Core i7 6800K reviewIntel Core i7 7700K reviewIntel Core i5 7600K reviewIntel Kaby Lake - all you need to knowBest CPU for gaming Clicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.

The German automaker will put 40 of its 7 Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7 Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. Automakers and technology companies are rushing to form partnerships to compete against the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has clocked 2 million self-driving miles on public roads, and Tesla Motors Inc., with 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles. BMW is appealing to other carmakers to adopt its approach to help shoulder research costs, speed development by sharing data and ensure they don’t become also-rans. “Those who reach the finish line before you will have their tech become the basis of standardization,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. “This is why sharing is important.” BMW will be following Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Cars in putting autonomous cars on the road, with the latter two companies partnering on test vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Other carmakers have been reluctant so far to heed BMW’s call for adopting its platform. Rival Daimler AG has said it prefers to develop its own technology. Mobileye shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to the highest intraday in three months and traded at $42.12 as of 1:12 p.m. in New York. Costly Technology Enabling vehicles to navigate without human input through cities requires them to see and understand complex situations more like people do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye brings expertise in cameras that model the surroundings while Santa Clara, California-based Intel wields computing capabilities to power artificial intelligence. The companies released details Wednesday in conjunction with CES 2017, the consumer-technology show in Las Vegas. “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best,” Froehlich said. “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology.” Carmakers could participate by buying sensors to install in their cars, or go deeper with equipment that helps crowd-source data from an autonomous-vehicle fleet, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Division. While Munich-based BMW’s main target is individual car owners, the technology will be available for ride-sharing fleets as well, Froehlich said. Auto manufacturers are pushing into so-called mobility services like car-sharing and ride-hailing to counter alternatives to private vehicle ownership.

Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last month, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. VW is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing. Revenue from car-sharing is projected to surge more than sevenfold to 4.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by 2021, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group Inc. Robo-taxis will make up 40 percent of automotive profits by 2030, more than selling vehicles to individuals, according to consulting company Roland Berger.

The German luxury carmaker yesterday confirmed that 40 self-driving cars, co-developed with Intel and Mobileye, are taking to US and European roads this year. “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” stated Klaus Fröhlich, BMW’s head of development at a joint press conference at CES in Las Vegas. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles.” When the partnership was announced in July 2016, the companies set themselves a hugely ambitious target of having not just an autonomous car, but an autonomous car platform that could be used by other companies, ready to go by decade’s end. Yet, just six months in, it appears that the project is on track. “We have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs,” said Mobileye chairman, Prof Amnon Shashua. It also means the iNext, BMW’s fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. “This year, our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNext,” said Fröhlich. According to Intel, the main obstacle that has been slowing down the development of autonomous vehicle technology is the huge initial costs involved. “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. As well as a progress report, Intel confirmed at CES that it is taking a 15 per cent stake in HERE.  HERE offers global mapping and localisation services for vehicles and is currently owned by Audi, Daimler and BMW. With Intel on board the owners plan to develop high-definition maps that are detailed enough for autonomous driving. “A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms,” said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.” — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week In New York, ride-hailing drivers are slaves to the surge Daimler’s Zetsche shows off the new Mercedes E-Class (VIDEO) Perodua unveils new Perodua Axia with VVT-i engine In cars, do Americans care about looks?

Zeman   @phonescooper Intel today announced next-generation modem for mobile devices, aptly named the Intel 5G Modem. Intel says the idea behind the 5G Modem is to help push the development of 5G ahead. The modem relies on key 3GPP 5G NR (new radio) technology, such as massive MIMO, low-latency, and advanced channel coding. It also includes both sub-6 GHz and mmWave capabilities. Intel hopes the modem will support early 5G field trials and at the same time drive the 3GPP NR specification forward. Intel is working with AT&T and other companies to test and define what might eventually be 5G. more info at Intel » Related CES 2017 news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Though that feat continues to elude us, a Bucharest-based Intel® Innovator, Silviu-Tudor Serban, has set out to do the next best thing. Leveraging a background in computer vision and artificial intelligence, he and his team have designed Helios, which uses Intel® RealSense™ 3D cameras to give those with severe visual impairments a clearer view of the world. And for those with total blindness, Helios features like reading assistance, facial recognition, and a haptic interface provide a much enhanced sense of their surroundings. Motherboard spoke with Serban about his project, and how next-gen technology can give greater independence to the 285 million people across the world who have low vision, or no vision at all. Tell me about Helios. What we wanted to do with Helios is use next-gen technologies to radically improve accessibility for visually impaired people. It works similar to a VR set, but instead of displaying computer-generated content, the user receives real-time visual data that is captured by the Intel® RealSense™ 3D camera. Our software processes the data in order to provide the most relevant information for people with low vision. For example, if there are some obstacles nearby, our software can highlight them, and tell the user he or she is going to bump into something. It can also recognize people's faces and assist with reading too. How did you come up with the idea? My partners Cristian Dragomir and Andrei Nistor and I took part in the Intel® RealSense™ App Challenge, which was a global competition organized by Intel to create the first applications for RealSense. It had a one million dollar prize pool, and we were actually one of the winners. We built a game called Drill Sergeant Simulator, which is when we first got to explore the full range of capabilities for the Intel® RealSense™ camera and SDK. It allowed us to get to know the technology inside out. That eventually led us towards the “Aha moment,” where we knew this camera could be the secret sauce for building something to help the visually impaired. As someone who's followed emerging technologies within the field of computer vision, what are some things we can do now that we couldn't do five years ago? We can do more on the go. Five years ago you couldn't do much on mobile. Laptop cameras were of much lower quality. We had Kinect, which is like a big hulk of equipment that had 3D vision. But the Intel® RealSense™ camera is so small, it can fit on your phone or tablet. This is the major difference from five years ago. You have the computing power and the sensors, and it's all so small and power-efficient you can actually place it in the product. What do you hope to be able to do in a few years that we just can't do yet? What we're waiting for is the technology to shrink even more. Now we have a wearable prototype, but what we want is to have it smaller and lighter, while keeping all the performance. I think in a couple of years we'll get even better mobility from these kinds of devices. What kind of equipment is the user carrying? The current prototype features an Intel® RealSense™ SR300 3D camera, which is mounted on a headset, and an Intel 2-in-1 hybrid laptop, which the user carries in a backpack. What was most challenging part of making Helios work? From my point of view, the most challenging part was to see the world from the perspective of the people who we are trying to help: the visually impaired. It's vital for designing the product and actually giving the software features that will make sense for the user, not me or you. To that end, we've been working with a couple of people who have vision impairments. We have a team member named Mihai -- he's featured in our videos demoing Helios -- who was born with microphthalmia and cataract-microcornea syndrome. Basically, he can see with only one eye, and that’s up to 50 cm. We relied a lot on his insight. Our meeting was rather serendipitous, actually. I was on the train, returning home after a Helios hardware hacking session with my team. Mihai was carrying a walking stick, and someone was helping him find his seat, which happened to be in the same compartment with me. It was incredibly random. I think the universe is particular in that way, making sure we wind up exactly where we should be. We started talking. First, about his vision impairment and challenges he faces everyday, then about vision aids and his Master’s thesis on accessibility in museums. Finally, I told him about Helios and he said he would love to try it and help out if possible. He’s been part of our team ever since. It sounds like he has a very specific type of vision impairment. Do you have to calibrate it so it works with someone who has a different impairment? There are some afflictions that cover most people: cataracts, glaucoma, Retinitis Pigmentosa, things like that. For the most part, they struggle to see a distant point. For them, Helios works right out of the box. The headgear has an adjustable lense, so that fixes some minor problems. We also have a few presets people can switch between in real-time, to choose whichever is best for them. For example, some people can’t see at night; for them we have a nightvision mode. Was there a particular moment when you knew this was going to work? I believe we have had several breakthrough moments while developing the software and hardware, but one of the most meaningful ones was when Mihai tried out the prototype for the first time. He just put the headset on and started using it with zero learning curve. He began describing objects in his line of sight, like tables, chairs, the closet or the door, sometimes touching them for confirmation. Then he gained confidence and went on exploring the area. Meanwhile, I was trying to hold back an ecstatic grin. I just knew we were on the right track. What if someone can’t see at all? Is there anything Helios can do for them? We actually have two versions of Helios we’re working on: Helios Light is the current working prototype, which aims to enhance sight for people suffering from low vision; and Helios Touch is our concept for improving spatial awareness for the blind. The secret ingredient for both implementations is Intel® RealSense™ technology, which is used to capture visual data. The idea behind Helios Touch is to help people with complete blindness by using software that can describe their nearby environment and then communicate with them via haptic impulses. It uses vibration patterns to convey a level of information about what’s around the user, somewhat like painting a picture in broad strokes. If, for instance, an obstacle is encountered, the user can feel it is there before they run into it. Those with total blindness can also take advantage of other features our software has right now, like reading assistance. That allows them to do things like go to a restaurant on their own and know what’s on the menu. We also have a special feature we call Argos, which is named after the all-seeing guardian giant from Greek mythology. Argos is for remote caregiving. Basically, the user can connect to a friend or relative who they trust, and can ask for help and guidance whenever they need. That friend or relative will have access to a direct visual stream of what the user sees, which they get on their phone. The Intel® RealSense™ technology also allows for almost instant learning of a person's facial features. So a known person, such as a friend or relative, can thus be easily recognized when they are in the line of sight of the user. More than that, the user can better understand facial cues, such as happiness or surprise, when talking to others. What's the next step? Our long-term plan is not only to develop the best possible solution, but also make it affordable. In terms of areas we're working on, we've been focusing a lot on the human-computer interface, improving in terms of computer vision and AI, and refining the algorithms to improve organization. Though we're developing several other core projects, our greatest focus is on Helios, because we think it has the capacity to make the greatest impact. For people with low vision it’s difficult, or even impossible, to do simple things like reading, writing, shopping, watching television, or recognizing faces. With Helios, all these types of activities become achievable. What we want is to empower people. Imagine people with vision impairment being able to better integrate in the workplace, or more easily access knowledge, or have improved mobility or an easy method of asking a friend for help -- this could change the lives of millions.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google January 04, 2017 5G will start deployments in 2018 and what expectations should be for real world speeds future, google, internet, smartphones, technology, wireless, world Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit In 2008, ITU – International Telecommunication Union said that 4G would deliver 1Gbit/sec for stationary devices, and 100Mbit/s for those moving. 4G brought a considerable improvement in speed over 3G, but even in 2017 real-world speeds are averaging out at around 7-40 Mb/s. 4G real world speeds actually delivered on the promised speeds for 3G. 5G could start deployments in 2018 Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung and others are preparing hardware for 2018 Intel aims to attract 5G design wins in top 2018 smartphones for the first modem made in its 14 nm process. The plan is an aggressive effort to be early with a chip that supports 3GPP 5G standards. Engineers attending those meetings say the first phase of the 5G standard won’t be formally approved until at least May 2018. Intel is not alone in the rush to 5G. Its archrival, Qualcomm, announced late last year its X50 5G modem will sample in 2017. It uses eight 100-MHz channels, a 2x2 MIMO antenna array, adaptive beamforming techniques and 64 QAM to achieve a 90dB link budget and works with separate 28 GHz transceiver and power management chips. Fixed wireless access over millimeter wave frequencies will come first, claiming to be 5G ahead of the standard. This was the scenario with 4G. Various startups and Google are trying to accelerate point to point millimeter wireless deployment 5G with controlled tests has speeds of 10-20 Gbps, but real world speeds will probably be a few hundred Mbit/second in most countries for those moving and a few Gbps for stationary point to point communication. Only countries like South Korea, Japan and Sweden might see Gbps or multi-Gbps speeds under real world conditions.

Credit: Intel More like this Volvo, Autoliv to form self-driving car software company Delphi, Mobileye partner to bring self-driving system to market by 2019 Intel's Go supercomputer for cars points to a PC-like horsepower race Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 BMW Group, Intel and computer vision maker Mobileye today announced they will collaborate to create a fleet of about 40 autonomous BMW vehicles that will hit U.S. and European roads by the second half of 2017. The pilot project is aimed at demonstrating advances the three companies have made in technology that enables fully self-driving vehicles. The BMW 7 Series will be used as the initial platform for Intel processor and Mobileye computer vision technology during the global trials. Mobileye, an Israeli technology company, is a leader in developing both software and proprietary computer chip technology (EyeQ) to support vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that provide warnings for collision prevention and mitigation. Mobileye has also partnered with other automakers and multi-billion-dollar tier 1 auto parts maker Delphi to supply its technology to the industry. Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their "Central Sensing Localization and Planning" (CSLP) platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during the Consumer Electronics Show taking place now in Las Vegas. They plan to start production in 2019. Mobileye, Delphi Mobileye and Delphi plan to demonstrate their platform for self-driving cars in urban and highway driving conditions during CES 2017 and start production in 2019. In July, BMW, Intel and Mobileye announced a development partnership that BMW said would result in a completely autonomous car called iNEXT, suited for both city streets and highways, by 2021. Like Google with its autonomous vehicle technology, the three firms have developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end autonomous system that provides "a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences." BMW believes self-driving cars will be widely used in ride-hailing services such as Uber, which has already deployed a self-driving test car in Pittsburgh. In related news, Intel announced Intel GO In-Vehicle Development Platforms for Automated Driving, which is specifically tailored for the self-driving technology market in that it's highly scalable and designed to meet the high compute demands of the fully autonomous driving industry. Intel GO computer systems will span the car, connectivity and cloud with multiple development kits that scale in performance based on its next-generation Intel Atom processor as well as Intel Xeon processors plus Arria 10 FPGAs. The technology, Intel claims, is also the industry's first 5G-ready development platform for automated driving.

The world’s largest software company is leaving no stone unturned in its bid to change that perception with mixed reality software and hardware products that meld the offline and online worlds and make both living rooms and companies smarter. On 8 December, for instance, Microsoft Corp. joined its partners and hardware engineers from around the world at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community event (WinHEC) in China to talk about its vision for building the next generation of personal computers (PCs) that support mixed reality and gaming, and to introduce always-connected, more power-efficient cellular PCs running Windows 10. Microsoft first announced a new PC partnership with Intel Inc., code-named ‘Project Evo’, which envisages “new ways for devices to light up with the latest in advanced security, artificial intelligence and Cortana, mixed reality, and gaming”, according to a 7 December note by Terry Myerson, executive vice-president of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group. The announcement was a continuation of Wintel, an industry lingo for personal computers based on Intel microprocessors and one of the Windows operating systems from Microsoft. That very day, the Redmond-based company also announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies Inc., to enable Windows 10 on mobile computing devices powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, once again signalling that personal computing is increasingly becoming mobile, which will necessitate power-efficient devices with multiple form factors that run on open platforms. The first such PCs are expected to be available as early as next year. Personal computers are passé The reason for these announcements is evident. While Microsoft garnered almost half of its $85 billion revenue from PCs, this year, the fortunes of PCs are consistently on the decline. Worldwide PC shipments totaled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to preliminary results by Gartner Inc. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of PC shipment decline, the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry. “According to our 2016 personal technology survey, the majority of consumers own, and use, at least three different types of devices in mature markets. Among these devices, the PC is not a high-priority device for the majority of consumers, so they do not feel the need to upgrade their PCs as often as they used to. Some may never decide to upgrade to a PC again,” Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a 11 October note. “In emerging markets, PC penetration is low, but consumers are not keen to own PCs. Consumers in emerging markets primarily use smartphones or phablets for their computing needs, and they don’t find the need to use a PC as much as consumers in mature markets,” Kitagawa added. The fact is that the world is becoming increasingly mobile, making it imperative for Microsoft to prove that it is no longer just an Office and Windows company for PCs but an agent of digital transformation. The change is perceptible under the guidance of its chief executive Satya Nadella, with Microsoft executives peppering their pitches with terms like analytics, intelligent cloud, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, machine learning and deep learning, in the same breath as they talk of Windows, Microsoft Office and PCs. Also Read | Satya Nadella in the driver’s seat at Microsoft “Personal computing is about the mobility of the experience, the Internet of Things (IoT); it is about augmented and virtual reality. It’s the way we access computing through touch and make it accessible in multiple languages. It is about enabling even differently-abled people to interact with computing because computing has become all pervasive. And in a sense, people will only see personal computing because everything else will become invisible. Personal computing will come in different shapes and sizes,” says Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft Corp. (India) Pvt. Ltd. Form factors are already changing With Windows 10, Microsoft’s goal is to have “the effect of the Gutenberg Press on this next generation of computing, enabling 3D creativity, mixed reality, and eSports and game broadcasting for everyone”, said Myerson in a 26 October note when introducing the ‘Surface Studio’ and a new input device called ‘Surface Dial’. Microsoft touts Surface Studio as “a new class of device that transforms from a desktop PC into a powerful digital canvas”. Microsoft has also launched its ‘Creators Update’, which enables Windows 10 users to be able to start capturing in 3D, printing in 3D, creating in 3D, sharing in 3D, and experiencing mixed reality. Users can take an object from the real world, capture it in 3D, edit it in Paint 3D, share it on the web, bring it back as a hologram, or even take it into a virtual world. Over the next year, Microsoft also plans to bring 3D to a range of Office applications including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Myerson believes that with Intel’s collaboration, devices of the future will “take advantage of Microsoft and Intel innovations” including “far-field speech communications so you can ask Cortana a question or play a song from across the room”, advances in biometric authentication with Windows Hello, insights from Microsoft’s Intelligent Security Graph, analytics from Intel, mixed reality experiences with head mounted displays (HMDs), and gaming innovations like eSports and game broadcasting. To be sure, Microsoft, which is taking to the cloud in a big way with its Office on iPad, already has Kinect—an input device that senses motion and allows users to play games with gestures and spoken commands. It is also betting big on its mixed reality holographic computer which it christened HoloLens. Microsoft believes that “holograms are the next evolution in computing”. Photo: Bloomberg The idea, as the company puts it on its website, is: “Mixed reality blends 3D holographic content into your physical world, giving your holograms real-world context and scale, allowing you to interact with both digital content and the world around you.” HoloLens has sensors that allow you to use your gaze to move the cursor when you want to select holograms. You can use gestures to open apps, select and size items, and drag and drop holograms, and use voice commands to navigate, select, open, command and control the apps. You can also speak directly to the personal digital assistant Cortana. Microsoft first announced HoloLens in January 2015 and shipped to developers and commercial partners in Canada and the US this March. Microsoft HoloLens is now available to pre-order exclusively from the Microsoft Store in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK. Many organisations and institutions have begun using HoloLens for business. This July, for instance, during the Worldwide Developer Conference in Toronto, Japan Airlines demonstrated a HoloLens app that lets engineers get up-close with a full-scale, computerized model of a jet engine. The app can highlight engine parts and show how different components work together in a way not possible with a real engine. Skype for HoloLens lets your contacts see what you see and draw on their screens to place holograms over physical objects in your view. Last June, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and Microsoft teamed up to develop Sidekick, a project using commercial technology to empower astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Sidekick used Microsoft HoloLens to provide virtual aid to astronauts working off the Earth. Nasa’s OnSight project also enables scientists to use HoloLens to “work on Mars” together, directly from their offices, allowing them a means to plan and, along with the Curiosity Mars Rover, conduct science operations on the Red Planet. By extending the OnSight project, in September, Microsoft opened “Destination: Mars” at the Kennedy Space Center to the public, which allows visitors the only opportunity possible today to walk around the Red Planet. Lowe’s Innovation Labs (LIL) is another case in point. It has partnered with Microsoft to launch the Lowe’s Hologram Experience in two of Lowe’s stores in the US. At these pilot stores, customers collaborate with a HoloLens specialist to plan their kitchen renovation in an interactive, mixed reality environment. Customers view physical objects and digital holograms merged through the Microsoft HoloLens headset, while standing in a showroom kitchen. With Skype on HoloLens, technicians at Thyssenkrupp Elevator AG can be hands-free while on the job, even when making remote calls to experts and sharing holographic instructions between users. This enables more flexibility while also complying with safety regulations. Additionally, the elevator company has partnered with Microsoft and systems integrator CGI to develop a solution christened MAX, which integrates machine learning IoT technology to analyse realtime data from elevators around the world. The solution provides technicians with instant diagnostic capabilities and rich, real-time data visualization of two primary types of data: alarms that indicate an immediate issue, and events, which are stored and used for management. In India, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd launched an optional telematics-based service for its customers. Christened ‘Drive Smart’, the device can track vehicle information such as driving summary, vehicle diagnostics and provide safety alerts. The device uses Pune-based telematics startup, CarIQ’s app that provides real-time feedback on driver behaviour, including overspeeding, faulty gear changes and rash driving. The statistics include the time spent driving, distance travelled and likely fuel consumption. However, handling this humongous data can be very challenging in real time. Hence, CarIQ uses Microsoft’s Azure Cloud to receive data from multiple sources. Big Data analysis is then done on the stored data and the platform also integrates with external services.

According to Narendra Bhandari, general manager of Developer Experience and Evangelism at Microsoft, “these solutions are helping the manufacturing sector create digital factories”. These solutions offer IoT and analytics to improve productivity, efficiency and compliance. Click here for enlarge Microsoft, for instance, claims that its Teramatrix IoT software platform, which enables companies to connect with their fixed or mobile infrastructure and analyze the massive data streams emanating from them, “resulted in a 20% expected increase in direct and indirect manpower productivity by enabling 24x7 continuity of testing operations and remote management of testing equipments” at Hero MotoCorp Ltd. “The predictive analytics as a service market is entirely led by consulting firms. In contrast, what Microsoft is seeking to achieve is to empower enterprise users to access analytics platform directly by integration of R and Azure technologies into their mainstream technologies, such as SQL Database. Microsoft has made it easier to run models and brought down the learning curve. Given the extensive reach that Microsoft has in the Enterprise markets, Microsoft’s analytics platform is likely to dominate the advanced analytics market,” concurs Alok Shende, founder and director of Ascentius Consulting.

The global augmented -reality (AR) market in 2014 was valued at $1.72 billion and is expected to touch $56.8 billion by 2020, according to market research firm MarketsandMarkets. According to the new Worldwide Semiannual Augmented and Virtual Reality Spending Guide from the International Data Corp. (IDC), worldwide revenues for the augmented-reality and virtual-reality (AR/VR) market will grow from $5.2 billion in 2016 to more than $162 billion in 2020. MarketsandMarkets pegs the total mixed-reality market at $453.4 million by 2020. Besides the increasing adoption of mixed-reality products for multiple applications and growing popularity of reality technologies such as augmented reality, the report attributes the growth of the mixed-reality market also to rising investments and new product development activities “from some of the major companies such as the Microsoft Corp., Atheer Labs, and Meta Co. among others”. The global mixed reality market will be worth $1.2 billion by 2024 as opposed to $35.30 million in 2015, says a 15-November report by Transparency Market Research. Some of the key companies in this market include Daqri LLC, Seiko Epson Corp., Facebook Inc., HTC Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, Recon Instruments Inc., Microsoft , Magic Leap Inc., Canon Inc., Meta Co., Infinity Augmented Reality Inc., and Osterhout Design Group, according to the report. Mixed reality combines the best of augmented reality and virtual reality with hardware such as associated devices, head-mounted displays (HMDs), cameras, consoles and software that comprises cloud, gestures, mixed reality tracking software, and software development kits (SDKs) to offer real-world experience through virtual images. In terms of applications, the report divides the global mixed-reality market into segments such as healthcare, automotive and aerospace, e-commerce and retail and entertainment. Transparency Market Research analysts expect the North American market to lead the global market in the coming years with Asia Pacific projected to follow its lead “as the region is exhibiting a high uptake of smart devices”. Research and consulting firm, IndustryARC, pegged the global mixed-reality market at $294.8 million in 2015. In its 20 July report, it pointed out that eye glass devices currently dominate mixed-reality hardware but added that the HMD devices segment is “set to become the largest one in the coming years owing to its penetration in virtual reality”. The report noted that with increasing investments in innovation centers located in emerging countries like India and China, the mixed reality market is set to witness considerable growth especially in creative industries such as education, mobile-based applications, mixed reality-based movies, advertising and fashion. It listed the key companies in this market as Facebook, Samsung, HTC, Seiko and Recon. “This mixed-reality market is highly consolidated with top five companies occupying close to 90% of the market share in 2015. The growing number of start-ups coupled with technological advancements is estimated to however shift the market share slightly from key players to smaller companies. Furthermore, rising investments in emerging companies boost their innovation,” said the IndustryARC report. Moreover, while Microsoft has its Cortana, Google Assistant’s Allo chatbot and Apple’s Siri give it very tough competition. All of them use artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms. Moreover, while there are newer entrants like the Bridge Explorer Edition from Occipital, there are existing products like Amazon Echo and Google Home that compete with Project Evo. Echo connects to the Alexa Voice Service to play music, provide information, news, sports scores, weather and more. Google Home, on its part, is a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant. Pramanik is unfazed about the competition. He admits that “if you think about the Microsoft even two years back, our obsession was about competition, about our products, technology and licensing” but adds that “today, our focus is really around customers—our obsession is around customers, and our focus is on innovation.” He concludes, “Transformation is about business model changing. So if you have a connected product or service, your whole business model changes because you don’t charge for the product—you charge for the service. Second is about differentiated customer experiences. We have transformed the way people buy. Analytics is now built into everything we do because that gives you the power of data—the ability to actually take better informed decisions. Finally, it is IoT which you can look at manufacturing, services—how using IoT you can actually make processes, products intelligent. So we are not the Office and Windows company of the past. We are a company that can help you empower, engage, optimize and transform.” Leslie D'Monte Topics: Microsoft personal computing PC sales Satya Nadella digital transformation More From Livemint READ MORE Why the rhetoric of caste vs. development in UP polls rings hollow Nintendo takes big gamble with Switch’s split personality Believing in India’s solar mission takes a leap of faith First Published: Thu, Jan 05 2017. 02 18 AM IST Editor's Picks Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

The year is front-loaded because even announcements not technically made at the Las Vegas show are pushed ahead because the big convention is happening. For 2017, it’s no surprise that the one of the high-profile items is 5G. AT&T mapped out its 5G roadmap for the year ahead; it will pursue fixed and mobile solutions and is working with more than 12 companies on standards. AT&T will continue to deploy LTE-Advanced, which it positions as a precursor to 5G. It will conduct a 5G video trial with DirecTv Now during the first half of the year. The company said that it will follow what it said was the first business trial in Austin in collaboration with Intel and Ericsson. The next step is trials of mobile and fixed wireless during the second half of 2017 with Qualcomm and Ericsson. The press release claims that the trials will be the first of the radio specification that is expected to be promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Intel announced what figures to be an important 5G modem. The not too creatively named Intel 5G Modem is, according to the company, the first to offer a baseband chip that supports both mmWave and sub-6 GHz bands. Intel’s aim is for the modem to be used in trials and in early deployments in sectors including automotive, home broadband and mobile. The modem will be available in sample form during the second half of the year, according to the press release. Everyone agrees that 5G will be big. How that actually “will look,” however, is difficult to say. Phil Marshall, the chief research officer for Tolaga Research, suggests that different markets will react differently. Areas where there is a great deal of interest in new techniques may not react as staid markets will. There also is the issue of whether the real money in 5G will be made by extending the types of services now available or going after unproven revenue streams, such as the “tactile” internet. The bottom line? Companies need to be careful and meticulously plan their entry into the market. That’s a tall order because the technology itself is nowhere near ready. At this point, there is a rhythm to technical innovations. They start in the tech sites and get taken over by marketers. Thus, they jump ahead and become household names well before they truly are ready. It is simply impossible to rush physics. That is the stage that 5G is in now -- that in-between time of the technology catching up to the hype, as this Financial Times piece suggests: Qualcomm chief Stephen Mollenkopf has made 5G the theme of his keynote speech this week, while other chipmakers are also expected to be pushing the technology. 5G promises faster data speeds at lower latency and lower power consumption. While beneficial to smartphones, 5G could be transformational in automotive, virtual reality and the internet of things. However, consumers will probably have to wait several years before it becomes widely available. By the time of next year’s CES, the vendors may have rollouts of more substance to discuss.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español ​Intel: We'll be your net-connected, self-driving car's brains With processors and communication chips under its new Go brand, Intel hopes to revolutionize the auto industry -- and profit from the change. Auto Tech by Stephen Shankland January 4, 2017 6:45 AM PST @stshank Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show Enlarge Image Intel CEO Brian Krzanich opens the door for Elmar Frickenstein, leader of BMW's electronics work, at a 2016 Intel conference.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET It's go time for Intel. The company that almost certainly made the chip in your PC wants to be the one that also makes the chip for your self-driving car. To that end, it's launching a new product brand, Go, that encompasses its processors, its coming high-speed 5G radio communication links and the software it'll offer so programmers can make it all useful. It's not clear whether the Go brand will mean you'll see an "Intel Inside" sticker on your next car's dashboard. But the plan does show how seriously the tech industry is taking the computerization of cars. Computers have seized onto our work, school and home lives, but they've remained largely peripheral to how we experience cars. Lots of chips are hidden away in fuel injection systems and antilock brakes, and we can use Bluetooth to hear phone calls on the car stereo. Intel, though, wants to be part of the radical digital overhaul that's only just beginning with cars. In November, Intel formed a new automated driving group, gave it a $250 million R&D budget and named Doug Davis to lead it. At this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it announced it's acquiring a 15 percent stake in digital mapping company Here to boost its self-driving car work, it'll tout its new Go brand along with efforts to expand into new growth markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Despite its manufacturing prowess, Intel missed out on the overhaul of another big market, phones. Establishing its brand outside the PC market also will be hard -- especially with rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm, which is trying to spend $39 billion to buy NXP Semiconductors, a chipmaker with lots of expertise in automotive computing tech. "The brand inside a vehicle doesn't matter," said David Kanter, chip analyst with the Linley Group and Real World Technologies. "People care about Mercedes, Tesla or Toyota, not NXP, Intel or Nvidia." Digital driving Computerization is remaking driving. An array of sensors -- lasers, radar, conventional cameras -- will make cars aware of what's around them, with computers to make sense of the raw data. That data will let self-driving cars decide when to turn, brake and change lanes, and it'll let them share data through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links the US government wants in all cars. Cars will need network links for refreshing maps and fetching updates to block the latest security threats, too. And even if it's a long time before computers supplant human drivers, voice interfaces like Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa are mature enough today to cue up the latest album or podcast without you taking your hands from the wheel. Manufacturers will probably spend between $1,000 and $1,500 on chips to build a modern car, Kanter estimates -- "even higher for autonomous vehicles, which will need more impressive sensors, communications and computation," he said. Enlarge Image Intel plans to send prototypes of its 5G communication chips to auto industry partners in the second half of 2017.Photo by Intel Intel chips and wireless links Intel wants to supply all kinds of processors for cars, Davis said. That includes tiny Quark models, midrange A3900 models to run dashboard displays, high-end Xeon models for self-driving tasks and unusual field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips that can be good at bridging between modern computers and the years-old standards that car electronics still use. For communications, Intel wants to supply 5G chips -- those that'll replace today's fourth-generation technology. Today's 4G networks are handy for phones, but 5G proponents promise all manner of revolutions -- superfast home broadband, an internet of things bringing networks far beyond phones and laptops, and augmented reality glasses that populate the real world with computer-generated video game characters. 5G is a big deal at CES, and just about any other large tech show these days. And Intel is hardly the only interested party. Network equipment maker Ericsson announced a partnership on Wednesday to test 5G cars this year with carrier Orange and the French automaker behind the Peugeot and Citroen brands. The zippy data-transfer speeds of 5G will let cars fetch updated map data, and short communication delays will mean it can handle V2V communications, Davis said. "5G has the low latency that would meet those requirements," he said. It's not yet clear which standards will be used when cars chat among themselves, though: the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has signed up for a variation of Wi-Fi standards called dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Cars talking to cars V2V could help cars share information. Two cars passing in opposite directions in rural Iowa, for instance, could exchange information about the last 10 miles they'd each driven -- as long as they had a fast-enough connection. "That's a lot of data you want to exchange in short period of time," Davis said. It's just the sort of thing that 5G should be good for -- once the standard is done. The technology is taking years to develop, but Intel plans to deliver prototype 5G chips in the second half of 2017 so auto partners can see what's possible sooner. Intel partners in the auto market include BMW, Chinese internet company Baidu and auto technology provider Delphi. Its chips are used in hundreds of advanced prototype self-driving cars, and 33 top-tier automotive companies have picked its products for their designs. It's not domination as in the PC market, but it's a start.

Close Intel strengthens self-driving car presence with 15 percent stake in HERE digital maps firm Viknesh Vijayenthiran Jan 4, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle Self-driving carEnlarge Photo Intel is set to acquire a 15 percent stake in digital mapping company HERE which is owned by Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The acquisition is set to be completed in the first quarter of 2017, pending approval from various regulatory bodies. In addition to the acquisition, Intel and HERE have signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a proof-of-concept scalable system that supports real-time updates of highly-detailed digital maps that self-driving cars will be able to tap in order to calculate their routes. HERE has been developing the digital maps for several years, including using information gathered from sensors fitted to car models from its owners Audi, BMW and Mercedes. In late December, HERE announced that it would also use information gathered from vehicle sensor company Mobileye. All of these sensors are the key to updating the maps in real time. The maps promise to make self-driving cars extremely safe. For example, today’s navigation technology can pinpoint a car’s location to within meters, but HERE’s digital maps support localization to within centimeters. This will help vehicles precisely position themselves on the roadway to enable reliable and safe self-driving capability. HERE HD Live MapEnlarge Photo And together with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, the maps will also give vehicles the ability to see obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision and receive real-time updates as environments change due to traffic, road conditions and other factors. “A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle computer platforms,” HERE CEO Edzard Overbeek said in a statement. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.” Intel and HERE will initially work with Audi, BMW and Mercedes to test the technology. However, the plan is to make it available to other automakers. Note, Intel is already working with BMW and Mobileye to develop self-driving cars and estimates to have the technology ready by 2021.

G.Skill has been constantly releasing the highest clocked memory kits around, so when we got their latest press release overnight  showing off Trident Z DDR4 4266 MHz memory kits we weren’t too shocked by it. The two new kits that G.SKill is highlighting today are rated at DDR4-4266MHz at CL19-19-19-39 for 16GB (8GBx2) kits and DDR4-4133MHz CL19-21-21-41 for 32GB (8GBx4) kits. Both kits have CL19 memory timings and that is pretty aggressive seeing how fast the clock speeds are. The voltage to get a 16GB 4266MHz DDR4 memory kits is 1.4V, which is the highest that we have ever seen a DDR4 memory kit at. The G.Skill DDR4 4266MHz memory kits appear to be available now from Newegg for $249.99 shipped. G.Skill didn’t show off any performance benchmarks on either of these new kits, but did show off a screenshot of them running error free. If you are buying a new Intel Z270 motherboard and need a new memory kit be sure to check out all the different speeds available from G.SKill to get the most from your new platform. FZ1 Sweet colors!

Intel’s new Go brand covers car tech from self-driving to 5G wireless Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story ZF debuts ProAI, a production self-driving system based on Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 Intel already has a dedicated functional group targeting the automotive industry, and now it also has sub-brand devoted to all things car tech. The Go brand covers products including in-vehicle automated driving development platforms, a 5G communication platform that’s intended to help carmakers get ready for broader rollout of 5G wireless tech in 2020, and an SDK aimed at helping developers in the automated driving field take advantage of new computing and sensor hardware. Go, and its three product lines, are making their official debut at CES 2017 on Wednesday, and put some more definition on Intel’s plan to position itself in a key role as autonomous driving continues to gain traction. Intel also announced a test fleet deployment partnership with BMW and Mobileye Wednesday morning, and those test vehicles will indeed carry Intel Go platforms on board, according to the chipmaker. The new 5G deployment platform is also very interesting, because it paves the way for connective not only between vehicles, but also between cars and infrastructure, with wireless network advances that drastically improve latency and speed, which are both key ingredients when you’re talking about communication tech that’s used to help inform split-section decisions a car’s autonomous navigation systems are using to potentially avoid accidents. Intel’s Automated Driving Group (ADG) will likely be a big contributor to Go’s development, but it sounds like Go might be even more broad-reaching as the silicon giant looks to make the most out of the car industry’s increasing reliance on tech.

BMW is ready to get its self-driving cars on the road, and you could see one whizzing past you on the highway by year's end. The car maker is in Las Vegas for CES this week, where it—alongside Intel and Mobileye—announced that autonomous BMW 7 Series vehicles are scheduled for trials in the US and Europe later in the year. BMW, Intel, and Mobileye teamed up in July to "create an open platform for the next generation of cars," with an eye on providing fully automated driving solutions by 2021. Now, the trio are ready to start testing what they've come up with, which BMW board of management member Klaus Frölich called "a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group's first fully autonomous vehicle." "Over the last six months, we have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas," said Mobileye co-founder, chairman, and CTO Professor Amnon Shashua. Mobileye is contributing its EyeQ 5 high-performance computer vision processor, which handles input from the 360-degree vision sensors and localization. Going forward, it's prepping a "sensor fusion solution," which will create a model of the environment around the vehicle using vision, radar, and lidar sensors. Intel solutions, meanwhile, are present in the vehicle via Intel GO and the data center. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. The solution will be available to other auto makers, not just BMW. "We are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies—manufacturers, suppliers, or technology companies—to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform," Frölich said. Intel, meanwhile, has also acquired a 15 percent stake in digital mapping firm Here, which BMW, Audi, and Daimler acquired in 2015. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2017!

The announcement, made at a joint press conference at CES 2017, the consumer and electronics trade show that is taking place this week in Las Vegas, is testament to the “significant advancements” made by the three companies towards fully autonomous driving, the companies said. The BMW 7 Series will employ “cutting-edge” Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials starting in the U.S. and Europe, the companies said. BMW, Intel and Mobileye announced their partnership in July last year, and the companies have since developed what they define a “scalable architecture” for autonomous driving that can be also used by other carmakers for their own brands. This offering to other manufacturers will range from individual integrated modules to complete end-to-end solutions, the companies said in a statement. “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” said Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “We are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies — to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform.” This year, a BMW fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions, he said, adding that this is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle. As part of the partnership, the BMW Group will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety of the cars; Intel brings to the partnership the high performance computing elements that span from the vehicle to the data center; while Mobileye contributes its high-performance computer vision processors. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop additional sensors, as well as establishing driving policies and using Mobileye’s reinforcement learning algorithms, to provide the vehicles with the artificial intelligence required to safely negotiate complex driving situations, the companies said. Mobileye and its UK based partner Delphi Automotive Plc. said last month they would hold the “most complex automated drive ever publicly demonstrated on an urban and highway” route in Las Vegas this week. There are some 30 corporate groups globally, ranging from the automotive industry to leading technology brands — including Google, Daimler and General Motors — that are chasing the dream of driverless cars by setting up research and development activities, and buying or teaming up with tech companies, according to CB Insights, a New York-based data company. And the race is on among them for who will be able to put the first driverless car on the road.

The companies will deploy 40 self-driving cars for testing on public roads in the second half of this year. The test cars will be BMW 7 Series sedans that are packed with technology provided by Intel and Mobileye. BMW hasn’t made this announcement today out of the blue. It first announced more than six months ago that it was looking to team up with Intel and Mobileye on self-driving cars. Intel will provide the processing power while Mobileye will come up with the systems and sensors required to enable the car to drive itself. BMW said back then that it wanted to start selling autonomous cars by 2021. Today’s announcement is interesting for a different reason. These companies aren’t just collaborating on self-driving car technology that only BMW will use. They are actually working on scalable architecture that other car manufacturers can adopt and use in their vehicles of the future. BMW also has an independent project that it’s working on. It’s the company’s autonomous electric car currently referred to as i NEXT that BMW is hoping to have out on the market by 2021. The three companies will begin their joint testing with BMW 7 Series vehicles in the second half of 2017. Filed in Transportation. Read more about bmw, CES, CES 2017, Intel and self-driving cars.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Intel Announces Full Lineup of Kaby Lake Processors for iMac, MacBook Pro, and More Intel Announces Full Lineup of Kaby Lake Processors for iMac, MacBook Pro, and More Tuesday, 3 January 2017 (2 weeks ago) At today's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, Intel formally announced its full lineup of 7th-generation Intel Core processors, known as Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake low-power Y-Series and U-Series processors were announced in late August, but today's unveiling covers notebook and desktop chips that could be destined for many future Apple Macs. Intel's 7th-generation processors are built on the "14nm+" process, introducing new optimizations compared to previous 14nm Broadwell and Skylake chips. According to Intel, Kaby Lake will bring "double digit productivity performance increases" of up to 20 percent for gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. With 4K and 360 degree content, customers can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks. Enhanced security, a new media engine, and improvements in VR and gaming are all advertised features. Of the chips announced today, the 28-watt U-Series chips are appropriate for a future 13-inch MacBook Pro update, and we could see the 7267U/7287U/7567U used in 13-inch MacBook Pro machines this year. Those same chips are likely what Apple would use in a Mac mini update, as the Mac mini and the 13-inch MacBook Pro have traditionally included the same chips. Intel's 45-watt H-Series chips are appropriate for a future 15-inch MacBook Pro update. The 7700HQ would be ideal for entry-level machines, while a mid-tier machine would use the 7820HQ and the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro would use the 7920HQ. There are multiple potential upgrade options for the 27-inch iMac, but the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) are the straight upgrade path from the current Skylake chips used in 27-inch machines. For the 21.5-inch iMac, Apple normally uses chips with higher-end integrated graphics, but Intel has not released Kaby Lake chips that are a clear upgrade for the smaller iMac machines. Apple could choose to use Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake chips for the 21.5-inch iMac, and in that case, would likely adopt the 6585R, 6685R, and 6785R chips, released six months ago. With today's announcement, Kaby Lake chips that are clear upgrades for the iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini will be available to manufacturers in the near future and will be available for Apple's planned 2017 upgrades. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for future MacBook updates are already available. Rumors suggest we will see refreshed iMacs in the spring, which is also when we may see new MacBooks, and in the fall, we expect to see Kaby Lake refreshes for the MacBook Pro lineup.

BMW’s Self-Driving Cars to Hit Public Streets This Year Share Tweet Subscribe Get AutoGuide.com in your Inbox Like AutoGuide.com on Facebook By Stephen Elmer Jan 04, 2017 BMW along with partners Intel and Mobileye have announced that about 40 self-driving BMW vehicles are destined to hit public streets for testing by the second half of 2017.  The fleet will be made up of BMW 7 Series vehicles fitted with technology from Intel and Mobileye, the entire suite of which has been designed to scale to different platforms and could even be used by other automakers. The three companies announced a partnership in July of 2016. BMW is responsible for the driving control, dynamics and overall evaluation of the functional safety of the system along with building a high-performance simulation engine. Production of prototypes and eventually scaling the platform through partners will also be handled by the German automaker. Intel supplies the brains of the car, with its new Intal GO system offering powerful processors that handle sensor fusion, driving policy, environmental modelling and path planning. Mobileye provides its EyeQ 5 system which processes and interprets the input from the 360-degree surround view vision provided by a number of sensors, made up of radar, lidar and cameras. SEE ALSO: Weird BMW ‘Sculpture’ Thinks Holograms are the Future “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles,” said Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle.” BMW is still planning to launch the BMW iNext model by 2021, complete with a full suite of self-driving technology. The brand says the iNext will serve as the basis for all of its self-driving cars moving forward.

It will also support faster wireless connectivity for mobile computing, gaming and multimedia use, the company said yesterday. Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel. Currently, the global microprocessor leader, Intel is still producing 14-nanometer-based chips, although the company said it expects to begin shipping 10-nanometer technology sometime this year. Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog. "Qualcomm Technologies' newest mobile SoC is designed to meet every one of these rigorous requirements while setting new standards in mobile performance." The architectural improvements in the Snapdragon 835 will pave the way for a new wave of capabilities in smartphones, virtual reality (VR) gear, Bluetooth devices, 4G connectivity and security-focused authentication, Cheng said. The improved computing power of the new SoC will also enable smarter and more dynamic machine learning applications, he added. One of the first VR devices to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 will be Osterhout Design Group's R-8 and R-9 smart glasses, both set to hit the market later this year. Unveiled at CES yesterday, the devices will allow wearers to view movies and videos, play games and read articles and books, among other uses. Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds. In production now, the Snapdragon 835 will begin appearing in commercial devices hitting the market in the first half of this year, Qualcomm said.

Protect Your Phone from Spyware Next Article > New BlackBerry Smartphone with QWERTY Keyboard Ahead By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: JANUARY 05 2017 BlackBerry may have stopped making smartphones, but that hasn’t stopped BlackBerry smartphones from being made, with one expected to be called the BlackBerry Press to be announced at CES in Las Vegas on Wednesday. BlackBerry’s manufacturing partner TCL Communications Technology (TCT), which recently licensed the former RIM brand and makes smartphones under the Alcatel brand, is expected to announce a new BlackBerry -- and a teaser video shows it will come with the traditional qwerty keyboard. TCT’s president of North America, Steve Cistulli, posted several teasers of the Press to his Twitter account. imPRESSively designed. distinctly different. #BlackBerryMobile#CES2017pic.twitter.com/MGvvGXOtvi -- Steve Cistulli (@SteveCistulli) January 3, 2017 One more look… #BlackBerryMobile#CES2017pic.twitter.com/dSjVuMWd35 -- Steve Cistulli (@SteveCistulli) January 4, 2017 The new BlackBerry-branded smartphone will, like previously released BlackBerry smartphones the DTEK50 [pictured above] and DTEK60 also made by TCT, run BlackBerry’s version of Android and its messaging apps. The Press will be the first TCT BlackBerry to have a qwerty keyboard and will continue the long run of BlackBerry devices with such a physical input device as well as a touchscreen, where other manufacturers, including Apple, Google and Huawei have shunned the hardware keyboard in favour of larger touchscreens with adaptive virtual keyboards. BlackBerry’s ditching of its own BlackBerry operating system for Google’s Android was seen as a positive step, giving access to the wealth of apps within Google’s Play Store. Whether the device will be enough to attract the former lovers of BlackBerry’s physical keyboard that have since ditched the brand remains to be seen. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge.

More About: The Changing Automotive Landscape Intel Advertisement Intel Corp., trying to convert its dominance of computers into a stake in the growing market for chips used in cars, is offering automakers new products aimed at making its technology crucial to the effort to develop self-driving vehicles. ‘Intel Go’ will feature processors ranging from its smallest Atom chips all the way up to its most powerful Xeon product packaged with other components and software. It will be available in the first half of 2017, the company said Wednesday. The world’s largest chipmaker is seeking to gain a greater piece of what the industry is targeting as its next big market. As cars make the move from primarily mechanical devices to become increasingly dependent on electronics, Intel, Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are tuning their digital products to provide more intelligence in vehicles. Popular Now Top 10 Manufacturing Countries in 2020 The Dawn of the Smart Factory 5 Ways to Develop a More Efficient Factory Intel processors are a good fit for autos because the same type of chips are used to develop software on personal computers and process information in data centers, said Doug Davis, the head of Intel’s car unit. The company also announced Wednesday that it will offer the first version of a new modem to connect to forthcoming 5G cellular networks. That part will be available to test in the second half of 2017. Intel’s chips are already designed into 30 vehicle models that are on the road and are being used in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles, the company said. It doesn’t break out how much revenue is generated by that market. Nvidia automotive chip sales rose to $320 million in its 2016 fiscal year from $183 million in the preceding period. Neither Intel nor Nvidia made it into the the Top 10 chip providers to the automotive market in 2015, according to IDC Corp. One chipmaker that did, NXP Semiconductor NV, last year bought another on the list, Freescale Semiconductor. Now that combined company is being acquired by Qualcomm.

Next Article > CES 2017: Wireless Charging May Be About To Become a Reality By Samuel Gibbs. Updated January 06, 2017. Over the past few years, wires have been cut for everything from internet connections to earphones -- but still, almost every device needs to be plugged in at least once a day to charge. That may be about to change. At CES this year, Dell unveiled the Latitude 7285, a convertible two-in -- one Windows 10 computer that gets its power from a desktop wireless charging pad, and Ford announced it would be conducting tests of wireless vehicle charging. But it was Energous that revealed the most interesting development. The four-year-old company, a CES regular, had something to show of its WattUp wireless system, which beams power to devices using radio frequencies, rather than the magnetic induction used in the contactless charging of certain smartphones of the past few years. It had six companies showing off devices with WattUp technology powering them. From Bluetooth trackers, hearing aids and styluses, to a small module you can plug into other things, WattUp’s tentative steps into the real world with products you may actually be able to buy are encouraging with one small caveat: it only works over a few centimetres. Energous claims that these devices will be able to “seamlessly transition from being charged by small, contact-based, portable transmitters, to forthcoming larger transmitters that offer charging at-a-distance of up to 15 feet (4.6m)”. How long before that switch to power at a distance greater than a few centimetres takes is unknown, but one of the WattUp devices is capable of providing 700mAh of power to any microUSB port, a level of power greater than minimum expected of traditional USB supplied power from a computer. While 700mAh is certainly not enough power for something large, yet, it should be easily capable of powering portable devices and the burgeoning Internet of Things ecosystem instead of requiring a USB cable or replaceable battery. Energous also signed a undisclosed deal last year to supply its wireless power system to “one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world” according to the Energous chief executive, Steve Rizzone, talking to the Verge. The company also claimed that its technology was going through “Apple compliance testing” suggesting that it might have inked a deal with the Cupertino-based company. Wireless power is still in its infancy, but CES 2017 has marked a significant milestone for the technology. To leap out of the pages of science fiction and into the real world products you might actually buy will need a large electronics firm to put the technology into its products. A company such as Apple or Samsung, which was an early adopter of wireless charging technology, may just be catalyst needed to make it happen. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge.

Credit: Intel More like this Xavier and BB8: Nvidia heroes drive ambitious autonomous car plans Nvidia's updated Drive PX 2 computer will drive autonomous cars Nvidia teases Volta GPU in next-gen Xavier self-driving car computer Video The State of Solar 2017 There's a race to put more computing power in self-driving cars, and it's shaping up to be eerily similar to an earlier battle between Intel and AMD to crank up PC horsepower. Intel at CES announced the powerful Go computer with up to 28 Xeon chips so self-driving cars can cruise the streets safely. Beyond Xeon, Go will also be available with either next-generation Atom chips or 5G connectivity. The first 40 self-driving BMW cars based on the Go will hit the streets in tests this year. Autonomous cars need a lot of computational power under the hood to avoid accidents and make smart driving decisions. That horsepower comes from computers like the Go, which is configured to be faster than gaming PCs and many servers. Go will compete with Nvidia's Drive PX 2, a water-cooled supercomputer for autonomous cars announced by Nvidia last year. The Drive PX 2 has 12 CPU cores and two Pascal-based GPU cores but no 5G connectivity. The car chip race between Intel and Nvidia resembles the competition between AMD and Intel in the late 1990s and early 2000s PC heyday to crank up the clock frequency of processors. The chip makers ultimately gave up the battle to focus on power efficiency to increase battery life in laptops.  Intel believes it has an advantage over its rivals with 5G connectivity, allowing cars to communicate with servers in the cloud to analyze images. This connectivity is an important tool for cars to identify objects on streets. Both the Go and the Drive PX 2 have the same target: To train computers to be smarter. The computers help cars detect pedestrians, recognize lanes, and stop at signals. Computers make decisions based on algorithms and data collected from cameras and sensors like lidar and radar. Intel and Nvidia are also in a race to put self-driving cars on streets. Intel is working with Mobileye and BMW on self-driving cars, and Nvidia's hardware is being used in Tesla vehicles with self-driving features. The biggest benefit to self-driving cars is in safety, but there are other functional and economic benefits, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Self-driving vehicles could help people make better use of their time. Self-driving cars could bring economic benefits to logistics related to transportation and delivery of products, Winter said. Uber is already testing self-driving taxis in the U.S., and other technology companies are dabbling in self-driving cars. Companies are working together to establish standards for autonomous vehicles to communicate about traffic and weather conditions. The Go computers are part of development kits that come with software tools. The kits join a stable of Intel computers that include NUC mini desktops, Compute Sticks, and development boards for smart devices, robots, and drones. Intel's Go hardware with Xeon is supplemented by two FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which can be reprogrammed to do multiple tasks. The FPGAs are to Intel's Go what the GPUs are to Nvidia's Drive PX 2 -- fast chips that will help cars make key decisions instantly. The version of Go with next-generation Atom chips has only one FPGA. The Go computer with 5G will be demonstrated at the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Intel announced its first 5G modem at CES this week. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel. Currently, the global microprocessor leader, Intel is still producing 14-nanometer-based chips, although the company said it expects to begin shipping 10-nanometer technology sometime this year. Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog.

Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds.

Safe Yet To Fly with a Galaxy Note 7? Next Article > CES 2017: Wireless Charging May Be About To Become a Reality By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: JANUARY 06 2017 Over the past few years, wires have been cut for everything from internet connections to earphones -- but still, almost every device needs to be plugged in at least once a day to charge. That may be about to change. At CES this year, Dell unveiled the Latitude 7285, a convertible two-in -- one Windows 10 computer that gets its power from a desktop wireless charging pad, and Ford announced it would be conducting tests of wireless vehicle charging. But it was Energous that revealed the most interesting development. The four-year-old company, a CES regular, had something to show of its WattUp wireless system, which beams power to devices using radio frequencies, rather than the magnetic induction used in the contactless charging of certain smartphones of the past few years. It had six companies showing off devices with WattUp technology powering them. From Bluetooth trackers, hearing aids and styluses, to a small module you can plug into other things, WattUp’s tentative steps into the real world with products you may actually be able to buy are encouraging with one small caveat: it only works over a few centimetres. Energous claims that these devices will be able to “seamlessly transition from being charged by small, contact-based, portable transmitters, to forthcoming larger transmitters that offer charging at-a-distance of up to 15 feet (4.6m)”. How long before that switch to power at a distance greater than a few centimetres takes is unknown, but one of the WattUp devices is capable of providing 700mAh of power to any microUSB port, a level of power greater than minimum expected of traditional USB supplied power from a computer. While 700mAh is certainly not enough power for something large, yet, it should be easily capable of powering portable devices and the burgeoning Internet of Things ecosystem instead of requiring a USB cable or replaceable battery. Energous also signed a undisclosed deal last year to supply its wireless power system to “one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world” according to the Energous chief executive, Steve Rizzone, talking to the Verge. The company also claimed that its technology was going through “Apple compliance testing” suggesting that it might have inked a deal with the Cupertino-based company. Wireless power is still in its infancy, but CES 2017 has marked a significant milestone for the technology. To leap out of the pages of science fiction and into the real world products you might actually buy will need a large electronics firm to put the technology into its products. A company such as Apple or Samsung, which was an early adopter of wireless charging technology, may just be catalyst needed to make it happen. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge.

Yahoo To Be Altaba after Buyout Next Article > Apple App Store Breaks Another Sales Record By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: JANUARY 05 2017 After a year in which its developers earned record-high revenues from app sales, Apple reported today that it broke another sales record on New Year's Day. Calling Sunday the "App Store's busiest day ever," Apple said customers spent $240 million in app purchases on the first day of 2017. The holiday shopping season was also Apple's busiest, with more than $3 billion in App Store sales in December, the company said. Introduced in 2008, Apple's App Store offers more than 2.2 million free and paid applications for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and other iOS devices. Developers of iOS apps, which include everything from games to software for workplace productivity, took in a record $20 billion in earnings last year, 40 percent more than in 2015, Apple said. Game Apps Led the Way Apple's App Store "shatters records on New Year's Day," senior vice president of worldwide marketing Philip Schiller noted this morning in a tweet announcing the company's latest sales figures. Those results suggest that "2017 is off to a great start," he said. The most-downloaded app on both Christmas and New Year's Day was Nintendo's Super Mario Run, which became available for iOS devices on Dec. 15, according to Apple. In the first four days after its release, the game was downloaded more than 40 million times. (The Android version isn't set to come out until later this year.) Apple's top grossing apps for the past year include Monster Strike, Fantasy Westward, Clash Royale and Pokémon Go. Other apps that led the year in downloads included Prisma, Reigns, Procreate, Lumino City, Sweat With Kayla and djay Pro. Fast Growth, but Limits, in China Over the past year, the number of apps available from Apple grew by more than 20 percent, with the U.S., China, Japan and the U.K. making up the top markets. China's App Store in particular saw dramatic growth in 2016, with activity expanding by 90 percent. Despite such growth, China also placed some limits on what iOS users there can and can't download. In fact, at the request of Chinese authorities, Apple removed both the English- and Chinese-language versions of the New York Times' iOS app from China's App Store in late December, The New York Times reported yesterday.. According to the New York Times, Apple's director of corporate communications Fred Sainz said his company was informed that the app was in violation of local regulations. "As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China," he said. In the fall, Apple also introduced several changes to its App Store guidelines and revenue splits for developers. Under a new subscription model launched in September, developers receive an extra cut from Apple's earnings when customers subscribe to their apps for more than one year. The top subscription apps for 2016 included Netflix, HBO Now, Line, Tinder and MLB.com at Bat. Subscription-based revenues at the App Store grew by 74 percent in 2016, reaching a total of $2.7 billion, according to Apple.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated January 4, 2017 9:04AM SHARE ALSO SEE CES Intel Processor Chip Kaby Lake Hardware Laptops Desktops Enterprise IT Technology News Chipmaker Intel announced updates to its core CPU series yesterday, in preparation for the CES 2017 tradeshow in Las Vegas, which officially opens Jan 5. The announcement focused on launch of the remaining models in the 7th generation of its Intel Core processors. The addition of the desktop versions of the Kaby Lake processors should have plenty of appeal for enterprise clients thanks to improved performance, security, and graphics. The new CPUs feature several small improvements in efficiency and performance over Intel's previous Skylake models. Improved Integrated Graphics One of the key differences between Kaby Lake and Skylake is an upgraded video engine. This can be important for laptops that lack the space for a dedicated graphics card, but often has little impact on the desktop market where users can add a dedicated GPU. But most corporate customers aren't going to invest in separate graphics cards for their employees' desktops. For these buyers, the improved media engine offers the promise of improved graphics and video rendering performance during their next upgrade cycles without having to spend any extra cash on a GPU. "With the latest 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processors, business owners and IT managers can offer new PCs with up to 10 hours of battery life and a 65 percent increase in productivity when compared with a 5-year-old PC," Navin Shenoy (pictured above), senior vice president and general manager for the Client Computing Group at Intel, said in a statement about the launch. "And with many Millennials today taking technology into consideration when choosing their workplace, I'm confident the new 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based 2 in 1s and AIOs will delight them." Enhanced Security for Enterprises The new Kaby Lake chips make use of the same 14nm manufacturing process that Intel introduced with the launch of its Broadwell chips several years ago. Nevertheless, Intel is claiming that the new chips show a significant improvement in performance over the previous Skylake processors, with up to 20 percent improvement for performance and gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. For 4K and 360-degree content, users can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks and 35 percent faster on desktops, the company said. But the biggest news for enterprise clients is likely the new improvements in security. The new chips feature several advances in hardware-enhanced security and two-factor authentication. The new processors feature Intel's hardware-based Authenticate multi-factor authentication solution. Authenticate verifies user identity using a combination of hardened factors such as a PIN, a Bluetooth signal from the user's phone or a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, making employee logins many times more secure than traditional password logins. The new integrated graphics engine and hardwired security features of the Kaby Lake chips will likely make it appealing to businesses that were already looking to replace their aging IT infrastructures.

Updated January 04, 2017. The next generation of Qualcomm Technologies' Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC) will be far smaller, thinner and more power-efficient than than the previous version. It will also support faster wireless connectivity for mobile computing, gaming and multimedia use, the company said yesterday. Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel.

Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog.

The architectural improvements in the Snapdragon 835 will pave the way for a new wave of capabilities in smartphones, virtual reality (VR) gear, Bluetooth devices, 4G connectivity and security-focused authentication, Cheng said. The improved computing power of the new SoC will also enable smarter and more dynamic machine learning applications, he added. One of the first VR devices to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 will be Osterhout Design Group's R-8 and R-9 smart glasses, both set to hit the market later this year. Unveiled at CES yesterday, the devices will allow wearers to view movies and videos, play games and read articles and books, among other uses. Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds.

The company looks to be trying to get a head start on competitors with 5G, the next big mobile connectivity standard, by giving manufacturers a way to test 5G in their upcoming products. While there's been no publicly agreed upon standard for 5G networks as yet, Intel is helping things along with its latest modem, and is likely hoping to become a major supplier for 5G technology in the future. Related: CES 2017 Recently, the company has been making investments in drones and self-driving cars, two products that could benefit from 5G tech. And when it comes to self-driving cars, Intel's previously announced partnership with BMW and Mobileye will soon yield a fleet of 40 test vehicles, which will hit the road in the second half of 2017. The companies announced the project at CES in Las Vegas, following the announcement of their partnership back in July. Related: What is 5G? A BMW engineer works on an autonomous system The three firms say they have already developed a “scalable architecture” for autonomous driving – a technology they hope will eventually be used by other manufacturers and developers. Intel says the system is scalable because it can be used either as discreet modules at the most basic level or an entire autonomous driving system. The project to test 40 vehicles will, according to BMW, be carried out “globally under real traffic conditions," though just where the tests will take place remains unclear. Related: Who's to blame when robot cars get it wrong? Explaining the benefits of the partnership, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said: “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform. "The car to cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behavior and is validated to the highest level of safety. “That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground. We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” Intel, BMW, and Mobileye say they plan to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years.

The German automaker will put 40 of its 7-Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7-Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. BMW engineer, André Mueller does an automated driving technology check. Photo: BMW Automakers and technology companies are rushing to form partnerships to compete against the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has clocked 2 million self-driving miles on public roads, and Tesla Motors Inc., with 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles. BMW is appealing to other carmakers to adopt its approach to help shoulder research costs, speed development by sharing data and ensure they don’t become also-rans. “Those who reach the finish line before you will have their tech become the basis of standardization,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. “This is why sharing is important.” Enabling vehicles to navigate without human input through cities requires them to see and understand complex situations more like people do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye brings expertise in cameras that model the surroundings while Santa Clara, California-based Intel wields computing capabilities to power artificial intelligence. The companies released details Wednesday in conjunction with CES 2017, the consumer-technology show in Las Vegas. Costly Technologies “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology – huge numbers of sensors in the car – so I think we will be the drivers anyway,” Froehlich said. “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best.” Carmakers could participate by buying sensors to install in their cars, or go deeper with equipment that helps crowd-source data from an autonomous-vehicle fleet, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Division. While Munich-based BMW’s main target is individual car owners, the technology will be available for ride-sharing fleets as well, Froehlich said. Auto manufacturers are pushing into so-called mobility services like car-sharing and ride-hailing to counter alternatives to private vehicle ownership. Partnerships Form BMW, which co-owns the DriveNow car-sharing venture with Sixt SE, will be jockeying for consumers’ attention against the likes of Uber Technologies Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, among others. Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last month, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. VW is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing. Revenue from car-sharing is projected to surge more than sevenfold to 4.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by 2021, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group Inc. Robo-taxis will make up 40 percent of automotive profits by 2030, more than selling vehicles to individuals, according to consulting company Roland Berger. Copyright 2017 Bloomberg.

The new Trident Z modules come in 8 GB and 16 GB sizes and are rated for operations at data rates beyond 3600 MT/s per pin. For Intel’s Kaby Lake and Z270 launch, G.Skill now offers various dual-channel kits with 16 GB (2×8 GB), 32 GB (4×8 GB, 2×16 GB) and 64 GB (4×16 GB) capacities designed to run in DDR4-3600, DDR4-3866, DDR4-4000, DDR4-4133 and DDR4-4266 modes at 1.35 V or 1.4 V (the top-of-the-range kit only). Due to rather high data rates, the new Trident Z kits come with rather looser CL17, CL18 or even CL19 timings. The modules support XMP 2.0 technology that simplifies setting of correct sub-timings on platforms that support this feature. For about a year now G.Skill has been using Samsung’s 8 Gb B-die ICs for its high-end DDR4 memory modules. Keeping in mind that companies tend to be cautious with new platforms and memory controllers, it is not surprising that the new DIMMs designed for the brand new CPUs are based on familiar chips made using 20 nm process technology. G.Skill's Memory Modules Designed for Intel's Kaby Lake Platform Speed CL Timing Voltage Kit Configuration Kit Capacity DDR4-3600 CL17 19-19-39 1.35 V 2×16 GB 4×16 GB 32 GB 64 GB DDR4-3866 CL18 19-19-39 2×8 GB 4×8 GB 16 GB 32 GB DDR4-3866 CL18 18-18-38 2×16 GB 32 GB DDR4-4000 CL18 19-19-39 2×8 GB 4×8 GB 16 GB 32 GB DDR4-4133 CL19 19-19-39 2×8 GB 16 GB DDR4-4133 CL19 21-21-41 4×8 GB 32 GB DDR4-4266 CL19 19-19-39 1.4 V 2×8 GB 16 GB Initially G.Skill will offer Kaby Lake-optimized memory modules with its regular aluminum heat spreaders, but eventually the company will expand the lineup with DIMMs featuring RGB lighting and other enhancements. G.Skill has tested its new memory modules (DDR4-4133 32 GB kit to be exact) on the ASUS ROG Maximus IX Formula motherboard and the Intel Core i5-7600K processor to ensure compatibility with the new CPUs, but everything should work on other Kaby Lake/Z270 configurations that plan to support high speed memory. Newegg already sells G.Skill’s Kaby Lake-optimized 16 GB DDR4-4266 memory kits (F4-4266C19D-16GTZ series) for $229.99. Other modules will hit the market shortly from now and more retailers will follow. Source: G.Skill Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Image: Roman.S-Photographer/Shutterstock BMW has revealed that its alliance with Intel and Mobileye will result in 40 self-driving test cars hitting the road by the second half of this year. At CES 2017 in Las Vegas, it emerged that the BMW 7 Series will employ cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye technologies during global trials starting in the US and Europe. Since revealing a partnership last year, the companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other carmakers to pursue state-of-the-art car designs and differentiated brands. This scales from individual key integrated modules to complete end-to-end solutions. IT is all systems GO at CES 2017 At CES this week, Intel revealed its new Go solution for autonomous driving, combining its expertise in processors and FPGA technologies with a scalable development and compute platform for carmakers. Intel’s Go platform scales from Atom to Xeon and utilises Arria FPGAs. Data centre technologies that support Intel Go include Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors, as well as the Intel Nervana platform for artificial intelligence and deep machine learning required for autonomous driving. As well as revealing the new Go platform for driverless vehicles, Intel also acquired a 15pc stake in Here, the mapping and location software firm formerly owned by Nokia, which is now co-owned by Audi, BMW and Daimler. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop the sensor fusion solution, creating a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar, and lidar sensors. “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” explained Klaus Fröhlich, member of the board of management for development at BMW AG. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialise self-driving vehicles. “Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. “This year, our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” Fröhlich added. BMW fleet on asphalt.

Credit: Stephen Lawson More like this Qualcomm's 5G preview: High frequencies, 5-gigabit speed Intel's Go supercomputer for cars points to a PC-like horsepower race Intel's siloed business units unify around IoT and connectivity Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods Intel has a disastrous history with smartphones. It fumbled a chance for its wares to be in Apple's first iPhone, and then quit making its Atom smartphone chip to focus on modems. But the company is now set to ship a groundbreaking modem that will deliver data-transfer rates many times faster than most wired internet connections. The chipmaker will start shipping its first 5G modem for testing in the second half this year. Beyond mobile devices, the modem could also be used in autonomous cars, servers, base stations, networking equipment, drones, robots, and other internet-of-things devices. In name, 5G is the successor to 4G in today's mobile devices, but it's significantly faster and more versatile. It will combine multiple wireless high-speed and low-bandwidth technologies and enable communications across an array of spectrum bands. New 5G networks are expected to be deployed starting in 2020. The Intel 5G Modem, as it's called, is designed to provide download speeds in excess of 5Gbps, which is five times faster than today's fastest 4G modem. It's also five times faster than Google Fiber, which offers speeds of up to 1Gbps. But don't expect the modem to be installed in smartphones immediately. It will be used mainly for testing on 5G network deployments. It will also be used to test possible 5G applications, still being explored in areas like automotive tech. The benefits of 5G are enormous. Download and upload speeds will go up for devices like drones, robots, smart devices, and industrial equipment. Faster networks will help autonomous cars communicate over long distances about weather and road conditions.  The technology will improve mobile health-care services, which need reliable connections for patient monitoring. It will also help IoT devices remain in constant contact with servers running analytics. Intel believes as wireless becomes ubiquitous, there will be more opportunities to put its 5G modems in devices. The 5G Modem is a big move for Intel when its mobile chip future was in question after many false starts. Intel's effort to put Atom chips into smartphones was a colossal failure, and the company wasted billions of dollars on the lost cause. Last year, it bailed out of the smartphone chip market and refocused on modems. Apple will reportedly use Intel's 4G modems in its next iPhone, and that's a major win for the company. Apple also uses modems from Qualcomm, which is considered ahead of Intel in modem technology. Qualcomm announced its first 5G modem, the Snapdragon X50, in October. Intel is slowly catching up, but Qualcomm also has the advantage by integrating high-speed modems inside its Snapdragon chips that power smartphones. Intel does not plan to offer Atom chips for smartphones anytime soon, though it has hinted that it could make such chips if opportunities arise. Intel until now provided FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) that could be programmed to mimic modems. But the 5G Modem will be needed to obtain results from real-world testing. The new 5G technology will be important for autonomous cars, which may make driving decisions by consulting remote servers to recognize objects, signs, and lights, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Intel also announced autonomous vehicle development kits ready for 5G at CES. Intel is also building an autonomous car with BMW and Mobileye that could be ready to hit the streets by 2021. It's possible that Intel will put its 5G modem in that car. Intel's 5G Modem supports the sub-6GHz band, where cellular networks typically operate. It also supports the 28GHz millimeter-wave band, which should enable deployment trials in U.S., South Korea, and Japan, Intel said. The 28GHz band allows for faster data transfers and is expected to be used for 5G networks.

The German luxury car maker teamed up with chip giant Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli computer vision company specializing in building driverless car technology, back in July when they first announced plans to put self-driving cars into full production by 2021. Speaking at a joint press conference at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, the three firms revealed that BMW 7 vehicles will “employ cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye technologies” as part of the trials that will take place in the U.S. and in Europe. In addition to their collaboration, the companies revealed that they have developed a “scalable architecture” that can be used by other carmakers — so in effect they’re working on a white-label platform that can be used by other brands. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles,” explained Klaus Fröhlich, member of the management board at BMW AG for Development. “Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies — to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions.” BMW first revealed its plans for self-driving cars last May when it discussed a futuristic concept car called the iNext, which it touted as its “innovation driver” for autonomous driving. And it’s the iNext that will form the building blocks of its autonomous driving strategy. “This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” continued Fröhlich. We’re starting to see a significant degree of collaboration between the automotive and technology industries — car companies typically don’t have the technological smarts to build self-driving cars, while technology companies don’t have the automotive capabilities. So partnerships like the one we’re seeing between BMW, Intel, and Mobileye is to be expected — self-driving cars will drive demand for high-end chips, which is where Intel comes into play. And self-driving cars need to be able to understand their environment, which is where Mobileye will help. That the trio is opening the platform to other companies also reveals that the race is on to become one of the default platforms powering the self-driving car industry. “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform,” added Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “The car-to-cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behavior and is validated to the highest level of safety. That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground.  We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” We saw a number of notable developments in the autonomous car realm last year. The world’s first public self-driving taxi service hit Singapore roads in August, courtesy of NuTonomy, with Uber following suit a month later in Pittsburgh. Uber’s foray into San Francisco in December was short-lived, however, with the company conceding defeat in its battle with California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.

Advertisement 2016 MacBook Design & Color You can buy the 2016 MacBook in four colors including Rose Gold. Apple finally delivers a pink MacBook. Technically it is a Rose Gold MacBook, but it still fits the bill and brings the MacBook color options in line with the iPad Pro and iPhone 6s. Overall the 2016 MacBook looks a lot like the 2015 MacBook. Both of these devices only include a single USB Type C port and a headphone jack for connectivity. There is no fan and no moving parts. The size and weight of the 2016 MacBook is the same as the 2015 MacBook, so if you’ve been longing for the older model, you already know the size and shape. The 2016 Macbook size and weight match the 2015 model. The MacBook is just over 2 pounds and is 13.1mm thick with a full size keyboard and a 12-inch Retina Display. This still uses the same keyboard as the 2015 MacBook, which means you get a full size keyboard, but there is not a lot of travel. It also uses a ForceTouch trackpad. 2016 MacBook Price The 2016 MacBook price starts at $1,299 for the base model with a 1.1 GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.2 GHz, 8GB of memory and 256GB of flash storage.

The other ready to buy option is $1,599 for a 1.2 GHz dual-core Intel Core m5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 2.7 GHz, 8GB of memory and 512GB of flash storage. Users can also choose to upgrade the processor to a 1.3 GHz dual-core Intel Core m7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1 GHz through a custom order that will not likely be in every store. The 2016 MacBook price is the same as the starting price of the current MacBook Pro. 2015 MacBook Price Cut There is no official 2015 MacBook Price cut since the company is no longer making that model. Users looking for a deal should check out the refurbished MacBook deals at Apple that cut the price to $929 for an entry-level model. The higher end 2015 MacBook models may not be worth the savings considering all the upgrades that the 2016 MacBook brings to the table. Best Buy offers $300 off the 2015 MacBook, dropping the price to $999 for the model with 256GB of storage and 8GB RAM.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Jan 4, 2017, 11:30am EST share tweet Linkedin BMW engineer, André Mueller, tests autonomous driving technology in a BMW 7 series sedan. BMW Live coverage from the year's biggest technology conference, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The year in tech starts here. 2017 is about to become overwhelmed with self-driving cars. Today, BMW, Intel, and Mobileye announced their intention to deploy 40 autonomous vehicles for testing on public roads in the second half of 2017. The cars — BMW 7 series equipped with Intel and Mobileye technology — will be on the roads in both the US and Europe for public trials, the companies say. 2017 is about to become overwhelmed with self-driving cars Six months ago, BMW first announced its intention to partner with Intel, which will supply processing power, and Mobileye, the Israeli supplier of driver-assistance systems and sensors that supplies a large percentage of the auto industry. At that time, the German automaker said it hoped to have autonomous vehicles available for purchase by 2021. Today’s announcement is that those vehicles will begin testing later this year. But BMW and its partners aren’t looking to just build self-driving 7 series sedans. The companies say they want to develop “scalable architecture” that can be adopted by other automakers and designers to plug into vehicles of different brands. All three companies are also pursuing their own self-driving projects independent of one another. BMW has said it will launch a flagship electric, self-driving model that it calls its "innovation driver" — the i NEXT — in 2021. Late last year, Intel vowed to spend $250 million over the next two years toward the development of autonomous vehicles. And previously, Mobileye said it was teaming up with Delphi, a leading auto supplier, to develop a near-complete autonomous driving system by 2019. The plan is to create a mass-market, off-the-shelf system that can be plugged into a variety of vehicle types, from smaller cars to SUVs. BMW, Intel, and Mobileye aren’t the only ones who will be testing self-driving cars this year. Since September, Uber has been offer rides in its autonomous vehicles to the public in Pittsburgh and briefly San Francisco, before running afoul of the state’s DMV. Ford, GM, and a variety of tech startups have been testing their own cars as well. And Tesla has said that all its new vehicles will come equipped with fully autonomous hardware — but won’t be activated until accruing millions more miles of test driving.

Its hopes rest on 5G, the upcoming wireless standard that’ll deliver even faster data connections to all of our devices. What exactly 5G is and how it’ll work is still under debate. But the broad strokes have been decided on by industry groups, so Intel is trying to get in early. Today Intel is announcing its first 5G modem, which is meant to let companies begin testing 5G data connections in their upcoming products, “including automotive, home broadband, mobile devices, and others,” according to Intel. Autonomous cars offer Intel a huge new market Intel seems to be hoping that by getting in the game early, and by offering the modem that companies use to test their 5G products, it’ll eventually become the go-to supplier for 5G radios. That’ll be harder than it sounds, as Intel is far from the only company with big plans for 5G. Qualcomm, for instance, has a major presence in LTE modems and is already testing 5G solutions with AT&T. AT&T just today announced additional plans to work with Qualcomm on 5G trials later this year. But the situation has been improving for Intel. This year, its LTE modems appeared in some versions of the iPhone 7. And separately, Intel is making big investments in drones and self-driving car systems, which its modems may end up being part of. Intel’s fight into the 5G market is starting today, but where it goes over the next couple years is what’ll matter. Deployment of 5G networks is expected to start in 2020, so it’ll be a few years before any of us get to use it — or see if Intel’s efforts pan out.

They’re affordable and quite good, Intel has now made them even better with the addition of new processors. It has also tweaked the design a bit and has also added a host of new ports to the mini-PCs for enhanced functionality. The new mini-PCs have been unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show 2017. Intel NUC mini-PCs are now powered by the company’s latest 7th generation desktop processors. The design has been changed as well and Intel has chucked in Thunderbolt 3 ports as well. The company has introduced five new NUC models with two running the new Core i3 processors, two on the Core i5, and just one model with the Core i7 processor. The mini-PCs will be available in two case sizes as there’s now a larger one that can support 2.5 inch SATA storage devices. The shorter case size is meant for PCIe SSDs. Despite their small size, they’re not lacking in connectivity options. Each NUC mini-PC features four USB 3.0 ports, microSD card slot, Thunderbolt 3 compatible USB Type-C port aside from the standard HDMI, audio, and Ethernet ports. Intel is yet to confirm pricing and availability for its new mini-PCs. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about CES, CES 2017 and Intel.

BMW, Intel and Mobileye will put 40 self-driving test cars on roads in 2017 Posted Jan 4, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Resolved to be better with money? Clarity Money launches with an app for that Automaker BMW is teaming up with suppliers Intel and Mobileye to deploy a fleet of test vehicles, numbering 40 in total, targeting a street date of sometime during the second half of 2017. The fleet deployment was announced Wednesday by the three partners at CES, and follows their July announcement of their initial decision to partner. Between July and now, BMW, Mobileye and Intel have created what they call a “scalable architecture” for autonomous driving, with the aim of making something that can be adopted by other developers working in the automotive space, and even by other carmakers. The scalability comes because the system can be used either as discreet, pick-and-choose modules at the most basic level, to an entire end-to-end autonomous driving system that leaves only user and product experience design to individual brands and potential clients. BMW says that this test will occur “globally under real traffic conditions,” so it’s likely the 40 vehicles will be deployed across more than one site. Intel’s Brian Krzanich explained in a press release that the chipmaker is seeing benefits in terms of speed of development and cost by teaming up with others like Mobileye and BMW to share the collective load of bringing autonomous systems to market. As you might expect, Intel is offering the computing component for this new joint platform, while BMW is handling “driving control and dynamics,” as well as safety validation, and Mobileye is doing computer vision processing and sensors, though its working with BMW on the sensor fusion model. BMW is targeting use of autonomous tech in its iNEXT model for 2021, but the joint partnership is looking to start rolling out hardware samples for the platform along with software updates across the next few years. Another entrant joining the real-world autonomous testing mix in 2017 is hardly surprising, but the combined talents of these three partners could make this a strong contender as a turn-key solution for smaller companies who want to mine the turn towards self-driving but don’t have the resources or time to build a system on their own.

The x86 giant aims to attract design wins in top 2018 smartphones for the first modem made in its 14 nm process. The plan is an aggressive effort to be early with a chip that supports 3GPP 5G standards. Engineers attending those meetings say the first phase of the 5G standard won’t be formally approved until at least May 2018. Intel is not alone in the rush to 5G. Its archrival , Qualcomm , announced late last year its X50 5G modem will sample in 2017. It uses eight 100-MHz channels, a 2x2 MIMO antenna array, adaptive beamforming techniques and 64 QAM to achieve a 90 dB link budget and works with separate 28 GHz transceiver and power management chips. The chip vendors aim to enable carriers who are racing to be first with pre-standard services they will market as 5G. “The operators are in a big hurry to announce they have 5G ahead of everyone else,” said Chris Taylor, director of wireless chip research at market watcher Strategy Analytics. “I think fixed wireless access over millimeter wave frequencies will come first, claiming to be 5G ahead of the standard ; , we saw this scenario with 4G,” Taylor said, noting regulators have not yet harmonized millimeter wave bands for 5G, though early trials generally are using 28 GHz. Intel bought its way into the smartphone modem business when it acquired Infineon’s wireless group that had lost a design win in the iPhone. After a long absence, Intel has returned to the top five in baseband revenue share rankings , according to a recent report from Strategy Analytics as a result of its design win in the Apple iPhone 7 last year. Qualcomm currently ships about half of all LTE modem chips. Samsung and Mediatek follow with a total of about 35% unit share, and Intel trails at 4%, Strategy Analytics estimates. “I personally think Qualcomm, Samsung , and Intel will have an early lead in 5G chips for user equipment , Mediatek hasn’t concentrated on 5G like the others,” said Taylor.

However, the headache problem is the speed of the WAN. A Dual WAN or even Multi-WAN routers are needed. As expected on Dual WAN router is the capability of load balancing routing service. The key players of the 5G solution, like Intel, Broadcom and QualComm should focus on the load balancing routing service in the 5G modem chip set as well. Otherwise, the bottle neck of the 5G modem is limited to 1 Gbps only. In some countries or cities, the fiber network WAN service becomes affordable nowadays. 2 or more fiber optics from two or more Internet Service Providers (ISP) does not cost too much. For home users and small business runners, multi-ISP with load balancing service can improve the network performance and reduce the service down time. 2.5G/5G/10G N-Base-T network system can help to improve the bottle neck problem. But it cannot help on the accident on the ISP. If the ISP or the WAN channel got trouble, the internet service would be stopped. Multi- WAN solution can resolve this problem.

It fumbled a chance to be in Apple's first iPhone, and then quit making its Atom smartphone chip to focus on modems. But the company is now set to ship a groundbreaking modem that will deliver data transfer rates many times faster than most wired internet connections. The chipmaker will start shipping its first 5G modem for testing in the second half this year. Beyond mobile devices, the modem could also be used in autonomous cars, servers, base stations, networking equipment, drones, robots, and other internet-of-things devices. In name, 5G is the successor to 4G in today's mobile devices, but it's significantly faster and more versatile. It will combine multiple wireless high-speed and low-bandwidth technologies and enable communications across an array of spectrum bands. New 5G networks are expected to be deployed starting in 2020. The Intel 5G Modem, as it's called, is designed to provide download speeds in excess of 5Gbps, which is five times faster than today's fastest 4G modem. It's also five times faster than Google Fiber, which offers speeds of up to 1Gbps. But don't expect the modem to be installed in smartphones immediately. It will be used mainly for testing on 5G network deployments. It will also be used to test possible 5G applications, still being explored in areas like automotive tech. The benefits of 5G are enormous. Download and upload speeds will go up for devices like drones, robots, smart devices, and industrial equipment. Faster networks will help autonomous cars intercommunicate over long distances about weather and road conditions.  The technology will improve mobile health-care services, which need reliable connections for patient monitoring. It will also help IoT devices remain in constant contact with servers running analytics. Intel believes as wireless becomes ubiquitous, there will be more opportunities to put its 5G modems in devices. The 5G Modem is a big move for Intel when its mobile chip future was in question after many false starts. Intel's effort to put Atom chips into smartphones was a colossal failure, and the company wasted billions of dollars on the lost cause. Last year, it bailed out of the smartphone chip market and refocused on modems. Apple will reportedly use Intel's 4G modems in its next iPhone, and that's a major win for the company. Apple also uses modems from Qualcomm, which is considered ahead of Intel in modem technology. Qualcomm announced its first 5G modem, the Snapdragon X50, in October. Intel is slowly catching up, but Qualcomm also has the advantage by integrating high-speed modems inside its Snapdragon chips that power smartphones. Intel does not plan to offer Atom chips for smartphones anytime soon, though it has hinted that it could make such chips if opportunities arise. Intel until now provided FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) that could be programmed to mimic modems. But the 5G Modem will be needed to obtain results from real-world testing. The new 5G technology will be important for autonomous cars, which may make driving decisions by consulting remote servers to recognize objects, signs, and lights, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Intel also announced autonomous vehicle development kits ready for 5G at CES. Intel is also building an autonomous car with BMW and Mobileye that could be ready to hit the streets by 2021. It's possible that Intel will put its 5G modem in that car. Intel's 5G Modem supports the sub-6GHz band, where cellular networks typically operate. It also supports the 28GHz millimeter-wave band, which should enable deployment trials in U.S., South Korea, and Japan, Intel said. The 28GHz band allows for faster data transfers and is expected to be used for 5G networks.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 4, 2017 -- 15:33 GMT (07:33 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage Intel, best known for the processors behind PCs, servers and data center gear, now wants to be the brains behind autonomous vehicles. The chip giant at CES 2017 launched a new brand, Intel GO, that's designed for autonomous driving and aim to link cloud computing, connectivity and the car. To back up its efforts, Intel is launching two development kits to connect GO with Atom and Xeon processors. Intel said its GO effort will provide the first 5G-ready development platform. The company also launched its 5G modem at CES. CNET's Stephen Shankland has the deep dive and the strategy details. As for partnerships, Intel is teaming up with BMW and Mobileye to have 40 autonomous vehicles on the roads by the second half of the year. Intel announced a partnership with BMW and Mobileye in July. The Intel moves come as the company bought a 15 percent of HERE, a digital map and location services company. Here's where Intel sees its platform in the automotive food chain. And here's the catch. Intel's move into the autonomous vehicle market is likely to face the same challenges it had with smartphones and mobile devices. The short version is that ARM-based chips dominate the market and Qualcomm recently outlined plans to acquire NXP largely for its footprint in the automotive industry. In other words, Intel will push ahead in the auto market, but will need to forge new relationships similar to what it had to do in the smartphone market.

Alongside the 5G Modem, the chipmaker also announced the Intel GO automotive 5G platform. The Intel 5G modem will be another building block in its ambitious move to have an end to end 5G solution ready in time for the commercial 5G rollout in 2020. The Intel 5G Modem is expected to sample in the second half of 2017 and move into production soon afterwards. But the technology is expected to go commercial only by 2020. Intel has however begun work with some of its partners such as BMW, Nokia, Vodafone, GE and others in deploying 5G technology across the different building blocks. Intel 5G modem has begun with spectrum trials and deployments across different markets in the world. The Intel 5G baseband chip supports 28GHz mmWave as well as sub-6GHz bands. With the two bands Intel is looking at offering ultra-wideband operations while enabling multi-gigabit throughput with ultra-low latency for multiple use case scenarios. The 5G modem pairs both the sub-6GHz 5G radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) as well as the 28GHz 5G RFIC to ensure all global markets are covered. The Intel 5G RFIC is expected to sample in the first half of 2017. The 5G modem aims to achieve speeds of 5Gbps and over. It will also be paired with LTE modems such as Intel XMM 7360 to provide 4G fallback in areas where 5G may not be working. Considering 5G proliferation will cover various areas of application, Intel is going in with a use-case driven approach. The three areas it has identified include: Enhanced mobile broadband which includes using Wireless Broadband at home with last mile fiber connectivity, Virtual reality / Augmented reality / Merged reality applications and gaming, mobile offices, 4K/8K streaming and so on. Massive machine-to-machine connectivity includes using narrow band IoT networking where the data transmitted isn’t large, but area covered is huge. This will work in Smart City implementation of smart meters, smart traffic management as well as with Smart Agriculture where data will be provided on key aspects such as crop yield, weather and so on. The third area involves ultra reliable and extremely low latency networks (less than 1ms) which involve areas such as healthcare, drones used during disaster recovery efforts and autonomous vehicles where high latency could mean a matter of life and death. Intel GO Autonomous platform Image Credits: REUTERS Alongside its 5G modem, Intel also announced its ambitions to get into the autonomous car segment with the Intel GO Automotive 5G platform, which is an industry-first 5G-ready test platform for the auto industry. This platform has been built to allow car makers to develop and test a wide range of use cases and applications for autonomous vehicles ahead of the expected 5G rollout in 2020. The Intel GO platform will also help Intel combine autonomous driving with its other 5G building blocks in the compute, wireless technology, network connectivity and data centre space. Intel has partnered with automotive supplier Denso, with who it will share a new stereo vision solution for automakers using Intel Cyclone V SoC which will assist cars to make emergency braking decisions based on data coming in from the multiple camera sensors onboard the car. In the future, with 5G in place, the feeds coming in from the multiple cameras should not face a bottleneck, thereby letting the autonomous vehicle make a decision to brake within milliseconds. Intel is also working on an autonomous car project with BMW and MobileEye and is looking at a 2021 launch. 4G Fallback According to the Intel representative, Asha Keddy, vice president, communications and devices group, 4G chips will also be used alongside 5G chips in some use cases. For instance, when the user is not present in a fixed location, while using a smartphone for instance, there will initially be a separate 4G and 5G chip. This is to ensure that in areas where there is no 5G connectivity, there is seamless fall back to 4G . “Depending on the vertical or use case, 4G fall back may or may not be required. For instance, gaming or broadband to home will not require fallback as they are more localised use cases. Once the area is covered with mmWave, you can have extremely high bandwidth. As time goes on and more parts of the globe are covered with 5G networks, there will be less need for fallback to 4G,” said Keddy. 5G rollout in India Intel said it is working with a lot of universities and industries to deploy 5G in some applications, but was not specific about it. According to Intel, 5G rollout in India depends a lot on the spectrum availability and how keen the leading operators are. Intel believes that India can accelerate the use of 5G in a lot of verticals, and sooner than other parts of the world. IoT will be a major driver for 5G in India. IoT automation in cities for solving some endemic issues such as traffic management, power shortages, agricultural data distribution and so on are areas where 5G deployment could give a lot of information, studying which decisions can be taken accordingly. Network Congestion According to Intel, the bandwidth of 800MHz can handle several Gigabits of data, which in effect translates to more capacity. Other way to reduce network congestion is by having efficient algorithms which will manage sub-channelisation depending on the different technologies under work. Another area which could reduce network congestion is intelligent network distribution. For instance, using cloud only when required and at other times relying on device to device data transfer. Commercial 5G rollout is still some years away. But investments in the space have already started. Now, with the two chip-making giants Intel and Qualcomm releasing their 5G modems, it is now time for their deployment and trials.

Auto Tech by Stephen Shankland January 4, 2017 6:45 AM PST @stshank Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show Enlarge Image Intel CEO Brian Krzanich opens the door for Elmar Frickenstein, leader of BMW's electronics work, at a 2016 Intel conference.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET It's go time for Intel. The company that almost certainly made the chip in your PC wants to be the one that also makes the chip for your self-driving car. To that end, it's launching a new product brand, Go, that encompasses its processors, its coming high-speed 5G radio communication links and the software it'll offer so programmers can make it all useful. It's not clear whether the Go brand will mean you'll see an "Intel Inside" sticker on your next car's dashboard. But the plan does show how seriously the tech industry is taking the computerization of cars. Computers have seized onto our work, school and home lives, but they've remained largely peripheral to how we experience cars. Lots of chips are hidden away in fuel injection systems and antilock brakes, and we can use Bluetooth to hear phone calls on the car stereo. Intel, though, wants to be part of the radical digital overhaul that's only just beginning with cars. In November, Intel formed a new automated driving group, gave it a $250 million R&D budget and named Doug Davis to lead it. At this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it announced it's acquiring a 15 percent stake in digital mapping company Here to boost its self-driving car work, it'll tout its new Go brand along with efforts to expand into new growth markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Despite its manufacturing prowess, Intel missed out on the overhaul of another big market, phones. Establishing its brand outside the PC market also will be hard -- especially with rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm, which is trying to spend $39 billion to buy NXP Semiconductors, a chipmaker with lots of expertise in automotive computing tech. "The brand inside a vehicle doesn't matter," said David Kanter, chip analyst with the Linley Group and Real World Technologies. "People care about Mercedes, Tesla or Toyota, not NXP, Intel or Nvidia." Digital driving Computerization is remaking driving. An array of sensors -- lasers, radar, conventional cameras -- will make cars aware of what's around them, with computers to make sense of the raw data. That data will let self-driving cars decide when to turn, brake and change lanes, and it'll let them share data through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links the US government wants in all cars. Cars will need network links for refreshing maps and fetching updates to block the latest security threats, too. And even if it's a long time before computers supplant human drivers, voice interfaces like Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa are mature enough today to cue up the latest album or podcast without you taking your hands from the wheel. Manufacturers will probably spend between $1,000 and $1,500 on chips to build a modern car, Kanter estimates -- "even higher for autonomous vehicles, which will need more impressive sensors, communications and computation," he said. Enlarge Image Intel plans to send prototypes of its 5G communication chips to auto industry partners in the second half of 2017.Photo by Intel Intel chips and wireless links Intel wants to supply all kinds of processors for cars, Davis said. That includes tiny Quark models, midrange A3900 models to run dashboard displays, high-end Xeon models for self-driving tasks and unusual field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips that can be good at bridging between modern computers and the years-old standards that car electronics still use. For communications, Intel wants to supply 5G chips -- those that'll replace today's fourth-generation technology. Today's 4G networks are handy for phones, but 5G proponents promise all manner of revolutions -- superfast home broadband, an internet of things bringing networks far beyond phones and laptops, and augmented reality glasses that populate the real world with computer-generated video game characters. 5G is a big deal at CES, and just about any other large tech show these days. And Intel is hardly the only interested party. Network equipment maker Ericsson announced a partnership on Wednesday to test 5G cars this year with carrier Orange and the French automaker behind the Peugeot and Citroen brands. The zippy data-transfer speeds of 5G will let cars fetch updated map data, and short communication delays will mean it can handle V2V communications, Davis said. "5G has the low latency that would meet those requirements," he said. It's not yet clear which standards will be used when cars chat among themselves, though: the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration has signed up for a variation of Wi-Fi standards called dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Cars talking to cars V2V could help cars share information. Two cars passing in opposite directions in rural Iowa, for instance, could exchange information about the last 10 miles they'd each driven -- as long as they had a fast-enough connection. "That's a lot of data you want to exchange in short period of time," Davis said. It's just the sort of thing that 5G should be good for -- once the standard is done. The technology is taking years to develop, but Intel plans to deliver prototype 5G chips in the second half of 2017 so auto partners can see what's possible sooner. Intel partners in the auto market include BMW, Chinese internet company Baidu and auto technology provider Delphi. Its chips are used in hundreds of advanced prototype self-driving cars, and 33 top-tier automotive companies have picked its products for their designs. It's not domination as in the PC market, but it's a start.

It fumbled a chance to be in Apple's first iPhone, and then quit making its Atom smartphone chip to focus on modems. But the company is now set to ship a groundbreaking modem that will deliver data transfer rates many times faster than most wired internet connections. The chipmaker will start shipping its first 5G modem for testing in the second half this year. Beyond mobile devices, the modem could also be used in autonomous cars, servers, base stations, networking equipment, drones, robots, and other internet-of-things devices. In name, 5G is the successor to 4G in today's mobile devices, but it's significantly faster and more versatile. It will combine multiple wireless high-speed and low-bandwidth technologies and enable communications across an array of spectrum bands. New 5G networks are expected to be deployed starting in 2020. The Intel 5G Modem, as it's called, is designed to provide download speeds in excess of 5Gbps, which is five times faster than today's fastest 4G modem. It's also five times faster than Google Fiber, which offers speeds of up to 1Gbps. But don't expect the modem to be installed in smartphones immediately. It will be used mainly for testing on 5G network deployments. It will also be used to test possible 5G applications, still being explored in areas like automotive tech. The benefits of 5G are enormous. Download and upload speeds will go up for devices like drones, robots, smart devices, and industrial equipment. Faster networks will help autonomous cars intercommunicate over long distances about weather and road conditions.  The technology will improve mobile health-care services, which need reliable connections for patient monitoring. It will also help IoT devices remain in constant contact with servers running analytics. Intel believes as wireless becomes ubiquitous, there will be more opportunities to put its 5G modems in devices. The 5G Modem is a big move for Intel when its mobile chip future was in question after many false starts. Intel's effort to put Atom chips into smartphones was a colossal failure, and the company wasted billions of dollars on the lost cause. Last year, it bailed out of the smartphone chip market and refocused on modems. Apple will reportedly use Intel's 4G modems in its next iPhone, and that's a major win for the company. Apple also uses modems from Qualcomm, which is considered ahead of Intel in modem technology. Qualcomm announced its first 5G modem, the Snapdragon X50, in October. Intel is slowly catching up, but Qualcomm also has the advantage by integrating high-speed modems inside its Snapdragon chips that power smartphones. Intel does not plan to offer Atom chips for smartphones anytime soon, though it has hinted that it could make such chips if opportunities arise. Intel until now provided FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) that could be programmed to mimic modems. But the 5G Modem will be needed to obtain results from real-world testing. The new 5G technology will be important for autonomous cars, which may make driving decisions by consulting remote servers to recognize objects, signs, and lights, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Intel also announced autonomous vehicle development kits ready for 5G at CES. Intel is also building an autonomous car with BMW and Mobileye that could be ready to hit the streets by 2021. It's possible that Intel will put its 5G modem in that car. Intel's 5G Modem supports the sub-6GHz band, where cellular networks typically operate. It also supports the 28GHz millimeter-wave band, which should enable deployment trials in U.S., South Korea, and Japan, Intel said. The 28GHz band allows for faster data transfers and is expected to be used for 5G networks. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Image: AR Pictures/Shutterstock Intel has become the latest investor in the mapping and location software firm Here, purchasing a 15pc stake to develop the company’s autonomous car tech. Once owned by telecoms giant Nokia, Here was sold to a number of major German auto manufacturers back in 2015 for a sum of €2.5bn, as part of a future of connected cars and, more specifically, autonomous vehicles. Now Intel is getting in on the action, with news that the chip manufacturer is to purchase a 15pc stake in Here as part of a shared technology agreement. This would appear to follow on from Intel’s announcement in November that it had plans to invest $250m in autonomous vehicle tech over the course of the next two years. As part of the deal, both companies will jointly develop highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture to support real-time updates of HD maps for highly and fully automated driving, and also to explore opportunities in IoT and machine learning. The end goal of this project will be to make autonomous driving as safe and predictable as possible, and increase a car’s understanding of its location, narrowing metres down to centimetres. Follows Chinese investment Intel’s decision to purchase a significant stake in Here follows just over a week after a joint bid from Asia’s Tencent, NavInfo and GIC, which saw the trio purchase a 10pc stake in the company to allow it expand into the Chinese market. “A real-time, self-healing and HD representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms,” said Edzard Overbeek, Here CEO. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate Here’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.” Intel will now work with Audi, BMW and Daimler to test the architecture initially, but has said that it will look to make the technology available to other auto manufacturers at some point in the future.

The DinoPC Raptor 2 uses Core i7-7700K with dual GTX 1080 graphics cards, all wrapped up in a liquid cooling system that aims to keep the CPU running stably at a solid 5.0GHz – which sounds like an enticing proposition. The latest Core i7, overclocked and backed up with a pair of GTX 1080s? Wowza. Time we put this high end gaming PC through the ringer and play a bunch of games at 4K resolution to see whether or not it delivers on a massive promise. Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p HERE DinoPC Raptor 2 Specification: Case: Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX Tempered Glass Black Case Vinyl: Black Carnivore Skin Vinyl CPU: Intel Core i7-7700K CPU Overclocking: 5.0GHz – Stable OC on all CPU cores RAM: 16GB Corsair 3200MHz Vengeance White LED DDR4 (2x8GB) Graphics card: 2 x Palit NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB in SLI Overclocked Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus Z270X Gaming 7 M.2 Super-fast SSD: Samsung 512GB Polaris SM961 M.2 PCIe NVMe Hard Drive: Western Digital 2TB Black PSU: 750W Corsair RMx Fully Modular Sound Card: On-board 7.1 Audio Operating System: Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Warranty: 5 Year Silver Warranty Full custom EKWB water cooling: EK 360 and 240mm radiators EK-XRES 140 Revo D5 PWM Pump with reservoir EK-FC1080 GTX JetStream – Nickel full cover GPU waterblock EK-FC1080 GTX JetStream Backplate – Nickel backplate EK-Supremacy EVO – Full Nickel CPU Block EK-FC Terminal DUAL Parallel 3-Slot – Plexi PrimoChill PrimoFlex Onyx Black 1/2″ Tubing EK Matt Black Connectors 6 x Corsair ML120 White LED Magnetic Fans DinoPC RGB LED Remote controlled kit But first let’s just look at the Raptor 2. It is built in a Phanteks Enthoo Evolv ATX Tempered Glass case, which is one of our favourite cases of all time. There is nowhere to hide with this case as it has glass on both sides and every aspect of the build is on show. You get a good view of the EKWB liquid cooling system and the combination of Onyx Black hose and Mayhems Pastel white fluid looks fetchingly retro. Add in the six white LED Corsair ML fans and the DinoPC lighting kit and the simple fact is that Raptor 2 looks glorious. If, for some reason, you don’t like Mayhems White you can simply ask DinoPC to fill the system with a different colour, which primarily changes the cosmetic look of the tube reservoir on top of the D5 pump. Click a button on the lighting control pad (it is DinoPC’s own system and works very well) and you can change the colour or the light pattern to make the PC appear quite different. The top and front panels of the case have been treated to a Black Carnivore Skin Vinyl wrap that looks fantastic. It is the hardware that is the star of the show and in particular the new CPU. Intel Core i7-7700K doesn’t appear much different to Skylake Core i7-6700K but we will accept the slightly faster, slightly more efficient CPU with thanks. Put it another way, at the start of 2017 the new 7th Gen. Intel hardware is the latest technology on offer and while you may get more grunt with Broadwell-E it is currently two generations behind the times. Core i7-6700K runs at 4.2 GHz and Turbos to 4.4GHz while the new Core i7-7700K Turbos to 4.5GHz. DinoPC has performed what looks like the world’s easiest overclock by increasing the CPU voltage to 1.32V, leaving the Power Limit at 91W TDP and raising the multiplier to 50x. The result is a straight 5.0GHz across all CPU cores. My colleague Luke Hill has published an analysis of both 7700k and 7600k Kaby Lake processors this week, so be sure to check out our front page for detailed analysis. DinoPC has also overclocked the two Palit GTX 1080s using MSI Afterburner. Each Raptor 2 system is different in regards to GPU overclock but they are all set at minimum 200MHz plus on Core and 300MHz plus on memory. In our review PC the Core boosts to 1733MHz and the memory to 5005MHz. Our single query about the hardware chosen by DinoPC is that Gigabyte appears to be rebranding itself as Aorus, apparently to compete with Asus Republic of Gamers and the idea of an Aorus Z270X motherboard simply doesn’t sound right to our ears. Gigabyte Z270X is perfectly satisfactory, thanks. As you will see in our video (above) we had two minor snags with Raptor 2 that we put down to the newness of Kaby Lake. The first is that Ashes of the Singularity refused to run at Crazy settings in DX12 mode with multiple GPUs. The other was that the fans would often run at full speed when the system started and required a restart for PWM control to become effective. We are quite sure this will be cured by a BIOS update from Gigabyte/Aorus, hopefully in the near future. We tested the DinoPC Raptor 2 system at 4K as there was no point messing around with lower screen resolutions. Performance was a notch above the PC Specialist Vortex VI (review HERE) which is a laptop that combines Core i7-6700K with dual GTX 1080 GPUs. That may not sound like a massive vote for the Raptor 2 however the Vortex VI is remarkable and the Raptor 2 is better. Furthermore, you can bet there will driver and BIOS updates that help the new Kaby Lake system to leap further ahead. Gaming at 4K on DinoPC Raptor 2 is a fabulous experience. No doubt you can also edit videos and encode movies but that’s not quite so much fun. Power draw Idle                  105W 3D Mark         560W Cooling Performance. Dino PC has used a 360mm radiator in the roof of the Phanteks case and a 240mm at the front with five 120mm Corsair ML fans and a sixth fan in the exhaust position at the rear. The D5 pump moves fluid through an EK-Supremacy EVO Nickel CPU Block and the graphics cards are fitted with EK GTX JetStream GPU waterblocks and backplates. This is top grade hardware that could only be improved marginally with a change to the fans. Basically it is as good as it gets. The two GTX 1080 GPUs run nice and cool and top out below 50 degrees C. The Core i7-7700K is hotter and hits 71 degrees under extreme load, however that is pretty good going for an overclocked LGA115x CPU. At first glance the EKWB cooling system is massively over the top for a compact ATX case such as Phanteks Evolv Glass however the temperature figures show that DinoPC has made some excellent choices. Acoustics performance. With the current BIOS acoustic performance is a matter of pot luck. If the fans run at full speed the PC is annoyingly noisy. When PWM control works correctly it is a delight. We have to hope that a BIOS update will fix this questionable behaviour. Closing Thoughts We were deeply impressed by the DinoPC Raptor 2. It looks amazing and packs in the latest CPU and GPU technology. If Skylake X were expected any time soon or we had the least idea whether AMD Ryzen was going to live up to the hype then we might advise you to hold tight and delay your buying decision. As things stand, if you’re looking for a top notch gaming PC that is bang up to date, the DinoPC Raptor 2 delivers exactly what you want. Even if those other two expected-some-time-in-2017 platforms turn out to be superb, the Raptor 2 will still keep you going until at least the next upgrade. The extensive cooling system looks superb and delivers tangible benefits as the overclocked CPU and GPUs run much cooler than you would expect with air cooling or an All In One. Clearly you can save a good deal of cash if you go down that route and stick to stock clocks but your PC will undoubtedly run hotter and you will have a very different experience. There are minor matters such as the colour of the coolant. Speaking for myself, I like the Pastel White but would prefer clear tubing that shows it off fully. Having said that, the Onyx Black is very nice indeed. Also, I would probably choose to lose the Corsair ML fans with their LED lighting in favour of duller but more effective EKWB Vardars. The point here is that we are splitting hairs. These are trivial details that tinker at the margins and change nothing about the fundamentals of the Raptor 2. It is a damn fine gaming PC and if you buy it we are confident you will be very, very satisfied. The DinoPC Raptor 2 has yet to get a link on the official website due to Intel NDA. We have heard that the price will be around the £3,500 mark and the purchase page will be updated when DinoPC is allowed to sell Kaby Lake. Discuss on our Facebook page HERE. Pros: Raptor 2 looks amazing. Overclocked 5.0GHz Core i7-7700K. Dual GTX 1080 graphics cards with minor overclocked settings. Extensive EKWB cooling system does a fabulous job. Top quality system build. The Phanteks Evolv Glass case is superb. DinoPC lighting system works well. Cons: The system needs some form of update to sort out some fan control issues (possibly the BIOS, possibly the fans). Unconvinced about the Corsair ML fans. A better CPU may be coming in a few months time. KitGuru says: In an ideal world everyone would own a DinoPC Raptor 2.

It fumbled a chance to be in Apple's first iPhone, and then quit making its Atom smartphone chip to focus on modems. But the company is now set to ship a groundbreaking modem that will deliver data transfer rates many times faster than most wired internet connections. The chipmaker will start shipping its first 5G modem for testing in the second half this year. Beyond mobile devices, the modem could also be used in autonomous cars, servers, base stations, networking equipment, drones, robots, and other internet-of-things devices. In name, 5G is the successor to 4G in today's mobile devices, but it's significantly faster and more versatile. It will combine multiple wireless high-speed and low-bandwidth technologies and enable communications across an array of spectrum bands. New 5G networks are expected to be deployed starting in 2020. The Intel 5G Modem, as it's called, is designed to provide download speeds in excess of 5Gbps, which is five times faster than today's fastest 4G modem. It's also five times faster than Google Fiber, which offers speeds of up to 1Gbps. But don't expect the modem to be installed in smartphones immediately. It will be used mainly for testing on 5G network deployments. It will also be used to test possible 5G applications, still being explored in areas like automotive tech. The benefits of 5G are enormous. Download and upload speeds will go up for devices like drones, robots, smart devices, and industrial equipment. Faster networks will help autonomous cars intercommunicate over long distances about weather and road conditions.  The technology will improve mobile health-care services, which need reliable connections for patient monitoring. It will also help IoT devices remain in constant contact with servers running analytics. Intel believes as wireless becomes ubiquitous, there will be more opportunities to put its 5G modems in devices. The 5G Modem is a big move for Intel when its mobile chip future was in question after many false starts. Intel's effort to put Atom chips into smartphones was a colossal failure, and the company wasted billions of dollars on the lost cause. Last year, it bailed out of the smartphone chip market and refocused on modems. Apple will reportedly use Intel's 4G modems in its next iPhone, and that's a major win for the company. Apple also uses modems from Qualcomm, which is considered ahead of Intel in modem technology. Qualcomm announced its first 5G modem, the Snapdragon X50, in October. Intel is slowly catching up, but Qualcomm also has the advantage by integrating high-speed modems inside its Snapdragon chips that power smartphones. Intel does not plan to offer Atom chips for smartphones anytime soon, though it has hinted that it could make such chips if opportunities arise. Intel until now provided FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) that could be programmed to mimic modems. But the 5G Modem will be needed to obtain results from real-world testing. The new 5G technology will be important for autonomous cars, which may make driving decisions by consulting remote servers to recognize objects, signs, and lights, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel. Intel also announced autonomous vehicle development kits ready for 5G at CES. Intel is also building an autonomous car with BMW and Mobileye that could be ready to hit the streets by 2021. It's possible that Intel will put its 5G modem in that car. Intel's 5G Modem supports the sub-6GHz band, where cellular networks typically operate. It also supports the 28GHz millimeter-wave band, which should enable deployment trials in U.S., South Korea, and Japan, Intel said. The 28GHz band allows for faster data transfers and is expected to be used for 5G networks.

Wie die kleinen Prozessoren der Y- und der U-Serie versprechen auch diese Modelle deutlich höhere Taktraten bei gleichbleibendem Verbrauch und spielen HEVC mit Profil Main 10 in Hardware ab. Nach dem Test des Core i7-7500U mit 15 Watt im November standen ComputerBase im Vorfeld der Ankündigung Notebooks mit Core i7-7700HQ und Core i7-7820HK zur Verfügung. Wie schnell die beiden neuen CPUs sind, zeigt dieser Test. Der Test von Core i7-7700K und Core i5-7600K ist bereits am Dienstag erschienen. Kaby Lake-H mit 45 Watt TDP Die neue Oberklasse bei den verlöteten Notebook-Prozessoren mit 45 Watt TDP hört auf den Codenamen Kaby Lake-H. Anfang 2017 gibt es die schnellsten Notebook-Varianten aber nur als Lösung mit einfacher Intel-HD-Grafik – Iris mit doppelt so viel Shadern und eDRAM wie beim alten Core i7-6970HQ gibt es vorerst nicht. Weil die kleinere Grafikeinheit mit unverändert 24 Shadern 50 MHz höher takten darf und HEVC (H.265) mit Profil Main 10 unterstützt, hat Intel auch deren Bezeichnung von HD Graphics 530 auf HD Graphics 630 angepasst. Der Die ist kaum größer als ein Fingernagel Bild 1 von 2 Bei gleichzeitig 200 MHz mehr Basis- und 300 MHz mehr Turbotakt kosten die neuen 45-Watt-CPUs laut Intels Preisliste so viel wie die jeweiligen Vorgänger. Der Taktzuwachs fällt dabei kleiner aus als bei den U-Prozessoren, die mit 15 Watt TDP um 400 und mit 28 Watt TDP gar um bis zu 600 MHz im Turbo zulegen.

Mit dem Taktaufschlag erreicht das neue Einstiegsmodell in die Core-i7-Serie annähernd die Taktraten des alten Topmodells Core i7-6920HQ, wie er im MacBook Pro 15 Zoll mit Touch Bar bestellt werden kann. Anzeige Der ebenfalls getestete Core i7-7820HK bleibt dem Core i7-7700HQ um 100 MHz voraus und ist damit schneller als das letztjährige Topmodell. Diese Variante verfügt darüber hinaus über einen freien Multiplikator und zwei MB mehr Cache, verzichtet dafür aber auf vPro. Neben den neuen Kaby-Lake-H-CPUs hat Intel zur CES 2017 auch weitere Modelle mit 4,5, 15,0 und 28,0 Watt TDP vorgestellt. Eine separate Übersicht zeigt alle neuen Kaby-Lake-Prozessoren im Vergleich zum Vorgänger. Die Notebooks im Test ComputerBase standen zwei verschiedene Notebooks für den Test der beiden Prozessoren zur Verfügung. Der Core i7-7700HQ wurde von Asus mit dem neuen Gaming-Notebook GL753VD mit ebenfalls heute neu vorgestellter GeForce GTX 1050 für Notebooks mit 4 GB Speicher getestet. Der Core i7-7820HK wurde von einem anderen Hersteller bereitgestellt, dessen Notebooks noch in einem sehr frühen Vorserienstatus vorlagen. Obwohl der Prozessor bereits seine volle Leistung bereitstellen konnte, wird auf eine Nennung deshalb verzichtet. Das Asus GL753VD mit Intel Core i7-7700HQ Bild 1 von 4 Das Asus GL753VD besitzt ein 17,3 Zoll großes Full-HD-Display mit TN-Technologie und setzt auf die ebenfalls zur CES 2017 neu vorgestellte mobile GeForce GTX 1050 mit 4 GB GDDR5. 16 GB DDR4, 256 GB SSD- (M.2) und 1 TB HDD-Speicherplatz sind ab Werk verbaut. Ein optisches Laufwerk wird ebenfalls noch geboten. Die Kühlung von CPU und GPU übernehmen zwei Heatpipes, die beide Chips verbinden. Die an einen Radiator an der linken Seite abgeführte Wärme wird von einem Lüfter aus dem Notebook geblasen. Das Kühlsystem ist vergleichsweise schwach ausgelegt. Der Preis wird voraussichtlich bei 1.199 Euro liegen. Die kleinere 15-Zoll-Version mit ansonsten gleicher Ausstattung wird 1.099 Euro kosten.

Chip-making giant Intel will acquire a 15% stake in digital maps company HERE as it looks to develop technology for autonomous cars. Embedded navigation solutions provider Here was started by Nokia before it was bought by automakers including Audi, BMW and Daimler last year. Apart from the stake acquisition, the two companies have also agreed to collaborate on research and development in the areas of highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture for real time updates of high definition (HD) maps for automated driving. The companies are also looking to pursue opportunities that result in the development of edge-computing devices with location data. The two companies’ plan to develop a proof-of-concept architecture that could make autonomous driving safe and predictable to the biggest extent possible. Intel noted that, with tomorrow’s highly developed navigation technology, it could be possible to locate a vehicle within a few centimetres, in contrast to today’s technology which can locate a few meters away. With the development of such technology, it could be easier for autonomous and connected vehicles to precisely know their relative position on a road, thus making self-driving cars more reliable. HERE’s HD Live Map and its cloud service can offer autonomous vehicles data about obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision. The data can include real time traffic updates, road conditions and other factors. The two companies plan to make the architecture broadly available for automotive industry which could not only be integrated seamlessly but can also shorten the development time for automakers. Intel stated that it is poised to offer a secure, flexible and scalable technology for autonomous driving from vehicles to data centres. It plans to do this with its solutions in machine learning, in-vehicle computing and high speed wireless connectivity. With its collaboration with HERE, Intel expects to further its plans in location-based services, while achieving growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things. By working with Intel, HERE aims to introduce a universal solution to the auto industry with reduced complexities and long-term development costs. Here, Intel’s expertise in developing and optimising hardware can significantly help in bringing cloud-based algorithms to in-vehicle architectures. Intel and HERE are awaiting regulatory approval which is expected in the first quarter of this year. Intel stated that it will nominate its Automated Driving Group’s senior vice president and general manager Doug Davis to HERE’s supervisory board of directors, once the stake acquisition is completed.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel rolls out the rest of the Kaby Lake CPU family Intel rolls out the rest of the Kaby Lake CPU family By Joel Hruska on January 4, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Intel didn’t just launch the new Core i7-7700K desktop CPU, it made a comprehensive update to its entire product line. The initial Kaby Lake mobile refresh was limited to a handful of SKUs; with this launch Intel is bringing out a larger number of cores intended for every price point. The new chips are, for the most part, drop-in replacements for the Skylake SKUs Intel launched in 2015 and 2016, though most of the models feature at least a small clock jump over and above what Skylake offered. The slideshow below steps through each of Intel’s SKUs in some detail, but we’ll give you the 10,000-foot overview. Kaby Lake is priced nearly identically to Skylake in virtually every case, but the Core i5-7600K has a 3.8GHz base clock and a 4.2GHz turbo clock, whereas the Core i5-6700K was a 3.5GHz – 3.9GHz chip. These gains are preserved through most of the product stack; the 35W Core i5-7400T has a 2.4GHz base, 3GHz turbo, compared with the Core i5-6400T with its 2.2GHz base and 2.8GHz turbo. There’s a new nomenclature attached to many of Intel’s 15W and 28W CPUs. These new chips feature what Intel is calling “Iris Plus,” meaning they incorporate a 64MB EDRAM chip alongside the GPU core. The 128MB EDRAM cores that Intel has previously shipped with Skylake and Broadwell aren’t being carried over to the Iris Plus line, at least not for now. OEM uptake on these cores has never been high, even though they can improve integrated graphics performance by almost 100%. All of the new 7th-Generation chips support VP9 hardware decode, as well as supporting H.265 encode/decode completely in hardware. As a result, all of these cores are comparable with streaming 4K video from Netflix or any other service that agrees to use Windows PlayReady DRM via the Edge browser. Intel has already said it won’t bring its EDRAM to any desktop quad-core SKUs this cycle, so if you were hoping for a non-embedded chip with Iris Plus you’ll have to look for a Skylake-based core or consider the Broadwell-based Core i7-5775C, which does have the 128MB cache. Apart from improvements to media playback support, clock speed increases, and the Core i3-7350K (the first unlocked Core i3), the Kaby Lake refresh is a fairly standard update to Intel’s roadmap. A little more clock, a little more performance, and not much to specifically get excited about unless you’ve been waiting on an upgrade that was just a little faster than your 5-7 year-old system. Is it time for a new x86 architecture? I’m a bit torn over Kaby Lake. On the one hand, it’s a fine update as far as it goes. There’s not much reason for Skylake owners to upgrade, but review results from the 7700K show that it generally outperforms Devil’s Canyon from 2014, to say nothing of Sandy Bridge or even earlier chips. Squeezing an extra 8-10% out of Skylake in equivalent power envelopes is no small accomplishment given how hard it’s been to move the ball on x86 performance. At the same time, however, Intel has been working with Sandy Bridge-derived architectures since 2011 and doesn’t have much to show for it — at least, not compared with previous rates of performance improvements. A great deal of this is due to simple physics and the intrinsic difficulty of designing a core that is more efficient, draws the same amount of power (or less, ideally) and provides increased performance without resorting to clock speed gains to deliver it. In a talk several years ago, former Intel Chief Architect Bob Colwell estimated that modern chips are 50-60x more efficient than the original 8086 — but they clock 1,000x higher than that core (4GHz compared with 4MHz). For all the gains we’ve gotten from building better cores, the gains from clock speed are more than an order of magnitude higher. I mentioned this in the Core i7-7700K review, but it bears repeating: I have absolutely no inside knowledge that Intel is contemplating a new uarch and am not claiming it is. But it wouldn’t surprise me if the company does go this route, especially if Zen proves competitive against the 7th Generation core family. With Apple breathing down its neck with the iPad Pro and its old enemy preparing to return to the arena, it’s a good time to revisit old assumptions and see if new tricks can be found to boost perf, cut power, and deliver a superior product.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Intel announces new Kaby Lake processors, upgraded Macs likely in 2017 Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, January 4th, 2017, 05:34 Category: Hardware, iMac, Intel, Mac mini, MacBook Pro, News, Processors Over at CES, Intel formally announced its full lineup of 7th-generation Intel Core processors, known as Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake low-power Y-Series and U-Series processors were announced in late August, but today’s unveiling covers notebook and desktop chips that could be destined for many future Apple Macs. The new processors are built using the “14nm+” process and introduce new optimizations as compared to the previous 14nm Broadwell and Skylake chips. The company has cited that “Kaby Lake” will bring “double digit productivity performance increases” of up to 20 percent for gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops, compared to 2013 Haswell chips from Intel’s prior release cycle. With 4K and 360 degree content, customers can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks. Enhanced security, a new media engine, and improvements in VR and gaming are all advertised features. The new 28-watt U-Series chips are appropriate for a future 13-inch MacBook Pro notebook with the 7267U/7287U/7567U processors perhaps being used in 13-inch MacBook Pro machines this year. Those same chips are likely what Apple would use in a Mac mini update, as the Mac mini and the 13-inch MacBook Pro have traditionally included the same chips. Intel’s 45-watt H-Series processors could find their way into a future 15-inch MacBook Pro and the 7700HQ would be ideal for entry-level machines, while a mid-tier machine would use the 7820HQ and the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro would use the 7920HQ. Where desktops are concerned, the S-Series desktop chips, namely the 7500, the 7600 and the 7700K could be ideal for a 27-inch iMac. For the 21.5-inch iMac, Apple normally uses chips with higher-end integrated graphics, but Intel has not released Kaby Lake chips that are a clear upgrade for the smaller iMac machines. Apple could choose to use Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake chips for the 21.5-inch iMac, and in that case, would likely adopt the 6585R, 6685R, and 6785R chips, released six months ago. The Kaby Lake processors could be idea for the iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac mini, should Apple decide to update these units in 2017. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The company has made several adaptations to its CPU design, breaking its manufacturing tradition and further refining the Skylake architecture to create a new chip compatible with the LGA 1151 CPU socket. The new processors are similar to previous generations in many aspects, but do feature several improvements. Desktop processors This the first Intel architecture to break the tick-tock design model, offering a refinement of the 14nm manufacturing process used by Skylake and Broadwell. Intel’s 7th-gen processor lineup also includes the first unlocked Core i3 dual-core processor, the Core i3-7350K. Below are the specifications of the most powerful Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 7th-gen processors currently available. Intel’s full 7th-gen desktop range can be viewed here. Intel 7th-gen Processors Specifications Core i7-7700K Core i5-7600K Core i3-7350K Cores (Threads) 4 (8) 4 (4) 2 (4) Clock Speed 4.2GHz 3.8GHz 4.2GHz Turbo Speed 4.5GHz 4.2GHz N/A Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 L3 Cache 8MB 6MB 4MB TDP 91W 91W 60W Price $350 $243 $179 Motherboards The 7th-generation processors use the same CPU socket as Skylake, meaning you will be able to upgrade your Skylake processor without changing your motherboard. However, a new chipset series – the Z270 – has launched alongside the processors which offers added features, including more PCI Express lanes. The increased number of PCIe lanes means motherboard manufacturers can fit more bandwidth-heavy interfaces onto their devices, such as M.2, PCI, and USB 3.1 slots. Multiple motherboard manufacturers have released new products based on the Z270 chipset. Optane Memory Intel’s 7th-gen processors are also the first to support Intel’s Optane memory. Optane storage products are based on 3D XPoint technology, which is predicted to provide a massive improvement in storage speed over current solid state drives. Intel’s high-speed Optane SSDs are expected to launch later this year. Windows 10 Microsoft announced that Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform for Intel’s 7th-gen processors. This means that the new chips may not function properly on older Windows operating systems. Intel has confirmed there will be no official driver support for 7th-gen processors on Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1.

Here are some of the best SSDs you can buy in the UK for your PC and laptop By Andrew Harrison & Christopher Minasians | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments In this article we offer general storage- and SSD buying advice, before getting into the nitty gritty of SSD reviews. But if you just want to jump down to it, click here to go straight to our reviews of the best SSDs you can buy in the UK in 2017. Also see: Best Deals Best SSD 2017: SSDs buying advice Solid-state storage is standard-issue for storing data in tablets and smartphones, where it's relied upon for its tiny size and rugged nature. Those same virtues can be handy in desktop PCs and especially laptops too, but it’s the speed of an SSD (solid-state drive) compared to a traditional hard drive which is the biggest reason to upgrade to one. Instead of a fragile magnetic disk whirring at 90 or 120 times every second, SSDs store binary data on shock-resistant silicon chips. Some people use the word ‘memory' when they mean storage, but the lines are blurred with NAND flash technology, which is essentially non-volatile memory. In other words, RAM that keeps its memory even after you switch off the power. Besides being physically robust, silent, and smaller and lighter than any hard-disk drive, the big incentive to go flash remains sheer data-hurtling performance. The bits can be read and written hundreds and thousands of times faster from electronic flash memory then conventional hard-disk drives. This speed factor is about so much more than go-faster bragging rights though. Old-school desktop PC users may still battle over who has the fastest processor or the hottest graphics card, but SSD performance is more about the overall user experience – applications launch almost instantly, web pages spawn faster, and files copy in a fraction of the time. Put simply, and regardless of whether your processor has an Intel or AMD logo, the whole computer responds so much faster to your clicks. The main drawback in the past has been the steep price of entry to the premier-class storage club. (See all storage reviews.) Best SSD 2017: best value storage It's taken six years or more, but we are now at the state where the SSD is a truly affordable component for any computer user. And if your wallet won't even stretch to £100, just juggle your byte budget instead and get a 256- or 500GB SSD for £75 or less. Performance has swelled over the years – not just in the drag-race test of copying big files, but crucially with the way that small files are handled. And also in the way that a drive maintains itself, forever pruning and sweeping up the garbage of deleted files in the background. Much of the background housekeeping of a modern PC operating system is with the incessant background reading and writing of very small files of 4 kilobytes or smaller. It's the random access to these that can choke old disks that need to physically move a pickup head across spinning platters. We have reached a point where just about any SSD you put into a computer to replace a hard disk will transform your experience. But for those seeking the very best performance, there's still a case for finding the fastest rather than just choosing the cheapest. And that fastest metric is now more about small-file transfers, which we can measure by the number of input and output operations capable in one second – otherwise known as IOPS. The best SATA-based flash drives are returning peak figures around 100,000 IOPS, made possible by the way that data streams can be paralleled together, a major asset of flash over hard disks. Content continues below Best SSD 2017: buying an SSD for your computer Performance – in terms of the speed with which data can be read and written – has now effectively plateaued among the best SSDs. It's not that flash memory has reached its limit, far from it, but the Serial ATA interface between the flash and your computer is now an increasingly narrowing bottleneck. Pioneered by Apple and now finally trickling into the Windows world are solid-state drives that put SATA in the wastebasket, flash storage drives that hook more directly into the PC's native PCI Express bus. But Apple Macs take a proprietary version of these cards that are not available to buy or upgrade; and Windows PCs that are now available with the necessary M.2 PCIe attachments are just starting to go mainstream in 2017. With that said, they're still expensive, alongside the motherboards which actually support M.2. So for the moment, if you're building or upgrading a PC, chances are you'll be turning to the old tried-and-tested Serial ATA Revision 3.0 interface; often called SATA III. This bus has a 6Gb/s (750MB/s) nominal speed, but circa-550 MB/s real-world ceiling. Despite current SATA SSDs' shortcomings and converging performance specs we have tested the essential speed, both in large-file sequential transfers and small-file random access, as differences do exist between brands and models. Our selection covers the highest-performing SATA SSDs today, as well as some cheaper models that juggle the value factor rather than best-in-class performance figures. There are various technologies SSD manufacturers choose to utilise, from multi-level cell (MLC), to the cheaper triple-level cell flash (TLC) architectures. You might even come across the rare and more expensive single-level cell (SLC) drive. The differences between the cell technologies boil down to the amount of bits (data) that a single cell (within the SSD) can handle. TLC handles three, MLC, two and SLC one. The greater the number of bits per cell, the increased likelihood of failure, inconsistencies and most importantly performance. However, as this is a general sweeping statement, manufacturers have found ways around the limitations of SSD technology, but it's worth noting what is being used in your SSD, regardless of how it performs. When buying an SSD, look out for long warranties and high write limits if you prize data integrity, although with the help of proper backup routines, data loss is less of an issue today. Different SSDs demand more or less power in active use or when idle, and there are different power ratings again for when a laptop is in a sleep or hibernation mode. Unfortunately, we don't have the capability to measure power consumption in-house, and each manufacturer has its own way to present its numbers in the best light so we can't give a meaningful rundown of which has the best power economy. However, laptop users should take note of the rated power consumption of the SSDs in our group test, so that you know how much additional battery power you'll be using with an SSD. Do look out for manufacturers that provide accessible support with firmware updates possible on the platform of your choice. Most storage brands are still firmly routed in the Wintel world although with the decline of that platform more drive makers are making cross-platform upgrade tools available, in the form of bootable ISO images you can download from their support sites. For laptop users specifically, you'll want to also know the exact dimensions of an SSD, as it might not fit into your laptop. All SSDs have a 2.5in form factor, and often have 69.9x100.1x7mm dimensions – ensure it will fit in your laptop before purchasing it. Best SSD 2017: how we test The PNY CS2211 240GB, Kingston KC400 SSDNow 512GB, Crucial BX200 480GB, Samsung 850 Evo 500GB, Toshiba Q300 480GB (2016) were tested on the same Intel-based Windows 10 test rig. In addition, we ran the same benchmarks on our AMD-based rig and were shocked by the difference in performance. This budget system has an ASRock 970 Extreme3 Rev2.0 motherboard, with an AMD 970 Northbridge and AMD SB950 Southbridge. We found the Samsung 850 Evo could only manage 405.3MB/s sequential read speed and 387.8MB/s write speed compared to 550.8 and 505.8MB/s on the Intel rig fitted with an Asus Sabertooth motherboard and the Intel Z77 chipset. This doesn’t mean you’ll see that performance on all AMD systems: we can only speak to our experience of this one PC. We also found that even on our Intel test rig, the ASMedia SATA 6Gb/s ports performed considerably worse than the Intel Z77 SATA 6Gb/s ports. Also, bear in mind that a 3Gb/s port will perform even slower, so you should ensure you’re your laptop or PC’s motherboard has a decent SATA controller in order for you to achieve the fastest possible speeds. We would recommend benchmarking your SSD upon receiving it and making sure it's connected to the fastest SATA port available. Also check that all your motherboard drivers are up to date.

Kingston KC400 SSDNow Rating: Reviewed on: 4 May 16 RRP: £132.82 inc VAT The Kingston KC400 SSDNow 512GB is a fantastic SSD which delivers consistent high-speed performances across various benchmarks. The SSD is easy to recommend for those wanting to upgrade from their old hard drives or older generation SSDs, but it's more expensive than the Samsung 850 Evo. Read our Kingston KC400 SSDNow review. 8. WD Blue SSD 1TB Rating: Reviewed on: 11 October 16 RRP: £295 inc VAT Buy from Western Digital The WD Blue SSD 1TB offers consistent speeds, but comes in at a a hefty £295 price tag. The drive is overshadowed by its competitors, but nevertheless provides PC builders with more SSD alternatives. Read our WD Blue SSD 1TB review. 9. PNY CS2211 240GB Rating: Reviewed on: 9 May 16 RRP: £58.13 inc VAT; $89.99 The PNY CS2211 240GB is an affordable SSD that performs very well in its benchmarks. It however suffers from being limited in its availability, but should be made available within the UK in June/July 2016. Read our PNY CS2211 240GB review. 10. OCZ ARC 100 240 GB Rating: Reviewed on: 6 July 15 RRP: £69 inc. VAT This may be only OCZ's budget drive but it offers great performance with plenty of all-important support to provide peace of mind to anyone concerned about moving to solid-state storage. With its attractive warranty terms and great performance for the price it's easy to recommend. Read our OCZ ARC 100 240 GB review. 11. Kingston HyperX Savage 480 GB Rating: Reviewed on: 2 July 15 RRP: £185 inc. VAT The Kingston HyperX Savage turned in a solid performance among the leaders of the current SSD pack, and the flashy looks may appeal to gamers and PC enthusiasts wishing to pimp up their rig. Its overall performance is just behind the best of Samsung and SanDisk, and with a price that exceeds these drives it just loses out on any overall recommendation. But it is a good SSD. Read our Kingston HyperX Savage 480 GB review. 12. Crucial MX200 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 15 RRP: £301 inc. VAT When we tested the Crucial M550 last year it had a price/storage quotient of 37 pence per gigabyte. The latest MX200 is today available for around 30p/GB but other than that little has changed, except the newer drive has smaller process 16 nm flash and it measured slightly poorer in some tests. It's still a good drive but it's lost a little headway against higher performing or better value competitors like Samsung, SanDisk and OCZ. Read our Crucial MX200 review. 13. Crucial BX200 480GB Rating: Reviewed on: 19 May 16 RRP: £92.66 inc VAT; $118.28 The Crucial BX200 480GB is a cheaper SSD and certainly offers an impressive step-up over traditional hard drives. However, given its cache limitations, you should think carefully about whether the saving is worth it. Read our Crucial BX200 480GB review.

Well, it's one that can do everything - but there isn't just one, here are 18 best laptops By Marie Brewis | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What's the best laptop? Best laptop Price Key specifications Dell XPS 13 9360 £999 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 13.3in 1920x1080 display, 60Wh battery Lenovo Yoga 710 11in £549 Windows 10, Intel Core M3-6Y30, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 11.6in 1920x1080 display, 40Wh battery Asus ZenBook UX310UA £699 Windows 10, Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 500GB hard drive, 13.3in 3200x1800 display, 48Wh battery Jump straight to our full best laptops chart What's the best laptop? We round up the best laptops you can buy in the UK in 2017, including best Windows laptops and best MacBooks. The best laptop is the Dell XPS 13, followed by the Lenovo Yoga 710 and the Asus ZenBook UX310, but there are plenty of other options in our list below. Also see: Best Laptop Deals Despite the rise of tablets, there are still plenty of reasons to choose a laptop. Sometimes you just can't beat a bigger screen, a keyboard and Windows for getting stuff done. But, if you want a laptop that's also a tablet, there are plenty of convertible or 'hybrid' laptops which have a touchscreen which folds right back behind the keyboard and can be used as a tablet. The Yoga 710 is one of the best we've seen in this respect, although if its 11in screen is too small, Lenovo does offer larger versions. Before you buy any of the MacBooks in this chart, note that Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro on 27 October. We will add the new MacBook Pro to our chart once we have completed our testing. Best laptops 2017: Buying guide As with any product we review, the best laptops are rated on various factors - performance, build quality, features and value for money – along with an overall score, potentially with an award, too. Note that star ratings don't always dictate where a product ranks in the list below, as the score applies to the date it was reviewed. If you're looking for a laptop that can handle the latest games, see our up-to-date list of the best gaming laptops. As much as we can, we make sure all the laptops in the chart are available to but in the UK. However, it's not something we can check every day so there's a chance you might not find the model listed. There are also often many different SKUs (versions/models) of a laptop so the specs might vary to those on the model we've reviewed (we can't always choose the exact model to review). Most laptops will come pre-installed with Windows 10 now. Of course, our best laptops group test also includes the best MacBooks, which run OS X (now macOS) out of the box. Macs are often more expensive than Windows laptops, but Apple's laptops are better value than ever before. You might feel that the premium build quality and features warrant spending extra, although many Windows laptop manufacturers have stepped up their game recently. Best laptops 2017: How much should I spend on a laptop?  In this chart, there's no cap on how much the device can cost – sometimes the best does come at a steep price. Equally you can get a lot of laptop for under £300 – provided you only need to do basic tasks like browse the web, email and create the odd document. If so see the best budget laptops. Spending a bit more, around £500 and above, will potentially get you a nice laptop but it's likely to have an entry-level set of specs. We're talking a relatively basic processor, minimal SSD storage and a low resolution screen. It might also be a bit heavy and bulky. Content continues below Ramp up the amount you're happy to splash out - £800 and up - and you'll be looking at the best of the best with a blazing fast processor, plenty of RAM, hordes of storage and a gorgeous display. You should also expect excellent build quality and premium materials. That's why it's crucial to read laptop reviews before you buy.  Best laptops 2017: What screen size laptop do I need?  The size of your screen is an important decision when buying a laptop. After all they typically range from 11- all the way up to 17in. A smaller screen might be harder to work on but it means that the laptop will be far more portable, handy if you need to take it around with you wherever you go. Bear in mind that a smaller device means less space for features like ports. At 17in, you're buying a desktop replacement laptop which isn't deigned to be moved around often. You'll likely get a full-size keyboard, lots of connectivity and possibly even an optical drive, too. Generally, unless you're looking at either end of the spectrum, a 13in laptop is the sweet spot for us combining portability with usability. While many laptops have a resolution of 1366x768, you should look for something more if you want the best. Full HD (1920x1080) and higher should be a tick box and you can even get 4K laptops now, although arguably it's not necessary. If you want a touchscreen, this normally adds to the cost. Most laptops come with a glossy screen but most people prefer a less reflective matt finish so that's something to look out for, too. Best laptops 2017: How much laptop storage do I need?  As usual, storage depends on what you want to use a laptop for. As a general rule of thumb get as much as possible without wasting money on the upgrade (manufactures can charge a premium on this area). An SSD will mean your laptop runs faster but doesn't provide as much space as a traditional hard drive. Remember that there are also plenty of cloud storage options but this isn't so helpful when you don't have an internet connection. If you're going to need to storing a large amount of data (perhaps you make home videos or you simply want all your TV box sets ready to go) then look for 1- or 2TB of space. Don't forget you can buy a portable USB drive to supplement a laptop which has only a small-capacity SSD.  Memory (RAM) is where programs and files are stored only while you're using them, and more is always better. Consider 4GB an absolute minimum, unless it's a Chromebook, with 8- to 16GB the ideal figure if you can afford the upgrade. You can't have too much. Best laptops 2017: Which laptop processor is best?  Unless you're going to run complex and demanding software or gaming, you don't need the latest top-spec processor. It doesn't hurt, of course, but it's best to find a nice balance as there's nothing worse than waiting for a app to load etc. If you're happy to splash out then you're probably looking at the latest generation (6th) Intel Core i7 chip. Entry-level spec models are likely to offer a Core i3 or even a Core M processor instead. A Core i5 sits nicely in-between so check how much extra it is to upgrade before making a final decision. If you're not sure which generation the Intel processor is, look at the model number as the first digit represents this. For example, a Core i5-6500 is a sixth-generation CPU. While most come with Intel processors, you can still find AMD powered devices around. See AMD vs Intel for more information. Best laptops 2017: Ultrabooks and ultraportable laptops Buying an ultraportable laptop is really no different than any laptop, except that your priorities are likely to be different. You might want an ultraportable laptop that's light and will last a long time away from the mains.  However, other people want an ultrabook that's powerful and can handle demanding applications without breaking your back when you carry it around. Both types are available. Some compromises are inevitable if you want a thin and light laptop, though. There's less space for a battery, so it's typical to find shorter runtimes. But some companies have overcome this with clever packaging, such as the MacBook Air.  Another factor is efficient hardware, so a newer processor is likely to sip rather than guzzle power. The same goes for other components. But you should always read our reviews to find out how long a particular laptop lasted in our tests as you can't rely on specifications and it's unwise to go only by manufacturers' claims.  Thin laptops tend to have shallow key travel, so if you need a laptop to do a lot of typing then, again, read our reviews as they're the only way (short of hunting down the machine in a shop) to find out whether a keyboard is a joy or a pain to use.  Many ultrabooks use low-power processors which are better for battery life, but may not have much power for running Windows apps. Our benchmarks sort the speed demons from the sluggards. Best laptops 2017: Warranty and other considerations  We recommend all the laptops here: there isn't a duff one among them. However, we urge you again to read through the full review before spending your hard-earned cash. None of them are perfect and what will suit your needs might not simply be the device ranked at number one. Battery life and warranty are two things which vary between laptops. The latter may well differ depending on where you buy the laptop from, too. John Lewis, for example, tends to offer longer warranty than rivals. After-sales service is something you should consider, not only laptops but pretty much everything you buy. Check whether the company has a UK-based support line, and forums (including our own) are an ideal place to get an idea of whether a manufacturer is generally good or bad at carrying out work under warranty. You might not even have to deal with the manufacturer directly if you have a fault in the first six months as it's the retailer's responsibility to deal with issues. This is when it pays to have purchased from Amazon, John Lewis and others which will often replace or refund without quibble. After al that, it's also worth considering whether a laptop is what you really want. You can get some great bargains on desktop PCs these days, and if you don't want a large tower system taking up space there are plenty of all-in-one PCs to choose between. These integrate the computer behind the monitor, so they're much neater. Also, some tablets offer similar functionality to basic laptops. See our piece about choosing between laptop vs iPad, for instance.  Read on for our pick of the UK's best laptops and links to our best laptop reviews.

Dell XPS 13 9360 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 December 16 RRP: From £999 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499 inc VAT) The Dell XPS 13 is an excellent ultraportable laptop, the best 13-inch Windows model going for many. Dell hasn’t aimed for a single superlative feature, a potential gimmick. Its footprint is smaller than the competition, but it’s thicker. Its screen resolution is excellent, but display colour is normal rather than super-saturated. There’s also a mix of old and new connections, and a combo of a large battery and smart power management means the Dell XPS 13 lasts significantly longer than most a lot of the time. The balance is just right - we'd spend our own money on it. Read our Dell XPS 13 9360 review. 2. Lenovo Yoga 710 11" Rating: Reviewed on: 9 August 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT The Lenovo Yoga 710 wants to offer the best, most convenient ultraportable laptop experience you can get without spending a scary amount of money. It has a 360-degree hinge and a touchscreen, which makes is a fun machine for use while travelling around. You wouldn’t want to go any smaller for all-day work tasks, but there is also a larger 14in version of this laptop if you think the 11.6in Yoga 710 will prove too small. For what it’s worth, Lenovo has nailed the display, glossy, sharp, bright enough for outdoor use, covered in toughened glass and jet black when switched off. Core hardware includes an Intel Core M3-6Y30 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. You get a single USB 3.0 port, plus micro HDMI, but no microSD slot for storage expansion. There are stereo speakers, a nice tiled keyboard with two-button trackpad that is mostly comfortable to type on, and this 1.06kg laptop runs on a 40Wh battery. It’s not the fastest Windows laptop, but sufficient for everyday tasks that don’t include gaming. It’s silent in use, with respectable audio and long battery life - 9 hours 45 minutes in our tests. Lenovo’s Yoga 710 is one of the best Windows alternatives to the 12in MacBook. Read our Lenovo Yoga 710 11" review. 3. Asus ZenBook UX310UA Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £699 inc VAT The Asus ZenBook UX310A is an ideal mid-range ultraportable laptop. It is what happens when a practical everyday laptop and an expensive all-aluminium Ultrabook fall in love, bringing you the pricey look and feel of a portable, stylish machine with the features of a workhorse and a price way below that of a rival MacBook. Core hardware includes a Core i5-6200U CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and both a 128GB SSD and a 500GB HDD. There’s a single USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, plus USB-C, HDMI and SDXC. The Asus sports (albeit so-so) Harman Kardon stereo speakers, and with its 48Wh battery weighs in at 1.45kg. A cheaper version has the Core i3, 4GB of RAM and a lower-res display. The 13.3in screen is a highlight, with unbelievable sharpness (276ppi) and colour saturation at this price, and this matt screen excels in outdoor use. It’s paired with a scissor-mechanism keyboard with backlight and a large, comfortable trackpad. The ZenBook is not perfect - we’d like the display to tilt back further, the shell displays some flexing, and it’s a tad chunky thanks to the HDD inside - but it scored well on performance, provided you avoid intensive gaming. Battery life is solid, at 8 hours 10 minutes. You can’t have it all at this price, but the ZenBook gets close. Read our Asus ZenBook UX310UA review. 4. Dell Latitude 13 7370 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 July 16 RRP: From £1,079 Okay so it’s a business laptop, but check out that 13in edge-to-edge display. You wouldn’t be ashamed to show off the Dell Latitude 13 inside- or outside the office, with design hints taken from the awesome Dell XPS 13 listed higher up this chart. It’s customisable to suit your needs, but the model we reviewed came with an Intel Core m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. There’s a USB 3.0 port, two USB-C, Micro-HDMI, a microSD card slot and two optional Micro-SIM slots. This 13.3in-screen laptop also sports a 34Wh battery and a fingerprint scanner, and weighs in at 1.12kg. The Latitude 13 has a pleasant matt finish to its base half, but the outer side of the lid is a cool (in every sense) aluminium that is surprisingly sturdy. Or you can add a carbon-fibre lid for an extra tenner. The keyboard is distinctly business-fare, somewhat cramped and with concave, clicky keys, but it’s workable. The trackpad is good, but small. And the screen offers great colours and viewing angles, even outdoors, but it lacks brightness. What really impresses is the Professional version of Windows it ships with, the silent running of the still-powerful processor, and its outstanding battery life of 8 hours 23 minutes in our tests. Read our Dell Latitude 13 7370 review. 5. HP Envy 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 February 16 RRP: From £649 inc VAT (model reviewed £799) You won’t find a laptop with a decent-sized screen more portable than this HP Envy 13. It’s incredibly slim and light, powerful, and it doesn’t cost the earth. Magic. Key specs for our review sample include the Intel Core i7-6500U processor with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 256GB SSD. There’s a 13.3in full-HD screen, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a fingerprint scanner, SDXC slot, Bang & Olufson stereo speakers and a tiled keyboard complete with numberpad. With a 45Wh battery the Envy 13 weighs just 1.3kg. Cheaper Core-i5 and more expensive higher-resolution-screen options are also available. Sensationally petite, the Envy 13 has plenty of its own visual personality. This ultra-light system offers a mix of officiousness and cuteness: an unusal combo. There’s a pleasant matt screen, a shallow but crisp keyboard, and HP’s trademark ultra-big, ultra-rounded touchpad - one of the best you’ll find on a 13in Windows laptop. Day-to-day performance is excellent, and more demanding tasks such as photo- and video-editing are well within the HP’s remit. With integrated graphics, though, you’ll want to keep games at low settings. In our tests battery life ran to 8 hours 5 minutes. Read our HP Envy 13 review. 6. Acer S 13 S5-371 Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 16 RRP: £549.99 Introducing the Windows ultrabook for normal people (the ones whose jaws drop when they see the price of a new MacBook Air), the Acer S 13 is an affordable and recommended alternative to such wallet-busters. There’s a quirky trackpad and some parts of the build are cheap, but this is a very decent Windows laptop. The S 13 has an embossed ‘ridged’ plastic lid, offset by a silvery hinge that gives it a recognisable two-tone style. Its underside is plastic too, and the use of this material is one way Acer has managed to keep down the price. Elsewhere the build is more premium, for example the aluminium keyboard surround. On the whole, though, the spec is good. You get an Intel Core i3-610U processor (a Core i5 option is available) paired with 8GB of DDR3 RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C, HDMI, SDXC and stereo speakers. The 13.3in Acer has a 4,030mAh battery and weighs 1.3kg. Day-to-day performance is good and battery life is very good, but the Acer is not a great gaming machine. It’s mostly quiet, with the fans kicking in only when necessary, yet the stereo speakers are loud. Watch it, though, as they’ll distort at maximum volume. Read our Acer S 13 S5-371 review. 7. Microsoft Surface Book Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £1,299 inc VAT Microsoft thinks it has made the ultimate laptop, which is also a tablet. It's difficult to argue. There are five models, with the top offering the new £2,649 Surface Book i7. We reviewed the original Intel Core i7 Skylake model with 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GPU, and found excellent performance but have to point out the Core i5 model offers better value. The Surface Book is very angular, a slightly unusual shape for a laptop with a 3:2 aspect ratio, though we got used to it quickly. The 13.5in PixelSense display is stunning, with a crisp 267ppi density. Colour reproduction, brightness and viewing angles all excel. The Book itself is made from magnesium alloy, lighter and more durable than aluminium. The Book splits apart into the 724g screen with a 18Wh battery and the 860g keyboard with a 51Wh battery (battery life is fantastic at 16 hours, 25 minutes). The most striking part of its design its the ‘Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge’, which looks cool and improves balance. Meanwhile, an equally cool ‘Muscle Wire Lock’ uses an electrically charged nickel titanium alloy to hold it all together. The Surface Pen attaches magnetically to the side. You’ll find ports for USB 3.0 (x2), Mini-DisplayPort and an SD Card reader. USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 are missing, but this is still an amazing example of Windows laptop tech. Read our Microsoft Surface Book review. 8. MacBook Pro 2016 Rating: Reviewed on: 11 January 17 RRP: Base prices £1,449 (13-inch without Touch Bar), £1,749 (256GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £1,949 (512GB 13-inch model with Touch Bar), £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB 15-inch with Touch Bar), £2,699 (2.7GHz, 12GB 15-inch with Touch Bar) We're rather in love with the new MacBook Pro, but as with many love affairs there are irritations. The trackpad is huge and wonderful to use; but it's so big that the keyboard has been pushed up to make room, as well as flattened down to make the laptop slimmer. These factors together mean typing on the new Pro is a little harder - especially for touch typists, who will struggle to locate keys at first - than on on previous models. And those arrow keys are a nightmare. The Touch Bar is lovely to look at and fun to use. It's early days, both for us - we're only beginning to grasp its capabilities - and for app developers, who will surely come up with reams of clever Touch Bar features. Right now it's fun, but we're reasonably confident that it will become essential; the key will be getting lots of users on machines with Touch Bars. The tech is in this respect a little further back along the track that 3D Touch is following. This is a fast machine, of course, but maybe not quite fast enough for some tastes; it's worth reflecting on that maximum spec of 16GB of RAM, which may hold this machine back from a role in genuine pro settings. We're somewhat hopeful for a March update to add the option of more RAM and Kaby Lake processors. All in all, this is a fast and beautiful laptop but one with some flaws to consider. And ouch, that price tag is steep. Read our MacBook Pro 2016 review. 9. HP Spectre 13 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 August 16 RRP: £1299 inc VAT The HP Spectre 13 is desperate to appear a laptop of the future, and that comes with substantial pros and cons. Its supreme portability is quite wonderful, and while its design may polarise, it certainly is fancy. There's substance too, with a surprisingly powerful CPU for a laptop this thin and solid build in the keyboard and trackpad. Its message is a little confused, though. The processor courts enthusiasts, but that's exactly who's likely to be most annoyed by the lack of memory card slot and a traditional USB port. There's an audience for the Spectre 13, but if you've not signed-up to a wireless way of working yet you may want to think twice. Read our HP Spectre 13 review. 10. Lenovo Yoga 900 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 February 16 RRP: From £1199 inc VAT (model reviewed £1499) The Lenovo Yoga 900 is a laptop that really asks you to believe in its design style. After all, it doesn’t come cheap and for the price you can get a laptop with much more power if you’re not out for something immensely portable. That’s where this laptop excels: portability. As well as being slim, light and all-round lovely, the smart hinge lets it sit where most other laptops just can’t. The battery should last through a full day’s work as well. The trackpad can feel fiddly and the display isn’t perfect, but if you’re feeling flush this is one of the top ultraportables around. Read our Lenovo Yoga 900 review. 11. 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £849 (with 128GB storage), £999 (with 256GB) Buy from Apple After some extensive testing, we found the MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) to be little different overall to the 2014 model. The Thunderbolt 2 update will prove useful for connecting to high-resolution UHD displays, and a few percent of added processor power is never unwelcome. But hoped-for improvements in graphics performance and battery longevity did not arise in our testing, in spite of a new Intel processor which was expected to shepherd benefits in both areas. Launched at the same price as last year’s model it still deserves attention as one of the finest ultraportable laptops available - doubly so now that its flash-drive speed has shot up another 100 percent - and it will remain the more affordable option in lightweight notebooks when the new MacBook launches this month. Read our 13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015) review. 12. Apple MacBook (early 2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £1,049 There's no escaping the fact that this is a very similar laptop to its 2015 predecessor, which so divided the tech community. But we think the problems have been overblown. The engineering on show is superb, and the performance is completely acceptable for a modern-day computer of this size. The arguments that there should be more ports on the MacBook only exist because people want one, and are frustrated that their current set-up needs will not allow for it. Apple has undoubtedly improved the MacBook for 2016. It is a truly outstanding laptop that will be wrongly categorised as a luxury technological item. There's a difference between something costing a little too much and it being luxurious - just like the MacBook Air, this laptop deserves to fall in price and rise in specs to continue to be what we consider an excellent flagship computer. The world and its ports just need to catch up. Read our Apple MacBook (early 2016) review. 13. Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA Rating: Reviewed on: 5 January 17 RRP: From £1099 inc VAT (model tested £1499 inc VAT) The Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA is an extremely light laptop and one that doesn’t compromise performance or kill battery life as a result. It’s also more affordable than some of the alternatives, particularly in its entry-level spec. However, we’re not convinced about all the choices Asus has made. A single USB-C port won’t cut it for a lot of buyers, the ultra-slim keyboard isn’t great for long-form typing and the trackpad’s clicker mechanism has some real issues. The trackpad also seems a bit pointless when it’s reliability is mediocre, even if it’s down to Microsoft’s software. Its portability is just about unbeatable, but some of you may prefer the more accommodating style of the Dell XPS 13 or one of Asus’s cheaper ZenBook models Read our Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA review. 14. Dell Chromebook 11 (3120) Rating: Reviewed on: 9 March 16 RRP: £202 inc VAT Buy from Dell Dell knows what it’s doing when it comes to Chromebooks. This new, rugged model has plenty to offer in terms of speed and durability, but you don’t feel like you’re sacrificing much in return. With the long battery life and unique waterproofing feature it does seem like a device that’s built to last, which is good as you’ll want to keep using it for a long time to come.

VAT The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 tells you larger convertible laptops have truly entered the mainstream. It’s reasonably affordable, still looks good and has the roughly the same power as some laptops costing way over £1000. Down sides include that the screen isn’t as colourful as the best and that the casing is made of plastic rather than something fancy like aluminium or a magnesium alloy. Oddly enough, though, it actually fits in well among its more stylish peers. Read our Dell Inspiron 13 5000 review. 16. HP Envy 15-as001na Rating: Reviewed on: 13 September 16 RRP: £799 inc. VAT The HP Envy 15 doesn't seem like a desperately interesting laptop at first glance. It's too big to be cool, not quite cheap enough to be a stone-cold bargain. However, the longer you use it, the more you realise quite what a sound fit it is for people who want a larger laptop, but one not ugly, chunky or liable to last 90 minutes between charges. Sound performance, a smart trackpad, a respectable display and sensible price make the HP Envy 15 one of the best laptops for those who don't really need a super-performance PC but still want the desktop-replacer feel you get with a 15.6-inch laptop. Read our HP Envy 15-as001na review. 17. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 June 16 RRP: From £749 inc VAT (model tested £1079) There is a great deal to like and rave about the Surface Pro 4. The design is thinner and lighter for starters. The screen is awesome, there's plenty of power available, the new Surface Pen is better and the Type Cover is a vast improvement on the last one. However, the design is inherently awkward at times, it's more expensive that a lot of laptops and the Type Cover, which you'll pretty much need, isn't included lowering the value.

Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 January 16 RRP: From £639 inc VAT A very decent laptop replacement, and an okay tablet, the Surface Pro 3 is undeniably impressive. If you need a single device to do everything we can't think of any better device. And when you consider the cost of buying a discrete laptop, tablet and desktop PC the Surface Pro 3 is priced to shift. The question remains as to whether people want a single device rather than multiple gadgets that are better at their individual tasks. Microsoft's latest results suggest that Surface Pro 3 is winning hearts and minds. Has it won yours? Read our Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review.

Intel pumps out Optane memory at CES Just a dash to Kaby Lake splash 4 Jan 2017 at 12:04, Chris Mellor CES 2017 Intel has announced Optane memory products in M.2. format to ship in the second 2017 quarter. Optane is Intel’s brand for its 3D Xpoint memory, jointly developed with Micron, and a non-volatile memory that is faster than NAND but slower than DRAM. Intel says (PDF) “a hard disk drive coupled with Intel Optane memory affordably gives you SSD- like speed while maintaining large-storage capacity … [and] delivers amazing desktop responsiveness.” Intel has said it will develop both DIMM and SSD XPOint devices and the first SSDs are being revealed at CES in the shape of these M.2 products. There are two capacity levels: 16GB and 32GB and the devices are a disk drive cache memory option for its i7 Kaby Lake seventh generation Core CPUs. They will also be sold separately for use with certified “Intel Optane memory ready” motherboards and other platforms. A system that is Intel Optane memory ready will include either a 7th Gen Intel Core or Xeon E3 v6 processor. Intel’s video (available here) pushes Optane as a disk drive caching device, a role that flash has used for years. It does not compare such Optane caching to flash caching, which suggests the perceived difference will not be significant. Intel Optane M.2. format card There is a PDF Optane brochure which provides no quantitative performance information at all. Neither is there any pricing information. We expect a price higher than M.2. NAND but lower than the equivalent DRAM capacity. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 20 Comments More from The Register MacBook killer?

By Richard Leadbetter Published 04/01/2017 The reality of microprocessor design is slowly but surely losing pace against Moore's Law - and Intel's new Kaby Lake series of CPUs is a clear example of this. Stuck on the 14nm fabrication process, the latest Core i5s and i7s offer - clock for clock - the exact same performance as the existing Skylake processors you can buy now. So is there any actual point in Intel releasing these chips? Well, the reality is that factoring out IPC (instructions per clock), Kaby Lake is indeed a step forward compared to Skylake. And it all starts with that all-important 14nm process technology. Intel says that it has refined it significantly, the end result being that all Kaby Lake processors offer a frequency boost over their Skylake predecessors. So, in the case of the Core i5 7600K we're reviewing here, base and turbo clocks receive a significant uplift - run the chip on a Z170 or Z270 board, hit the XMP button in the BIOS and you'll have a processor running at 4.2GHz on all four cores with zero effort required. 'Enhanced Turbo' is part and parcel of XMP memory overclocking on all enthusiast boards these days. The revised CPU manufacturing process also seems to offer significantly higher overclocking potential. Our Skylake-based Core i5 6600K overclocks nicely enough to 4.5GHz, but the new Kaby Lake chip offers rock-solid stability at 4.8GHz with the possibility of hitting over 5.0GHz with air-cooling. We only had an engineering sample chip to test with a pre-retail BIOS before Christmas, but during the holidays, Asus released a new BIOS said to hit offer a one-button 5.0GHz solution that works with 80 per cent of Kaby Lake processors. Our test system, featuring the Asus Maximus 9 Code We tested the Core i5 7600K on a Z270 board supplied by Asus, the Maximus 9 code. It's at the deluxe end of the motherboard spectrum, with an almost bewildering spec. The socket 1151 board supports all Skylake and Kaby Lake chips, with four DDR4 slots that can support memory overclocked to 4.133GHz. Connectivity is taken care of with four USB 2.0, four USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 Type A and Type C exterior connections on the rear (plus 3.0 and 3.1 internal headers) along with three PCIe x16 slots (SLI and CrossFire supported) and three x1 slots. Network functionality utilises Intel's I219-V ethernet, along with 2x2 Mu-MIMO WiFi, while storage features six SATA-3 connections and M.2 support. Even the oft-neglected integrated GPU gets some love with an HDMI 1.4 output plus DisplayPort 1.2 for 4K, 60Hz output. The SupremeFX S1220 codec is utilised for audio, while the package is topped off with water-cooling flow headers, RGB lighting and ROG-branded plastic 'armour'. The comprehensive spec goes so far as to include a 'LANguard' feature for protecting the board input from mains spikes - now that's comprehensive. We paired this board with four sticks of Corsair Vengeance LPX at 3000MHz, with 15-17-17-35 latency and ran everything from an OCZ Trion 100 SSD. Corsair's RM1000i supplied power while the firm's H100i GTX closed loop cooler sat atop the processor for the duration. The same components were used for the i5 6600 testing, bar the use of an MSI Gaming Carbon Z170 motherboard. Meanwhile, the 2500K was tested on an MSI Z77A-G45 board paired with 16GB of Corsair Vengeance 2400MHz DDR3 (11-13-13-31 latency). Owing to the constraints of the Sandy Bridge platform, this memory was run at 2133MHz. Everything else surrounding the main processor cores is upgraded too - next-gen video codecs such as HEVC and Google's VP9 get full hardware support via fixed function media blocks, while the integrated Intel 630 graphics processor also sees a significant uplift (though it's still relatively feeble - for the purposes of an enthusiast gamer pairing the chip with a dedicated GPU, it remains mostly irrelevant here). There's also a new chipset too - Z270 and its non-overclocking equivalent, H270. Upgrades over the Skylake equivalents are relatively thin on the ground - there's support for Intel's next-gen Optane memory/storage system, and four additional PCI Express lanes for more storage connection functionality. Gallery: We were sent an engineering sample Core i5 7600K for review, and we paired this with an Asus Maximus 9 Code Z270 board, and four sticks of Corsair DDR4 rated at 3000MHz with 15-17-17-35 latency. Samples arrived late in the day in 2016, so testing of alternative CPUs was limited - we chose the last-gen Core i5 6600K in order to see what form the generational leap - if any - would take. We also returned to the Core i5 2500K, paired with 2133MHz DDR3, the sticks with the highest bandwidth allowed on the old Sandy Bridge platform. We chose this processor owing to its standing as an enthusiasts' favourite. In testing, we ran the i5 7600K in three different configurations - at stock speeds with XMP active (in order to access the higher, rated memory bandwidth) and also with the Asus auto-turbo enabled. In theory, with XMP active, all cores will run at the single-core max turbo speed - in this case, 4.2GHz. Our max, rock-solid overclock on the 7600K was 4.8GHz so those results are included too. For the i5 6600K and 2500K, we benched at stock speeds (3.5GHz and 3.3GHz respectively) and also standardised overclocking at 4.2GHz in order to ascertain clock-for-clock relationships between all three processors. To begin with, we ran some basic benchmarks - Intel's own extreme tuning utility (XTU), Cinebench R15 for single and multi-core testing and we also ran software video encoding tool, Handbrake. For this test, we used our own Rise of the Tomb Raider 4K60 video (available from digitalfoundry.net) and re-encoded it using both h.264 and HEVC. That proved... lengthy. Core i5 7600K Stock Core i5 7600K 4.2GHz Core i5 7600K 4.8GHz Core i5 6600K Stock Core i5 6600K 4.2GHz Core i5 2500K Stock Core i5 2500K 4.2GHz XTU Benchmark 1244 1288 1394 1142 1281 665 793 Cinebench R15 Single-Core 173 181 203 150 173 110 145 Cinebench R15 Multi-Core 654 694 774 562 686 425 544 Handbrake 0.10.5 x264 9.4fps 9.8fps 11.5fps 7.3fps 10.0fps 5.5fps 6.9fps Handbrake 0.10.5 x265/HEVC 4.8fps 5.2fps 5.8fps 3.7fps 5.1fps 2.0fps 2.8fps The results confirm that in terms of pure performance on a clock-for-clock basis, Kaby Lake is essentially identical to Skylake, but there is a performance boost from the extra stock clocks. The extent to which performance is improved over vintage 2011 Sandy Bridge processor varies according to the benchmark - at best, in the x265/HEVC test, we're looking at an 85 per cent improvement, but improvements elsewhere are as low as 27 per cent. It demonstrates that synthetic benchmarks have little value, but the video encoding tests are enlightening. A processor's capabilities aren't defined by instructions per clock performance alone - over the year, new instructions are added to CPU architectures and with Handbrake's x265 HEVC encoder, we seem to see those additional capabilities fully put to the test. But it's gaming that we're primarily interested in, which presents an interesting challenge. Most games are mostly limited by the graphics card, to the point where isolating areas where you are CPU-bound is a challenge. Our solution is to run titles at 1080p on max settings, paired with an overclocked Titan X Pascal. This propels the CPU to the forefront as the primary limiting factor. It's worth stressing that these benchmarks are not supposed to be indicative of the gaming experience - they are simply the means by which relative processor performance can be ascertained when running gaming tasks. We've included some of our GPU tests here, but for the most part, we've tried to tweak things in order to put more stress on the CPU. Rise of the Tomb Raider's geothermal valley has a big CPU requirement, so we're a score attack run-through there as opposed to the game's standard benchmark. We've relocated the Crysis 3 benchmark in order to hit CPU harder in the Welcome to the Jungle stage, but most of our other GPU tests can be repurposed to test processor performance instead. For example, our Assassin's Creed Unity and Witcher 3 runs can max out a modern i5 fairly easily, while - remarkably - the Far Cry engine is a great workout for CPU speed, threads and even processor cache. Meanwhile, Ashes of the Singularity ships with a CPU stress test which we've tapped into for our tests. The results below are averages: lowest recorded frame-rates can be anything up to half what you're seeing here. CPU Game logic processing brought to the fore, with the aid of Titan X Pascal eliminating GPU as a bottleneck. 1080p/Titan X Pascal OC Core i5 7600K Stock Core i5 7600K 4.2GHz Core i5 7600K 4.8GHz Core i5 6600K Stock Core i5 6600K 4.2GHz Core i5 2500K Stock Core i5 2500K 4.2GHz Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 121.4 124.4 125.4 117.0 122.9 75.8 96.7 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 29.6 29.8 33.1 26.2 29.9 17.2 23.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 99.4 100.8 108.6 93.4 100.5 66.6 83.7 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 132.0 134.2 134.6 132.4 133.3 111.2 123.7 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 117.2 124.0 137.4 111.8 123.9 70.8 92.7 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 89.7 93.3 97.8 83.1 93.4 57.4 69.7 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 99.0 109.2 114.9 97.7 108.5 62.6 81.7 Clock-for-clock, with all processors equalised to 4.2GHz, Skylake and Kaby Lake offer an average improvement of around 30 per cent in terms of gaming frame-rates - and this extends to lowest recorded frame-rates too, where the difference is most keenly felt. The Core i5 2500K still does a reasonable job overall, but if you are holding onto this processor, or its 3570K successor, we strongly recommend reading our guide on how to get the most out of your Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge system. To cut a lot story short - processor performance scales in line with memory bandwidth, so gains with a modern i5 may actually be much, much higher - combine that with higher overclocking or an upgrade to an i7 and there may be life in your system yet. For gaming, Kaby Lake may show no discernable upgrade over Skylake in equalised clock scenarios, but clearly the extra stock clocks are going to be very useful, particularly if you choose to plump for a non-K Intel processor. Both the Core i5 6400 and i5 6500 gained a strong following owing to their cheaper prices and decent gaming frame-rates, the latter in particular offering a creditable balance of price vs performance. Kaby Lake offers more than a frequency boost too - on non-Z boards, it's possible to utilise 2400MHz DDR4 as opposed to the rock-bottom 2133MHz modules. This is significant in CPU-bound gaming scenarios. To illustrate the relationship between memory bandwidth and processor performance, we re-ran all of our gaming benchmarks with the Core i5 7600K running at stock clocks and overclocked to 4.8GHz. We ran each title with our Corsair modules running at 2133MHz, 2400MHz and their max rated 3000MHz. The results can be remarkable. An overclocked i5 running at 4.8GHz with 2133MHz modules can be beaten in some scenarios by the i5 running at stock speeds with 300MHz DDR4. And let's remember that 3000MHz DDR4 is no longer the limit - overclocked modules are now hitting 4200MHz. In this video we demonstrate that many games require additional memory bandwidth to make the most of a processor overclock. 1080p/Titan X Pascal OC Core i5 7600K Stock Core i5 7600K Stock Core i5 7600K Stock Core i5 7600K 4.8GHz Core i5 7600K 4.8GHz Core i5 7600K 4.8GHz DDR4 Clock Speed 3000MHz 2400MHz 2133MHz 3000MHz 2400MHz 2133MHz Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 121.4 113.0 107.7 125.4 119.4 110.9 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 29.6 27.7 26.5 33.1 31.3 30.3 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 99.4 98.8 98.5 108.6 108.0 105.0 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 132.0 130.4 130.4 134.6 133.0 131.7 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 117.2 103.7 98.2 137.4 122.8 121.2 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 89.7 85.7 81.0 97.8 93.6 88.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 97.7 92.4 85.9 114.9 99.2 95.1 It stands to reason really - graphics cards tend to scale compute power with memory bandwidth, so why shouldn't CPUs benefit too? We've seen similar relationships on all of our CPU tests going back to Sandy Bridge, so this is not anything new. The bottom line is that getting the most out of your overclock rests not only on boosting frequency but by scaling memory bandwidth too. We would also expect tighter RAM latencies to yield additional, smaller scale performance boosts too. There are wider implications for this beyond the Core i5 7600K we're testing here. Locked Intel processors will also benefit from higher memory bandwidth, but anything higher than 2133MHz frequencies are not possible on existing Skylake-based motherboards. Kaby Lake introduces support for 2400MHz DDR4, which should extent to lower-end boards. So not only will we see a frequency boost to the processor itself, but the chip should produce better gaming performance if paired with faster memory. In terms of overclocking the i5, it was simplicity itself to get the system to boot at 5.2GHz. However, a Prime95 stress test saw heat kick in massively with hardware errors quickly manifesting. We settled a 48 multiplier, giving us a rock solid 4.8GHz and temperatures in the 70-75 celsius range once we'd adjusted voltage accordingly. However, we should stress that this was achieved with an engineering sample and with an older, pre-release BIOS. We've heard enthusiast desktop systems will ship with Kaby Lake chips at 4.8GHz, suggesting that there is more in the tank on the majority of overclockable K processors. However, equally, initial tests on the i7 7700K are showing similar results - we can easily boot this CPU at over 5GHz, but excessive heat seems to be an issue. We'll report back on this in more depth when review the i7 with a more mature BIOS, but the bottom line is clear - you should be able to easily achieve higher overclocks with Kaby Lake - we've tested two Skylake i5 6600Ks and both of them topped out at 4.5GHz. So how does all of this benchmark data relate to the gameplay experience? Typically, frame-rates are limited by your graphics card's capabilities, or an arbitrary frame-rate cap (v-sync will typically lock you to 60fps). It's dips below that can be caused by lack of CPU power, and these performance drops generally take the form of uneven stutter. Using a monitoring tool like Riva Tuner Statistics Server is typically the best way to see if you are CPU bound, as it's possible to monitor per-core load there. Our general feeling is that the veteran Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors are due an upgrade, but staying on those existing boards and going for an overclockable i7 paired with fast RAM can still keep you in the game - for now. Intel Kaby Lake Core i5 7600K - the Digital Foundry verdict Can a £300 PC match PlayStation 4 performance? Digital Foundry builds and tests its own budget build. With Intel's tick-tock strategy for new products now a thing of the past, Kaby Lake offers the customary minimal year-on-year bump in performance via higher clock-speeds as opposed to any architectural improvements. There's no increase in gaming performance on a clock-for-clock level, but a 4.8GHz to 5GHz overclock with air-cooling may be interesting enough to keep enthusiasts looking to upgrade on board. The latest generation Core i5 K-chip you can buy has offered the sweetspot in terms of price, performance and system longevity for over five years now and based on those aspects, the Core i5 7600K is no different. However, with AMD's new Ryzen CPU products arriving this year, many may be tempted to wait to see what the competition has to offer. However, the question is when we will see a mainstream offering based on AMD's new architecture. As things stand, everything AMD has demoed thus far has seen Ryzen compared against Intel's top-tier eight-core enthusiast line, as opposed to the gaming staple that is the Core i5. CES may prove forthcoming, but it may well be the case that we'll see a top-down approach from AMD, tackling the more lucrative enthusiast line before moving down to more mainstream markets. Until then, the i5's closest competition is likely to be its own Core i7 line - whether you're picking up the latest Kaby Lake chip, an existing Skylake processor or even an older chip. We do have the Core i7 3770K, 4790K and 6700K in-house and we'll be testing them up against the brand new 7700K as soon as we can. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

Now, it's time for business customers to receive some seventh-gen attention in the form of brand new vPro CPUs unveiled at CES 2017. While touting a 12% improvement in performance over last generation CPUs and "50% increased productivity over a 5-year-old PC", Intel has also been talking up the security capabilities of its new vPro processors, including Intel Authenticate and Intel Data Guard. Having come out of preview, Intel Authenticate provides a means for businesses to implement configure, and manage multi-factor authentication across their vPro fleet. While the function can operate independently, Intel Authenticate can integrate with Intercede's MyID solution and, in the future, with Windows Hello, introduced as part of Windows 10, as a co-development strategy with Microsoft. The company also announced the future introduction of Intel Data Guard which offers a hardware-based file and folder encryption system, from the point of creation and throughout the data lifecycle. Importantly, the encryption remains transparent to users while providing IT organizations the ability to apply policies according to their security requirements. While currently in customer trials, the technology will be released later this year and will be supported on Windows 7, 8.1, and 10. Furthermore, both Intel Authenticate and Data Guard are available on hardware containing either a sixth and seventh-generation vPro CPU, which will allow business to leverage these solutions in combination with recent hardware.

 Intel is planning to buy 15% of a mapping company that Nokia sold for $2.9 billion Sam Shead Jan. 4, 2017, 5:06 AM 1,771 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CEO Brian KrzanichEthan Miller/Getty Images Intel is set to acquire 15% of German mapping company Here, which is owned by BMW, Audi, and Daimler. The Silicon Valley computer chip manufacturer announced on Tuesday that it has signed a deal with Here to collaborate on the development of maps for highly and fully automated driving. The two companies said in a joint press release that they also plan to look at "strategic opportunities" that could arise from vehicle data in the future. Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, said in a statement: "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world’s most intelligent, connected devices. We look forward to working with Here and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future." The value of the upcoming deal has not been disclosed. Edzard Overbeek, Here CEO, added in a statement: "A real-time, self-healing and high definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms. Here CEO Edzard Overbeek.Here "As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate Here's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected." The duo said that the technology they work on will aim to make autonomous driving as safe and predictable as possible, adding that future mapping systems will be able to pinpoint cars to within centimetres — something that would help vehicles to precisely position themselves on the road. Here passed from Nokia to the German automotive group in 2015 in a deal that was worth €2.8 billion ($2.9 billion; £2.4 billion). Last month, two Chinese firms teamed up with Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC to buy a 10% stake in Here, which employs over 7,000 people worldwide, including almost 1,000 in Berlin. Apple has poached a number of mapping engineers from Here for a secret Apple Maps team in Berlin over the last few months. However, Here has also been hiring at the same time, recruiting around 30 people from failed taxi startup Karhoo.

Liliputing CES 2017 LPX Reviews Deals Mini PCs Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement ECS to show four new mini PCs at CES 12/30/2016 at 1:30 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Elitegroup Computer Systems (ECS) is bringing four tiny desktop computers to the Consumer Electronics Show next week. One is the ECS Liva Z fanless mini PC with an Intel Apollo Lake processor, which we first heard about in November. But there will also be three other models, including several variations in the Z series. Liva Z This computer features a 10 watt, quad-core Intel Apollo Lake processor, support for 4K displays, and support for Windows 10. It’s a fanless computer, and it has a microphone that allows you to talk to Microsoft’s Cortana Digital Assistant without plugging in an external mic. It supports EMMC storage and there’ an M.2 SSD. There are two SODIMM slots with support for up to 8GB of DDR3L memory. Other features include a USB 3.0 Type-C port, three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and mini DisplayPort, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, and 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. The system measures 5″ x 4.6″ x 1.3″ Liva ZE This model has the same basic specs as the ECZ Liva Z, but it’s a taller device that measures about 2 inches thick, and which has more room inside the case for additional ports. And ECS puts that space to use. There support for an M.2 solid state drive, but there’s also a 2.5 inch drive bay for a hard drive or SSD. And there are four COM ports in this model, which you probably won’t use at home, but which could make this little PC useful in commercial environments. This model is also fanless. Liva Z Plus This is a more powerful model with an Intel Kaby Lake-U processor, support for up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and improved performance and power efficiency over previous Liva mini PCs with Intel Skylake chips. The Liva Z Plus is the same size as the Liva Z, but it will likely have a fan to help keep the 15 watt laptop-class dual core processor cool. Liva XE This model uses a previous-gen Intel Braswell processor, which should make it less powerful than the new Z series systems, but more in line with other members of the Liva X family. via Tom’s Hardware Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Latest News Report: Android co-founder Andy Rubin’s new company to launch a bezel-free phone (and much more) Andy Rubin co-founded Android Inc, before the company was bought by Google.

The industry demands new products on a yearly cycle, but as far as processors go, there isn't a whole lot more that PC and laptop buyers today need from their machines that they can't get from the ones they already have. Sure, everyone would like a lighter laptop and more power overall at the same price, but let's face it, there's no new killer app or usage scenario that demands a leap in performance, and there hasn't been for a long time. The world's largest PC chipmaker can keep pushing transistor sizes down, squeezing more life out of each jump to a smaller manufacturing process, but the process gets more expensive and complicated with each generation. We're also facing the prospect of diminishing returns with each such transition. Well over a year ago, Intel announced that it would break its longstanding practice of introducing a smaller process every other release cycle, and instead ship a third generation of products on the then-new 14nm node. A new codename, Kaby Lake, was inserted into roadmaps to serve as a successor to Skylake and fill the void created by pushing the 10nm Cannonlake generation a year out. Much like all of Intel's releases, Kaby Lake is coming out in phases. The first wave, in late 2016, comprised of the low-power U-series and Y-series processors for Ultrabooks, 2-in-1s and similar small devices, since these are the hottest selling PC form factors. Manufacturers were thereby able to release new products in time for the busy US holiday shopping season. Now, the same architecture is coming to servers, desktops and more traditional laptops, and we have the top-end enthusiast desktop model, the new Core i7-7700K, with us for review already. There's also a new generation of platform controllers, aka chipsets, to go with Kaby Lake. We received a shiny new Z270-based Asus Maximus IX Hero to test our CPU with, and we'll be taking a good look at it as well. Intel Core i7-7700K architecture and features Skylake was the first implementation of a new architecture, and Cannonlake was supposed to be the process shrink that followed. Now, we have an interloper, Kaby Lake - Intel is calling it the "optimisation" stage in a new three-year "process-architecture-optimisation" cycle. As such, there are few changes compared to Skylake. Intel is going so far as to say that Kaby Lake uses a "14nm+" manufacturing process, by which it means that performance gains can be realised thanks to improvements to the fabrication process alone. At the time of the U- and Y-series launch, Intel said that there would be a 12 percent increase in performance even if nothing else about the CPU itself was to change. The Core i7-7700K in particular sits at the top of the list of offerings, and has a base speed of 4.2GHz with a maximum boost speed of 4.5GHz. The K indicates an unlocked multiplier for overclockers to tinker with. This is still a quad-core CPU with Hyper-Threading, as there are no major changes to the structure of the product lineup: all desktop Core i7s still have four cores and eight threads; Core i5 CPUs have four cores but no Hyper-Threading, and Core i3s have two cores with Hyper-Threading. Still, there are some new things to talk about, most notably some major improvements to the integrated graphics capabilities of these processors. Desktop Kaby Lake CPUs will feature the new HD Graphics 630 integrated GPU which promises superior 4K video handling, including playback and encoding for the H.264, H.265, VP9, and HEVC standards at high bitrates. Specifically, hardware acceleration for 4K HEVC 10-bit encode/decode and VP9 decode are new with this generation. 4K 60fps video can be decoded at up to 120Mbps, or if the quality is a more standard 4K 30fps, up to eight streams can be decoded simultaneously. There's also now support for HDR video tone mapping with a wide color gamut in accordance with the Rec.2020 specification which is part of the HDMI 2.0 standard and widely recognised in the broadcast industry. Intel points out that Netflix and YouTube are aggressively pushing newer video standards in order to boost compression and reduce Internet bandwidth consumption, and that video is expected to account for 70 percent of all Internet traffic in 2017. This means there is a real appetite out there for such capabilities even in products aimed at consumers, not just content creators and professionals. People might not know the specifics of the standards, but "smoother and more efficient video streaming" is a highly relatable selling point. Other than graphics, there are improvements to Intel's Speed Shift algorithms which govern when and how quickly the CPU adjusts its clock speed in response to changing workloads, with the goal of reducing power draw by either getting tasks over with quickly with a burst of speed, or slowing down to keep consumption below a point. Short bursts, in the range of milliseconds each, can help a PC feel more responsive. Unsurprisingly for a stopgap product, there isn't really anything new to the CPU architecture itself. Intel is targeting people who use PCs and laptops which are now around five years old, and sure, users will see significant cumulative improvements if they haven't upgraded in that long. Kaby Lake doesn't push any new killer app or use-case scenario, but it will allow manufacturers to sell new PCs with newer, higher numbers on their spec sheets. The 2XX platform On the other hand, a lot has changed outside of the CPU, and so Intel is releasing an updated series of platform controllers, known colloquially as chipsets. Kaby Lake uses exactly the same socket as Skylake, and there is full cross-compatibility between both lines of CPUs and motherboards (with a BIOS update). You don't strictly have to match generations, but there's always more benefit in going with a newer motherboard. The 2XX series will directly replace the 1XX series, and has almost exactly the same tiers: Z270 at the top end for enthusiasts and overclockers, H270 for mainstream needs, plus Q2XX and B2XX for businesses with remote management and mass deployment needs. Only the low-end H110 for home and casual users will not be replaced with a H210, for unknown reasons. There's more PCIe 3.0 bandwidth now, with a maximum of 24 on the Z270, up from 20, and 20 on the H270, up from 16. That means more motherboards will feature standards such as USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10GBps) and Thunderbolt 3 (up to 40Gbps). Z270 boards will also be able to officially work with DDR4-2400 RAM, up from DDR4-2133, as well as Intel's upcoming Optane lineup of high-speed storage and memory products. Everything else, from the number of SATA and USB 3.0 ports to the other standards supported, remains unchanged. The Asus Maximus IX Hero Every motherboard manufacturer is riding this wave and releasing dozens upon dozens of new models. The one we have with us for our review is the Asus Maximus IX Hero, a Z270-based enthusiast model with a price tag of around Rs. 23,350. It's aimed squarely at overclockers who like to show off, but there's plenty of appeal even for less adventurous enthusiasts. The board looks absolutely gorgeous, with a dark grey finish and subtle red accents. The heatsinks and port shroud have a sculpted angular look. It has a printed pattern, like most high-end boards these days, and thankfully it isn't garish at all. The layout is bog standard, with generous amounts of room around the CPU cooler. Asus is pushing its Aura RGB lighting feature across its product line, and it's actually implemented really well on this new board. There are LEDs only around the PCH heatsink and port shroud, but they shine through various gaps and facets, looking great. There's a strip of LEDs aimed right where a CPU cooler's fan should be, lighting it up like a monument. If that isn't enough, you can connect standard LED strips to two headers on the motherboard and sync up your whole case. Of course, Asus hopes you buy one of its graphics cards and some more accessories too. One very interesting touch is the abandonment of the much-unloved SATA Express standard. This is no loss at all, considering SATA Express SSDs never hit the market. The standard 6GBps SATA ports are complemented by two M.2 slots, one of which can accommodate extra-long modules up to 110mm and also supports SATA modules. The other one goes up to the standard 80mm and can only take PCIe modules. Both are raised, which we hope helps with cooling. There's no server-grade U.2, like we've seen on higher-end boards. The rear port cluster has quite a lot going on. From left to right, there are buttons with which you can reset or update the BIOS without reaching inside your PC's case, then two Wi-Fi antenna terminals, DisplayPort and HDMI video outputs, four USB 2.0 ports, four USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports, five reassignable analog audio jacks, and digital S/PDIF. The Maximus IX Hero features an ALC S1220 codec, ESS Sabre DAC and dedicated circuitry for its onboard sound. Asus of course lists a long line of high-quality components including capacitors, chokes, and regulators for the 8+2+2 phase power design. For overclockers, there are power and monitoring terminals for water pumps and high-powered fans. There's even a debugging boot mode for those using liquid Nitrogen. We like Asus' numeric Q-code diagnostic readout, which helps diagnose boot-related issues. One final interesting touch is a new header for front-panel USB 3.1 ports, presumably including Type-C. All in all, Asus has managed to make even an incremental update feel fresh, and if this one board is any indication, there will be a lot to like about the entire lineup. Intel Core i7-7700K and Asus Maximus IX Hero performance: We tested Intel's new CPU on a matching motherboard, and compared scores to those of our Core i7-6700K. Integrated GPUs were used throughout. The specifications are as follows:   Skylake Kaby Lake CPU Intel Core i7-6700K Intel Core i7-7700K Motherboard Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 7 Asus Maximus IX Hero RAM 2x8 GB Kingston HyperX DDR4-2666 SSD 256GB Samsung SSD 950 Pro   CPU cooler Cooler Master Hyper 212X   PSU Corsair RM650   Monitor Asus PB287Q   OS Windows 10   As expected, there were no issues getting our test system up and running. We ran a variety of tests designed to challenge the CPU as well as GPU capabilities of the new platform, beginning with with standard synthetic tests, and then moving on to some light gaming and then real-world usage.   Core i7-6700K Core i7-7700K Cinebench R15 CPU multi-threaded 930 987 Cinebench R15 CPU single-threaded 182 193 Cinebench R15 OpenGL 57.5fps 61.23fps POVRay* 2m, 9s 2m, 0s WebXPRT 338 417 Basemark Web 3.0 398.79 494.64 PCMark 8 Home 3571 4010 PCMark 8 Creative 3434 4055 PCMark 8 Work 4583 4943 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra 283 297 3DMark Fire Strike 1179 1245 3DMark Time Spy 443 458 HyperPi 11.938s 11.141s SiSoft SANDRA CPU arithmetic 140.86GOPS 152.45GOPS SiSoft SANDRA CPU multimedia 426.08Mpix/s 458.52Mpix/s SiSoft SANDRA CPU encryption bandwidth 9.76GBps 10.1GBps SiSoft SANDRA CPU performance/Watt 1404.04MOPS/W 1323MOPS/W SiSoft SANDRA cache bandwidth 1404.04MOPS/W 1323MOPS/W Handbrake video encoding* 2:04 1:01 7zip file compression* 2:30 2:26 Rise of the Tomb Raider, 1920x1080, Low 11.59fps 12.46fps Star Swarm 6.15fps 8.01fps Unigine Valley, 1920x1080, Medium 19.2fps 20.9fps *lower is better The one highlight of our report card is the Handbrake video encoding test. We transcoded a 1.36GB 1080p AVI file to 720p30 H.265 MKV for this test specifically to challenge the new CPU. The i7-7700K managed to finish its workload in just under half the time taken by the Skylake CPU, which is pretty impressive. This does have implications for home users as well as content creators. We just wish that overall performance had been improved to this degree. We did try some light overclocking using Asus' bundled Dual Intelligent Processors 5 tool, which pushes speeds incrementally and performs stress tests at each stage, to verify that the system can run stably. Our sample CPU could be safely pushed to 4.8GHz using air cooling. However, when we ran our tests again, monitoring tools showed the CPU staying at 4.66GHz with only minor spikes above this level. Scores were not different enough for us to measure any significant improvement. As you can see by the results, the new Core i7-7700K does outperform its predecessor consistently, but only by small margins except in very specific scenarios. Given that pretty much the entire Kaby Lake generation is a drop-in replacement for Skylake, this is not a bad thing at all. If you're about to buy or build a new PC and prices are the same, simply buy the new instead of the old. On the other hand, this launch doesn't give anyone a reason to rush out and upgrade. Verdict While the larger buying public is unaware of Intel's behind-the-scenes roadmap changes and process technology delays, enthusiasts worry about things like whether Kaby Lake is a pointless stopgap created solely to keep a billion-dollar marketing machine running. The answer to that is while it might be true, customers are still getting slightly better performance at each level than they would have if Intel had simply prolonged the lifespan of the 6th generation. Plus, all process improvements will benefit future generations of products. Our Core i7-7700K is a solid performer with reasonably low power consumption, and will not require massive, noisy cooling solutions, and we expect the rest of the lineup to be just as good. It might take a while for pricing to settle, especially in India, so if you find a Skylake equivalent part at a significantly lower price, you can go for it without feeling like you're losing out on anything. The new GPU is of course welcome, but is more likely to be attractive to those who aren't going to pop in a much beefier graphics card, which means that desktop gamers and enthusiasts gain the least. Laptop buyers, on the other hand, would do well to look for the specific "7th Gen" wording on Intel's stickers - not only does graphics horsepower improve, but also battery life. We're much more interested in the new flood of 2XX-series motherboards from Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, ASRock and others that will soon arrive in the market. More modern connectivity is always a good thing, and we can easily see ourselves recommending these boards over previous ones even for Skylake CPUs. The Asus Maximux IX Hero is probably overkill for many, but we were very pleased with it and would recommend it without hesitation. For the past few years, reviews of high-end Intel processors have only made passing mention of AMD, the only other company in the x86 CPU race, for the simple reason that AMD has not had any product to offer that would even remotely be viable as a competitor. That could change in a dramatic way when Ryzen, its first high-performance lineup in years, is launched just a short while from now. We don't have solid information yet, but we're hoping for a fierce fight to reinvigorate this stagnant market. Finally, if recent rumours and leaks are to be believed, 10nm is delayed even further there will be a fourth 14nm generation codenamed Coffeelake next year. With very little left in the way of fresh ideas, Intel is supposedly going to make six-core desktop models mainstream. Between Ryzen and this potential development, it sounds like there's enough reason to wait a little while before upgrading - or skip Kaby Lake entirely.

The company will work with Here to develop mapping systems that can pinpoint a vehicle’s location ‘within centimeters’ for aiding autonomous cars. The deal is pending regulatory approval. Interestingly, Intel had recently said it would spend $250 million to develop self-driving cars. While the company would not develop its own cars, it would look to power certain aspects of the technology with context to “connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security and safety.” The company also builds drones for industrial jobs,and while these are currently manually controller, mapping and pinpoint locations will be mandatory for automating these technologies. Here Maps was previously acquired by an automotive industry consortium including Audi AG, BMW Group and Daimler AG, from Nokia for over $3 billion in August 2015. The consortium was also looking for a cloud computing partner to help manage the data collected by HERE and its cars, and subsequently had Amazon and Microsoft pick up minority stake in HERE, likely to fill this gap. With Intel now onboard, the consortium also has a hardware manufacturer to help develop the product. Note that Intel has started investing heavily in the fields of machine learning, automated vehicles, VR and other upcoming technologies, after missing out on the previous digital revolution – mobiles. In November Intel started providing specialized computer chips to Delphi, an auto supplier, and Mobileye, an Israeli company that specializes in vision systems for automated vehicles. The company also acquired Voke in November, a company that makes VR cameras for live sports, and Movidius in September, a startup that makes vision chips for drones and VR.In August, it acquired Nervana, a cloud based deep learning company for $400 million.

Some of these gadgets will be released over the next few days, and a majority will show up on stands in the next few months. Lenovo Legion series laptops The big news from Lenovo’s camp is the new gaming series of laptops called Legion. The two new laptops to make a debut under the new sub-brand are Y720 and Y520.

Nvidia GTX 1050 and 1050ti graphics Nvidia has announced two new variants of GTX 1050 and 1050ti GPUs (Graphics processing unit) for gaming laptops. Despite their smaller footprint, the new GPUs offer as many CUDA cores as their desktop siblings. What makes them better than their predecessor is their 16nm architecture which delivers three times more over clocking speed than 28nm-based GPUs and Nvidia’s new Battery Boost technology which makes them 30% better battery efficient. The two GPUs will be available with all major gaming laptops starting at $700 from this month onwards. Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 convertible PC Dell has upgraded the XPS 13 line-up with XPS 13 2-in-1 laptop with a flexible hinge design that allows the display to be flexed backwards up to 360 degrees so it can double up as a tablet.

Honor 6x smartphone Huawei’s sub-brand Honor is expected to release a budget smartphone called the Honor 6x. Successor to Honor 5x, the new smartphone runs on a superior HiSilicon Kirin 655 octa-core processor and dual cameras which has been a highlight in several Honor smart phones recently.

Lenovo Phab 2 Pro smartphone Lenovo has finally unveiled its first Tango-enabled smartphone.

It starts at $499 and is available in the US.

Fossil smart watches Fossil is the only wearable brand with big plans at this year’s CES and is expected to unveil multiple wearable devices across categories this time. Google’s improved operating system for smart watches, called Android Wear 2.0, is rumoured to show up on some of these Fossil smart watches expected to show up. Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate GT storage Kingston has unveiled the world’s highest capacity USB flash drives that will be available in 1TB and 2TB variants.

We covered the processor launch today in our in-depth look at Core i7-7700K CPU performance and then posted up two Intel Z270 motherboard reviews on boards released by ASUS and Gigabyte. Those reviews that we posted covered much of what you’d expect, but they didn’t cover some of the most interesting benchmarks and platform highlights as they just don’t fit well in a comparison style review. When we were playing around with the Gigabyte Aorus Z270X-Gaming 9 motherboard ($499 MSRP) we ran some fun benchmarks that weren’t included in our reviews, but still deserve a look.   32GB DDR4 4000MHz Memory Kit Support We got our hands on the Corsair Vengance LPX 32GB (4x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 4000MHz C19 memory kit (part number CMK32GX4M4B4000C19) that had the latest SPD update for the new 7th Gen Core processors and got a chance to try out on the Gigabyte Z270X-Gaming 9 motherboard. Getting an Intel Z270 motherboard to run DDR4 4000MHz and faster is very tricky to do and not many will support 4GHz memory kits and beyond Luckily for Gigabyte, the Z270X-Gaming 9 board can reach 4000MHz and they are still working on making it easier to do with refinements in the UEFI. Our early production board with beta UEFI versions liked 4GHz with all four memory banks occupied and hated having just two banks full, but that is something Gigabyte is working on perfecting. Our memory bandwidth performance with the stock XMP Profile settings with no overclock on the Intel Core i7-7700K CPU were pretty impressive. We hit over 43 GB/s in Sandra 2016 SP3 and in AIDA64 we were pushing 50 GB/s read and 60 GB/s write! Those are some serious memory bandwidth scores and they will only get better with the UEFI tweaks Gigabyte is currently working on. Impressive and did we mention this is a massive 32GB memory kit? Corsair hasn’t given us a price on this unreleased memory kit, but we are thinking it will be around $399.99. Dual Ultra-Fast M.2 with PCIe Gen3 x4 Ports For Insane Performance We’ve never messed around with installing two M.2 PCIe Gen3 x4 cards on a motherboard before, but Samsung hooked us up with a pair of Samsung SSD 950 PRO 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDs ($346.24 shipped) and we figured why not. Setting up a RAID 0 configuration in the Gigabyte Aorus Z270X-Gaming 9 was super simple with the latest UEFI featuring EZ RAID, but its still tricky setting up the Windows 10 installation. You need to install Windows 10 from a GPT formatted USB drive and then the Windows 10 installer will need the F6 Driver Diskette (the good old Intel RST Floppy Disc driver) to see the array. Once Windows you then need to install the full version of  Intel RST 15.2 and get the Intel Rapid Storage Technology software utility that you may be familiar with. Once you jump through all those installation hurdles you are left with a pretty impressive 953GB boot drive. A quick look at sequential performance using ATTO Disk Benchmark showed that we were able to hit 3.3 GB/s read and 3.0 GB/s write speeds with this setup! One of these drives is rated at 2,500MB/s read and 1,500MB/s write for sequential performance, so we are happy with these numbers on the actual boot drive in a ‘dirty’ used state. To get these numbers we did have to angle a case fan to blow across the M.2 slots as without it the Samsung SSD 950 PRO SSDs were reaching the temperature where they thermally throttle. That is the bad part about laying M.2 SSDs down flat against a board like this, but the performance numbers are nice. Intel USB 3.1 Gen 2 with USB Type-C – Extreme 40 Gb/s Thunderbolt 3 If you use an external drive to move your data around we saved the best performance feature for last! The USB Type-C port started popping up on Intel Z170 boards last year, but they standard is finally taking off. Many people are overlooking that lone port on the rear I/O panel, but you shouldn’t. We got our hands on the SanDisk Extreme 900 960 GB External Solid State Drive ($463.99 shipped) and the performance benchmarks are pretty incredible. SanDisk markets this model as beinng up to 9x faster transfer speeds than an external hard drive and twice the speed of other SSD with 850 MB/s sequential read and write speeds. Our testing showed that we were hitting 1039 MB/s sequential read and 975 MB/s sequential write in ATTO Disk Benchmark. Those are the highest ATTO benchmarks numbers that we have ever seen on USB 3.1 Gen 2 over the Type C connector on an external SSD! Overclocking Intel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake Processors Beyond 5GHz Our processor launch article covered Core i7-7700K overclocking pretty well, but it’s worth pointing out again that this is a highly overclockable chip. The Gigabyte Aorus Z270X-Gaming 9 is the flagship Intel Z270 board from Gigabyte and as long as your processor is a decent overclocker and you have a good high-end CPU cooler, reaching over 5GHz should be easy to do. The Z270X-Gaming 9 has far more settings to tweak than another other board in Gigabyte’s Aorus Z270 product lineup, so if you like have knobs to turn in the UEFI look no further. On our particular 7700K processor we hit 5,100 MHz on the Gigabyte Aorus Z270X-Gaming 9 motherboard! Hopefully some of these benchmarks are some that you haven’t seen before and will give you a better glimpse of the true potential of a modern Intel Z270 platform! A big thanks to Intel, Gigabyte, Corsair, Samsung and Sandisk on making this review possible!   Basket of Winning ✓ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ PC hardware hitting the performance saturation apex.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 3, 2017 at 10:43PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) didn't really deliver much in the way of shareholder value in 2016, with the stock up roughly 5% over the year, dramatically underperforming its key large-cap semiconductor peers. Nevertheless, despite disappointing share price returns, the chipmaker made several interesting moves in 2016 that could set the company up for longer-term success. Here's a look at Intel's best moves in 2016. A cool acquisition During the first nine months of 2016, Intel "completed eight acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate consideration (net of cash required) of $811 million." In other words, these were small, tuck-in acquisitions designed to improve Intel's technical capabilities in key areas. The acquisition of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems really piqued my interest. Nervana Systems was working on the development of a specialized chip and related software aimed at accelerating deep-learning applications. This technology, especially when combined with Intel's server processors, could give the chipmaker an edge in a key growth opportunity within the data center. One caveat: Intel's track record with respect to acquisitions isn't exactly stellar, so I'll be watching closely to see how well Intel can assimilate Nervana's technology and use it to build products that ultimately generate financial returns for the company. Conceptually, though, I like it. Taking self-driving cars seriously One of the hottest themes in the semiconductor industry is the automotive market and within that, self-driving cars. The amount of computing power required to power self-driving cars is expected to be immense, something that ought to play well to Intel's strengths given that its product portfolio is filled to the brim with high-performance processors. Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel Corporation. Image source: Intel. However, for Intel to participate and become a significant player in this market, it's going to take more than having a portfolio of fast chips. There's a lot of work to be done to build platforms suitable for self-driving cars (both hardware and software) and a ton of effort is required to come up with a successful go-to-market strategy. To that end, Intel hired automotive electronics industry veteran Kathy Winter to serve as the general manager of its automated driving solutions division. Intel also has former Intel Internet of Things group chief Doug Davis (who was expected to retire from Intel at the end of 2016) running the company's newly formed automated driving group. Topping it all off, Intel's Diane Bryant revealed at a recent investor conference that the company has already booked $1 billion in self-driving car deals. Intel seems to have made several good moves in 2016 to position itself to capitalize on the trend of increasingly intelligent cars. Dumping McAfee Back in 2010, Intel -- a chip company -- announced that it was going to shell out a whopping $7.7 billion for McAfee -- an antivirus software provider. Intel paid a roughly 60% premium to McAfee's closing price before the announcement of the deal. Intel's pitch (which you can see here; link opens PDF) was that security would become "on par with [Intel's] strategic focus areas in energy-efficient performance and Internet connectivity." The reality is that this business didn't really deliver much revenue growth for the company, and its profitability remained modest for years. SSG = software and services group. Data source: Intel financial reports.  Indeed, although Intel had amassed a number of smaller software companies over the years (likely for their technology rather than their revenues), the bulk of its Software and Services Group revenue came from the McAfee business.  In 2016, Intel announced that it would be spinning out McAfee (which Intel had renamed "Intel Security") into a jointly owned, independent cybersecurity company called McAfee. After the deal is done, Intel is expected to own 49% of McAfee while private equity company TPG Capital will own 51%. I wouldn't be surprised to see Intel quietly divest itself of the remainder of its stake over the next couple of years. Starting to dump McAfee was a great move, one that Intel shareholders and market watchers alike should applaud. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Jan 3, 2017 at 8:05PM Graphics and mobile computing specialist NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been red-hot in 2016. The stock's scorching 225% total return in 2016 made it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. You might be wondering if it's too late to invest in NVIDIA. These six charts should help you make investing decisions by giving you a broad overview of NVIDIA's business and its stock. NVIDIA Drive PX. Image source: NVIDIA. Stock performance One of the first things a potential investor in NVIDIA probably wants to know is how the stock has performed absolutely, and how it has performed relative to its main competitors/closest peers and the broader market.  The following chart shows the 2016 performances of the stocks of NVIDIA and fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Qualcomm. While NVIDIA had a terrific 2016, AMD had an even better one, gaining 293%. Qualcomm's 35.1% return comfortably beat the S&P 500's return by nearly a factor of three, while Intel was the laggard of the bunch.  While AMD's stock turned in a great performance in 2016, unlike NVIDIA, AMD is not profitable on a trailing-12-month basis, nor was it profitable in its most recently reported quarter.   Data source: YCharts. The following chart gives you a 10-year view of these same stocks. While past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future performance, past long-term performance often gives investors insight into a company's sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, chipmakers in general tend to be cyclical -- a factor that can be seen in a longer term chart.  Data source: YCharts. While NVIDIA's 10-year performance is very strong, it delivered the majority of its gains in 2016. NVIDIA was underperforming the S&P 500 (purple line) until 2016. This isn't necessarily a sign of a bad stock, but this past underperformance and overall volatility is something potential investors should be aware of. NVIDIA'S business and growth dynamics NVIDIA, which was founded in 1993 and went public in 1999, is a visual computing company that operates in two main segments, graphic processing units (GPU) and Tegra processors, both of which have been growing nicely.  The GPU business' main products include the GeForce line for gaming, Quadro for design professionals, and Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) and other applications. The Tegra segment provides processors that integrate a computer onto a single chip; end markets include a variety of things that are mobile -- mobile devices to cars to drones. NVIDIA is the dominant player in its flagship business of selling discrete GPUs for computer gaming, with this core business continuing to grow robustly. In Q3 of fiscal 2017, ended on Oct. 30, gaming revenue soared 63% year over year to $1.2 billion, accounting for 62% of the NVIDIA's total revenue. Professional visualization revenue increased 9% to $207 million, data center revenue jumped 193% to $240 million, and automotive revenue rose 61% to $127 million. For the quarter in general, revenue shot up 54% to $2.0 billion, net income soared 120% to $542 million, and earnings per share jumped 89% to $0.83.     Here's how the four core platforms, or end markets, have performed through the first nine months of fiscal 2017.  Image source: NVIDIA. Investors have poured money into NVIDIA stock because the company has the potential to capture solid market share in several relatively nascent, but fast-growing, technologies that have humongous growth potential -- such as self-driving cars, AI, and virtual reality (VR).  Notably, NVIDIA announced in Q3 that its DRIVE PX 2 platform will power a new Autopilot system in all of Tesla Motors' factory-produced vehicles -- the Model S, Model X, and upcoming Model 3. NVIDIA stock's risks  Investors shouldn't give too much power to short-sellers. After all, it's in their best interests to talk down a stock they're shorting. However, well-known short-sellers, such as Citron Research, have the power to move markets, at least in the short term -- as happened last week with NVIDIA stock -- so this topic deserves mention. Last Wednesday, Dec. 28, Citron, run by Andrew Left, tweeted that NVIDIA's stock had run-up too fast, was overvalued, and belonged at $90 per share. (The stock closed at $117.8 per share the day before.) Since that tweet, NVIDIA's stock has fallen by more than 9% to its closing price of $106.7 per share on Friday, Dec. 30.  Here's the tweet listing the six risks to NVIDIA's stock that Citron believes investors are discounting.  Image source: Citron Research via Twitter.  Citron brings up some solid points, which deserve exploring by investors. Fellow Fool Evan Niu addressed Citron's points, concluding that some of Citron's concerns are probably already priced into the stock, while some are worth acknowledging, most notably the point about the sustainability of gross margins:  [C]oncerns around gross margin are completely valid, given the expected intensification of competition in many of the growth areas that NVIDIA is enjoying right about now. Intel's vertical integration with silicon fabrication does give it cost and strategic advantages, which it will surely leverage. [NVIDIA is a fabless semiconductor manufacturer, meaning it does not fabricate its own chips.]  It wouldn't be particularly surprising if NVIDIA does pull back to $90 in 2017. Stocks that run up as fast as NVIDIA has in 2016 often do pull back if the market got ahead of itself, which is entirely possible given the significant multiple expansion that NVIDIA experienced this year.  I don't disagree with Evan, though I'd like to add that long-term investors who are bullish on NVIDIA should thank Citron. NVIDIA's prospects haven't changed since the tweet, but its stock is now less pricey, giving investors a chance to buy the stock at a valuation that's more attractive.  NVIDIA's absolute valuations are high NVIDIA's stock is pricey -- it's trading at 55.4 times trailing-12-month earnings and 36.4 times projected forward earnings. However, the stock is somewhat less pricey from a cash valuation basis -- it's trading at 49.6 trailing free cash flow (FCF). Investors should put more stock (no pun intended) into valuations based on cash flows, since cash is a better indicator of how well a company's business is performing than is net income, or earnings, which is just an accounting measure. Data by YCharts. NVIDIA's relative (to growth) valuations are more palatable Common valuation metrics -- such as the price-to-earnings (PE) -- look at valuations in a vacuum. Metrics that take growth into account can be more helpful. The PEG (P/E to trailing or future projected growth) is one such metric. As a rough rule of thumb -- there are many factors that come into play -- a PEG of 1.0 implies that a stock is fairly valued. So NVIDIA's stock doesn't seem overvalued if we factor in earnings.  Data by YCharts. The million-dollar question, of course, is whether NVIDIA can continue to churn out strong earnings growth. Wall Street projects the company will grow EPS at an average annual rate of 28.6% over the next five years. However, given that NVIDIA routinely beats analysts' estimates -- it crushed them by 46% in Q3 -- there's reason to believe long-term growth expectations will prove too conservative.  Even if Citron is right and the stock falls to about $90 per share, if NVIDIA's promise comes to fruition, the difference in five or ten years between the stock's current share price of about $106 and $90 will be insignificant.   Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Data source: Intel financial reports.  Indeed, although Intel had amassed a number of smaller software companies over the years (likely for their technology rather than their revenues), the bulk of its Software and Services Group revenue came from the McAfee business.  In 2016, Intel announced that it would be spinning out McAfee (which Intel had renamed "Intel Security") into a jointly owned, independent cybersecurity company called McAfee. After the deal is done, Intel is expected to own 49% of McAfee while private equity company TPG Capital will own 51%. I wouldn't be surprised to see Intel quietly divest itself of the remainder of its stake over the next couple of years. Starting to dump McAfee was a great move, one that Intel shareholders and market watchers alike should applaud. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Intel has formally announced the new Kaby Lake processors lineup coming this year. The said processors will also be featured in this year?s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in a few days. In line with the announcement made by Intel, many experts now believe that a MacBook 2017 refresh will also be release before long. Since the initial release of the MacBook Pro last October, Apple has been on the receiving end of many complaints. From sub par battery life to buggy display firmware, it is not looking good for Apple of late. READ ALSO: Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Review: Laptop Causing Disappointments To Owners? Many Shift To Microsoft? The recent criticisms thrown at the company have resulted in a steady migration of Mac users to Microsoft. As reported by the Microsoft blog, many Mac users are beginning to switch to the Windows system, specifically the Surface Pro. For Apple, this is terrible news indeed. Losing its loyal fanbase will definitely hurt the company in the long run. MacBook Pro (via apple.com) In recompense, Apple then has an option to do an early release of the MacBook Pro based on the Kaby Lake chips. This is probably the best case scenario for the company to gain back the trust of its loyal customers.

With over 40 new performance-class processors, these 7th Gen Intel Core processors and Intel Xeon processors based on Intel’s 14nm+ process technology power some of the best new laptops and desktops. Here's what Intel is touting for its Kaby Lake processors: --- Increased performance and reliability: We know performance matters. It’s why we continue to focus on improved performance, delivering double-digit productivity performance increases – up to 20 percent for performance and gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. With 4K and 360-degree content – people can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks and 35 percent faster on desktops. Our Intel Core vPro processors have been the gold standard for commercial computing for over a decade. With the latest 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processors, business owners and IT managers can offer new PCs with up to 10 hours of battery life and a 65 percent increase in productivity when compared with a 5-year-old PC1,6. And with many millennials today taking technology into consideration when choosing their workplace8, I’m confident the new 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based 2 in 1s and AIOs will delight them. Enhanced Security: 7th Gen Intel Core and Intel Xeon processors strengthen security with advancements in hardware-enhanced security and two-factor authentication built in to the silicon. For consumers, this frees up the hassles of remembering and typing in passwords. It also offers secure payments through fingerprint touch-to-pay. For the enterprise, our new Intel Core vPro processors, as well as Intel Core processors for business9, bring Intel Authenticate7 as a hardware-enhanced multi-factor authentication solution. Intel Authenticate verifies user identity using a combination of hardened factors such as a PIN, a Bluetooth signal from your phone or a biometric identifier like a fingerprint, making your login a million times safer10. We are expanding our security partnership with Microsoft* and plan to integrate Windows* Hello and Intel Authenticate together for a seamless user experience. 4K UHD Entertainment: Thanks to the new media engine in all 7th Gen Intel Core processors, it is possible to stream 4K UHD movies and TV shows7 on services such as Netflix* on a computer for the first time. This means that critically acclaimed titles like “The Crown” and “Stranger Things” can be watched at home or on the go in brilliant 4K on your 7th Gen Intel Core computer. With the availability of other premium content providers like Sony* Pictures ULTRA, FandangoNOW* and iQiyi* coming in 2017, your 7th Gen-based PC is now a 4K theater. VR and Gaming: With virtual reality and gaming growing at an incredible pace, the need for computing horsepower everywhere has never been more essential. In gaming and VR, the processor not only provides the power to drive these system-intensive games, but is also responsible for important capabilities like particle physics and object persistence. That’s a technical way of saying it makes objects look and act more lifelike – creating a completely immersive experience. Intel puts the reality in virtual reality. And for those gamers on the go? The new Intel Iris Plus graphics in laptops7 makes it possible to take a game like Overwatch* with you and play in full HD. Enhanced Content Creation: Content creators will have the ability to do more from both a creativity and productivity standpoint. 7th Gen Intel Core processors with Intel HD7 and Intel Iris Plus Graphics7 provide laptops the power and graphics to create, stitch and share 4K UHD 360-degree videos and simultaneously transfer and display dual 4K video and fast storage through a single port and cable with Thunderbolt 3. --- The Intel U-Series of processors are appropriate for MacBooks and perhaps the Mac Mini. The H-Series processors would be ideal for the MacBook Pro and the S-Series processors are suitable for the iMac. Unfortunately, the Kaby Lake processors provide minimal performance improvements over Skylake. Additionally, MacBook Pro users may be disappointed to learn that the H-Series processors do not support LPDDR4. Apple limited the new MacBook Pro to 16GB RAM because the LPDDR3 limit is 16GB/chip and it needed the power savings of LPDDR for battery life. This means we likely won't see 32GB of RAM in the MacBook Pro until Intel's Cannonlake processors which do support LPDDR4. Hit the link below for more details on the new 7th gen core processors...

By TheresePoletti Columnist Nvidia Corp. is set to take the stage in Las Vegas at CES 2017 on Wednesday evening, where it will upstage rival Intel Corp. following a monster year for the graphics-chip maker. Nvidia NVDA, -0.01% was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, with its stock soaring 224%, while rival Intel’s INTC, +0.22%   shares eked out an approximate 5.2% gain in 2016. The evening keynote, the first one at CES, has been given by either Intel or Microsoft Corp. in recent years — Intel CEO Brian Krzanich took the stage the past two years. Nvidia is mostly known for its graphics chips and cards popular with video-gamers, but it has also made successful forays into new arenas with its high-performance graphics processors — most notably used in data centers and automotive systems — with their focus on deep learning and artificial intelligence. In its most recent third-quarter results, revenue for the 23-year-old chip company soared 54% to $2 billion, far above Wall Street’s expectations. How Nvidia Went From Gaming to GPUs(3:12) Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang talks about how GPU processing revolutionized his business. He speaks at the WSJDLive conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. The company said in a recent press release that “you can be sure” its CEO and co-founder Jen-Hsun Huang will “break news in some of the areas we’re focused on: artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, virtual reality and gaming.” The company may unveil the next iteration of its current graphics processing unit and/or graphics board, based on its current Pascal architecture, but it could also make some announcements in the arena of automotive news, where its chips are being used as part of auto infotainment systems and in self-driving cars. In its last earnings call, Nvidia also noted that customers such as Amazon.com’s AMZN, +0.43%  Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, +0.14%  Azure and Alibaba’s BABA, +0.39%   AliCloud are all using its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence, data analytics and high-performance computing in their data centers. “They are all using GPUs to do deep learning,” said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy. Moorhead said he expects a bit of a victory lap from Huang and a reiteration of Nvidia’s place in the current tech world, where it is involved in all the fields that have the biggest buzz. “This is an indication of how hot Nvidia is right now,” Moorhead said. “They are at the epicenter of all of the cool things, almost every buzz word you can think of, self-driving cars, AI, drones are likely done with deep neural network training, games ... They are this center point of some really cool stuff.” While Moorhead is not worried about Intel’s position, the Silicon Valley chip giant has been making both defensive and offensive moves for the future. Last August it bought Nervana Systems, a startup focused on deep learning, to bolster its focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, and Intel is clearly gearing up for a battle for the hearts of self-driving cars. Just Tuesday, it bought a 15% stake in Here International B.V., to jointly develop navigation technology for self-driving cars, among its other efforts, such as its pact with BMW AG and Mobileye NV. Intel is hosting its own press conference at CES late Wednesday afternoon, where it says CEO Krzanich will “immerse you in virtual reality to experience how Intel technology is extending far beyond consumer electronics to define almost every aspect of our lives and transform industries.” Investors will likely be focused on Huang’s keynote for signs of whether Nvidia can continue its huge momentum going into 2017.

Then again, it’s not surprising either. The first batch of 7th gen “Kaby Lake” Intel Core CPUs it announced back in August were part of its Y-series, focused primarily on detachables and PCs on a stick. Now it is putting its 14 nm processors into full swing with U, H, and S series that aim for more powerful PCs, especially gaming ones. That said, Intel still has something for “thin and light” laptops and convertibles. The new members of its U series boast of a never before heard “Intel Plus” graphics chip. In reality, the Iris Plus seems to sit in between a plain Iris and an Iris Pro with 64 MB of eDRAM. These processors, however, are rarely seen except in MacBooks and Intel’s own NUC boxes. The H-Series is meant for more powerful laptops used as workstations. As such, they have an appropriately higher power draw at 45W. And finally, there are the S-Series monsters that are destined for socketed desktops and even some mini computers, going up to 65W TDP. A core focus of these new 7th gen Intel Core processors is on enabling 4K as well as 360-degree content, particularly through hardware decoding and encoding as well as support for DRM protection. This isn’t surprising considering how Intel wants to position itself as a prime choice for AR and VR experiences.

Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Jan 3, 2017 at 8:05PM Graphics and mobile computing specialist NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been red-hot in 2016. The stock's scorching 225% total return in 2016 made it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year. You might be wondering if it's too late to invest in NVIDIA. These six charts should help you make investing decisions by giving you a broad overview of NVIDIA's business and its stock. NVIDIA Drive PX. Image source: NVIDIA. Stock performance One of the first things a potential investor in NVIDIA probably wants to know is how the stock has performed absolutely, and how it has performed relative to its main competitors/closest peers and the broader market.  The following chart shows the 2016 performances of the stocks of NVIDIA and fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and Qualcomm. While NVIDIA had a terrific 2016, AMD had an even better one, gaining 293%. Qualcomm's 35.1% return comfortably beat the S&P 500's return by nearly a factor of three, while Intel was the laggard of the bunch.  While AMD's stock turned in a great performance in 2016, unlike NVIDIA, AMD is not profitable on a trailing-12-month basis, nor was it profitable in its most recently reported quarter.   Data source: YCharts. The following chart gives you a 10-year view of these same stocks. While past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future performance, past long-term performance often gives investors insight into a company's sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, chipmakers in general tend to be cyclical -- a factor that can be seen in a longer term chart.  Data source: YCharts. While NVIDIA's 10-year performance is very strong, it delivered the majority of its gains in 2016. NVIDIA was underperforming the S&P 500 (purple line) until 2016. This isn't necessarily a sign of a bad stock, but this past underperformance and overall volatility is something potential investors should be aware of. NVIDIA'S business and growth dynamics NVIDIA, which was founded in 1993 and went public in 1999, is a visual computing company that operates in two main segments, graphic processing units (GPU) and Tegra processors, both of which have been growing nicely.  The GPU business' main products include the GeForce line for gaming, Quadro for design professionals, and Tesla for artificial intelligence (AI) and other applications. The Tegra segment provides processors that integrate a computer onto a single chip; end markets include a variety of things that are mobile -- mobile devices to cars to drones. NVIDIA is the dominant player in its flagship business of selling discrete GPUs for computer gaming, with this core business continuing to grow robustly. In Q3 of fiscal 2017, ended on Oct. 30, gaming revenue soared 63% year over year to $1.2 billion, accounting for 62% of the NVIDIA's total revenue. Professional visualization revenue increased 9% to $207 million, data center revenue jumped 193% to $240 million, and automotive revenue rose 61% to $127 million. For the quarter in general, revenue shot up 54% to $2.0 billion, net income soared 120% to $542 million, and earnings per share jumped 89% to $0.83.     Here's how the four core platforms, or end markets, have performed through the first nine months of fiscal 2017.  Image source: NVIDIA. Investors have poured money into NVIDIA stock because the company has the potential to capture solid market share in several relatively nascent, but fast-growing, technologies that have humongous growth potential -- such as self-driving cars, AI, and virtual reality (VR).  Notably, NVIDIA announced in Q3 that its DRIVE PX 2 platform will power a new Autopilot system in all of Tesla Motors' factory-produced vehicles -- the Model S, Model X, and upcoming Model 3. NVIDIA stock's risks  Investors shouldn't give too much power to short-sellers. After all, it's in their best interests to talk down a stock they're shorting. However, well-known short-sellers, such as Citron Research, have the power to move markets, at least in the short term -- as happened last week with NVIDIA stock -- so this topic deserves mention. Last Wednesday, Dec. 28, Citron, run by Andrew Left, tweeted that NVIDIA's stock had run-up too fast, was overvalued, and belonged at $90 per share. (The stock closed at $117.8 per share the day before.) Since that tweet, NVIDIA's stock has fallen by more than 9% to its closing price of $106.7 per share on Friday, Dec. 30.  Here's the tweet listing the six risks to NVIDIA's stock that Citron believes investors are discounting.  Image source: Citron Research via Twitter.  Citron brings up some solid points, which deserve exploring by investors. Fellow Fool Evan Niu addressed Citron's points, concluding that some of Citron's concerns are probably already priced into the stock, while some are worth acknowledging, most notably the point about the sustainability of gross margins:  [C]oncerns around gross margin are completely valid, given the expected intensification of competition in many of the growth areas that NVIDIA is enjoying right about now. Intel's vertical integration with silicon fabrication does give it cost and strategic advantages, which it will surely leverage. [NVIDIA is a fabless semiconductor manufacturer, meaning it does not fabricate its own chips.]  It wouldn't be particularly surprising if NVIDIA does pull back to $90 in 2017. Stocks that run up as fast as NVIDIA has in 2016 often do pull back if the market got ahead of itself, which is entirely possible given the significant multiple expansion that NVIDIA experienced this year.  I don't disagree with Evan, though I'd like to add that long-term investors who are bullish on NVIDIA should thank Citron. NVIDIA's prospects haven't changed since the tweet, but its stock is now less pricey, giving investors a chance to buy the stock at a valuation that's more attractive.  NVIDIA's absolute valuations are high NVIDIA's stock is pricey -- it's trading at 55.4 times trailing-12-month earnings and 36.4 times projected forward earnings. However, the stock is somewhat less pricey from a cash valuation basis -- it's trading at 49.6 trailing free cash flow (FCF). Investors should put more stock (no pun intended) into valuations based on cash flows, since cash is a better indicator of how well a company's business is performing than is net income, or earnings, which is just an accounting measure. Data by YCharts. NVIDIA's relative (to growth) valuations are more palatable Common valuation metrics -- such as the price-to-earnings (PE) -- look at valuations in a vacuum. Metrics that take growth into account can be more helpful. The PEG (P/E to trailing or future projected growth) is one such metric. As a rough rule of thumb -- there are many factors that come into play -- a PEG of 1.0 implies that a stock is fairly valued. So NVIDIA's stock doesn't seem overvalued if we factor in earnings.  Data by YCharts. The million-dollar question, of course, is whether NVIDIA can continue to churn out strong earnings growth. Wall Street projects the company will grow EPS at an average annual rate of 28.6% over the next five years. However, given that NVIDIA routinely beats analysts' estimates -- it crushed them by 46% in Q3 -- there's reason to believe long-term growth expectations will prove too conservative.  Even if Citron is right and the stock falls to about $90 per share, if NVIDIA's promise comes to fruition, the difference in five or ten years between the stock's current share price of about $106 and $90 will be insignificant.   Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 3, 2017 at 6:57PM I have often been critical of microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) execution in many areas, ranging from its ill-fated efforts to build mobile applications processors to its recent stumbles in chip manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel.  Nevertheless, there are some moves that Intel's current management has made over the last several years that I think were quite sensible. Here are three. Picking up Altera In mid-2015, Intel announced that it would be acquiring programmable logic specialist Altera for $16.7 billion. Intel's rationale for this buy was based on two key theses. The first is that Intel could strengthen Altera's core programmable logic chip business by building future Altera chips using Intel's chip manufacturing technology. This, Intel argued in an investor presentation, "will increase the competitiveness of Altera's existing products." The second is that Intel aims to integrate Altera's FPGA technology with its processors aimed at both the server market as well as the Internet of Things market. Intel said in an investor presentation that it thinks that "up to 1/3 of cloud service provider nodes" could use FPGAs. Additionally, the company said that in the Internet of Things market, its processors integrated with FPGAs could open a roughly $11 billion "incremental [serviceable addressable market] by 2020 as integrated FPGAs become cost competitive with [application specific integrated circuits] & [application specific standard products]." It remains to be seen how well Intel can take advantage of the Altera assets (there is significant execution risk here given Intel's poor track record with large acquisitions), but conceptually the acquisition is an interesting one. Diversifying beyond processors in the data center Intel's data center group (DCG) is arguably the company's most important business over the long term. It is large, very profitable, and has good long-term growth prospects. Although Intel is a primarily a processor specialist, the company has worked to try to build out a portfolio of products aimed at data center customers that goes beyond processors. This is smart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, these non-processor products simply bring in a significant amount of revenue. Year-to-date, Intel's non-processor data center products have pulled in $979 million in revenue, meaning that the company rakes in more than $1 billion in revenue on an annualized basis from such products. Additionally, sales of such products are growing at a faster rate than processor products, which has helped accelerate the growth rate of DCG. Year-to-date, the processor portion of DCG is up about 6.9%; the non-processor portion of DCG is up nearly 18% and has the potential to accelerate going forward. Succeeding in the Internet of Things It's hard for a company of Intel's size and scale to find meaningful new growth opportunities, but the company's continued investments in its Internet of Things group seem to be yielding results. Today, the company's Internet of Things business generates less than $3 billion in annual revenue, but the segment has been on a growth path for several years. It grew by 19% in 2014, 7.3% in 2015, and is up more than 14% year to date. With new opportunities emerging in this space, such as self-driving cars, it's likely that Intel's Internet of Things group will continue to be an interesting growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead.

By Chris Duckett | January 3, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (09:00 PST) | Topic: Hardware (Image: Intel) The 14-nanometre Kaby Lake family of chips has expanded to 42, with Intel announcing 40 new chips based on its seventh-generation Core architecture on Tuesday, ranging from the unlocked 91W-using 4.2GHz base frequency i7-7700K to the 1GHz 7W m3-7Y30 chip. The chip giant has broken up its processor line into four categories: The Y-series for detachables and compute stick; the U-series for laptops, convertibles, and minis; the H-series for Xeon laptops and mobile workstations; and the S-series for traditional desktops. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage Among the latest chip release is a new unlocked S-series i3 chip dubbed the i3-7350K that offers 4 threads on a dual-core processing unit running at 4.2GHz, and taking in 60 watts of power. The i3-7350K will be available a month after its i7-7700K and i5-7600K brethren. On the integrated graphics front, all SKUs offering eDRAM will use the new Iris Plus branding instead of Iris Pro. According to Intel's numbers, Iris Plus on its U-series offers around 65 percent better 3D graphic performance compared to the HD620 graphics offered on its U-series non-Iris chips. Intel is also unveiling two Xeon processors for mobile workstations, the E3-1535M v6 and the E3-1505M v6. The slighty quicker quad-core hyperthreaded E3-1535M v6 offers a 3.1GHz base frequency, 4.2GHz single-core turbo, and 3.9GHz quad-core turbo; whereas the E3-1505M v6 is just behind, at 3.0GHz base, 4.0GHz single-core turbo, and 3.6GHz quad-core turbo frequency. The chip giant said pricing will sit at $623 for the E3-1535M v6 and $434 for the E3-1505M v6, and both models come with HD P630 graphics. Last year's E3-1535M v5 sat at 2.9GHz base and 3.8GHz turbo frequencies, with the E3-1505M v5 clocking in with 2.8GHz base and 3.7GHz turbo frequencies. For its H-series core chips, Intel is touting a 20 percent "productivity improvement", but that comparison is against a 2013 22-nanometre i7-4700HQ running at a base frequency of 2.4GHz and using 8GB of DDR3 memory compared to the 14nm i7-7700HQ running at 2.8GHz and packing 16GB of DDR4 memory. In preparation for the arrival of its Optane 3D XPoint SSD later this year, Intel will be labelling motherboards with an M.2 slot using its 200 series chip as "Optane Memory Ready". The chip giant has baked a number of security features into the silicon, including biometrics, password management, and two-factor authentication. "For consumers, adding biometrics plus hardware-based security makes it both easier and safer to buy online," the company said in a statement. "Intel is working with partners to enable secure fingerprint touch to pay, and Secure Guest Checkout which provides hardware-level data protection to better verify that you are you. "Intel is also working with Password Manager providers to provide simpler and more secure web login to online sites and services through password manager applications that take advantage of Intel security hardware." Pricing for Kaby Lake chips per 1000 units is: E3-1535M v6: $623 i7-7920HQ: $568 E3-1505M v6: $434 i7-7660U, i7-7560U, i7-7567U, i7-7287U: $415 i7-7Y75, i7-7600U, i7-7500U: $393 i7-7820HQ, i7-7820HK, i7-7700HQ: $378 i7-7700K: $339 i5-7360U, i5-7260U, i5-7267U, i3-7167U: $304 i7-7700, i7-7700T: $303 i5-7Y57, i5-7Y54, m3-7Y30, i5-7300U, i5-7200U, i3-7100U: $281 i5-7440HQ, i5-7300HQ: $250 i3-7100H: $225 i5-7600K: $242 i5-7600, i5-7600T: $213 i5-7500, i5-7500T: $192 i5-7400, i5-7400T: $182 i3-7350K: $168 i3-7320: $149 i3-7300, i3-7300T: $138 i3-7100, i3-7100T: $117 (Image: Intel) Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Hardware 2017: The best laptops for education Mobility Barnes & Noble pulls Nook Tablet 7-inch from sale due to faulty charger Smartphones It's time to stop dreaming: iOS and Android have won the mobile war iPhone 'Transparent' iPhone, patents, and fake news × Thank You Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription I agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 3, 2017 at 6:57PM I have often been critical of microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) execution in many areas, ranging from its ill-fated efforts to build mobile applications processors to its recent stumbles in chip manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel.  Nevertheless, there are some moves that Intel's current management has made over the last several years that I think were quite sensible. Here are three. Picking up Altera In mid-2015, Intel announced that it would be acquiring programmable logic specialist Altera for $16.7 billion. Intel's rationale for this buy was based on two key theses. The first is that Intel could strengthen Altera's core programmable logic chip business by building future Altera chips using Intel's chip manufacturing technology. This, Intel argued in an investor presentation, "will increase the competitiveness of Altera's existing products." The second is that Intel aims to integrate Altera's FPGA technology with its processors aimed at both the server market as well as the Internet of Things market. Intel said in an investor presentation that it thinks that "up to 1/3 of cloud service provider nodes" could use FPGAs. Additionally, the company said that in the Internet of Things market, its processors integrated with FPGAs could open a roughly $11 billion "incremental [serviceable addressable market] by 2020 as integrated FPGAs become cost competitive with [application specific integrated circuits] & [application specific standard products]." It remains to be seen how well Intel can take advantage of the Altera assets (there is significant execution risk here given Intel's poor track record with large acquisitions), but conceptually the acquisition is an interesting one. Diversifying beyond processors in the data center Intel's data center group (DCG) is arguably the company's most important business over the long term. It is large, very profitable, and has good long-term growth prospects. Although Intel is a primarily a processor specialist, the company has worked to try to build out a portfolio of products aimed at data center customers that goes beyond processors. This is smart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, these non-processor products simply bring in a significant amount of revenue. Year-to-date, Intel's non-processor data center products have pulled in $979 million in revenue, meaning that the company rakes in more than $1 billion in revenue on an annualized basis from such products. Additionally, sales of such products are growing at a faster rate than processor products, which has helped accelerate the growth rate of DCG. Year-to-date, the processor portion of DCG is up about 6.9%; the non-processor portion of DCG is up nearly 18% and has the potential to accelerate going forward. Succeeding in the Internet of Things It's hard for a company of Intel's size and scale to find meaningful new growth opportunities, but the company's continued investments in its Internet of Things group seem to be yielding results. Today, the company's Internet of Things business generates less than $3 billion in annual revenue, but the segment has been on a growth path for several years. It grew by 19% in 2014, 7.3% in 2015, and is up more than 14% year to date. With new opportunities emerging in this space, such as self-driving cars, it's likely that Intel's Internet of Things group will continue to be an interesting growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Agam Shah More like this Battle lines drawn as Chromebooks, Windows PCs renew rivalry at CES Next year's premium smartphones may get Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chip Qualcomm awakens and hopes to crush Intel at its own game Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Take your pick: whether you choose an Android smartphone, Windows 10 laptop or hybrid PC device, you'll be able to run Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. That sums up the versatility of the new chip: designed primarily for Android smartphones, it has the horsepower to run a PC. In fact, the Snapdragon 835 will  bring never-before-seen features to Windows PCs. The chip, based on ARM architecture, will first arrive in smartphones later this quarter, with a good chance of appearing in new handsets from Samsung, HTC and LG. It will also appear in PCs running Windows 10 later this year. Microsoft and Qualcomm in December announced they were collaborating to bring the Snapdragon 835 to "cellular PCs," which are thin-and-light Windows 10 laptops with smartphone-like, always-on connectivity to the internet. When users buy a laptop with the Snapdragon 835, they will also get the fastest available LTE modem, Bluetooth 5 and Wi-Fi that supports the emerging 802.11ad standard, which is faster than today's 802.11ac. LTE connectivity doesn't come standard with PCs, but that could change with the Snapdragon 835. In addition, the Snapdragon 835 has a fast eight-core CPU with four cores to run high-performance applications and four power-efficient cores for mundane tasks like audio playback. It has an integrated GPU that supports 4K video, DirectX 12 gaming and virtual reality headsets. The chip will be able to do a lot of what Intel's mobile chips can do. The Snapdragon 835 is the first smartphone chip that has the ability to legitimately challenge Intel's decades-long domination in PCs. In interviews, Dell, Lenovo and HP executives said the idea of cellular PCs with the Snapdragon 835 is interesting, especially with the line between PCs and mobile devices blurring. More PCs need to be constantly connected to the internet for web browsing, e-mail, applications and cloud services. The capabilities of the Snapdragon 835, along with Microsoft and Qualcomm's promotional efforts, virtually ensures that some PCs will end up running the chip. However, PC makers are taking a cautious approach. They are still evaluating the Snapdragon 835 and haven't yet committed to releasing hardware based on it. That caution could be tied to the rough history of ARM-based Windows PCs. In 2012, PC makers like Dell and Asus took a chance and built devices with Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 for ARM-based tablets and PCs. Microsoft also built a Surface tablet with a Qualcomm chip. But Windows RT was a bust, partly because of issues related to incompatibility of x86 applications and drivers. Users turned back to Windows PCs running on x86 chips from Intel and AMD. But times have changed, and Qualcomm has observed and learned. The Snapdragon 835 will run a full version of Windows on ARM, and x86 applications will work, said Cisco Cheng, an evangelist for Qualcomm's Snapdragon technologies. Microsoft has put up a Youtube video showing Windows 10 running on a PC with the Snapdragon 835. The PC runs a 64-bit version of the OS, supports touch and Windows Ink features, and also can run Win32 applications via hardware-level emulation. But there is also a new set of opportunities for PCs with the Snapdragon 835, Cheng said. PCs will be thinner, batteries will be bigger, and groundbreaking wireless connectivity features will come to all devices using the chip, Cheng said. The Snapdragon 835 -- which is based on the Kryo 280 architecture -- is smaller than a U.S. penny and will take up very little space on a laptop or 2-in-1. That helps slim down and reduce the device's weight, and saves space for a bigger battery. Qualcomm's new chip also integrates the latest LTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Intel hasn't yet integrated Wi-Fi or an LTE modem into its PC chips, giving Qualcomm an advantage. The Snapdragon 835 also has the fastest LTE modem, able to download data at up to 1Gbps. That's even faster than modems in the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, which can download data at 600Mbps. PCs with the Snapdragon 835 will also get Bluetooth 5, which can transfer data at 2Mbps, two times faster than Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 also has a longer range than its predecessor. In addition, Snapdragon 835 laptops will support 802.11ad, an emerging Wi-Fi standard that can theoretically transfer data at speeds of up to 7Gbps. Qualcomm's promoting a realistic speed of about 4.6Gbps. The chip also has a feature called Quick Charge 4, which provides five hours of talk time on a smartphone after just a five-minute recharge. That feature could make it to PCs. But there are hurdles. Intel's latest CPUs could handily beat the Snapdragon 835 in performance benchmarks. Intel's chips are built for performance, while the Snapdragon 835 is built for power-efficiency on mobile devices, which drags down performance. Qualcomm did not provide information on CPU performance improvements in the 835 compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 820. But the 835's Adreno 540 GPU is about 25 percent faster compared to the GPU in the older chip. PC makers have been designing laptops and desktops around Intel chips for decades, creating a challenge for Qualcomm. PCs need to be designed and tweaked around a processor, which can be a 12- to 18-month process. So it could take some time for PC makers to design Snapdragon-based laptops and 2-in-1s. Exactly how PCs will take advantage of the Snapdragon 835 will become clear later this year. But the chip provides opportunities to bring different OSes to PCs. For example, Snapdragon provides a chance to bring Google's Android-based mobile DayDream VR platform to PCs.

The amount to be paid by Intel wasn't disclosed. The two firms have also signed an agreement in a move to take on the automated driving trend. The goal is to cooperate on the development of new technologies for real-time updates of high definition maps aimed for use on fully-automated driving. In the announcement, Intel described the companies' vision for their collaboration: "The proof-of-concept architecture HERE and Intel plan to deliver will be designed to help make autonomous driving as safe and predictable as possible. For example, today’s navigation technology can pinpoint a car’s location to within meters, but next generation, HD mapping supports localization to within centimeters." Intel will also work with Audi, BMW, and Daimler to test out the planned architecture with the view to make it more widely available across the automotive market. Of particular benefit for vehicle manufacturers will be decreased development and delivery timeframes. Furthermore, the agreement also aims to explore opportunities in IoT and machine learning. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

Roadshow by Terry Collins January 3, 2017 4:09 PM PST @terryscollins Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show Intel is revving up its presence in the self-driving car game by buying a 15 percent stake in Here, a mapping technology company. Intel is vying for a bigger spot in the self-driving car race. The Silicon Valley chipmaker said Tuesday it's buying a 15 percent stake in Here, a mapping company, to develop autonomous positioning systems used in driverless vehicles. Financial details weren't disclosed. The Intel deal comes less than 18 months after Here was sold by Nokia to European automakers Audi, BMW and Daimler. During the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, Intel announced plans to invest more than $250 million over the next two years "to make fully autonomous driving a reality." It's all part of grand plan to keep pace with the likes of Google, Tesla and Uber in pursuing technology to put self-driving vehicles on the road. And, in Intel's case by 2021 or sooner. In a joint statement Tuesday, Intel and Here said they will be working on technology for "maps for highly and fully automated driving." "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Here CEO Edzard Overbeek agrees. "A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," he said. Intel will also work with Audi, BMW and Daimler for testing, the companies said. First published January 3, 1:57 p.m PT. Update, 3:55 p.m. PT: Adds background about Intel and comments from Here CEO.

The last time was around early 2011 when the Sandy Bridge Core i7-2600K and i5-2500K landed. Both were considerably faster than then flagship Core i7 975 EE and competing Phenom II X6 1100T but came at a fraction of the price. With notable performance boosts, a number of new features and significantly reduced consumption, Sandy Bridge was worth getting excited about. A year later the Ivy Bridge replacement arrived and while it wasn't as exciting as its predecessor, we were prepared for that at the time and appreciated the ~10% boost to performance and efficiency. Tick-tock, remember? Haswell came another year later, in June 2013 and despite being paired with new chipsets and motherboards, it seemed like Intel's least exciting release in recent times. If its initial launch wasn't lackluster enough, Intel dragged it out for another year with a 'Haswell-refresh'. PC enthusiasts fell on hard times and we knew AMD didn't have anything in the pipeline either. By mid-2015, Intel made it to the 14nm process with Broadwell, though you would be forgiven for missing it. Availability was virtually non-existent and as a result prices were inflated. Broadwell seemed more like an experiment with few Core i5 and Core i7 processors to speak of and no Core i3 or lower-end models. Skylake reared its head toward the end of 2015 and despite packing a new platform with DDR4 memory, it was still another baby step in terms of performance and efficiency. So much so that in a clock-for-clock comparison with Haswell, Skylake was often slower if tested with DDR4-2400 memory, though it has since pulled ahead by a reasonable margin with an abundance of DDR4-3000+ memory available at attractive prices. Fast forward 16 or so months to today and we have the official introduction of Intel's 7th-generation desktop processor series. Codenamed 'Kaby Lake', the architecture is said to deliver new levels of performance courtesy of the company's latest 14nm+ process. Intel had anticipated that mobile variants of Kaby Lake would be up to 12% faster than the previous Skylake models and similar claims have been made for the desktop models. Before we get into benchmarking, here's a bit more information about Kaby Lake, their accompanying chipsets and some cool new motherboards. Meet the Kabies Intel's new Kaby Lake desktop series (S-Series) features a number of familiar faces. For instance, the i7-7700K is stepping in for the 6700K, while the 6600K will be replaced by the 7600K. Here's a full breakdown of the Core i3, i5 and i7 S-Series processors. Model Price Cores/Threads Base Frequency Boost Frequency L3 Cache TDP Core i7-7700K $305.00 4C/8T 4.2 GHz 4.5 GHz 8MB 91W Core i7-7700 $272.00 4C/8T 3.6 GHz 4.2 GHz 8MB 65W Core i5-7600K $217.00 4C/4T 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz 6MB 91W Core i5-7600 $199.00 4C/4T 3.5 GHz 4.1 GHz 6MB 65W Core i5-7500 $179.00 4C/4T 3.4 GHz 3.8 GHz 6MB 65W Core i5-7400 $170.00 4C/4T 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz 6MB 65W Core i3-7350K $157.00 2C/4T 4.2 GHz N/A 4MB 60W Core i3-7320 $139.00 2C/4T 4.1 GHz N/A 4MB 51W Core i3-7300 $129.00 2C/4T 4.0 GHz N/A 4MB 51W Core i3-7100 $109.00 2C/4T 3.9 GHz N/A 3MB 51W Compared to their Skylake counterparts, it looks like the Kaby Lake models are clocked at least 100MHz higher while some have as much as a 300MHz clock speed advantage. For example, the Core i7-7700 runs 200MHz higher than the 6700K with a 300MHz higher maximum single core turbo boost frequency. The only other noteworthy change is the upgrade to HD Graphics 630, though this only appears to be a minor upgrade. Both models run the integrated graphics engine at up to 1150MHz. The other processor that we have on hand is the Core i5-7600K which comes clocked at 3.8GHz but depending on load can boost as high as 4.2GHz. Of course, like the 7700K the 7600K is an unlocked processor and when paired with a Z170 or Z270 motherboard it can be overclocked to operate at greater frequencies. When compared to the 6600K, the 7600K runs 300MHz faster, so this could afford it up to 8% better performance based on frequency alone. Same Socket, New Chipsets Intel is sticking with the LGA 1151 socket for this generation so that means Kaby Lake can be used on existing Intel 100-series motherboards, providing their BIOS is up to date. However, in an effort to add a little spice and probably keep the board partners happy Intel is also releasing a new range of 200-series chipsets. Model Z270 H270 B250 Q270 Q250 Chipset PCI Express 3.0 Lanes Up to 24 Up to 20 Up to 12 Up to 24 Up to 14 SATA 3.0 (6 Gb/s) Ports Up to 6 Up to 6 Up to 6 Up to 6 Up to 6 USB 3.0 Ports Up to 10 8 6 8 8 Total USB Ports (USB 2.0 + 3.0) 14 14 12 14 14 Intel RST for PCIe 3.0 Storage Ports 3 2 1 1 1 Processor PCI Express 3.0 Lanes 1x16 or 2x8 or1x8+2x4 1x16 1x16 1x16 or 2x8 or 1x8+2x4 1x16 DMI Speed 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Intel Management Engine 11.6 Consumer Consumer /Corporate Consumer /Corporate Corporate Corporate Intel vPro Technology No No No Yes No Intel Standard Manageability No No No Yes Yes Intel Platform Trust Technology 3.0 No No No Yes Yes Intel Device Protection Technology Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Overclocking Yes No No No No Intel Stable Image Platform No No No Yes Yes Independent Display Support 3 3 3 3 3 System Memory Support DDR4/3L DDR4/3L DDR4/3L DDR4/3L DDR4/3L System Memory Channels/SPC 2/2 2/2 2/2 2/2 2/2 The desktop range will be comprised of the Z270, H270, B250, Q270 and Q250 chipsets. Enthusiasts will be primarily interested in the Z270, most notably because it's the only one to support overclocking of the CPU and DDR4 memory. The Q270 lacks overclocking support but picks up a number of 'enterprise' type features such as Intel vPro Technology, Intel Stable Image Platform and Intel Standard Manageability. The other business focused chipset is the Q250, a cut down version of the Q270 offering fewer PCIe lanes, USB 3.0 ports and lack of Intel vPro. The H270 chipset fills the same role as last generation's H170, basically appealing to those not buying an unlocked K-processor, as well as those who want to run a single graphics card, which these days is most of us. Those opting for a Core i3 processor might want to consider a B250 motherboard. Compared to the H270, you get far fewer PCIe 3.0 lanes at 12, only six USB 3.0 ports, one M.2 port, and a single PCIe x16 slot, but frankly this configuration is ample for entry-level PCs.

That sums up the versatility of the new chip: designed primarily for Android smartphones, it has the horsepower to run a PC. In fact, the Snapdragon 835 will  bring never-before-seen features to Windows PCs. The chip, based on ARM architecture, will first arrive in smartphones later this quarter, with a good chance of appearing in new handsets from Samsung, HTC and LG. It will also appear in PCs running Windows 10 later this year. Microsoft and Qualcomm in December announced they were collaborating to bring the Snapdragon 835 to "cellular PCs," which are thin-and-light Windows 10 laptops with smartphone-like, always-on connectivity to the internet. When users buy a laptop with the Snapdragon 835, they will also get the fastest available LTE modem, Bluetooth 5 and Wi-Fi that supports the emerging 802.11ad standard, which is faster than today's 802.11ac. LTE connectivity doesn't come standard with PCs, but that could change with the Snapdragon 835. In addition, the Snapdragon 835 has a fast eight-core CPU with four cores to run high-performance applications and four power-efficient cores for mundane tasks like audio playback. It has an integrated GPU that supports 4K video, DirectX 12 gaming and virtual reality headsets. The chip will be able to do a lot of what Intel's mobile chips can do. The Snapdragon 835 is the first smartphone chip that has the ability to legitimately challenge Intel's decades-long domination in PCs. In interviews, Dell, Lenovo and HP executives said the idea of cellular PCs with the Snapdragon 835 is interesting, especially with the line between PCs and mobile devices blurring. More PCs need to be constantly connected to the internet for web browsing, e-mail, applications and cloud services. The capabilities of the Snapdragon 835, along with Microsoft and Qualcomm's promotional efforts, virtually ensures that some PCs will end up running the chip. However, PC makers are taking a cautious approach. They are still evaluating the Snapdragon 835 and haven't yet committed to releasing hardware based on it. That caution could be tied to the rough history of ARM-based Windows PCs. In 2012, PC makers like Dell and Asus took a chance and built devices with Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 for ARM-based tablets and PCs. Microsoft also built a Surface tablet with a Qualcomm chip. But Windows RT was a bust, partly because of issues related to incompatibility of x86 applications and drivers. Users turned back to Windows PCs running on x86 chips from Intel and AMD. But times have changed, and Qualcomm has observed and learned. The Snapdragon 835 will run a full version of Windows on ARM, and x86 applications will work, said Cisco Cheng, an evangelist for Qualcomm's Snapdragon technologies. Microsoft has put up a Youtube video showing Windows 10 running on a PC with the Snapdragon 835. The PC runs a 64-bit version of the OS, supports touch and Windows Ink features, and also can run Win32 applications via hardware-level emulation. But there is also a new set of opportunities for PCs with the Snapdragon 835, Cheng said. PCs will be thinner, batteries will be bigger, and groundbreaking wireless connectivity features will come to all devices using the chip, Cheng said. The Snapdragon 835 -- which is based on the Kryo 280 architecture -- is smaller than a U.S. penny and will take up very little space on a laptop or 2-in-1. That helps slim down and reduce the device's weight, and saves space for a bigger battery. Qualcomm's new chip also integrates the latest LTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Intel hasn't yet integrated Wi-Fi or an LTE modem into its PC chips, giving Qualcomm an advantage. The Snapdragon 835 also has the fastest LTE modem, able to download data at up to 1Gbps. That's even faster than modems in the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, which can download data at 600Mbps. PCs with the Snapdragon 835 will also get Bluetooth 5, which can transfer data at 2Mbps, two times faster than Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 also has a longer range than its predecessor. In addition, Snapdragon 835 laptops will support 802.11ad, an emerging Wi-Fi standard that can theoretically transfer data at speeds of up to 7Gbps. Qualcomm's promoting a realistic speed of about 4.6Gbps. The chip also has a feature called Quick Charge 4, which provides five hours of talk time on a smartphone after just a five-minute recharge. That feature could make it to PCs. But there are hurdles. Intel's latest CPUs could handily beat the Snapdragon 835 in performance benchmarks. Intel's chips are built for performance, while the Snapdragon 835 is built for power-efficiency on mobile devices, which drags down performance. Qualcomm did not provide information on CPU performance improvements in the 835 compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 820. But the 835's Adreno 540 GPU is about 25 percent faster compared to the GPU in the older chip. PC makers have been designing laptops and desktops around Intel chips for decades, creating a challenge for Qualcomm. PCs need to be designed and tweaked around a processor, which can be a 12- to 18-month process. So it could take some time for PC makers to design Snapdragon-based laptops and 2-in-1s. Exactly how PCs will take advantage of the Snapdragon 835 will become clear later this year. But the chip provides opportunities to bring different OSes to PCs. For example, Snapdragon provides a chance to bring Google's Android-based mobile DayDream VR platform to PCs.

A filing to the German cartel office on Tuesday showed Intel has sought approval to buy a stake in the company, which is controlled by German carmakers Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen. Intel and HERE said in a statement that they had also signed an agreement to collaborate on the research and development of real-time updates of high definition (HD) maps for highly- and fully-automated driving. U.S. chip maker Intel will take a 15 percent stake in German digital mapping firm HERE, it said on Tuesday, as it seeks to build its presence in automated driving technology. Intel did not disclose how much it would pay for the stake but said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter. The deal highlights a shift in the dynamics of research and development in the car industry, which until recently saw automakers largely dictating terms for suppliers to manufacture their proprietary technologies at specified volumes and prices.

THE REAL-TIME SERVICES  Here’s Open Location Platform uses sensor data from connected vehicles. This includes data from brakes, windshield wipers, headlights, location systems, cameras and other sensors, are translated into alerts on driver dashboards using the HERE services. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles from the three German automakers are set to begin feeding visual data into the HERE system supplying these services. The data are then translated into alerts on driver dashboards using the HERE services The firm has now unveiled Real-Time Traffic, Hazard Warnings, Road Signs, and On-Street Parking to provide live updates regarding driving conditions.  Last month two Chinese companies and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in HERE and in July, BMW teamed up with Intel and Mobileye to develop self-driving cars by 2021. BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen bought HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in 2015 from mobile equipment maker Nokia of Finland. Last September, HERE said it would introduce a new set of traffic services allowing drivers to see for themselves what live road conditions are like miles ahead using data from competing automakers, an industry first. German digital map maker HERE will introduce a new set of traffic services this week that allows drivers to see for themselves what live road conditions are like miles ahead.

Roadshow by Terry Collins January 3, 2017 4:09 PM PST @terryscollins Up Next New 2018 Buick Enclave expected at the New York Auto Show Intel is revving up its presence in the self-driving car game by buying a 15 percent stake in Here, a mapping technology company. Intel is vying for a bigger spot in the self-driving car race. The Silicon Valley chipmaker said Tuesday it's buying a 15 percent stake in Here, a mapping company, to develop autonomous positioning systems used in driverless vehicles. Financial details weren't disclosed. The Intel deal comes less than 18 months after Here was sold by Nokia to European automakers Audi, BMW and Daimler. During the Los Angeles Auto Show in November, Intel announced plans to invest more than $250 million over the next two years "to make fully autonomous driving a reality." It's all part of grand plan to keep pace with the likes of Google, Tesla and Uber in pursuing technology to put self-driving vehicles on the road. And, in Intel's case by 2021 or sooner. In a joint statement Tuesday, Intel and Here said they will be working on technology for "maps for highly and fully automated driving." "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Here CEO Edzard Overbeek agrees. "A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," he said. Intel will also work with Audi, BMW and Daimler for testing, the companies said. First published January 3, 1:57 p.m PT. Update, 3:55 p.m. PT: Adds background about Intel and comments from Here CEO.

Thanks to management and security functions built into the Intel vPro architecture, IT organizations have already shown a marked tendency to favor vPro systems. The 7th Generation Intel Core vPro processor unveiled today is being touted by Intel as being able to substantially improve productivity over a five-year-old PC while at the same time enabling the building of mobile computing devices that have as much as 10 hours of battery life. Tom Garrison, vice president and general manager for the Business Client Platform Division at Intel, says that as IT organizations make the transition to Windows 10, they are more conscious about security concerns than ever. To better secure endpoints, Intel also announced today that it has collaborated with Microsoft to integrate Intel Authenticate multi-factor authentication software running on Intel processors with Microsoft Hello, which allows end users to make use of fingerprints, the face or the iris of their eyes to unlock endpoint devices running Windows 10. Intel also announced that a new Intel Data Guard tool for encrypting documents will be available on 6th and 7th generation processors by the middle of this year. Intel Data Guard will enable IT organizations to embed protections and permissions that are directly attached to a document wherever it happens to wind up being stored, says Garrison. Finally, Intel is making available Intel Manageability Commander, which makes it simpler to discover, diagnose and remediate remote PC issues by enabling IT staffs to take direct control of the device. Collectively, Garrison says Intel expects security concerns will drive a wave of PC upgrades in 2017. “We think many IT organizations are looking at refreshing their PCs for security reasons,” says Garrison. In total, Intel reports that there are already 24 desktop, 80 notebook and 24 2-in-1 designs based on 7th Generation Intel Core vPro processors coming to market this year. Given the range of options, the bigger decision may not necessarily be to upgrade to systems that are clearly more secure and simpler to manage, but rather figuring out what form of vPro platform to ultimately standardize on.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Intel Optane Memory Coming in Q2 2017 Intel Optane Memory Coming in Q2 2017 Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Tue, Jan 03, 2017 - 4:01 PM Intel announced their new 7th Generation Core ‘Kaby Lake’ processors this morning along with their new Intel 200 series chipsets to go along with those new processors (check out our review). One of the new supported features on Intel 200 series boards is Intel Optane Memory, so it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that the company has also started to share some details on Intel Optane Memory and the Intel Optane Memory Ready program. Intel Optane memory is a new class of non-volatile memory (NVM) device which accelerates client systems to unleash the new high performance experiences users demand. By pairing either a 16GB or 32GB Intel Optane memory module (via an M.2 motherboard slot) with a large-capacity hard drive or SATA solid state drive users can get SSD-like speed while maintaining capacity and affordability. Note that they said SATA SSD or HDD as this technology isn’t meant to be paired with high-end PCIe SSDs it appears. Once you pop one of the Intel Optane memory modules into an open M.2 slot on your board, or an add-in card if your motherboard doesn’t have an open slot, you should get improved speed while maintaining large storage capacities is ideal for virtual reality, gaming, content creation and video editing. Intel says that Optane memory boosts responsiveness across the system, but has yet to disclose any performance data, product pricing or exact availability at this time. If all goes well Intel Optane memory solutions should be available to consumers in the second quarter of 2017. That hasn’t slowed down the motherboard makers and almost all of them are advertising Intel Optane memory module support on their new Intel Z270 motherboards that came out today. MSI for example showed that the all-new Intel Optane technology is supported on their Turbo M.2 slots that are connected to the PCI-E Gen3 x4 interface for transfer speeds up to 32 Gb/s. MSI has an M.2 Shield (patent pending) that comes with select board models to help keep SSDs or Optane modules nice and cool to prevent damage and thermal throttling. Intel Optane brings back memories of Intel Smart Response Technology (SRT) that was introduced by Intel when Sandy Bridge processors came out on the Intel Z68 platform way back in 2011. It was known as SSD Caching before it was branded as launched as it basically functioned as cache for conventional rotational hard drives at the time as SSDs were very expensive back them. Intel Smart Response Technology caches data I/O blocks to the SSD that benefit the most from acceleration—for example, your most frequently used applications, games, and OS data. Intel still supports the technology, but it is something we haven’t seen anyone use in years let alone still talk much about it. Let’s hope that Intel Optane technology gets off to a better start than SSD Caching did back in 2011 with Intel SRT. Terry Francis I am following this closely. I believe there to be more than meets the eye on what this is capable of. I do need more data on power consumption. gerwingr going to follow this, if it works for two core kaby i am up for it.

That sums up the versatility of the new chip: designed primarily for Android smartphones, it has the horsepower to run a PC. In fact, the Snapdragon 835 will  bring never-before-seen features to Windows PCs. The chip, based on ARM architecture, will first arrive in smartphones later this quarter, with a good chance of appearing in new handsets from Samsung, HTC and LG. It will also appear in PCs running Windows 10 later this year. Microsoft and Qualcomm in December announced they were collaborating to bring the Snapdragon 835 to "cellular PCs," which are thin-and-light Windows 10 laptops with smartphone-like, always-on connectivity to the internet. When users buy a laptop with the Snapdragon 835, they will also get the fastest available LTE modem, Bluetooth 5 and Wi-Fi that supports the emerging 802.11ad standard, which is faster than today's 802.11ac. LTE connectivity doesn't come standard with PCs, but that could change with the Snapdragon 835. In addition, the Snapdragon 835 has a fast eight-core CPU with four cores to run high-performance applications and four power-efficient cores for mundane tasks like audio playback. It has an integrated GPU that supports 4K video, DirectX 12 gaming and virtual reality headsets. The chip will be able to do a lot of what Intel's mobile chips can do. The Snapdragon 835 is the first smartphone chip that has the ability to legitimately challenge Intel's decades-long domination in PCs. In interviews, Dell, Lenovo and HP executives said the idea of cellular PCs with the Snapdragon 835 is interesting, especially with the line between PCs and mobile devices blurring. More PCs need to be constantly connected to the internet for web browsing, e-mail, applications and cloud services. The capabilities of the Snapdragon 835, along with Microsoft and Qualcomm's promotional efforts, virtually ensures that some PCs will end up running the chip. However, PC makers are taking a cautious approach. They are still evaluating the Snapdragon 835 and haven't yet committed to releasing hardware based on it. That caution could be tied to the rough history of ARM-based Windows PCs. In 2012, PC makers like Dell and Asus took a chance and built devices with Windows RT, a version of Windows 8 for ARM-based tablets and PCs. Microsoft also built a Surface tablet with a Qualcomm chip. But Windows RT was a bust, partly because of issues related to incompatibility of x86 applications and drivers. Users turned back to Windows PCs running on x86 chips from Intel and AMD. But times have changed, and Qualcomm has observed and learned. The Snapdragon 835 will run a full version of Windows on ARM, and x86 applications will work, said Cisco Cheng, an evangelist for Qualcomm's Snapdragon technologies. Microsoft has put up a Youtube video showing Windows 10 running on a PC with the Snapdragon 835. The PC runs a 64-bit version of the OS, supports touch and Windows Ink features, and also can run Win32 applications via hardware-level emulation. But there is also a new set of opportunities for PCs with the Snapdragon 835, Cheng said. PCs will be thinner, batteries will be bigger, and groundbreaking wireless connectivity features will come to all devices using the chip, Cheng said. The Snapdragon 835 -- which is based on the Kryo 280 architecture -- is smaller than a U.S. penny and will take up very little space on a laptop or 2-in-1. That helps slim down and reduce the device's weight, and saves space for a bigger battery. Qualcomm's new chip also integrates the latest LTE, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. Intel hasn't yet integrated Wi-Fi or an LTE modem into its PC chips, giving Qualcomm an advantage. The Snapdragon 835 also has the fastest LTE modem, able to download data at up to 1Gbps. That's even faster than modems in the Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, which can download data at 600Mbps. PCs with the Snapdragon 835 will also get Bluetooth 5, which can transfer data at 2Mbps, two times faster than Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 also has a longer range than its predecessor. In addition, Snapdragon 835 laptops will support 802.11ad, an emerging Wi-Fi standard that can theoretically transfer data at speeds of up to 7Gbps. Qualcomm's promoting a realistic speed of about 4.6Gbps. The chip also has a feature called Quick Charge 4, which provides five hours of talk time on a smartphone after just a five-minute recharge. That feature could make it to PCs. But there are hurdles. Intel's latest CPUs could handily beat the Snapdragon 835 in performance benchmarks. Intel's chips are built for performance, while the Snapdragon 835 is built for power-efficiency on mobile devices, which drags down performance. Qualcomm did not provide information on CPU performance improvements in the 835 compared to its predecessor, the Snapdragon 820. But the 835's Adreno 540 GPU is about 25 percent faster compared to the GPU in the older chip. PC makers have been designing laptops and desktops around Intel chips for decades, creating a challenge for Qualcomm. PCs need to be designed and tweaked around a processor, which can be a 12- to 18-month process. So it could take some time for PC makers to design Snapdragon-based laptops and 2-in-1s. Exactly how PCs will take advantage of the Snapdragon 835 will become clear later this year. But the chip provides opportunities to bring different OSes to PCs. For example, Snapdragon provides a chance to bring Google's Android-based mobile DayDream VR platform to PCs. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake. If you read tech news, you may seeing that phrase an awful lot this week: it's what Intel calls its latest seventh-generation processors for laptop and desktop PCs. But before you get all excited about a PC with the new processors, there's something you should know: they're not meaningfully faster than the chips you can already buy now. We'd already known that Intel's new laptop chips weren't a big upgrade, but it seems the desktop chips are even less compelling: today, the reviews are in and experts are struggling to find meaningful differences between the new Intel Core i7-7700K and 7600K and their predecessors. In page after page of benchmarks (I read 'em so you don't have to) at reputable PC component benchmarking sites like AnandTech, PC Perspective and Tom's Hardware, each site comes to the same conclusion: the new chips only seem faster because Intel sets the clock speed (GHz) a little bit higher before they leave the factory. Enlarge Image Photo by Tom's Hardware But if you overclock last year's Core i7-6700K and i5-6600K to that same speed, they perform identically -- sometimes even a hair better. It's not a big difference even if you don't overclock. Depending on the benchmark, we're talking seconds, or sometimes just tenths of a second faster in apps like Photoshop and Office. The new chips also don't seem to run any cooler or more power-efficient. And if you're a PC gamer, you should know that -- like usual -- a new Intel CPU also won't help your games run faster. Here's a chart showing how the six-year-old Intel Core i7-2600K is basically just as competent in games as Intel's latest chips: Enlarge Image Photo by AnandTech I've gotta agree with Mark Walton at Ars Technica: desktop chips are dead in the water. That doesn't mean Intel's new Kaby Lake chips have nothing to offer, though: they're the only official way to watch Netflix in 4K on a desktop PC, and Intel promises they'll support a new form of hybrid memory/storage dubbed Optane (more on how Optane works here). And there is one processor in Intel's new lineup that might be worth talking about: the new Core i3-7350K. For half the asking price of Intel's highest-end Core i7-7700K, it offers the same impressively high 4.2GHz clockspeed and overclocking capabilities (unheard of for a cheap Core i3!) for about half the price -- just with two cores instead of four, and four threads instead of eight. (See it in some of AnandTech's benchmark charts here.) But as far as I can see today, the best thing about Intel's new chips are the sale prices you're about to find on last year's processors.

Twitter Facebook Intel buys into autonomous vehicle mapping company The goal: Maps with a high-definition representation of the physical world around autonomous vehicles Lucas Mearian (Computerworld (US)) 04 January, 2017 08:27 - - - - print email Comments Intel has announced it is purchasing a 15% stake in Netherlands-based HERE, a company that makes digital maps and location-based services for semi- and fully autonomous vehicles and the internet of things (IoT) industry. Intel and HERE plan to jointly develop a "highly scalable, proof-of-concept architecture" that provides real-time updates of HD maps for self-driving vehicles as well as "explore opportunities" in IoT and machine learning. Intel Intel displays its automated driving technology at the Automobility LA conference on Nov. 15, 2016. "A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," HERE CEO Edzard Overbeek said in a statement. "Intel can help accelerate HERE's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected." In November, Intel made public its plans to invest $250 million dollars in autonomous vehicle technology. "These investments will drive the development of technologies that push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more," Intel said in a news release. Intel and HERE also plan to jointly explore strategic opportunities that result from developing edge-computing devices with location data. Intel "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. "We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future." Intel said it will also work with automakers who are also HERE investors, such as AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG, to test the HD mapping architecture. Intel and HERE said they envision making the architecture broadly available across the automotive industry as a seamlessly integrated offering that simplifies and shortens time of development for automakers.

Intel unveiled Intel Optane Memory along with sharing details about Intel 7th generation Core processors. Intel Intel's Optane memory module on a Stoney Beach motherboard. Developed internally with partner Micron as 3D XPoint, which the companies claim is a "new class" of memory, Optane will act as a high-speed cache in conjunction with either a larger capacity hard drive or a SATA SSD. The low capacity of Intel's Optane modules will enable it to be affordable as well, the company said. "Improving speed while maintaining large storage capacities is ideal for virtual reality, gaming, content creation and video editing and so much more," Intel said in a statement. "The performance of a 7th Gen Intel Core processor plus the speed of Intel Optane memory boosts responsiveness across the system." Intel Other than detailing Optane module capacities and form factor, Intel released virtually no other details about the memory, including performance specifications, pricing or  exact availability dates. A spokesman for the company said additional detail, including performance specifications, would be released "soon." In June, Intel let slip its plans for releasing several product lines based on the new 3D XPoint memory, which it said it would release alongside its Kaby Lake processor platform. In August, Micron revealed its own separate go-to-market plans for 3D Xpoint memory, which it will sell under the name QuantX. Both Micron and Intel claim the new non-volatile memory sports up to 1,000 times the performance of NAND flash. The first generation of QuantX solid-state drives (SSDs) will be aimed squarely at data center applications when they ship in the second quarter, according to Jon Carter, Micron's vice president of storage solutions Intel Currently, Micron expects to see its first revenues from QuantX sales in the second half of 2017, with 2018 being a "bigger year," and 2019 being the "break-out" revenue year, Carter said. 3D Crosspoint will be about half the price of DRAM, but around four to five times more expensive than NAND flash, Carter said. So while it will replace DRAM for many applications, it's not likely to replace NAND flash -- at least for prosumer applications --- anytime soon. Intel Intel's Optane M.2 memory module being inserted onto a Stoney Beach motherboard. Carter said demand for QuantX memory is "through the roof" from system manufacturers and there's currently not enough stock to go around. "We've built the capacity for the first couple of years; it's all accounted for," Carter said in an earlier interview with Computerworld.

After their debut in laptops and mobile devices in September, Intel's 7th Generation Core (aka "Kaby Lake") processors are now available across the entire spectrum of Intel-powered machines, from Xeon-based mobile workstations to gaming laptops to what's left of the consumer desktop market. While Intel is releasing its latest Core processors for what used to be the company's bread and butter—desktops—four months after their availability for lower-end portables and mobile devices, that doesn't mean the company is ignoring PC enthusiasts and professionals who demand lots of computing power. Intel says that the new high-end Core i7-7700K processor delivers a 35 percent performance boost for applications like the Adobe Premiere Pro video editing suite, compared with an equivalent processor from three years ago. It's unlocked, too, and users who need even more power can overclock it thanks to simplified voltage control that Intel claims will offer more stable overclocking; a Russian blog recently recorded a blistering clock speed of 7GHz. Another intriguing option for enthusiasts is the Core i3-7350K, a two-core, four-thread chip that's also unlocked. This marks the first time that Intel has released an overclockable Core i3 chip, moving heavy-duty overclocking capabilities into its budget-oriented family. Related Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processor Details Intel Unveils Kaby Lake Processor Details The new processor lineup is also poised to usher in an era of 4K video, even for machines that don't have discrete graphics cards. Every Kaby Lake processor—even the Core i3—supports 4K streaming thanks to improved Intel Iris graphics, assuming you also have an Ultra HD display, a robust broadband connection (Intel recommends at least 25Mbps), and a premium Netflix subscription. As for Kaby Lake–powered workstations and business PCs, Intel is promising its enterprise customers more robust security, including support for hardware authentication features like biometrics, secure PINs, and proximity sensors. The processors have built-in two-factor authentication support for Dropbox and other cloud storage providers and the ability to keep duplicate copies of passwords stored in Dashlane, 1Password, and other password managers. If you're building a new system from scratch, the cheapest Core i3 processors are priced at around $100, with Xeons and Core i7s topping out at over $500. Meanwhile, Intel estimates that more than 100 consumer and enterprise Kaby Lake–powered systems are already on the market.

Intel has agreed to purchase a 15 percent ownership stake in HERE, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services, from HERE’s current indirect shareholders, which include AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG.   In conjunction with Intel’s acquisition of a stake in HERE, the two companies also signed an agreement to collaborate on the research and development of a highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture that supports real-time updates of high definition (HD) maps for highly and fully automated driving. Additionally, the two companies plan to jointly explore strategic opportunities that result from enriching edge-computing devices with location data.   “Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world’s most intelligent, connected devices,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future.”   “A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms,” said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.”   The proof-of-concept architecture HERE and Intel plan to deliver will be designed to help make autonomous driving as safe and predictable as possible. For example, today’s navigation technology can pinpoint a car’s location to within meters, but next generation, HD mapping supports localization to within centimeters. This will help vehicles precisely position themselves on the roadway to enable reliable autonomous driving functionality. HERE HD Live Map, HERE’s cloud service supporting vehicle automation, gives vehicles the ability to “see” obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision and receive real-time updates as environments change due to traffic, road conditions and other factors.   Intel will also work with AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG to test the architecture. Intel and HERE envision making the architecture broadly available across the automotive industry as a seamlessly integrated offering that simplifies and shortens time of development for automakers.       Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Software » Trending now » Hot discussions in our forums right now: The President Of The USA: Donald Trump Created by TimA, last reply by networkn on 16-Jan-2017 16:34 (1662 replies) ... 109 110 111 New Unlimited Fixed Broadband Created by LivingSkinny, last reply by noroad on 16-Jan-2017 16:37 (23 replies) ... 2 How do people feel about lawyers?

There are over 40 new performance-class processors in the family, which are based on Intel’s 14nm+ process technology, that offer more speed, productivity and security than previous generations. The Kaby Lake processors are up to 20% faster in performance and gaming notebooks, and 25% faster in desktops. They are also 65% faster at handling 4K and 360-degree video on notebooks, and 35% faster on desktops. As for the increased productivity, the chips are capable of 10+ hour battery life, and they feature two-factor authentication for added security. Among the chips announced today, several should be prime for upcoming Mac updates. Amidst growing concerns that Apple is losing interest in its laptop and desktop lines, recent reports have suggested we could see new iMacs and MacBooks as early as March. And Intel’s announcement today of Kaby Lake’s “near future” availability adds weight to the theory.

Optane memory will be available as an option for new Intel-based client platforms, including Intel 7th Gen Core (Kaby Lake), and as a standalone component. Platforms and motherboards supporting Intel Optane technology will be labeled "Optane Ready" to indicate their compatibility. Intel unveiled Intel Optane Memory along with sharing details about Intel 7th generation Core processors. Anand Lal Shimpi, Anandtech.com On the left is an mSATA solid-state drive and on the right is an M.2 SSD. Intel's new Optane memory will come as an M.2 expansion card that will plug directly into a computer's motherboard. Developed internally with partner Micron as 3D XPoint, which the companies claim is a "new class" of memory, Optane will act as a high-speed cache in conjunction with either a larger capacity hard drive or a SATA SSD. The low capacity of Intel's Optane modules will enable it to be affordable as well, the company said. "Improving speed while maintaining large storage capacities is ideal for virtual reality, gaming, content creation and video editing and so much more," Intel said in a statement. "The performance of a 7th Gen Intel Core processor plus the speed of Intel Optane memory boosts responsiveness across the system." Intel Other than detailing Optane module capacities and form factor, Intel released virtually no other details about the memory, including performance specifications, pricing or  exact availability dates. A spokesman for the company said additional detail, including performance specifications, would be released "soon." In June, Intel let slip its plans for releasing several product lines based on the new 3D XPoint memory, which it said it would release alongside its Kaby Lake processor platform. In August, Micron revealed its own separate go-to-market plans for 3D Xpoint memory, which it will sell under the name QuantX. Both Micron and Intel claim the new non-volatile memory sports up to 1,000 times the performance of NAND flash. The first generation of QuantX solid-state drives (SSDs) will be aimed squarely at data center applications when they ship in the second quarter, according to Jon Carter, Micron's vice president of storage solutions Intel Currently, Micron expects to see its first revenues from QuantX sales in the second half of 2017, with 2018 being a "bigger year," and 2019 being the "break-out" revenue year, Carter said. 3D Crosspoint will be about half the price of DRAM, but around four to five times more expensive than NAND flash, Carter said. So while it will replace DRAM for many applications, it's not likely to replace NAND flash -- at least for prosumer applications --- anytime soon. Carter said demand for QuantX memory is "through the roof" from system manufacturers and there's currently not enough stock to go around. "We've built the capacity for the first couple of years; it's all accounted for," Carter said in an earlier interview with Computerworld. "I've been in situations with partners who buy a lot of DRAM who've said, 'Do you know how much DRAM I buy? You'd better get me some 3D XPoint.'

Technology Intel Grabs Stake In Here, German-Led Self-Driving-Car Consortium The Mercedes-Benz booth at last year's International Consumer Electronics Show Asia attracted its share of attendees. (Zhou Junxiang/ Imaginechina/Newscom) REINHARDT KRAUSE 1/03/2017 Reprints LAS VEGAS -- Chipmaker Intel (INTC) will buy a 15% stake in Here, a developer of digital mapping technology for self-driving cars, deepening its ties to German automakers as well as to auto tech firm Mobileye (MBLY), as companies started making announcements at the start of the big CES show in Las Vegas Here's owners include BMW, Daimler (DDAIF) and Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi. Autonomous vehicles and next-generation auto technology again will take the spotlight at CES (also known as the Consumer Electronics Show) along with the Internet of Things — web-connected consumer and industrial devices. CES kicked off with media events Tuesday and more on Wednesday, before the regular event starts Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is slated to give a keynote speech Wednesday evening on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, as the auto industry becomes a bigger market for Nvidia and other chipmakers. IBD'S TAKE: Netflix and Broadcom — and nontechs such as Nucor, Burlington Stores and Martin Marietta — are among the stocks on IBD's Leaderboard. Leaderboard follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts and post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.  Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which have teamed on autonomous-driving technology, on Tuesday said they would expand their relationship to create an in-car infotainment system using Google's software. Concept Car Designed By Millennials In a pre-CES press conference Tuesday, Fiat Chrysler unveiled a concept car called Portal that it said was "designed by millennials for millennials." The battery electric vehicle is described as connected and upgradable. It features touchscreen and voice controls and links to users smartphones and tablets. Fiat Chrysler user experience designer Emilio Feliciano said Portal is a "next-generation vehicle that serves as a hub for your life." FCA did not provide any details on whether the concept car would be produced or if technologies in it would be incorporated in other FCA vehicles. Portal is upgradable to autonomous driving when the technology becomes available, company engineer Ashley Edgar said. The steering wheel tucks away in self-driving mode, she said. The Portal concept car features customizable colored exterior lighting, sliding front and rear doors, and a transparent roof. The electric car has a range of 250 miles and can charge up for 150 miles in less than 20 minutes, Edgar said. Cars Becoming 'Most Intelligent Devices,' Says Intel Faraday Future, a startup backed by China's LeEco, also is expected to showcase its next-generation car technology at CES. Intel, meanwhile, did not disclose the size of its investment. Intel and Here said they also will partner in location-based services. "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in the company's announcement Tuesday. In July, Mobileye announced an agreement with Intel and BMW to develop autonomous-driving technology for commercial launch in 2021. Here competes with Tesla (TSLA) and Google in developing technology to capture video and sensor data needed to navigate self-driving cars. Apple (AAPL) lags in mapping data, which has hampered its push into autonomous vehicles, analysts say. The German automakers acquired Here's forerunner from Nokia (NOK) for $3.1 billion. Intel stock rose 0.91% to 36.60 in the stock market today, while Fiat Chrysler's U.S. shares jumped 4.7% to 9.55, a 14-month high. Alphabet stock rose 2% to 808.01. Here had been expanding its ownership structure prior to Intel's announcement. Here last week said that China internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) — along with Chinese mapping company NavIno and Singapore-based investment firm GIC — would jointly acquire a 10% stake in the consortium. Japan's Toyota (TM) is a Here map user, though not a partner. Here and Mobileye, a leader in advanced driver-assistance systems, last week said they would collaborate on digital mapping using the Israeli company's REM technology. Mobileye's REM software collects street and highway data for updating digital maps. Mobileye's chip and software technology provides image processing and analysis for self-driving cars equipped with camera-based systems. Mobileye parted ways with Tesla in mid-2016. Tesla announced an upgrade to its autopilot system that includes more reliance on radar sensors rather than camera-based technology.

These chips, called 7th Generation Core, will extend laptop battery life to new highs, and bring new capabilities like 4K video. You'll also enjoy VR by connecting headsets to Kaby Lake laptops or tablets. There's a lot more to Kaby Lake, and here's what you can expect from PCs: Thinner and lighter laptops Laptops and tablets with Kaby Lake are so thin and light that their weight in a backpack is not noticeable, unless it's a fully loaded gaming PC. Samsung's new 13.3-inch Notebook 9 weighs an amazing 816 grams, but offers only seven hours of battery life. Low-power Kaby Lake chips will also be in laptops and 2-in-1 devices from Lenovo, HP, Acer and Dell that weigh 1 to 1.5 kilograms. Better battery life Intel says users can expect 10 hours of battery on thin-and-light laptops and tablets, but PC makers are claiming even longer battery life. Lenovo is claiming its new ThinkPad X1 Carbon will have 15 hours of battery, while the ThinkPad X1 Yoga 2-in-1 will offer 16 hours. Dell is claiming battery life up to 15 hours for its new XPS 13 2-in-1, and 10 hours when streaming Netflix video. Those numbers are based on MobileMark benchmarks, but battery life typically varies in real world usage. The disappearing display borders Windows devices are also getting smaller because of thinner borders around displays. The best example is the Dell XPS 13, which is a 13.3-inch laptop compressed in the frame of an 11.6-inch laptop. It has a borderless display, with the screen dominating the entire display panel. The trend is growing with the new PCs, with a notable example being the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which is a 14-inch laptop in a 13.3-inch laptop frame. Watch 4K video Graphics processors in Kaby Lake chips are capable of processing 4K video, so you will be able to watch movies on a laptop with a screen or external display at that resolution. Intel is also partnering with video streaming companies to push 4K movies to Kaby Lake PCs. 4K movies from Netflix are already available, and Intel said 4K movies from FandangoNow and Sony's Ultra 4K movies will come later this year. Users will need a Microsoft Edge browser to view the 4K movies. Use VR headsets You'll be able to hook up VR headsets to view movies, play games and roam virtual worlds. Many headsets -- which will need to be hooked up to Kaby Lake PCs -- will come later this year from Dell, Acer, HP, Asus and Lenovo, with prices starting at US$299. Kaby Lake is Intel's entry into the emerging world of VR, which is providing a new way to interact with computers. The chip's integrated GPU is able to handle basic VR, but won't be enough for  high-end headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, which need discrete GPUs from Nvidia or AMD. More secure biometric logins Microsoft wants to kill passwords with Windows Hello, which can log users into PCs via facial recognition, fingerprints or retina scans. Intel's providing an alternative to Windows Hello called Authenticate, which requires multiple authentication techniques to log in to PCs. For example, users may be required to log in twice -- once during the pre-boot sequence and then again in to Windows once the boot is complete. Authenticate is available only in business PCs with Kaby Lake vPro chips. Intel claims Authenticate is more secure than Windows Hello, as user data is secured and stored in a special CSME (converged security manageability engine) chip, which has its own operating system and firmware. Microsoft and Intel are co-developing a version of Authenticate and Windows Hello with multi-factor authentication to log into a PC and Windows. Faster storage with Optane PC designs could change forever with the superfast Optane, a new class of storage and memory that could replace conventional SSDs and DRAM. Intel claims Optane-based SSDs are 10 times faster than today's SSDs, and denser than DRAM. But here's the bad news: the first Optane units will be lower-capacity caching storage, not full-fledged SSDs with large storage capacity. The initial Optane units will help load the OS, applications and games faster, and will work with only with Kaby Lake PCs. It could be ideal for gamers looking to buffer games, or those running engineering applications or creating virtual reality content. Run applications faster The new Kaby Lake chips have faster CPUs and GPUs so applications and graphics can run faster. PCs are also faster as Windows 10 has also been tweaked to work closely with the chip. PC makers are seeing CPU performance improvements between 5 and 15 percent with Kaby Lake chips compared to the predecessor Skylake chips. More modems and connectivity for laptops Modems have been in laptops for years more as an afterthought, but not anymore. Lenovo is offering modems as a standard feature in its ThinkPad X1 laptops and 2-in-1s so users can connect to cellular networks if Wi-Fi isn't available. Like with smartphones, cellular modems will drive communications in laptops, especially with 4G network speeds going up and 5G networks around the corner. Overclock Gamers craving more performance will be able to overclock the Core i7-7820HK Kaby Lake chip, which has a base speed of 2.9GHz but can be cranked up to 4.4GHz. Look for the chip in Dell's Alienware 15 and 17 laptops, which are being launched at CES. Cut cables There's a renewed effort to cut cables from PCs with wireless charging and data transfer technologies. Wireless charging laptops are being shown at CES, and Intel's increasing its focus on bringing WiGig wireless technology to PCs. WiGig can wirelessly connect laptops to peripherals like storage devices and monitors, providing a way to get rid of connectors and display ports from PCs. The wireless technologies are still years away from widespread adoption, but gaining steam again after a few years of inactivity. Many more ways to interact Be it through pen, voice, touch or typing, PCs with Kaby Lake chips will provide a more natural way for users to interact with PCs. Intel and Microsoft are developing technology so users can shout out commands to the Cortana voice-activated assistant from longer distances. Additionally, Microsoft is making it easier to take notes on Windows PCs with styluses.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Dell seems to have done it again, turning its winning XPS 13 laptop into a potential leader in the 2-in-1 laptop category with some new features and some holdouts from models past. For Beautiful IGZO screen Thinner than ever Thunderbolt 3 included Windows Hello ready Against Webcam position still poor Down to microSD slot For the past few years at CES, we’ve looked to Dell and its ever-evolving XPS 13 as one of the darlings of the show. This year, with Dell’s new XPS 13 2-in-1, the computer maker does not disappoint. That’s right, Dell has finally created a hybrid version of its leading laptop, and it’s as versatile and beautiful as you’d expect. Coming in the same 11-inch frame providing a 13-inch (diagonal) touchscreen, the XPS 13 2-in-1 brings a new wrinkle to the XPS line without disrupting it. In other words, Dell will still keep making the traditional version, so don’t worry, purists. Price and availability Dell is starting the XPS 13 2-in-1 at $999 (about £810, AU$1,390). That model will come packing an FHD (1,920 x 1,080) touchscreen with a 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i5 processor with Intel HD Graphics 615, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage. From there, you can expect the usual upgrades you’ve seen from the XPS 13 the past few years: an Intel Core i7 processor (still Kaby Lake), a QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) touchscreen, up to 16GB of memory and as large as a 1TB SSD. However, pricing for those models hasn’t been made clear yet. Of course, everything will be crystal when the laptop is generally available starting January 5. Design Dell’s sense for design has skyrocketed over the past few years, and the XPS 13 2-in-1 is no exception. Keeping the same general ID of the existing XPS devices, this model adds two sturdy hinges made of steel and cased in machined aluminum. The anodized aluminum lid and carbon fiber palm rest make a welcome return, all within the same 11-inch frame as the preceding model. In short, this is the XPS 13 you already know, but with some subtle yet impactful changes. Altogether, the device weighs just 2.7 pounds (1.24kg) and measures 0.32 inches (8mm) at its thinnest point and 0.54 inches (13.7mm) at its thickest. All told, that’s a shaving to the tune of 2mm, which is impressive considering the laptop’s 2-in-1 trappings. The device is easily held in one hand, and the light weight makes adjusting between its hybrid modes that much easier. The palm rest feels as comfy and responsive as ever, as do the glass-covered trackpad and backlit keyboard (with a satisfying 1.3mm of key travel) – all holdouts from the previous models. However, a holdout from the previous design that we wish, well, wouldn’t hold out is the webcam still positioned near the hinge. While Dell wizened up and centered the infrared-equipped webcam (hello, Windows Hello), it’s still going to show off our lovely double chin during meetings. At the very least, you can orient the device in a tent position so that the webcam faces upright. The last major feature about the XPS 13 to make it into the 2-in-1 iteration is that beautiful, nearly bezel-free InfinityEdge screen. The returning IGZO panel is notched at either 1080p or QHD+ resolutions, but either way, brings plenty of brightness (400 nits), contrast (1,000:1 ratio) and viewing angles (up to 170 degrees). Specs and performance In addition to what you can change about the XPS 13 2-in-1 you might buy before checkout, Dell has loaded this machine with plenty of other goodies. In wired connectivity, you have two USB-C ports (one being Thunderbolt 3, but both can charge), a now-smaller microSD card reader and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the wireless front, the XPS 13 2-in-1 comes with the expected 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 with Miracast and Intel Smart Connect supported. Now, all of this is powered by what Dell is calling upfront a “lower-power” processor, though both Core i5 and i7 options can reach 3.2GHz and 3.6GHz clock speeds, respectively. That said, Dell has devised a dynamic power management system focused on temperature that should work extra well with a laptop cooler when you need that extra oomph. That power management should also help keep the 46 Whr battery included powering the whole system for a bit longer. Dell promises up to 15 hours of juice from the FHD version, while the QHD+ flavor will enjoy a still-lengthy 8 hours and 35 minutes – based on its own tests. Of course, we’ll see that for ourselves soon enough. Early verdict Dell has once again crafted one of the most impressive laptops of CES, if not the entire year. With the public perception of 2-in-1 laptops far better than it was even a year ago, Dell picked a good time to bring those features to its leading laptop. The XPS 13 2-in-1 sacrifices almost nothing in achieving its new design, save for a now-smaller microSD card reader and standard barrel connector for power. That said, despite its massive improvements and centering (at last), we’re still not exactly excited about the webcam beneath the screen. We were thoroughly impressed by the now-hybrid XPS 13 during our short time with it at CES 2017. Dell’s managed to bring a new wrinkle of function and form to its most pleasing product for not much more cash to start than the traditional version. Stay tuned for our full review.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 3, 2017 -- 19:46 GMT (11:46 PST) | Topic: Hardware Intel is acquiring a 15 percent ownership stake in mapping and location service provider HERE. The news comes roughly a week after Chinese technology giant Tencent, Beijing-based mapping company NavInfo, and Singapore state-owned investment firm GIC announced plans to jointly take up a 10 percent ownership share of the mapping company along with current owners Audi, BMW, and Daimler. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech As part of the investment, Intel will work with HERE and its consortium of automaker owners to design, test and deliver proof-of-concept architecture supporting real-time, high-definition map updates. The architecture will aim to improve the precision and accuracy of mapping technology used in autonomous driving systems. For instance, current navigation technology can pinpoint a car's location to an accuracy within meters, but HD mapping can tighten accuracy down to a matter of centimeters. Ultimately this level of precision will help self-driving vehicles better position themselves on the roadway, which increases safety, reliability and driving functionality. HERE currently offers this kind of mapping technology as a cloud service, called HD Live Map, so Intel's contribution will likely fall on the hardware side. Eventually, Intel and HERE plan to offer the architecture to other automakers as fuel for the continued growth of cloud computing and the Internet of Things. "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, in a statement. "We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future." "A real-time, self-healing and high definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," added HERE chief executive Edzard Overbeek. "As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected." Intel did not disclose a purchase price for the stake in HERE but said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter.

The company said Tuesday it is buying 15 percent of Here Maps, the former Nokia mapping unit owned by a consortium of German carmakers. No one is talking price, but the carmakers bought the unit from Nokia last year for $2.8 billion, so it’s reasonable to think Intel paid several hundred million dollars. The carmakers had said last year they were looking to bring in additional investors, including US tech companies. High-definition maps are a key component to self-driving cars, providing the in-car computers with not just addresses and places, but information on lane markers, intersections and a blueprint for exactly where the car is on the road at any given time. The move is part of Intel’s broader strategy, which can be summed up as, “We missed out on mobile, let’s not miss out on what’s next.” To that end, Intel has been investing heavily in things like computer vision, sports technology and virtual reality. Intel has already made moves into cars, including a deal last year with BMW and MobileEye.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 3, 2017 at 2:03PM Image source: Getty Images. With the holiday season in the rearview mirror, it's time for investors to turn their attention back to the stock market. The first earnings season of the new year is coming up, and plenty of major companies will be reporting results in January. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will need to prove to investors that it can keep growing its subscriber base while improving the bottom line. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will need to show that it can grow despite a weak PC market and competition from all directions. And Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) will need to justify an increased pace of investments. Netflix After reporting disappointing second-quarter results, which featured the subscriber base growing far slower than anticipated, Netflix turned up the heat during the third quarter. The company added 3.57 million subscribers globally, more than doubling its second-quarter total, leading to its first quarter with revenue over $2 billion. Another 5.2 million subscribers are expected to join during the fourth quarter, which will push the total global member base to nearly 92 million. Stranger Things was a surprise hit for Netflix in 2016. Image source: Netflix. Profits have taken a back seat as Netflix has spent heavily on international expansion and new content. The company plans to release more than 1,000 hours of original programming in 2017, up from 600 hours last year. All told, content spending will reach $6 billion this year, with Netflix aiming to both retain its existing members and lure new customers will a broad array of exclusive programming. The international business remains unprofitable, and Netflix's ability to return to pre-expansion levels of profitability while simultaneously spending so much on content is still a big unknown. One major problem: Competition from Amazon is heating up, with Prime Video expected to be expanded into more than 200 countries. Netflix will need to impress investors with its results and outlook when it reports its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 18. Otherwise, the stock could dive much like it did after the company shocked investors with weak numbers earlier this year. Intel Despite a weak market for PCs, Intel has managed to grow its revenue through the first nine months of 2016. The client computing segment, which contains chips that go into PCs, tablets, and phones, suffered an 11% decline in unit volume, but a 12% increase in average selling price drove total revenue slightly higher. The data center segment grew faster, producing 7.7% growth and driving the bulk of Intel's revenue increase. Image source: Intel. Intel will report its fourth-quarter results after the market close on Jan. 26. More important than Intel's results, though, will be the company's outlook. 2017 will bring new challenges, including a brand new line of CPUs from Advanced Micro Devices that will aim to challenge Intel in the PC and server markets. IBM's OpenPOWER initiative remains a threat to Intel's dominance in the data center, and Qualcomm's recently announced Centriq line of ARM server chips could finally bring ARM into the data center in a significant way. The data center segment is already not growing as fast as it once did, and any success by AMD, IBM, or Qualcomm this year could slow things down even more. It doesn't look like Intel's fourth-quarter results will bring any major surprises, but expect the company to field some questions about these threats during its earnings conference call later this month. Under Armour Shares of apparel and footwear company Under Armour took a dive in late October after it slashed its outlook for earnings. After previously setting a goal of producing $800 million of operating income by 2018, Under Armour now expects its margins to weaken as it pushes deeper into international markets and footwear. CEO Kevin Plank framed this guidance cut as a positive for long-term investors: "The growth is still there, and it requires significant investment. It is time for us to invest." Image source: Under Armour. With Under Armour stock trading at 55 times trailing-12-month earnings, revenue growth is the name of the game. The lofty valuation can't be justified with today's profits. Instead, investors are betting that Under Armour will continue to grow sales at a double-digit pace, eventually growing into a much larger company on par with Nike. Sacrificing profits in order to keep revenue growing as fast as possible makes sense given the opportunity. All eyes will be on Under Armour's revenue growth when the company reports its fourth-quarter results. The company has yet to confirm the exact date, but late January is likely given the timing of last year's report. Investors will ultimately accept the lower earnings guidance if the company can deliver faster growth. If it fails, expect the stock to be in for a rough ride in 2017.

Credit: Intel More like this The top 10 PC technologies and trends to watch in 2017 Intel's Optane: What users can expect in PCs and when it will ship Lenovo's new ThinkPad X1 devices get sexier designs, faster chips Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Amazingly thin Windows 10 laptops and tablets will soon become available with Intel's new Kaby Lake chips, which were announced at CES. These chips, called 7th Generation Core, will extend laptop battery life to new highs, and bring new capabilities like 4K video. You'll also enjoy VR by connecting headsets to Kaby Lake laptops or tablets. There's a lot more to Kaby Lake, and here's what you can expect from PCs: Thinner and lighter laptops Laptops and tablets with Kaby Lake are so thin and light that their weight in a backpack is not noticeable, unless it's a fully loaded gaming PC. Samsung's new 13.3-inch Notebook 9 weighs an amazing 816 grams, but offers only seven hours of battery life. Low-power Kaby Lake chips will also be in laptops and 2-in-1 devices from Lenovo, HP, Acer and Dell that weigh 1 to 1.5 kilograms. Better battery life Intel says users can expect 10 hours of battery on thin-and-light laptops and tablets, but PC makers are claiming even longer battery life. Lenovo is claiming its new ThinkPad X1 Carbon will have 15 hours of battery, while the ThinkPad X1 Yoga 2-in-1 will offer 16 hours. Dell is claiming battery life up to 15 hours for its new XPS 13 2-in-1, and 10 hours when streaming Netflix video. Those numbers are based on MobileMark benchmarks, but battery life typically varies in real world usage. The disappearing display borders Windows devices are also getting smaller because of thinner borders around displays. The best example is the Dell XPS 13, which is a 13.3-inch laptop compressed in the frame of an 11.6-inch laptop. It has a borderless display, with the screen dominating the entire display panel. The trend is growing with the new PCs, with a notable example being the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which is a 14-inch laptop in a 13.3-inch laptop frame. Watch 4K video Graphics processors in Kaby Lake chips are capable of processing 4K video, so you will be able to watch movies on a laptop with a screen or external display at that resolution. Intel is also partnering with video streaming companies to push 4K movies to Kaby Lake PCs. 4K movies from Netflix are already available, and Intel said 4K movies from FandangoNow and Sony's Ultra 4K movies will come later this year. Users will need a Microsoft Edge browser to view the 4K movies. Use VR headsets You'll be able to hook up VR headsets to view movies, play games and roam virtual worlds. Many headsets -- which will need to be hooked up to Kaby Lake PCs -- will come later this year from Dell, Acer, HP, Asus and Lenovo, with prices starting at US$299. Kaby Lake is Intel's entry into the emerging world of VR, which is providing a new way to interact with computers. The chip's integrated GPU is able to handle basic VR, but won't be enough for  high-end headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, which need discrete GPUs from Nvidia or AMD. More secure biometric logins Microsoft wants to kill passwords with Windows Hello, which can log users into PCs via facial recognition, fingerprints or retina scans. Intel's providing an alternative to Windows Hello called Authenticate, which requires multiple authentication techniques to log in to PCs. For example, users may be required to log in twice -- once during the pre-boot sequence and then again in to Windows once the boot is complete. Authenticate is available only in business PCs with Kaby Lake vPro chips. Intel claims Authenticate is more secure than Windows Hello, as user data is secured and stored in a special CSME (converged security manageability engine) chip, which has its own operating system and firmware. Microsoft and Intel are co-developing a version of Authenticate and Windows Hello with multi-factor authentication to log into a PC and Windows. Faster storage with Optane PC designs could change forever with the superfast Optane, a new class of storage and memory that could replace conventional SSDs and DRAM. Intel claims Optane-based SSDs are 10 times faster than today's SSDs, and denser than DRAM. But here's the bad news: the first Optane units will be lower-capacity caching storage, not full-fledged SSDs with large storage capacity. The initial Optane units will help load the OS, applications and games faster, and will work with only with Kaby Lake PCs. It could be ideal for gamers looking to buffer games, or those running engineering applications or creating virtual reality content. Run applications faster The new Kaby Lake chips have faster CPUs and GPUs so applications and graphics can run faster. PCs are also faster as Windows 10 has also been tweaked to work closely with the chip. PC makers are seeing CPU performance improvements between 5 and 15 percent with Kaby Lake chips compared to the predecessor Skylake chips. More modems and connectivity for laptops Modems have been in laptops for years more as an afterthought, but not anymore. Lenovo is offering modems as a standard feature in its ThinkPad X1 laptops and 2-in-1s so users can connect to cellular networks if Wi-Fi isn't available. Like with smartphones, cellular modems will drive communications in laptops, especially with 4G network speeds going up and 5G networks around the corner. Overclock Gamers craving more performance will be able to overclock the Core i7-7820HK Kaby Lake chip, which has a base speed of 2.9GHz but can be cranked up to 4.4GHz. Look for the chip in Dell's Alienware 15 and 17 laptops, which are being launched at CES. Cut cables There's a renewed effort to cut cables from PCs with wireless charging and data transfer technologies. Wireless charging laptops are being shown at CES, and Intel's increasing its focus on bringing WiGig wireless technology to PCs. WiGig can wirelessly connect laptops to peripherals like storage devices and monitors, providing a way to get rid of connectors and display ports from PCs. The wireless technologies are still years away from widespread adoption, but gaining steam again after a few years of inactivity. Many more ways to interact Be it through pen, voice, touch or typing, PCs with Kaby Lake chips will provide a more natural way for users to interact with PCs. Intel and Microsoft are developing technology so users can shout out commands to the Cortana voice-activated assistant from longer distances. Additionally, Microsoft is making it easier to take notes on Windows PCs with styluses.

After launching the first of the Kaby Lake chips officially in August, and having a long list of products introduced with the chips since, today the company introduced new processors to round out the lineup that could make their way into both future Mac desktops and MacBooks. Intel says the new chips deliver performance increases including “up to 20 percent for performance and gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops.” Among the new processors are 7th Gen Intel Core chips from 4.5W-91W, 7th Gen processors with Intel Iris Plus graphics, processors with Intel vPro technology, and Intel Xeon processors for mobile workstations. The lineup includes new low-powered U-Series chips that would be suitable for future MacBook products as are new H-Series chips built for high-performance laptops. Also included are new Y-Series chips made for detachables and S-Series chips for desktop systems that could be used in future iMac or other Mac desktop upgrades. All of the chips, like previous Kaby Lake releases, support Thunderbolt 3, and the Y-Series and U-Series chips notably put a focus on increased performance and battery life: With the Y-series processor family, 2 in 1s are reimagined, enabling thin and fanless designs for ultra-mobility. On U-series processors, enhanced productivity and creativity are possible in increasingly slim form factors without sacrificing battery life – in fact, new 7th Gen Intel Core U-series processors now provide up to 10 hours of battery life for the whole workday. Modern Standby ensures laptops resume with data ready in a flash. On that note, we pointed out in our look at what’s next for Apple in 2017 that the company is said to be planning iMac updates for this year alongside spec bumps for MacBook models. Intel has a full fact sheet on the new processors (listed below) on its website here.  4.5W Intel® Core™ vPro™ processors (Y-series) for 2 in 1 detachables 15W Intel Core vPro, 15W and 28W Intel Core processors (U-series) for 2 in 1 convertibles and thin and light clamshells including SKUs with Intel® Iris™ Plus graphics 45W Intel Core vPro processors (H-series) for large-screen clamshells and premium notebooks 45W Intel Core mobile processor (H-series), unlocked2 SKUs for enthusiast and VR-capable notebooks 45W Intel Xeon processors for mobile workstations 65W Intel Core and Intel Core vPro processors (S-series) for mainstream towers 65W and 35W Intel Core and Intel Core vPro processors (S-series) for All-in-Ones and minis 95W and 65W Intel Core processors (S-series) for enthusiast towers, including unlocked2 SKUs   blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Anytime. Anywhere. Microsoft, Intel Era at CES Gives Way to Rising Star Nvidia By Matt Day PUBLISHED: JANUARY 03 2017 For most of its 33 years, Nvidia was best known for building graphics processors that helped computers display high-powered computer games. Now, rising interest in the hardware that powers self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and virtual reality has taken the Santa Clara, Calif., chipmaker, little known outside the high-tech industry, to new heights. On Wednesday evening, Nvidia will unofficially kick off CES in Las Vegas, occupying a speaking slot held in past years by the likes of Microsoft and Intel. The mammoth technology industry confab, formerly the International Consumer Electronics Show, used to be centered on big-screen televisions, appliances and speakers. Those devices are still featured at the show. But these days the hype, and much of the conference-hall space on the Las Vegas Strip, focuses on technology that enables cars to drive themselves or allows you to talk to your devices. Nvidia processors help power some of those futuristic applications. "Nvidia was one of the first chipset suppliers that spied new opportunities in completely different markets," said Malik Saadi, a vice president with ABI Research. "Back in 2014 when everybody was just talking about automotive, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, they were very busy reshaping their product areas." Nvidia's stock price soared nearly 230 percent in 2016, and the firm took in $1.2 billion in net income during its most recently reported 12 months, double the total of the previous period. Nvidia's place in the keynote slot the evening before the opening of the CES show floor marks a changing of the guard at the event. That position for years was held by Bill Gates, and, later, Steve Ballmer, during Microsoft's personal-computer heyday. When Microsoft bowed out after 2012, chipmakers Qualcomm and Intel, dominant in smartphone and PC processors, respectively, held that slot. In Nvidia, the show, put on by the Consumer Technology Association industry group, is homing in on a new wave of technologies untethered from the smartphone or PC. The company's CEO, and the man who will take the microphone on Wednesday, is Jen-Hsun Huang [pictured above]. The 53-year-old was born in Taiwan and emigrated to the U.S. as a child, attending Aloha High School west of Portland, Ore., and earning a degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University. A master's degree at Stanford followed. In 1993, Huang and two veterans of Sun Microsystems founded Nvidia. The company is a resident of the semiconductor industry, the catchall name for builders of brainlike circuits that control the flow of electrical signals in computing devices ranging from laptops to smartphones. The most widely known name in that world is Intel, which makes most of the processors that power personal computers and servers in cloud-computing data centers. Intel focuses on central processing units, the general-purpose chips proficient in completing a wide range of tasks and quickly switching from one to the next. Nvidia, based a short drive from Intel's headquarters, also in Santa Clara, is the inventor of the modern graphics-processing unit. Those chips aren't as flexible in their applications as CPUs, but can complete many simple operations quickly and simultaneously. The original use for that kind of horsepower was video gaming. Computer games in the early 2000s went from pixelated, two-dimensional, tabletop-like experiences to three-dimensional worlds. To display that often required components dedicated to graphics, and Nvidia's GeForce line of graphics cards is the industry standard. Sales of gaming-focused GPUs account for more than 60 percent of Nvidia's revenue. Nvidia's current hot streak comes as the company tries to expand the pie beyond its gaming wheelhouse. The technology universe seems poised to grant that wish. The focus at CES, the weeklong trade show attended annually by more than 150,000 technologists, marketers and journalists, in recent years has focused on tools that bring new ways to interact with humans or otherwise mimic human intelligence. Amazon.com's Alexa voice-activated assistant relies on a trove of human speech data and pattern-recognition software to make sense of spoken commands. Self-driving cars similarly are designed to bring to bear the experience of thousands of other vehicles to inform how they react to situations on the road. Using GPUs, it turns out, can speed up those sorts of tasks. "You're dealing with a number of tasks (at once). That means you need a different engine to digest and process that information," said Saadi, the ABI executive. "Those markets are getting very, very hot." Nvidia's Tesla line of chips targets the builders of the data centers that power artificial-intelligence applications. The company is also marketing a package that executives say is the only off-the-shelf hardware and software platform for builders of self-driving cars available today. Jeff Herbst, a vice president of business development at Nvidia, says the company a decade ago couldn't have predicted that its future would lie in areas like artificial intelligence. "But did we know that high-performance computing and parallel processing were going to be important? Yes, we did," he said. "All the investments we made in the last 20-something years are starting to pay off." © 2017 Seattle Times under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Next Article > Lenovo Updates Enterprise Lineup of Ultraportable Laptops By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: JANUARY 03 2017 Tech giant Lenovo is taking advantage of CES 2017 taking place in Las Vegas from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8 to refresh its lineup of products aimed at the enterprise market. In particular, Lenovo is launching several updated machines in its storied ThinkPad family of laptops. Those refreshed laptops, the Carbon (pictured above), Yoga and Tablet, are scheduled to go on sale in February or March. All three belong to Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 line of ultraportable laptops designed to make it easier for employees to take their work with them while on the go. Upgraded Carbon Lenovo is pitching the devices as hybrid models that can be used for work and play. “The next generation of ThinkPad X1 products are committed to uncompromised innovation and embracing the needs of the evolving consumer, who now blurs the line between work and personal PC use,” the company said in a statement. The lightest ThinkPad X1 machine is the Carbon, which weighs in at just 2.5 pounds while packing a 14-inch IPS display into a new 13-inch form factor. The company said the Carbon will also feature up to 15 hours of battery life, depending on the workload, which Lenovo is pitching as perfect for getting work done on ultra-long-haul flights with enough battery left over to connect once you land. Along with the improved battery life is the addition of Thunderbolt 3 ports and a fingerprint sensor with a dedicated chip that handles biometric processing to take some of the security processing off the shoulders of the CPU. The Carbon also features a new Infrared camera capable of supporting face recognition for the Windows Hello logon. Yoga and Tablet Go for Flexibility The Yoga is also getting an update, with a new, redesigned, rechargeable pen and an improved keyboard. The Yoga is designed with creative professionals in mind, as its 2-in-1 form factor allows it to be used as a tablet and a laptop. Like the Carbon, the Yoga is also getting improved security features and a complete set of ports, including the Thunderbolt 3. It will also support up to 15 hours of work for long-haul flights, according to Lenovo. The graphics are probably the biggest upgrade to this year’s Yoga model, which features a 14-inch OLED display and new, Intel Iris Graphics with high bandwidth, high-speed memory. The redesigned pen also offers users more friction when used against the display, allowing for a more natural drawing experience, Lenovo said. The X1 Tablet is also being updated this year. Like the Yoga, the Tablet features 2-in-1 flexibility while offering enterprise class features such as military specification-level durability, five extra hours of battery life and an integrated projection feature that should make setting up presentations for meetings a bit easier.

Register for an Exam Today> Microsoft, Intel Era at CES Gives Way to Rising Star Nvidia By Matt Day PUBLISHED: JANUARY 03 2017 For most of its 33 years, Nvidia was best known for building graphics processors that helped computers display high-powered computer games. Now, rising interest in the hardware that powers self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and virtual reality has taken the Santa Clara, Calif., chipmaker, little known outside the high-tech industry, to new heights. On Wednesday evening, Nvidia will unofficially kick off CES in Las Vegas, occupying a speaking slot held in past years by the likes of Microsoft and Intel. The mammoth technology industry confab, formerly the International Consumer Electronics Show, used to be centered on big-screen televisions, appliances and speakers. Those devices are still featured at the show. But these days the hype, and much of the conference-hall space on the Las Vegas Strip, focuses on technology that enables cars to drive themselves or allows you to talk to your devices. Nvidia processors help power some of those futuristic applications. "Nvidia was one of the first chipset suppliers that spied new opportunities in completely different markets," said Malik Saadi, a vice president with ABI Research. "Back in 2014 when everybody was just talking about automotive, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, they were very busy reshaping their product areas." Nvidia's stock price soared nearly 230 percent in 2016, and the firm took in $1.2 billion in net income during its most recently reported 12 months, double the total of the previous period. Nvidia's place in the keynote slot the evening before the opening of the CES show floor marks a changing of the guard at the event. That position for years was held by Bill Gates, and, later, Steve Ballmer, during Microsoft's personal-computer heyday. When Microsoft bowed out after 2012, chipmakers Qualcomm and Intel, dominant in smartphone and PC processors, respectively, held that slot. In Nvidia, the show, put on by the Consumer Technology Association industry group, is homing in on a new wave of technologies untethered from the smartphone or PC. The company's CEO, and the man who will take the microphone on Wednesday, is Jen-Hsun Huang [pictured above]. The 53-year-old was born in Taiwan and emigrated to the U.S. as a child, attending Aloha High School west of Portland, Ore., and earning a degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University. A master's degree at Stanford followed. In 1993, Huang and two veterans of Sun Microsystems founded Nvidia. The company is a resident of the semiconductor industry, the catchall name for builders of brainlike circuits that control the flow of electrical signals in computing devices ranging from laptops to smartphones. The most widely known name in that world is Intel, which makes most of the processors that power personal computers and servers in cloud-computing data centers. Intel focuses on central processing units, the general-purpose chips proficient in completing a wide range of tasks and quickly switching from one to the next. Nvidia, based a short drive from Intel's headquarters, also in Santa Clara, is the inventor of the modern graphics-processing unit. Those chips aren't as flexible in their applications as CPUs, but can complete many simple operations quickly and simultaneously. The original use for that kind of horsepower was video gaming. Computer games in the early 2000s went from pixelated, two-dimensional, tabletop-like experiences to three-dimensional worlds. To display that often required components dedicated to graphics, and Nvidia's GeForce line of graphics cards is the industry standard. Sales of gaming-focused GPUs account for more than 60 percent of Nvidia's revenue. Nvidia's current hot streak comes as the company tries to expand the pie beyond its gaming wheelhouse. The technology universe seems poised to grant that wish. The focus at CES, the weeklong trade show attended annually by more than 150,000 technologists, marketers and journalists, in recent years has focused on tools that bring new ways to interact with humans or otherwise mimic human intelligence. Amazon.com's Alexa voice-activated assistant relies on a trove of human speech data and pattern-recognition software to make sense of spoken commands. Self-driving cars similarly are designed to bring to bear the experience of thousands of other vehicles to inform how they react to situations on the road. Using GPUs, it turns out, can speed up those sorts of tasks. "You're dealing with a number of tasks (at once). That means you need a different engine to digest and process that information," said Saadi, the ABI executive. "Those markets are getting very, very hot." Nvidia's Tesla line of chips targets the builders of the data centers that power artificial-intelligence applications. The company is also marketing a package that executives say is the only off-the-shelf hardware and software platform for builders of self-driving cars available today. Jeff Herbst, a vice president of business development at Nvidia, says the company a decade ago couldn't have predicted that its future would lie in areas like artificial intelligence. "But did we know that high-performance computing and parallel processing were going to be important? Yes, we did," he said. "All the investments we made in the last 20-something years are starting to pay off." © 2017 Seattle Times under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Being held at several venues across Las Vegas, CES is scheduled to run from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8. In addition to new products in the usual consumer device categories -- TVs, audio equipment, video game technologies and more -- CES will showcase the latest innovations in augmented reality and virtual reality, drones, biotech, robotics and smart home devices. Among the speakers set to give keynote addresses during the conference are Nvidia founder, president and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, Huawei consumer business group CEO Richard Yu, Nissan chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn and Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf. A number of companies, including automotive startup Faraday Future, LG, Qualcomm, Samsung, Sony and Toyota, have scheduled press events during CES to unveil new products. As usual, though, Apple will not be attending, so iPhone fans will have to wait until later in 2017 for that company's latest device rollouts. And Samsung is not expected to make any announcements about the Galaxy S8 launch until the spring. Smart Car Demos and New Models Smart car technology is one area where CES is set to make plenty of headlines. The California-based electric car startup Faraday Future, for instance, plans to unveil its first model, the FFZero1 (pictured above), from Las Vegas in an event that will be streamed live later today. Like Elon Musk's Tesla vehicles, the FFZero1 was designed from the ground up as a new kind of car and features a carbon fiber body, connected intelligence and a top speed of over 200 mph. Meanwhile, Microsoft and several partner companies have scheduled a media event for tomorrow to demonstrate a "highly automated vehicle" that uses bots, secure communication technologies and artificial intelligence for improved road safety, traffic flow and mobile entertainment. "This collaboration at CES 2017 is another example of how we work together to continue testing, to see what sticks, and to help automakers bring truly personalized experiences to drivers and services that learn unique behaviors and can make improvements over time," Kevin Dallas, corporate vice president of business development for Microsoft, said today in a statement. Enterprise Focus on the 'Experience Economy' In all, this year's Las Vegas event is expected to feature more than 3,800 exhibitors and attract more than 165,000 visitors over four days. Beyond the keynote addresses, CES will feature panel discussions and other sessions on topics ranging from accessibility technology, cybersecurity, business use of drones and delivery robots, sports tech and cognitive technologies. Enterprise applications will also be in the spotlight, with Carnival Corp. president and CEO Arnold Donald scheduled to deliver a keynote on the "experience economy" and Mastercard hosting a conference track on digital money. Mastercard, CardConnect and Walmart will also be among the companies on hand at the CES e-commerce and enterprise solution marketplace. Microsoft today also highlighted a number of devices from Lenovo that will be unveiled at CES. They include the 2017 ThinkPad X1 Carbon laptop, as well as the ThinkPad X1 Yoga and ThinkPad X1 Tablet, all of which are set to hit the market in the U.S. in February or March. Other News Out of CES Some of the other developments likely to come out of CES this year include a growing presence for Alexa, Amazon's intelligent digital assistant, across a range of offerings from the DISH network's DVR platform to a new smart clock from the startup Vobot. Google's Project Tango, a "spatial perception" technology for the Android mobile operating system, is also making a new appearance through Asus' launch of the ZenFone AR. It's the second smartphone after Lenovo's Phab2 Pro to support Tango. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, meanwhile, is expected to discuss how new tech from his company will enable virtual reality applications for "almost every aspect of our lives." His press conference, to be streamed live, is set for tomorrow afternoon. Another no-show at CES this year is Oculus, Facebook's virtual reality property. The first consumer version of the Oculus Rift headgear hit the market in the spring, and Facebook is already said to be planning an update, although it's not expected to be released until later this year at the earliest.

Here is one of the hottest names in mapping — for companies in the auto business, at least — since it’s one of the few good options they can get ahold of that isn’t controlled by a competitor. It essentially offers them an out from relying on Google and gives these companies the ability to control a relatively mature mapping platform’s development. Intel wants a precise location system for self-driving cars Like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes, the investment Intel is making in Here is all about cars. Intel says it plans to work with Here to develop mapping systems that can pinpoint a vehicle’s location “within centimeters,” as a way to improve autonomous driving systems. That’s a key area for Intel, as it recently announced plans to invest $250 million in building self-driving vehicle systems. As you might expect, Intel’s role in this partnership seems to be more on the hardware side. Here already offers a service, called “HD Live Map,” that’s supposed to continually collect data to build updated road maps and let self-driving cars see the road ahead. Edzard Overbeek, Here’s CEO, says in a statement that Intel’s role will be more as a “silicon provider,” helping to create systems that are able to better monitor a vehicle’s location. While it goes unmentioned in the announcement, it’s easy to imagine Intel putting Here to use when it comes to its ambitions in drones, too. Mapping and location are key components of building drones that can fly themselves, and that’s exactly the kind of tech Intel will be developing alongside Here thanks to this investment. The investment will have to receive regulatory approval; Intel and Here suspect that’ll happen within the next few months.

Kaby Lake low-power Y-Series and U-Series processors were announced in late August, but today's unveiling covers notebook and desktop chips that could be destined for many future Apple Macs. Intel's 7th-generation processors are built on the "14nm+" process, introducing new optimizations compared to previous 14nm Broadwell and Skylake chips. According to Intel, Kaby Lake will bring "double digit productivity performance increases" of up to 20 percent for gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops, compared to 2013 Haswell chips from Intel's prior release cycle. With 4K and 360 degree content, customers can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks. Enhanced security, a new media engine, and improvements in VR and gaming are all advertised features. Of the chips announced today, the 28-watt U-Series chips are appropriate for a future 13-inch MacBook Pro update, and we could see the 7267U/7287U/7567U used in 13-inch MacBook Pro machines this year. Those same chips are likely what Apple would use in a Mac mini update, as the Mac mini and the 13-inch MacBook Pro have traditionally included the same chips. Intel's 45-watt H-Series chips are appropriate for a future 15-inch MacBook Pro update. The 7700HQ would be ideal for entry-level machines, while a mid-tier machine would use the 7820HQ and the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro would use the 7920HQ. There are multiple potential upgrade options for the 27-inch iMac, but the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) are the straight upgrade path from the current Skylake chips used in 27-inch machines. For the 21.5-inch iMac, Apple normally uses chips with higher-end integrated graphics, but Intel has not released Kaby Lake chips that are a clear upgrade for the smaller iMac machines. Apple could choose to use Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake chips for the 21.5-inch iMac, and in that case, would likely adopt the 6585R, 6685R, and 6785R chips, released six months ago. With today's announcement, Kaby Lake chips that are clear upgrades for the iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini will be available to manufacturers in the near future and will be available for Apple's planned 2017 upgrades. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for future MacBook updates are already available. Rumors suggest we will see refreshed iMacs in the spring, which is also when we may see new MacBooks, and in the fall, we expect to see Kaby Lake refreshes for the MacBook Pro lineup.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 3, 2017January 3, 2017 by Press Release Acer Launches Performance-Oriented Aspire VX 15, V Nitro and GX Series LAS VEGAS (PRWEB) January 03, 2017 Acer today unveiled three new Aspire series devices, including two new high-performance notebooks and a desktop PC, all designed with entertainment and performance in mind while featuring Windows 10. Packed with premium audio technologies, crystal clear displays with IPS technology(2) and the latest NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 10-Series graphics and high-performance 7th Generation Intel® Core™ processors, the new Aspire V Nitro Black Edition models (V Nitro 17 and V Nitro 15) and Aspire VX notebooks are ideal for people who like their videos crisp, games smooth and audio clear. Likewise, Aspire GX series desktop PCs are also ideal for users who are passionate about entertainment but appreciate expanded capabilities that their mobile cousins don’t offer. Aspire V Nitro Black Edition & Aspire VX Both notebook series come with up to a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor that is designed to bring incredible performance and responsiveness, immersive 4K entertainment and longer battery life to mobile devices. The chipset is the perfect match for the notebooks’ equally impressive GPUs, the new NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or 1050 Ti graphics(1). Whether a movie buff or a gamer, users will be able to fully enjoy the latest releases and titles without compromise. The Aspire V 17 Nitro Black Edition featuring a 17.3-inch display is available with optional integrated Tobii eye-tracking hardware, that when combined with touchpad gestures, enhances productivity and makes the device more responsive through the use of eye movements. Users are able to more quickly and conveniently navigate across apps and programs with a simple glance. Gaming is also enhanced with eye tracking, creating deeper immersion and allowing gamers to aim, shoot and explore freely using their eyes in more than 45 titles like Elite Dangerous, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and WATCH_DOGS 2™. The sleek Aspire V Nitro Black Edition models are the ideal device for those seeking high-quality entertainment on a notebook. Under the aluminum cover, Acer combined 7th Generation Intel Core processors to drive performance and the latest NVIDIA technologies, starting with up to a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card with 6GB of dedicated GDDR5 VRAM(1) and up to 16GB of DDR4 system memory, upgradable to 32GB using two soDIMM modules. They also come with an NVMe PCIe Gen3 or SATA SSD(1) and a HDD(1) of up to 2TB capacity for additional storage. The Aspire V Nitro incorporates Acer’s AeroBlade metal fan(1) to release thermal exhaust efficiently, while Coolboost™ technology allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost. The Aspire V Nitro notebooks also include DustDefender™, which uses dual high-speed fans with reverse rotation to remove dust build-up and improve heat dissipation. Connectivity comes in the form of a USB Type-C port with Thunderbolt™ 3 for speeds up to 40Gbps and support for dual 4K video output simultaneously, two USB 3.0 ports (one featuring power-off USB charging), two USB 2.0 ports and an HDMI connection. It connects wirelessly through 2×2 802.11ac MU-MIMO technology, while a Gigabit Ethernet port is available for wired connectivity needs. The new Aspire V Nitro notebooks come with a fingerprint sensor embedded in the top left corner of the Precision Touchpad. This enables Windows Hello, allowing secure and password-free sign-in with a touch of the finger. Users will revel in crystal clear visuals with the inclusion of an optional 4K (3840×2160) Ultra HD(1) display panel. Complementing the display is the inclusion of Acer Color Intelligence™, a system that dynamically adjusts gamma and saturation in real-time, optimizing screen color and brightness. The high-quality entertainment experience is also driven by the audio technologies featured on the Aspire V Nitro, including four speakers tuned with Dolby® Audio™ Premium and Acer TrueHarmony™ Plus technology. Acer TrueHarmony Plus delivers more accurate, clear sound reproduction and a wider bass range with an advanced paper cone speaker design framed by a foam material. Skype for Business Certification ensures people can communicate with crisp and lag-free quality, and also allows for clearer, higher quality audio and a great Cortana with Voice experience on Windows 10. The new Aspire VX 15 features large cooling vents and an edgy red chassis, clearly showing its determination for gaming. The iron red backlit keyboard makes sure gamers are always striking the right notes during gameplay, while also providing a hardcore look and feel without that hardcore price tag. The 5.5 lb (2.5kg) Aspire VX 15 boasts great visual clarity with a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS screen(2). It also comes with up to a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, offering significant improvements in performance over preceding generation processors, all the while providing lower battery consumption. The notebook also comes with up to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti(1) graphics with GDDR5 VRAM (delivering up to 32GB/s bandwidth). Speed is also a notable attribute of the memory system, offering up to 16GB1 DDR4 memory out of the box and is user-upgradeable to a maximum of 32GB. Storage is provided by a 512GB SSD and 1TB HDD1. Keeping all this running at optimal temperatures are dual fans, installed to ensure however much it’s pushed during a gaming session, the machine is up to the task and will deliver super-smooth gameplay.

Aspire V Nitro Black Edition Acer has added two new laptops to its Aspire line with the Aspire V Nitro Black Edition and the Aspire VX. At its core, both series of laptops can be configured with up to a Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor and either an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or 1050 graphics card. The system will arrive with 16GB DDR4 RAM by default but can be upgraded to 32GB. Lastly, the laptop will be available with either a NVMe PCIe Gen 3 or SATA SSD, with additional storage from an HDD that can be configured up to 2TB. Since it is running Windows 10, the Aspire V Nitro Black Edition will support Windows Hello with its fingerprint reader. There will also be a 17-inch model available, the Aspire V 17 Nitro Black Edition, with the optional Tobii eye-tracking module. As for pricing, the Aspire V 15 Nitro Black Edition and Aspire V 17 Nitro Black Edition will be available in North America, EMEA markets, and China in February. In the US the price of the V 15 will start at $1,199 with the V 17 starting at $1,399. In EMEA markets, the V 15 will start at €1,299, with the V 17 starting at €1,499 . Both of the aforementioned models will also be available in China in February starting at ¥8,999. Aspire VX 15 For those looking at something a bit more tame, the Aspire VX 15, might be a good option. The laptop offers Intel's Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM standard with the ability to upgrade to 32GB and the option of upgrading to an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics card. As for storage, the system will pack a 512GB SSD with a 1TB secondary HDD. The Aspire VX 15 will carry a bit friendlier of a price tag starting at $799 in the US, €899 in EMEA, and ¥5,499 in China and will be available in January. For those seeking a desktop, Acer has got you covered with their latest offering, the Aspire GX series PC. The setup will be similar to those laptop above with the added benefit of being able to configure a unit with up to 64GB DDR4 RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. There is no mention of it being available in the US, but the Aspire GX will make its way to EMEA markets and China, starting at €799 and ¥5,999 respectively. Predator 21 X Although this laptop was announced previously in the summer, Acer has finally added the important details of price and availability to its curved-screen laptop, the Predator 21 X. As expected, the laptop will come with a hefty price tag, with those in North America paying at least $8,999 and for those in the EMEA, it will be offered at a starting price of €9,999. The laptop will be available in February in both regions. Not to be forgotten, Acer will also be updating its Predator 17 X, offering the latest from Intel and NVIDIA. Like its larger 21-inch counterpart, the 17 X will offer the option of upgrading to the latest Intel Core i7-7820HK processor and can be configured with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080. The US and EMEA will get first dibs on the Predator 17 X as it will debut in both regions in January, although the price tag won't be cheap. The refreshed laptop will start at $2,599 in the US and €2,999 in EMEA. The laptop will make its debut a month later in China with a starting price of ¥39,999.

HERE / Intel to Acquire 15 Percent Ownership of HERE . Processed and transmitted by Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement. Companies to Collaborate on Technology for Autonomous Vehicles and IoT NEWS HIGHLIGHTS -- Intel is acquiring a 15 percent ownership stake in HERE, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services for automotive and the Internet of Things (IoT). -- Companies plan to jointly develop a highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture that supports real-time updates of high definition (HD) maps for highly and fully automated driving as well as explore opportunities in IoT and machine learning. -- HERE will add Intel's nominee to its Supervisory Board of Directors when the transaction closes, which is expected in the first quarter of 2017. SANTA CLARA, Calif., and Eindhoven, Netherlands, January 3, 2017 - Intel has agreed to purchase a 15 percent ownership stake in HERE, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services, from HERE's current indirect shareholders: AUDI AG, BMW AG, and Daimler AG. In conjunction with Intel's acquisition of a stake in HERE, the two companies also signed an agreement to collaborate on the research and development of a highly scalable proof-of-concept architecture that supports real-time updates of high definition (HD) maps for highly and fully automated driving. Additionally, the two companies plan to jointly explore strategic opportunities that result from enriching edge-computing devices with location data. "Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world's most intelligent, connected devices," said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. "We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future." "A real-time, self-healing and high definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. "As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected." The proof-of-concept architecture HERE and Intel plan to deliver will be designed to help make autonomous driving as safe and predictable as possible. For example, today's navigation technology can pinpoint a car's location to within meters, but next generation, HD mapping supports localization to within centimeters. This will help vehicles precisely position themselves on the roadway to enable reliable autonomous driving functionality. HERE HD Live Map, HERE's cloud service supporting vehicle automation, gives vehicles the ability to "see" obstacles beyond their immediate field of vision and receive real-time updates as environments change due to traffic, road conditions and other factors. Intel will also work with AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG to test the architecture. Intel and HERE envision making the architecture broadly available across the automotive industry as a seamlessly integrated offering that simplifies and shortens time of development for automakers. A Shared Commitment to Autonomous Machines Intel is positioned to provide a secure, flexible and scalable technology foundation for the future of autonomous driving from the vehicle to the data center. Intel's assets span: high performance and flexible, in-vehicle computing; robust cloud and machine-learning solutions; and high speed wireless connectivity. In addition to furthering Intel's efforts in autonomous driving, the next generation location services that result from this collaboration can fuel the continued growth of cloud computing and the Internet of Things. HERE is a private company, which is indirectly wholly owned by AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG. HERE is a global provider of embedded navigation solutions. By working with Intel, HERE aims to offer automakers a universal solution that reduces both complexity and long-term development costs. Intel also provides expertise in developing and optimizing hardware, which will be fundamental to moving cloud-based algorithms to in-vehicle architectures. This same expertise will support HERE's strategy to connect multiple industries beyond automotive, such as in Internet of Things where location algorithms and location-based services are increasingly becoming embedded into connected devices. Intel and HERE intend to explore other potential collaborative opportunities spanning next-generation cloud analytics, IoT applications, machine learning, augmented reality and more. Transaction Details and Timing: The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, after obtaining regulatory approvals. Intel will nominate Doug Davis, senior vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Group (ADG) at Intel to HERE's Supervisory Board of directors once the transaction is completed.

Roston - Jan 3, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Intel has announced plans to acquire a 15-percent ownership stake in HERE, the navigation company. HERE provides a navigation app not unlike Google Maps, and its data is used for relevant technology, including IoT services and automotive applications. This transaction, says Intel, is expected to close in the first quarter of this year, after which point Intel’s nominee will be added to the company’s Supervisory Board of Directors. HERE has been a hot item for a while, at one point seeming likely for a full sale, though that didn’t come to fruition. Instead, Intel will soon have a significant stake in the company, something that will be joined by a signed collaboration agreement for R&D purposes. This research and development will center around an effort to create a architecture proof-of-concept for real-time HD map updates. This, as you probably guessed, will be used for autonomous driving of various sorts, enabling vehicles to navigate public roads using GPS and high-quality map data. Said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich: Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world’s most intelligent, connected devices. We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future. This so-called next-generation mapping Intel and HERE will develop will enable unspecified navigation tech to pinpoint a vehicle’s location with ‘within centimeters’ rather than meters, says Intel. This is essential for precisely positioning among autonomous cars, and will help increase the safety of these vehicles, among other things. Daimler AG, Audi AG, and BMW AG have all been tapped to test this HD mapping architecture.

The new processors are built with modern computing tasks in mind, like 4K video streaming and virtual reality gaming, and early reviews suggest that Intel has a solid release on its hands.  Don't Miss: Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this? Intel’s new top-of-the-line offering is the i7-7700k. It’s an unlocked processor with a base clock of 4.2GHz and a boost clock of 4.5GH. That bests the previous generation’s go-to gaming chip, the 6700k, which clocked in at 4.0GHz with a 4.2GHz boost clock, much to the chagrin of hard-t0-please enthusiasts. For the purposes of comparison, Intel pitted the 7700k against the 4770k, which was part of the fourth generation of chips. The company says that the new processor is 35% faster than the fourth generation model when it comes to 4K, 360-degree video. Lower on the totem pole are the new i5-7600k and the i3-7350k (a rare unlocked dual-core processor). All show marked improvements over their predecessors in early reviews, with AnandTech’s benchmark testing showing the chips falling largely where they should in terms of gains over Intel’s sixth generation. The 7700k seems to handily best the 6700k in all computing tasks, and pales in comparison only to the Broadwell-E processors in certain circumstances due to the latter’s larger number of cores. However, if you’re already running a fifth or sixth generation i7 or even an i5, there’s a good chance your performance gains will be modest at best. Compared to the 4770k, these chips are beasts, but they’re only marginally better than their immediate predecessors. As for pricing, the chips should reach retail at somewhere below the $350 price point, unless of course the PC industry’s habit of price gouging rears its ugly head as it has with Intel launches in the past. If that does indeed happen, you’re best off waiting until things calm down a bit and picking up a chip at the more reasonable price point.

Intel confirms 15% stake in mapping business Here to work on autonomous car tech Posted Jan 3, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Acer’s new rugged Chromebook 11 N7 is designed to withstand drops and drinks Here, the mapping and location services company once owned by Nokia and sold for €2.5 billion to a car-maker consortium of Audi, BMW and Daimler in 2015, is picking up a new investor today. Chipmaker Intel has confirmed that it is taking a 15 percent stake in the business, which it will use to develop autonomous positioning systems (powered with Intel Inside). The companies are not disclosing the value of the stake, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. At Here’s sale price in 2015, the stake would be worth $390 million in today’s currency. “Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world’s most intelligent, connected devices,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future.” “A real-time, self-healing and high definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms,” said Edzard Overbeek, Here CEO, in a statement. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.” The news follows a morning of speculation after it was reported that Intel had applied to Germany’s Cartel Office to approve the investment. It comes about a week after Singapore’s GIC, Tencent and NavInfo together agreed to take a 10% stake of Here. (That was a deal that was months and months in the making: NavInfo and Tencent had been in the running to acquire Here outright before the car consortium acquired it.) Here is also working closely with Microsoft, which acquired other parts of Nokia and has been in an extended licensing agreement for location data as part of that transaction. This is Intel’s latest — but not first — investment in automotive. Cars are a big area for the chipmaker as it looks to make sure that it has a place at the table for its processors in the next generation of computing devices, and connected cars have shaped up to be one of the chief targets. This week, the auto industry will especially be in the spotlight because of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas — where cars have been growing in prominence as the “gadget of tomorrow” alongside computers, phones, washing machines, and more. Intel’s other auto moves have included acquiring Itseez and Yogitech for safety and navigation functionalities in autonomous cars; a commitment of at least $250 million to the space; keeping a strong presence at auto shows, and in November launching a dedicated autonomous driving group. (Doug Davis, who heads that group, will now sit on Here’s board.) With the Here investment, the plan is to design and deliver proof-of-concept architecture to improve driving safety and predictability. Part of this will be to raise the accuracy of mapping data on Here: Today, locations can be mapped to an accuracy of of meters but the aim is to bring that down to centimeters in HD mapping technology — essential in self-driving systems where cars are navigating themselves on roads and needing to be more precise with their positioning in real-time. Part of the deal will also include Intel working with Here’s other majority owners, Audi, BMW and Daimler to test its architecture. Intel and Here both say Intel will also work with AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG to test the architecture, it said, and eventually offer it to other carmakers. “Intel and HERE envision making the architecture broadly available across the automotive industry as a seamlessly integrated offering that simplifies and shortens time of development for automakers.” Latest from CES 2017 More CES 2017 BMW's prototype 5 series drives us around ZBoard is an electric skateboard that Two of Razer’s crazy concept laptops were Check out the real world version of the Check out Delphi's multi-layer in-car 10 of the coolest gadgets we saw at CES 2017 Ford CEO Mark Fields on mobility services Take a ride with us in a self-driving Audi Q7 At 50 years, CES is a show in transition Amazon and Nvidia won CES this year 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

Alongside the processors themselves, Intel is also releasing the 200-series chipsets to ride shotgun. The Z270 platform caters to enthusiast builders, and like the Kaby Lake CPUs themselves, Z270 offers builders some minor improvements over Z170 before it. The biggest upgrade for the Z270 chipset comes from the addition of four more PCIe Gen3 lanes. This allows the chipset to support up to 24 general purpose PCIe lanes, compared to 20 in the Z170. The "up to" qualifier exists because the motherboard maker is given some degree of flexibility with how it wants to allocate the chipset's flexible I/O lanes. Some of the lanes that can be used for PCI Express could be multiplexed with USB 3.0 and SATA ports. A motherboard could be designed to give consumers the maximum number of PCIe lanes for expansion cards, or the designer could swing the pendulum the other direction to maximize the number of USB 3.0 ports. Or, mobo makers could settle on a happy mid-point. Point is: mobo makers have options. Another advantage of the Z270 over its predecessor is the ability to support Intel's new Optane Memory caching products. While it remains to be seen what the first round of products sporting 3D XPoint memory will look like, only the combination of Kaby Lake CPUs and 200-series motherboards will be Optane Memory ready. One thing that hasn't changed is that the Z270 chipset itself is connected to the processor using the same four Gen3 PCIe lanes that make up the DMI link that we saw with the Z170. This provides for up to 32Gb/s (4GB/s) of bandwidth, which is far outstripped by the potential bandwidth of the chipset's 30 flexible I/O lanes. This is unlikely to change until we see a DMI link composed of Gen4 PCI Express lanes. For those feeling the bandwidth pinch, there's always Intel's high-end desktop platform built around Broadwell-E, with up to 40 on-die Gen3 PCIe lanes. The Z270 platform also gives us some welcome enthusiast-friendly features, like the ability to split the processor's sixteen Gen3 PCIe lanes across multiple slots for multi-GPU graphics configs. The Z270 also offers full control over the processor's various knobs and dials, allowing overclockers to tweak to their hearts' content. It's worth pointing out that both the new Kaby Lake processors as well as previous-generation Skylake CPUs can be used in the new Z270-based boards, thanks to the two chips sharing a common LGA1151 socket. We've also seen motherboard makers release firmware updates for existing 100-series boards to support Kaby Lake CPUs, so a new 200-series motherboard is not a requirement for running the latest and greatest silicon. With that general introduction out of the way, one of the first 200-series motherboards we're looking at is MSI's Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon. The Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon fits into MSI's "Performance Gaming" product segment. Like the rest of the Carbon models, it features a rear I/O cluster shroud and heatsinks with carbon-fiber-patterned accents. The plastic shroud is held on by two screws, so if you're not a fan of the look, you can simply remove those screws, disconnect the LED cable, and leave the shroud in the box. The full-sized ATX board sports a very blacked-out look, with only a smattering of silver highlights along the expansion slots and across the heatsinks decorating the matte black PCB. If it weren't for the Audio Boost logo on the EMI shield covering the codec and the nickel accents from the nearby caps, the board would be living in a monochromatic world. The back of the board shows that all the heatsinks are held firmly in place with screws rather than push-pins. Screws not only ensure better heatsink contact with the components beneath, but they also give the board a more premium feel. We can also see certification logos for SteelSeries gaming peripherals, Nahimic audio software, CrossFire, and SLI. If you were hoping to show those logos off in your build, you're probably going to be out of luck. The underside of the board also gives us a good look at the RGB LEDs running along the left hand side and down the isolated audio section. These provide the ground effects for MSI's lighting system, which the company calls Mystic Light. As four out of five gaming hardware designers know, the presence of LEDs will make your processor's transistors switch faster and with more vigor. For those folks willing to risk running their systems dark, all of the lighting can thankfully be disabled. The two VRM heatsinks conceal the Pro Carbon's 11 digitally-controlled power phases. Just as with Intel's Skylake processors, Kaby Lake once again puts the responsibility of CPU voltage regulation in the motherboard maker's hands. Given that Kaby Lake shares the existing LGA1151 platform with Skylake, this should come as no surprise. We'll have to wait for a future generation of processors to see if the fully-integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) that was introduced with Haswell chips and improved upon in Broadwell CPUs will be seen again. Since 200-series boards sport the familiar LGA1151 socket, which itself maintains support for existing LGA1150 cooler mounting mechanisms, we're able to keep using our trusty Nepton 240M from Cooler Master. This closed-loop liquid cooler has a beefy copper block with a tendency to run afoul of capacitor banks located close to the CPU socket. Unfortunately, the Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon has just such a row of capacitors, located north of the CPU socket in the picture above. Those caps prevent the block from making sufficient contact with the CPU's heat spreader, nixing two of the cooler's four possible orientations as workable options. Thankfully, both the DDR4 DIMM slots and the VRM heatsinks are far enough away from the socket  that the block can be mounted in the remaining two orientations without a hitch. MSI recommends installing DIMMs in the furthest slot of each bank first, so builders will only need to use the slot closest to the CPU socket if they're installing four DIMMs. We can't check for compatbility with all possible coolers, so we've provided some measurements below to help you figure out which components can safely fit together on the board: Four fan headers are situated within easy reach of the CPU socket: one CPU fan headers, one liquid cooling pump fan header, and two system fan headers. MSI tells us that the pump header can supply up to 2A of current. There's also a healthy amount of room between the CPU socket and the topmost PCIe x16 slot, thanks to the M.2 slot located where the first expansion slot would normally reside on other boards. The Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon serves up three PCIe x16 slots. When one graphics card is installed, all sixteen of the processor's Gen3 PCIe lanes are routed to the left-most silver slot. Those wanting to partake in some dual-GPU fun should use the two silver slots. With two cards installed, each will get eight Gen3 PCIe lanes from the CPU. Four ASMedia ASM1480 multiplexers are responsible for routing the PCIe lanes between the two silver x16 slots. You can spot them above the left-most PCIe x1 slots. Peppered around those three x16 PCIe slots are three x1 slots. All three x1 slots are always enabled and always fed with a single Gen3 lane from the chipset. Similarly, the black x16 slot at right in the picture above is always enabled and supplied with four Gen3 chipset lanes. Without the use of third-party PCI Express switch chips, a Kaby Lake or Skylake chip riding atop the Z270 platform provides enough PCIe lanes for two-way SLI setups. MSI fully supports this configuration with the Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon. AMD's CrossFire multi-GPU implementation has more lenient bandwidth requirements that let the third chipset-driven PCIe slot above join in the fun. That said, we usually recommend going for the fastest single graphics card you can afford before stepping up to more exotic multi-GPU setups. The silver cladding on the two primary PCI Express x16 slots isn't just for show. MSI has reinforced the PCIe slots with metal shrouds that are soldered to the board at multiple points. This setup should help to prevent damage to the slots if you're transporting a system that has a massive video card installed, although we'd always recommend stowing heavy expansion cards separately. An indicator LED rests under the locking mechanism of each PCIe x16 slot. When the slot is populated with a device that is using all 16 lanes, like a single GPU installed in the left-most slot, the LED glows red. If the slot is populated with a device that's using a lesser number of lanes, say 8, 4, or 1, the LED glows white. If it's not populated with an expansion card the LED doesn't illuminate. That's a lot of words. Here's a diagram of the Pro Carbon's expansion slots and the connectivity options for each: The Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon's expansion slot layout can handle something as wild as a pair of triple-slot video cards. It's worth pointing out that this doesn't leave any PCIe expansion slots free. In more typical multi-GPU setups, installing a pair of double-slot cards will still allow access to one of the PCIe x1 slots and the four-lane PCIe x16 slot; both of which can be used at the same time. Now, on to the board's storage subsystem.

The Tiger Woodses, Roger Federers, and Lebron Jameses of the world can blaze all the paths they want, set all the records, break all the barriers, force the invention of new metaphors for pushing the bounds of what's possible. They win and win and win some more. Eventually, though, even the best and brightest have to stumble—or, at least, plateau. About six years ago to this day, Intel launched the brilliant Sandy Bridge family of CPUs to universal acclaim. Clock for clock, Sandy Bridge redefined desktop performance by every measure we cared to test. Folks building new PCs in 2011 had ample reason to retire even their Nehalem and Lynnfield PCs in favor of Sandy Bridge. Overclockers enjoyed plenty of "free" headroom from K-series Sandy CPUs with modest aftermarket coolers on top. Life was very, very good. Intel followed Sandy Bridge with Ivy Bridge, the process-advance "tick" to Sandy's architectural "tock." While Ivy delivered some under-the-hood improvements to Sandy's microarchitecture and its instructions-per-clock throughput, the big changes on the third-generation Core chips came in the integrated-graphics and power-efficiency departments as Intel began chasing thin-and-light notebooks with vigor. Enthusiasts with Sandy Bridge CPUs still ended up sitting pretty when Ivy came around. Intel's third-generation Core chips proved less-forgiving overclockers than their forebears, and their performance improvements on the desktop weren't overwhelming compared to Sandy. Meanwhile, AMD's ambitious Bulldozer architecture failed to demolish Sandy Bridge Core i5s, much less the Core i7-2600K. Even with AMD's subsequent refinements, Bulldozer's derivatives never quite matched the killer combo of single-threaded performance, power efficiency, and gaming competence that Intel delivered with tick-tock regularity. The potent Radeon integrated graphics in AMD APUs did little to capture the enthusiast imagination, either. As Intel continued to perfect its microarchitectures and fabrication processes, the Haswell, Broadwell, and Skylake architectures each brought progressively more modest single-threaded performance improvements with them. The Skylake Core i7-6700K, Intel's most recent mainstream desktop range-topper, is one of the finest all-around CPUs ever made, and its only peers come from past generations of Core i7s. With that long line of winners, AMD's perennial struggles with its CPUs and APUs, and the maddeningly difficult pursuit of smaller process technologies industry-wide, Intel's processors have enjoyed more-or-less complete domination of the PC in recent years. How many among us can say they have nothing left to beat but their own past successes? Indeed, when you're doing so well, what's the motivation to stick your neck out even further and perhaps overplay your hand? The quad-core Kaby Lake die. Source: Intel And that brings us to this morning. Even in light of the slowing pace of per-clock performance improvements from Intel, the Core i7-7700K CPU that's launching today feels like the company's least-ambitious desktop chip in quite some time. From dispatch to retirement, the i7-7700K's basic Kaby Lake CPU core is identical to Skylake's. Aside from some improvements in its fixed-function video engines to efficiently handle 4K video encoded with the next-gen HEVC and VP9 video codecs, Kaby's integrated graphics are largely a carry-over from the Gen9 IGP technology on Skylake chips, too. Womp. The Skylake Core i5-6600K (left) and the Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K (right) Basically every item on our wish list for Kaby was dashed during Intel's Kaby Lake introduction earlier this year at IDF. No, there will be no eDRAM for socketed Kaby Lake CPUs. No, VESA Adaptive-Sync still hasn't been integrated into the Kaby Lake IGP. So on and so forth. If you were hoping for some revolutionary architectural change from Intel to mark the seventh generation of Core processors and put the last nail in Sandy Bridge's coffin, well, Kaby Lake ain't it. i5-6600K on the left, i7-7700K on the right Instead, the biggest change in Kaby comes when it's forged in Intel's foundries. Kaby is the first CPU from Intel's new "optimize" product phase, and that means the company has tweaked and tuned its 14-nm tri-gate transistors to extract every bit of performance possible from its fabs. With those improvements, the Core i7-7700K enjoys a 200-MHz base clock boost over the i7-6700K, to 4.2 GHz, and its Turbo clock is a dizzying 4.5 GHz. The Core i7-7700K's TDP has held steady at 91W even with that clock boost, halting a slow upward creep that began with Ivy Bridge. If there's any single-threaded performance improvement from Kaby, it should come entirely from this extra clock speed. Like the Skylake CPUs before it, the Core i7-7700K also exposes a couple new knobs for overclockers to play with. Kaby Lake incorporates a new base-clock-aware dynamic-voltage-and-frequency-scaling (DVFS) feature that lets the CPU's power-management circuitry take both changes in the base clock and changes in multipliers into account when it adjusts the CPU's P-states. In the past, the company says that its CPUs' power-management circuitry only took multiplier changes into account in that scenario, so BCLK overclocking required finding a stable fixed voltage. The company says this new BCLK-aware approach lets overclockers enjoy a simpler BCLK tweaking process and the power-saving benefits of DVFS at idle. Unlocked Kaby Lake chips also inherit Broadwell-E's AVX Offset feature. That setting lets tweakers run the chip at lower speeds under heavy AVX2 workloads while maintaining higher frequencies when those instructions aren't being executed, possibly increasing the light-load frequency gains one can achieve with a given chip. If those issues held you back from taking your Skylake CPU to its maximum potential, Kaby Lake might break those shackles.
