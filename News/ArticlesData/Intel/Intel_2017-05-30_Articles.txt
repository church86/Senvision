College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Autonomous-Vehicle Stocks to Buy in 2017 The first autonomous cars will likely emerge from big-company partnerships. Here are three companies at the center of some of the most promising deals. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) May 31, 2017 at 6:06PM How should we approach investing in autonomous vehicles -- so-called "self-driving cars" -- here in 2017? Of course, no company is (yet!) producing a fully autonomous vehicle. In fact, one thing that's becoming clear as companies race to develop autonomous-vehicle technology is that no one company is likely to do it entirely on its own. Tech companies, automakers, and auto-industry suppliers are teaming up to share expertise, hoping to bring the best possible technology to market -- as soon as possible. How can that help investors? If we can identify the companies that have fingers in the most promising pies, we might be able to get an early read on which companies are most likely to profit handsomely, as vehicles that can drive themselves become commonplace. I've been watching this space closely as it has emerged over the last few years. Right now, I think these three companies each have an excellent chance to profit handsomely from the rise of autonomous vehicles: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH). Who's driving this Audi SUV? A prototype autonomous-vehicle system developed by two of the companies on our list drove it in a demonstration in Las Vegas earlier this year. Image source: Delphi Automotive. NVIDIA is an emerging automotive powerhouse It's only recently that NVIDIA has ramped up its efforts to push into the automotive space. Its automotive business is still small, accounting for just 7.2% ($140 million) of the $1.9 billion in revenue that it generated in the quarter ended April 30. But as the company sees it, the potential is enormous. Between chips and systems for digital "cockpit" displays, supercomputing processors for autonomous vehicles, and systems for "transport as a service" (ride-hailing and car-sharing), NVIDIA believes its potential market is between $6 billion and $10 billion. How will it access those markets? Its partnerships are a clue: Back in February, NVIDIA and giant auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH announced that they will collaborate on a hardware "brain" for autonomous vehicles. Bosch is a key supplier to many automakers, and has deep relationships with (among others) giant Volkswagen AG, VW subsidiary Audi AG, and Daimler AG -- all of which are investing heavily in autonomous-vehicle technology. The alliance gives NVIDIA a much broader path to market in the automotive space. It also gives NVIDIA a deeper relationship with companies that could be dominant in the early days of self-driving. Between its Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles and its huge heavy-truck business, Daimler, in particular, has the potential to be a powerhouse in this space. That's just one of what could be a long list of very profitable relationships for NVIDIA as autonomous vehicles become commonplace. Self-driving could be the key to Intel's future I know that a lot of investors are wary of Intel. Growth in the chip giant's core business is stalling, and its management team has arguably been flailing a bit, jumping from one idea to another in search of future growth. But I think it's very possible that Intel's search for a path to future growth ended in March, when it struck a huge ($15.3 billion) deal to buy an Israeli tech company, Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). Mobileye is a fairly small company, but when it comes to autonomous-vehicle technology, it's a very big deal. The various autonomous-vehicle systems under development use several different combinations of sensors, but nearly all of them use "passive visual" sensors -- cameras and systems that can intelligently process the images they capture. That's the space Mobileye dominates. It's already a key supplier of the chips and technology used in existing advanced driver-assist systems offered by nearly all of the world's automakers, and it's deeply respected by engineers and executives throughout the auto business. Mobileye's client list includes almost all of the automakers you've ever heard of, as well as a bunch of smaller ones that might emerge as heavyweights in the future. Intel doesn't plan to fold Mobileye into its existing business. Instead, it'll leave the Israeli company largely intact -- while essentially adding its own chips and systems to Mobileye's catalog. When the deal closes (expected by the end of the year), Intel will instantly have deep access to the world's automakers -- just as demand for processing power in vehicles is about to skyrocket. Intel already has its fingers in a few important pies with Mobileye. The two companies are working with Delphi on a "turnkey" autonomous-vehicle system that they'll make available to automakers by the end of 2019. In a separate (but related) effort, the three are working with German luxury-vehicle giant BMW AG on a series of autonomous-vehicle systems -- which the partners also intend to offer to other automakers, as well. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks the total addressable market for autonomous-vehicle systems and the data centers that will support them will be over $100 billion a year by 2030. Intel is now in a position to grab a very big piece of that, which could have a major impact on a company that generated just under $60 billion in revenue in 2016. Yes, Intel has issues. But its stock isn't expensive at about 12 times its expected 2017 earnings, and its 3% dividend yield provides some comfort. While the Mobileye deal looks very expensive now, the potential upside could make it -- and Intel's stock -- look very cheap in time. Delphi: An old-line auto supplier, retooled Delphi Automotive is to the Intel-Mobileye partnership what Bosch is to NVIDIA, more or less: It's the well-established auto-industry supplier that has deep relationships with most of the world's automakers -- and the expertise to integrate its partners' systems into its clients' vehicles. Like Bosch, Delphi has its fingers in multiple pies. It's a partner to Intel and Mobileye in both of the efforts I noted above, both of which have the potential to be very profitable. But there are two big things that distinguish Delphi from Bosch for our purposes. First, Delphi is a public company, and Bosch isn't. Second, and more importantly, Delphi is setting itself up to become a "pure play" in autonomous-vehicle technology and related fields. The company announced earlier this year that it will spin off its legacy internal-combustion engine components business to focus entirely on "electronic safety systems" -- autonomous-vehicle tech and its building blocks. That move will make Delphi the closest thing to a "pure-play" investment in autonomous-vehicle technology since -- well, since Mobileye. But Delphi's current valuation (around 20 times earnings) makes it much cheaper than Mobileye was before Intel scooped it up. It might seem counterintuitive to invest in an auto-industry stalwart just as the industry is about to be transformed, but that's arguably another reason why Delphi deserves a very close look.

One of the most interesting ideas was that of a Modular PC. This basically put the core guts of a laptop - chipset, processor, memory, and storage - into a box similar in size to a deck of cards. The company envisioned a set of accessories that ranged from a smartphone to a full-on desktop that would go with it, but the IBM CEO at the time killed the idea. A few years later, a little company called Antelope Technologies brought the thing to market using a Transmeta processor; it found a small niche but didn’t survive. Almost 20 years later, Intel is going to give it a run with something called the Intel Compute Card, which addresses almost all of the problems the old IBM Modular PC had. (By the way, this is Intel’s second shot at this and it is amazing that it’s following a similar path to the one IBM started so many years ago.) The Evolution of the Modular Computer The concept for the modular computer was initially founded to correct a serious consumer problem. Processors, storage and memory were very expensive and users were being forced to buy it two or three times for their smartphones (which were just starting to gain traction), laptop/Windows tablet, and/or desktop computer. If you could create a module that had these core elements, the user would only have to buy one set and then basically plug the module that contained this technology into a smartphone, tablet, laptop or dock to get the function of multiple devices without having to buy the redundant components. In addition, sync wasn’t available back then, wireless technology sucked, and we didn’t even know what “the cloud” was, so this also solved the problem of being able to get to your stuff while mobile. A lot of discussion surrounded whether the module should have a screen and some functionality or not, and it was decided not to include it because these aspects created problems for other applications like laptops, tablets, and even PCs, which had their own screens. The Problems That Killed Modular A number of problems killed the effort. First, prices for processors, memory and storage started to drop quickly, making redundancy less of a problem. The market developed syncing applications, and wireless got better, so keeping your stuff with you on a variety of devices got a ton easier. Intel’s technology wasn’t mobile enough back then, and Transmeta largely went out of business. Given the low runs for the core compute module and all of the accessories, the resulting cost was higher than buying a better-performing multi-device solution. Oh, and the size of the computing module was simply too big, resulting in tablets and smartphones that looked stupid. I was approached to be CEO of one of the efforts related to it back then. I turned down the opportunity because I was convinced the technology wasn’t ready and that it would take a company like Intel or Microsoft to create the core technology and the ecosystem that would make this work, not to mention fund the effort enough to get it to critical mass. Intel’s Compute Card Boy, what a difference a couple of decades make. Intel has aggressively made its technology more portable, resulting in a core module that is the size of a small stack of business cards. Prices have come down sharply, which should keep this module affordable, and it is thin enough to go into a laptop or tablet carrier without the resulting combination being too ugly. While sync and wireless connectivity are common, so are concerns surrounding wireless security, often making it safer to move the files physically rather than electronically for some industries. And finally, and most recently, concerns about laptops being turned into bombs have resulted in an effort to ban them on planes. Renting an approved laptop in an airport for the flight might be a possibility, but the security concerns would be daunting, plus you’d need a configuration that didn’t have a battery (and would be able to live off the power available at the seat). Renting a shell that would use your module would likely be far safer, for the airline and your data, resulting in a very timely alternative to carrying a laptop or tablet on a long flight. At some point, particularly in first class, the airline might provide a dock and a screen so the experience could become even more convenient. Wrapping Up:  The Improved Modular Idea The old IBM idea of a modular computer had a number of critical faults. Over time, one by one, those faults have been corrected and the Intel Compute Card is the impressive result. Still, to fully reach potential, it needs a unique mass market use (like being the only way to safely bring a laptop onto a plane), and an eco-system that fleshes out the offering (and Intel remains one of the few companies that can even do that). In the short term, this could be an ideal way to address some security needs, provide an imbedded computer with prices at scale across a variety of machines that need PC functionality, or have a home PC that can be easily moved from room to room (dock to dock). Not to mention that this might be a good solution for small kids on computers, where the module could be locked up during times when the little darlings aren’t supervised. In the end, I like that someone is still trying to make this work.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Old and Busted: Trump Doesn’t Get Daily Intel Briefs. New Hotness: Trump Spends Too Much Time on Intel Briefs. Posted at 3:30 pm on May 31, 2017 by streiff Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Let’s take a quick trip back to December. Trump had been president elect for about a month and a half and Politico and its fellow travelers were on a tear about Donald Trump not getting daily intelligence briefings. Take this from USA Today as a sampling: Donald Trump’s reluctance to receive daily intelligence briefings — and his blunt rejection of the CIA’s assessment of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election — suggest a rocky start to the president-elect’s relationship with intelligence agencies. Since the election, Trump has received the President’s Daily Briefing only four times, amid meetings with potential Cabinet secretaries and other transition business. And on Sunday, the president-elect suggested that the rate of briefings won’t change once he’s sworn in next month. As I pointed out at the time, there is no tradition of a president taking the Presidential Daily Briefing in person: Democrats Are Flip-Flopping Like A Landed Fish On Russia And Trump’s Intelligence Briefings. Now we are onto the newest criticism. President Trump consumes classified intelligence like he does most everything else in life: ravenously and impatiently, eager to ingest glinting nuggets but often indifferent to subtleties. Most mornings, often at 10:30, sometimes earlier, Trump sits behind the historic Resolute desk and, with a fresh Diet Coke fizzing and papers piled high, receives top-secret updates on the world’s hot spots. The president interrupts his briefers with questions but also with random asides. He asks that the top brass of the intelligence community be present, and he demands brevity. … Yet there are signs that the president may not be retaining all the intelligence he is presented, fully absorbing its nuance, or respecting the sensitivities of the information and how it was gathered. Of course he isn’t retaining it or absorbing its essence. He’s an idiot, right? As president, Trump now takes briefings nearly every day. In a White House with few steadying mechanisms — and one led by a Washington neophyte who bristles at structure and protocol — the daily intelligence briefing is the rare constant. The sessions often run past their scheduled time, stretching for 30 or 45 minutes, prompting Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to pop into the Oval Office to cut off the discussion: “Mr. President, we’ve got people backing up outside. … Still, Trump tells advisers that he values his daily briefings. Though career intelligence analysts often take the lead in delivering them, Trump likes his political appointees — Pompeo and Coats — to attend, along with national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Pompeo and Coats, whose offices are in McLean, Va., have had to redesign their daily routines so that they spend many mornings at the White House. Vice President Pence usually attends, while other administration principals join depending on the topic of the day, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Senior members of the West Wing staff sometimes float in and out of the Oval Office during the briefings.” I’m really sure Trump spending a lot of time on the Presidential Daily Brief, and taking regularly, and asking questions, and having his national security team sit in with him is just another sign that Trump has no interest in the job and is an incompetent boob. What other explanation could there be? In fact, the only thing worse than him taking the briefings and paying attention is him not taking the briefings and not paying attention.

And so far the signs are very promising indeed. We've been keenly following the crowdfunded, community-developed Eve V convertible tablet since the first specs and images emerged late last year, and now it's hands-on time! The Finnish company was present at the Microsoft booth at Computex 2017 today, showing off their creation alongside more established brands. (Microsoft, among Intel and others, is one of the company's backers.) Like a Surface Pro, but with more ports, a speccier base model and a disruptive price. To answer a few likely questions upfront: Yep, this thing looks and feels a lot like a Surface Pro. But it also has its own distinctive identity, with sturdy build quality, and a near perfect balance between size and weight. It hits all the important spec targets, as we've known for a while, and the addition of extra ports and features (compared to Microsoft's latest convertible) doesn't seem to have come with any unwanted side-effects. So if you're after a Surface-alike that's a little bit qurirky, with improved connectivity — USB-Type C, Thunderbolt 3, and a microSD reader — then look no further. The pricing of a maxed-out V hasn't been confirmed yet, but the base model starts at $799, for specs that outpace the Surface Pro, and the manufacturer seems enthusiastic about the halo effect of Surface comparisons. It's "flattering," that consumers might see the V and mistake it for Microsoft's tablet, CFO Tuukka Korhonen told me. Despite its associaton with big names like Microsoft and Intel, Eve still sees itself as a disruptor, and its focus on developing products with its community isn't unlike what OnePlus has tried to achieve in the Android phone world. (It's also a tactic that's been attempted by many less successful crowdfunding hopefuls.) Eve has already succeeded where many other crowdfunding hopefuls have fallen by the wayside. The tablet is built around a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD with 2736 x 1824 resolution, which looks gorgeous, and easily visible under the bright floodlights of the Microsoft booth. (We didn't get to try it under the bright Taipei sunshine, but a rated brightness of 450 nits bodes well for daylight visibility all the same.) There's just enough bezel to hold onto, without making the device appear clunky. The metal body has a subtle matte texture, and feels sturdy in the hand. And the angled side walls serve much the same purpose as the Sufrace Pro's, helping with grip and providing a home for all your ports. That includes the power key, with integrated one-touch fingerprint scanner for Windows Hello. Around the back, there's a Surface-like hinge, which was apparently a major focus of engineering effort throughout development, as Eve worked to get it feeling just right while avoiding any issues with wear and tear. From a layman's point of view, I can say that the hinge does its job, strikes a nice balance between stiffness and ease of motion whether the device is in laptop or tablet mode. The base model Eve V out-specs the Surface Pro at the same price point. Powering the whole assembly are seventh-generation Intel chips — Core M3, i5 or i7 — along with 8GB of 16GB of RAM, and 128, 256 and 512GB storage options. There's also an ample 48 Wh battery, which we're told is good for a full day of use. (The 10-12 hour rating naturally depends on what you're using it for.) Eve's branding is subtle, almost to a fault. You'd easily miss the "V" logo around the back (dark gray on black), and the front panel is completely featureless. The more playful additions can be found on the keyboard backlit, Alcantara-clad keyboard, which connects over Bluetooth and charges over pogo pin connectors. The V key is replaced with a V logo (pressing Fn + V will change your backlighting color, for what it's worth), and backspace becomes "Oops." Because why not? Backspace becomes 'Oops.' It all plays into V's brand image as a disruptive influence — a product developed, publicly, with the people who are going to be using it. And as such, Eve is free to drop in whimsical hardware quirks like this. The keyboard itself is somewhat thicker than the Surface Pro's, but it equally doesn't feel excessively bulky, and stays put just as well as any magnetically attached tablet cover. Other notables include stylus support with Windows Ink certification — the V has its own pen, but also works flawlessly with Microsoft Surface Pen and Surface Dial, CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis told me. And on the audio side, quad speakers (they get pretty loud, but these things are hard to judge in a trade show environment) are backed up by a 1-amp 3.5mm headphone jack. It's going to take longer than just a half-hour or so with the Eve V to judge its overall success, or otherwise. But the first impressions are very positive. The company appears to have the fundamentals down — everything works, looks good, and the only giveaway that this is the product of a crowdfunded startup are the splashes of branding about the place. There's no shortage of Surface clones right now, but the Eve V is one we're eager to see more of in the months ahead. Reader comments Eve V hands-on: Quirky crowd convertible 46 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating DeepHeet On driver support the Eve team chose only branded components from vendors with good driver support e.g. Intel SSD, Realtec audio. I'm a hyper early backer and really looking forward to getting my V in June. The devices have been through 3 rounds of prototype testing by 20+ community members to iron out as many bugs as possible. On performance while the V has a 7th Gen Core i Y series CPU performance tests by the community have shown comparable performance to the equivalent 6th Gen Core I U series due to less CPU throttling. Eve Tech are finalising the support model, but there will be coverage for warranty and repairs (possibly similar to the Surface send in model). Not to forget there is a passionate community behind Eve V who will likely provide better and faster support than most larger tech companies. Eve tech keep prices low by cutting out the middle men. Direct orders and shipping direct from the factory. This model might not work for everyone, particularly those who want to see the device before purchasing. Again here the community might provide the answer. There have already been several meet ups to show off prototypes to community members. With 2000+ baxxckers around the world you will probably find a community member near by who is happy to organise a meet up for interested parties. Just join the community and post. 1 4 days ago Reply Mr J Christie CNET says this device outperforms the new surface device in every aspect. Correction " SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS", both the Surface Pro and all the rest and at a significant reduction in Price, which anyone loves. JC 1 4 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Literally the only area it doesn't is in the pen area. The Surface Pro is a few ms faster with pen input and has more pressure levels, neither of which i think will really affect me. Sounds like the V will be getting pen tilt support so that part is on even ground. 0 4 days ago Reply Justinian84 There is no way this outperforms the new Surface Pro in any way. Y-series processors, thicker/unknown weight, worse quality trackpad (that's Synaptics for you) and MUCH worse pen are the confirmed standout aspects. Other aspects I have doubts about include likely lower quality screen, lower quality build, lower quality hinge, lower quality keyboard and finish (seems to be quite a fingerprint magnet like the 1st gen Surfrace Pros). I think it's a wonderful product, and I fully support these guys, but comparing a startup's first device with the fruit of years of experience and resources of the Surface Team is a little unrealistic.   0 3 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Weight is known (It's just over 100grams heavier than the SP4 due mainly to the bigger battery and the slightly heavier built keyboard), the trackpad is a Precision Touchpad, and the pen is the same as the SP4 but is more accurate on the V than the SP4 pen is. As well, the V should support the new tilt feature as well as the added pressure levels, leading to the end result that if all of this holds true, the V will be every bit as good as the Surface Pro in the pen department EXCEPT for the response time improvements on the SP, which mean different things for different people, personally, I didn't have an issue with the SP4 response times, and when you're running CPU intensive software, you won't be getting that low latency anyways. The screen is optically bonded Gorilla Glass 4 with a new anti-reflective coating not found on competing devices. Hinge is sourced from the same manufacturer who made SP4 hinge. Keyboard has color-customizable backlighting, can work over Bluetooth without being docked, and can support up to three Bluetooth devices with the press of a button. The Y-series processors will be TDP adjustable and the device works with eGPU due to the Thunderbolt 3 port. I'm not saying that the V is better than the Surface Pro in every way, but there is some attention to detail and uncompromising standards being shown here that mega-companies with set deadlines and huge profit margins to make simply cannot compete with. Keep in mind, too, that the review model is actually a DVT3 hand-assembled prototype, which is not completely representative of the final product, especially in build quality. Also, Eve has been at this for several years now, with their first device being the Eve T1 a couple of years ago. 0 3 days ago Reply digitaldd if there is an 8GB RAM/128GB storage version with an m5 or i5 for say $900 I'd be intrigued. 0 4 days ago Reply iKirin Hi DigitalDD! :) Our "smallest" configuration is featuring the Core M3/8GB/128GB SSD so that should hit the mark for you ;) 2 4 days ago Reply DavidinCT Something to watch out for....basic same design (look), better specs for the dollar ?  Sounds like a win to me 0 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina Running the rebranded m5/m7 is not better specs for the dollar. The much demanded TB3 would be useless on a Y series chip. 0 4 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Wrong. It's already been tested by prototype testers. An eGPU works great on the V through TB3, that's one of the reasons it was included in the device. 1 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina Thermally stressing a Y-series chip with programs needing an eGPU... Yeah, recipe for long processor life. -1 4 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Not as big of an issue as you think. Case in point, I've been running an AMD FX 4130 OC'd to 4.2 GHz on almost 24/7 runtime with an hour or two or more of hard gaming every day since mid 2014. Thing is, these processors are designed to handle heat and if they get too hot thermal limiting kicks in. It's a lot harder to burn out a CPU than it used to be. 0 4 days ago Reply ScubaDog No kidding.  My interest in this device over the latest Surface Pro really is gaining headway.  I just can't help the nagging feeling, though, that there's a gotcha waiting to be found.  It doesn't really bother me that this doesn't support the pen sensitivity that the new SP does--I currently have the SP3 and the pen is fine even now. One thing that does concern me is the fact that the keyboard is Bluetooth.  I know some would call this a plus, but it's one more thing that has a battery that can lose ability to hold a charge over time.  I guess if I never plan to have it separated from the tablet while I'm using the keyboard this won't matter, but.... Bottom line, I'm anxious to see more substantial reviews of it and am curious about when it will be available and through what avenues.  If I'm going to off on replacing my SP3 (which still works awesome, so no real hurry), I want to make sure I'm going with the best value. 3 4 days ago Reply Cyril Richard Well, for the keyboard, as you said yourself the Bluetooth is to be considered simply as an added benefit. If you want to use it plugged only, you can. And if from time to time you need to use it with the tablet a meter away (tablet on table and keyboard on your lap maybe?) or to use it with another device (your smartphone maybe?)...you can. And you're likely to have the keyboard with you often since it comes with the tablet. I'm currently seriously considering the Surface Pro but I clearly want to wait until reviews of both the Surface and Eve V are available. I also want to know the final price of the V + keyboard + pen. What drags me a bit to the Surface is all the comments that we can read that insist that any Surface device has that little "something" that makes you just want to use it. I've never owned a Surface device so I'm curious to check by myself. But if battery life of EVE is on par or better than Surface Pro and price is lower...I might go for it. 0 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina With a Y series (rebranded m) versus and actual U series iCore. 3 4 days ago Reply Cyril Richard True, but for my use which is pretty casual (with no gaming at all), I'm pretty sure an i5-Y is enough or more than enough. If I suddenly launch many tabs and/or many programs at the same time, the burst should provide enough power for that limited time. I'm mostly using the web browser, quite a lot of store apps, and a few x86 programs including office. 1 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina That's my point, Y series chips are perfect for that use, but TB3 is wasted in that scenario. A TB3 use scenario (I.e. EGPU) would stress a Y-series chip 2 4 days ago Reply Cyril Richard Good to know it's perfect for this use! Not that I was worried but a confirmation is always helpful 0 4 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes For me, that little something is the same thing that attracted me to Eve. For example, a few weeks ago it was discovered during artificial aging tests that the V's screen could develop yellow spots over time. This is an issue that happens with Surface Pros, iPhones, you name it, all the "high end" big-name manufacturers have this issue on some devices. But Eve returned the screens to the supplier and went with a different screen supplier to eliminate the issue. We're still waiting to hear whether the new supplier has really fixed the issue. Another "little something", each V purchased as an "early bird" is going to have it's display individually professionally color-calibrated to IIRC 102% sRGB (or similar). I could go on and on, the ability to adjust the processor TDP up to a higher value (which doesn't throttle the device because of the custom engineered heatsink), the ability to connect the keyboard by Bluetooth to three separate devices with the push of a button, etc. These guys appear to be the real deal, which is why I've backed them since February 2016 and have an m3 model on preorder. So excited! 😃 2 4 days ago Reply atulk malhotra I remember Eve prices being an instant put off for many. 0 4 days ago Reply gerzhwin Will the keyboard be turned off when disconnected? 1 4 days ago Reply Paul Gorski The keyboard can be paired with other devices.  I believe it can be switched off. 0 4 days ago Reply BryanMahendra Last-time I checked on their forums, the Keyboard is pogo-pin Surface and has the Bluetooth 4.1 capabilities to pair to devices (w/ a small battery-inside). So yeah, it's a nifty feature above MS/iPad Pro; you could connect to the Tablet like it would (say you are drawing and need to type from afar.) or hook it up to your phone. 0 3 days ago Reply Zachary Boddy I'd still prefer a Surface Pro just for the design and untouchable Pen experience but this seems very promising. I hope they do well. 4 4 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer This doesn't "outspec" the Surface Pro, it's using Y series processors, which alone was a deal breaker for me. Regardless, good to see more options for consumers, still waiting for something that's not gimped compared to the Surface Pro, just with an added Thunderbolt 3 port... 3 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina I doubt anyone would be using the TB3 to any significant advantage with an m3, so I doubt it will be a big deal for the renamed m5/m7 (which in essence is what the Y chips are). 4 4 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer The Surface Pro isn't using only Y-series processors though, and such port will be very handy on the i5U/i7U variants... 2 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina Whole different issue, expect those next year, now that intel has seen the writing on the wall. 0 4 days ago Reply Drael646464 Bezels almost look too small.  -1 4 days ago Reply Sunstorming Indiegogo = fail -4 4 days ago Reply CronXPX Powering the whole assembly are seventh-generation Intel chips — Core M3, i5 or i7 I think it's important to note those are Y-series chips: m3-7Y 30 / i5-7Y54 / i7-7Y75. 11 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina Which means you will take a serious battery hit on the i5/i7 if it has to go into turbo mode to match the U models. 1 4 days ago Reply ScubaDog I don't believe that difference is going to matter much to most potential customers, to be fair. 2 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina I don't believe TB3 or USB-C will matter to many either. But I do think that as average users push that m class chip to turbo over and over and their battery life is more like 6-8 hours they will notice. 4 4 days ago Reply BryanMahendra Dude... We've been doing the CPU-limit trick (capping at 99%, so it won't go Turbo) for the SP4 i5/i7 for years to manage the maximum 7 hours batery life (usual 5.5 hours if the user doesn't know). Basically the Eve V is the "7th Core-M/Y Model of the SP4 that Microsoft won't bump the Storage/RAM above 128/4gb... with TB3 USB-C/2A ports and 48Wh battery.' I checked the Indiegogo pricing, the i5/256/8Gb is $1000-1100 & the max i7/512/16Gb is $ 1399-1500 (w/without tax-shipment).

The technology to enable true 4K has been around for years, but as is often the case, it takes a while for the tech to filter through and become more affordable. That's where we're at right now. Today, 4K TVs are common and so are 4K PC monitors, and we're getting more and more ultra HD (UHD) content to use with these displays. But a display isn't any use without something to actually push that 4K content to it. Thankfully, that doesn't require a high-end gaming PC. There's a pretty wide range of PCs that can push 4K video output, from the very big to the very small. And in the case of a mini PC, you're looking at a good option for a living-room-based Home Theater PC (HTPC). How can you tell if a mini PC supports 4K? It shouldn't be too difficult to figure out whether your mini PC is capable of outputting 4K video. From a processor perspective, Intel added support for it into much of its lineup of Core i chips, and now even the lower-powered Atom processors can support 4K. The best place to check many different aspects of specific processors is Intel's reference guide. Check out which processors support 4K video at Intel When it comes to Atom processors, as far back as 2015 with the Cherry Trail x7, Intel was talking about 4K video output at 30 frames per second (FPS) in the H.265 codec, or 60 FPS in H.264. The generations-old Surface 3 has a processor capable of outputting 4K video, for example. Even the less powerful x5 can do 4K video, albeit in a more limited way than the x7. Taking a $100 mini PC as an example, with Intel HD 400 graphics you should still get 4K output at 30 FPS. To look more specifically at Intel graphics and its capability, check out the link below. When you're looking at any product it should always have an accompanying spec on which version of Intel graphics you'll get. Intel graphics specifications Why does any of this matter? If you're not concerned about 4K, it doesn't. Here's the thing: The HTPC isn't a new concept, but in years past folks have had fairly large (read the size of a VCR, remember those?!) boxes beneath their TVs to house them. How to turn your mini PC into a monster media center But even without Windows Media Center, a Windows 10 PC is a great thing to use to control your home media. And even if you don't yet care about 4K content, you probably will in the future. Netflix already delivers 4K video through Microsoft Edge, and Amazon has UHD content available. This trend will only increase. Perhaps best of all is that for not a lot of money you can get yourself a little PC that can handle all of the 4K video. Make the right choice now, and you'll have a highly capable home entertainment center that'll last for years.

I am near-sighted as well but wear inexpensive contact lenses and use a 4K tv for my computer. Trust me, on a 50" screen 4K makes a difference even for near-sighted individuals.

Along with the bat sensor, Intel has designed a Falcon 8 Drone, which will be equipped with HD and infrared cameras for advanced pitch analysis ahead of the matches. Former England skipper Naseer Hussain heaped praise for the invention and said that the batsmen like Jason Roy, who struggling with their current form with the bat, might gain from the new system. “Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say ‘Is everything I’m doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?’ and if you know it was, you know that’s not the issue,” Nasser said. Ahead of their match against the Mashrafe Mortaza-led Bangladesh side, it was confirmed that Alex Hales, all-rounder Ben Stokes and Roy will be among the players to use the newly invented technology. ICC CEO David Richardson believes the innovation Intel is bringing in will transform viewers experience. “We couldn’t be more excited to have Intel as our ‘Official Innovation Partner’ of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort. That’s all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology.” Richardson added in a statement. Sandra Lopez, the Vice-President of the Intel Sports Group, said that “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports.” Meanwhile, the images caught by the drone will be offering rich visual data which will be used to generate pitch reports. It will also allow the fans to experience what it actually feels like to face the world’s best bowlers.

The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, is a member of a Turkish economic-relations board run by an appointee of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Flynn's firm was tasked with lobbying the US government to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup and, more generally, fomenting dissent inside Turkey. Alptekin paid the Flynn Intel Group over $500,000 to produce a documentary about the dangers of Gulen, which he had hoped would be "a small, '60 Minutes' kind of a thing, where these conclusions are brought to the public," he told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. "We thought that might have a good effect." The former Vice News correspondent who was hired to work on the documentary, David Enders, told the Journal that he had been instructed to conceal Flynn Intel Group's involvement in producing the film. "'We don’t want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this,'" Enders recalled the head of the firm, Bijan Kian, telling him at the time. He told the Journal that Kian asked him to hide the film equipment from the staff of the hotel they were doing interviews in. "It was very hush-hush," Enders told the Journal. "They were like Keystone Kops." Ultimately, the film was never finished. Neither Enders nor Kian responded to request for additional comment.  Flynn raised eyebrows when he wrote an op-ed article for The Hill, published November 8, alleging that Gulen helmed a "vast global network" that "has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network." Flynn's op-ed seemed out of place amid his work with the Trump campaign. His work for Inovo did not come to light until after he registered as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice in March — four months after his contract with Alptekin ended. In his FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) filing, Flynn acknowledged that his firm had conducted research for Inovo that "focused on" Gulen. But it may have gone further than that: Flynn met with Turkish government ministers in September, where he reportedly discussed removing Gulen from US soil, according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, who was at the meeting.  Price Floyd, a former spokesman for Flynn, strongly denied that such a discussion ever took place, telling Business Insider at the time that Flynn was contracted by Inovo, in part, "to gather information on Gulen and turn it over to legal authorities to take action." Alptekin did not respond to request for comment. But he told The Associated Press earlier this year that he did not agree with Flynn's decision to register as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice for his work with Inovo. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government," Alpetkin said.  Still, Flynn said in his filing with the DOJ that his work for Inovo "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey."  Join the conversation about this story » NOW WATCH: Watch as Democrats break out in song as the AHCA passes the House See Also: The Trump-Russia controversy may put 'wartime consigliere' Steve Bannon back in the spotlight 'Melania needs to get with the program’: Ian Bremmer explains the biggest takeaways from Trump’s first foreign trip The FBI just declined the House oversight committee's request for Comey's memos SEE ALSO: 'None of it makes much sense': Experts are baffled by Comey's use of a fake Russian document to skirt the DOJ Top Stories Smouldering Port Arthur silo ruptures, collapses Cat population multiplying fast in urban areas TX firefighters stand for fallen co-worker's son Mugshot: Felon flees BPD officers FDA: Tuna sold to local eatery could be tainted Community seeks answers, closure following principal's death SO: Drugs, guns and $13K seized from Nederland apartment BPD: Can you ID men that robbed clerk at gunpoint?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 3 Best PC Stocks to Buy in 2017 Contrary to predictions, the PC market is far from dead, which translates to opportunities for investors. Tim Brugger (timbrugger) May 31, 2017 at 1:00PM The negativity surrounding the PC market has been around for years now. With the advent of smartphones and other mobile devices, PCs were supposedly on their way to the junk pile. As it turns out, PCs are not only alive and well, but the market is growing. Bucking the anti-PC naysayers has opened the door to great opportunities for investors. The generally dour mood surrounding personal computers means stocks including HP (NYSE:HPQ), OS king Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and chip behemoth Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are all not only experiencing top- and bottom-line growth, they are significantly undervalued. HP's new OMEN computer. Image source: HP. Not your parents PC manufacturer According to IDC, for the first time in five years, PC sales actually climbed to kick off the year, albeit by a mere 0.6%. One of the primary drivers of the PC market turnaround was none other than HP. Given the last several quarters of growth, not surprisingly, HP took over the top spot as the world's No. 1 PC manufacturer, a designation long held by China-based Lenovo. HP shipped 13.1 million units in the first quarter, good for an astounding 13.1% jump year over year and a 21.8% share of the global marketplace. Personal Systems revenue, home to HP's PC sales, climbed 10% last quarter to $7.66 billion: Not bad for a "dying" market. What makes HP's sales results even more encouraging is how the company is executing its PC strategy. Targeting specific niche markets -- HP's OMEN virtual reality-ready PC is an ideal example -- helped drive a whopping 17% increase in notebook sales in the fiscal second quarter. Toss in a 2.8% dividend yield along with its strong PC and improving printing sales, and HP is an undervalued stock by almost any measure. Windows is still king There was some consternation among investors following Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings release on April 27. The "missed" expectations seemed to be the primary story, which is good news for investors in that its stock has remained a relative value despite the strength of its Windows operating system (OS) dominance, forays into the cloud, and market-leading productivity product lineup. Microsoft's Personal Computing division recorded a 7% decline in revenue, to $8.8 billion. But remove the 26% drop in Surface sales, and Microsoft's computing unit tells a different story. Largely thanks to Microsoft's 90%-plus OS market dominance and its industry-leading $15.2 billion annual cloud revenue run rate, Windows has helped boost virtually every PC-related offering in its arsenal. Last quarter, Windows revenue climbed 5%, which helped boost Microsoft's commercial Office 365 sales 45% and drove an astounding 81% increase in Dynamics 365 revenue: Most hosted on the Azure cloud platform, which soared 93% year over year. And like HP, Microsoft also pays shareholders a solid 2.25% dividend yield. What's not to love? Intel is another PC stock that suffers from the PC malaise still prevalent despite the market's strength. After reporting an 8% increase in revenue last quarter to a record-breaking $14.8 billion, Intel's stock declined 3.4% the following day. The problem? Intel's strong PC-related sales were viewed by some as more of an aberration than what it was: Yet another sign that there's a place in this world for computers. Much like HP and its push into the fast-growing 3D printing market and Microsoft's cloud leadership position, Intel is also expanding beyond PCs into data centers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and memory solutions. In addition to the 6% increase in computing revenue last quarter, to $8 billion, Intel's data center sales of $4.2 billion were a 6% improvement, IoT was up 11%, and memory solutions revenue skyrocketed 55% to $866 million. Also lost in the PC hoopla last quarter was the fact that even considering Intel's forays into markets beyond its core computing segment, its operating expenses declined, which, combined with its top-line growth, boosted per-share earnings 45% to $0.61. With its 3% dividend and a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of a meager 12.7, Intel also warrants a spot on a list of PC stocks to buy in 2017.

Michael Flynn previously declined the Senate intelligence committee’s subpoena and invoked his Fifth Amendment protection.  (CHRIS KLEPONIS / AFP / GETTY IMAGES)   By Chad Day And Jake PearsonThe Associated Press Wed., May 31, 2017 WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn’s decision Tuesday came as U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia’s attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn’s co-operation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump Article Continued Below Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn’s attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. U.S. President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn invoked the fifth amendment on May 22, rebuffing a subpoena in the investigation into Russia's election meddling. (The Associated Press) In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn’s businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn’s paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $44,500 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin.

Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn’s private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin’s Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are “fiction” invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. “I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” Cohen said. “I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.” Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen’s ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen’s business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting.

Timing Now, be aware that AMD’s part is expected in a few weeks, while Intel’s is due more towards the end of the year, making Intel’s launch more of a paper launch at the moment.  Still, this is designed to stall the market so that people wait to buy until they see Intel’s part tested.  However, the issue with the timing is that kids in school often have summers off and that is when they’d likely prefer to build a new computer or buy one and have it to play games.  AMD’s Threadripper, I love that name, should arrive late, but within the window, while Intel’s i9 will arrive later in the year.   You can’t expect people to wait for something better when they want to game now, particularly when you are talking about young adults who are known for thinking tactically and needing instant gratification.  Consuming Cores About a decade ago, Intel sent me an 8-core machine and, as I worked and played games, I would bring up the performance monitor to find that I rarely lit up 3 cores let alone anything over 6.  But apparently a lot has changed because I’m writing this on an 8 core i7 and all 8 cores are almost constantly lit up and running at about 30 percent to 50 percent capacity. Plus, when I play a current generation strategy game, I can often peg the cores, suggesting that now I can actually use more than 8 even in what I’m doing.  However, the folks that will really like this extra headroom are those that work with visual tools, such as photo editors, video editors, 3D creation, Computer Aided Design, engineering, or graphic arts.   You and I may like the cores but folks using those tools need them.   Core Wars AMD launched with 16, and Intel countered with 18, but AMD also launched a 32 Core processor (named Epyc) for enterprises, suggesting they have a ton more potential core headroom to match and possibly raise Intel by year end when the i9 actually ships. So, this fight is far from over and we are likely to see a return to something similar to the MHz wars of the 1990s, but this time with cores instead of clock speed. 3D-Xpoint Now, there is a technology that plays on the periphery of this, and it is 3D-Xpoint memory.  Currently Intel has it, branded Optane, and AMD doesn’t, though they could get access through Micron, which shares rights to this technology with Intel.  This is the wild card that could be a king maker, but currently it is being used mostly to speed up drives, not replace them.  When it moves to an SSD replacement, AMD should be able to use it as well as Intel does, making it an important, but potentially fleeting, advantage depending on how it plays out.  Optane, 3D-Xpoint is substantially faster than flash, performing closer to DRAM, and the visible performance improvement it has showcased is impressive (though I have yet to use it myself).   Wrapping Up:  More Excitement to Come The core war thing is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to battle royals in the PC space.  This initial fight is on desktop computers but it will quickly move to laptops, and overlaying this will be another Battle Royal between AMD and NVIDIA over graphics technology.  AMD is also launching a new line of graphics cards and NVIDIA has been pumping up their cards at an incredible pace.   In a fight like this, the only people that truly win are us because from gaming, to VR, to actually getting work done that pays the bills, our next computer is likely to be incredible regardless of whose technology is in it!   Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Governmental Entities Bringing Financial Cybersecurity to Center Stage By: Special Guest    6/2/2017 By now, it's no secret that cybercriminals have targeted, and continue to target, the financial services industry with advanced attacks that are desig… Read More How Too Much Data Could Spell Trouble for Consumers By: Larry Alton    6/1/2017 For most intents and purposes, data is a good thing.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 01/06/2017: Uber's head of finance Gautam Gapta is set to leave the ride-hailing company in July. At the same time, the company's first-quarter losses have narrowed substantially to $708 million. Uber has confirmed with IT Pro that Gapta will leave in July. Gapta is set to join another startup in San Francisco, leaving Uber to suffer another executive departure. Uber has experienced a number of high profile departures in the last few months and now the company will be looking for a new official CFO as well as a COO to partner with CEO Travis Kalanick. Reuters reported that Uber's first-quarter losses narrowed substantially from the previous quarter. Uber declared a net loss of $708 million, excluding employee stock compensation and other items, in Q1 2017, down from $991 million in Q4 2016. Furthermore, Uber's first-quarter revenue rose 18% to $3.4 billion. An Uber spokesperson said to Reuters: "The narrowing of our losses in the first quarter puts us on a good trajectory towards profitability". Since Uber is a private company, it does not report its financial results publicly but does confirm figures reported in the media. Yesterday, it came to light that Uber had fired Anthony Levandowski amid the legal battle with Waymo. Levandowski had refused to cooperate with the investigation in which Waymo claimed that the engineer had stolen thousands of documents from the company relating to self-driving vehicle technology. 31/05/2017: Uber has fired Anthony Levandowski after the engineer failed to cooperate in the ongoing lawsuit with Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Uber general counsel Salle Yoo outlined in Levandowski's termination letter, dated 26 May, that his failure to comply with a court order is the reason for his firing. In the letter Yoo also wrote that "your failure impeded Uber's internal investigation and defense of the lawsuit". A federal judge in the ongoing court case between Uber and Alphabet's self-driving car firm, Waymo, granted a preliminary injunction against Uber on 12 May that led the ride-hailing firm to remove Levandowski from any work on Lidar, and to return any stolen documents to Waymo. Levandowski is accused of downloading 14,000 confidential files before leaving Google's self-driving division in 2016. He went on to start his own self-driving truck company called Otto, which Uber bought in August 2016, six months after he had left his previous employer. Yoo goes on to underline that Uber required the engineer to have "destroyed all property and confidential information belonging to any prior employer" and by not complying with the court order it's a potential breach and warranty in the employment agreement and an "additional ground for termination". Levandowski invoked the fifth amendment in order to not to incriminate himself and refused to hand over documents or answer questions during a deposition. Uber has insisted its technology is different to Waymo's and there is no evidence it has the stolen files on its servers, although it did not check Lewandowski's computer in its search. 19/05/2017: Uber has reportedly threatened to fire Anthony Levandowski amidst a potentially damaging court case involving the possible theft of a rival's trade secrets. The ride-sharing firm is currently embroiled in a legal battle which centers around Levandowski's departure from Waymo, Google's autonomous vehicle division. Waymo claims that when he left the company, Levandowski also exfiltrated over 14,000 documents containing trade secrets which Uber subsequently benefitted from. Levandowski, while not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has been barred by presiding Judge William Alsup from working on Lidar technology - the technology covered by the allegedly stolen documents. Waymo also wanted to block Uber's driverless car research altogether, but this request was not granted. Alsup has, however, referred the case to criminal prosecutors, which could spell trouble for the company. "Waymo has supplied a compelling record that Levandowski pilfered over 14,000 files from Waymo, and that Uber knew or should have known as much when it brought him on board," Alsup wrote. Throughout the case, Levandowski has made use of his fifth-amendment right to not incriminate himself, and has thus far refused to testify. Now, however, Uber's lawyers have handed him an ultimatum. According to Levandowski's lawyers, Uber's general counsel Salle Yoo told the executive in a letter that he was expected to either deny the charges, or to hand over the purloined files immediately. If he does not, the letter states, the company will take "adverse employment action" against him, which may result in his termination from the company. Referring to the Judge's order to do everything it can to compel Levandowski to produce the documents, Yoo's letter apparently read: "Uber takes its obligations under the Order very seriously, intends to comply fully, and expects you to do the same". Levandowksi's lawyers, however, are arguing that this is unconstitutional. They claim that the court is giving Uber no choice but to fire him unless he violates his fifth-amendment rights. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's legal team wrote in the court filings. "Nearly fifty years of Supreme Court precedent forbid the government from putting an individual to such an unconstitutionally coercive choice," it said. "The Hobson's Choice that Mr. Levandowski now faces is a direct product of government action." 15/05/2017:  Waymo and Lyft are coming together to work on self-driving cars, in a bid to challenge rival Uber. The Google-owned autonomous vehicle firm will be partnering with Uber's main business rival in a non-exclusive deal that aims to bring driverless taxis to market before Uber. According to a Reuters source, talks on the deal began last summer. Uber has notably clashed with both companies. It is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Waymo after being accused of poaching one of its executives, who allegedly brought 14,000 confidential documents with him. Lyft has predominantly been exploring autonomous technology through partnerships, such as a $500 million investment deal with General Motors that will see the two companies work together on similar tech. Lyft says that this new agreement will not affect its relationship with GM. 12/05/2017: A US judge has called for an immediate investigation into the allegations of stolen trade secrets, which have surfaced during a court battle between Uber and Google over self-driving car technology. Google initially filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app in February, which alleged that former engineer Anthony Levandowksi downloaded 14,000 files without authorisation while working on its self-driving car research. Levandowski is said to have then left Google's Waymo to found his own startup, Otto, which was then later purchased by Uber for $680 million. Google claims that the documents travelled with him, which Uber then used to fast track its own autonomous vehicle research. US District Judge William Alsup stated in a ruling that the case "contains ample evidence" to merit an investigation, and has forwarded a recommendation to the US attorney "based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation". "The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney," the order states. Alsup also partially granted Google's bid to force an injunction against Uber's self-driving car unit, which if successful could determine the future of the company's operations in the technology. This ruling, which could be decided as early as tomorrow, has been made under temporary seal, so the exact scope of the injunction is unclear. The case has been complicated somewhat by Levandowski, who has invoked his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refuses to testify, leaving the two companies to fight it out in court. A spokesperson for Uber said in an email to IT Pro: "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum". The company also said it would not be commenting on the case referral to the US Attorney, but stated that the result of the partial preliminary injunction, currently under seal, would most likely be "status quo". Uber initially argued that Waymo's trade secret allegations should be held in private arbitration, however because Levandowski is not a defendant, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the proceedings behind closed doors, and as such was rejected by the judge. Uber doesn't dispute the claim that Levandowski stole the documents in question, but argues that trade secrets never made their way into the company's research, and that Google needs to prove that Uber "derived its knowledge from Levandowski". 28/04/2017: Uber self-driving car boss steps down amid Waymo lawsuit Uber's self-driving car chief has left his position after allegations that he stole critical research from his former employers at Waymo, Alphabet's own driverless car unit. Anthony Levandowski will continue to work for Uber, according to an internal memo published by Business Insider, but will no longer head up the company's Advanced Technologies Group or manage its work on autonomous vehicles. "Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," Levandowski wrote in an email to staff. "This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change." "This organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Levandowski's departure comes amid allegations from his former employers, Waymo. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company claims that when he left to join Uber, Levandowski took vital technology and information on the company's research and development efforts with him. For Uber's part, it claims that its work is "fundamentally different" to Waymo's and that Levandowski's role was focused on management rather than engineering. As part of the ongoing case, the presiding judge has asked the company to provide details of Levandowski's role, which could result in an injunction stopping Lewandowski from working on Uber's autonomous vehicle programme altogether. Uber declined to comment, but referred IT Pro to the email published by Business Insider. 26/04/2017: Leading US carmakers have petitioned the state of California to revise its proposed regulations on autonomous vehicle testing, stating that authorities ignored their earlier concerns that the rules would become too restrictive. Self-driving car manufacturers raised their objections at a public hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, the recording of which was seen by Reuters, saying that the planned additional regulations should be dropped, and that oversight should be handed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead. In the consultation, hosted via a webcast, automaker groups including the Association of Global Automakers described the proposed regulations as going "too far". The group also opposes California's plans to introduce a permit system, which would be required by all automakers wishing to test self-driving cars in the state. Ride-hailing firm Uber was driven out of San Francisco last year after it refused to apply for a permit to test its autonomous vehicle fleet. Automakers now believe requiring a permit is no longer an effective approach to regulating tests, and object to the proposal that the state could revoke permissions even if a company adheres to federal requirements. If the proposals were to be accepted, the automakers would be liable for any crashes that occur during the tests, even if they were not to blame. General Motors official Paul Hemmersbaugh said that regulations like these could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars". It could also see the introduction of a scheme that would ask automakers to submit a voluntary assessment to the NHTSA, outlining specific details of their self-driving vehicle systems. However, according to lawyers representing Google, Ford, and Uber, this would effectively be a mandatory clause. Other self-driving manufacturers, including Alphabet's Waymo and Ford, asked California to relax current regulations that restrict the testing of vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, which would include rides with multiple passengers. However safety advocates believe harsher regulations would ensure the public is kept safe from potential accidents. Group president for the Consumers for Auto Reliability, Rosemary Shahan, said: "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards." Alphabet's Ron Medford urged the state to quickly issue definitive guidelines "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need", although it is clear that lawmakers are still unsure how best to regulate the emerging technology. 24/04/2017: UK tech firms today received funding to test self-driving cars on Britain's roads, reaping the benefits of a recent government pledge to back the development of emerging technologies. Two consortiums have already secured backing as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a government commitment announced on Friday set to invest almost £5 billion into research and development over the next four years. Streetwise, a group led by Cambridge-based AI startup firm FiveAI, is currently working on a trial that will allow commuters to order self-driving cars using a mobile app. This will include the development of new insurance and safety protocols governing the use of the technology. The trial, which is set to launch in 2019, has received £12.8 million in government support and will be developed with input from Direct Line, Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, and the University of Oxford. "It's about delivering to the consumer an autonomous Uber-type service in London," said FiveAI CEO Stan Boland, speaking to the Telegraph. "It's insane for people to buy a car and the leave it parked for 94% of the time and only have one user per car, in the future vehicles can be shared." Driverless shuttle tests are already underway in Greenwich Driven, an initiative led by Oxbotica that has received £8.6 million in government funding, aims to develop self-driving technology over the course of a 30-month programme that started in April, aimed at linking London and Oxford with an autonomous shuttle. Commuters are able to test the technology today on the streets of Greenwich. Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith said: "Today’s news is truly ground-breaking. No company, group or consortium of autonomy experts has ever attempted what DRIVEN is planning over the next 30-months.We are seeking to address some of the most fundamental challenges preventing the future commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. I have full confidence in Driven’s world-leading and internationally respected team of specialists to deliver this project." Telefonica, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's R&D lab Race, UK domain registry firm Nominet, Oxford Robotics Institute, and Oxfordshire Council, will join Oxbotica in the consortium, as well as the Transport Research Laboratory, which is also supporting FiveAI. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is the latest government initiative to foster development of some emerging technology innovations, and offer alternate ways for commuters to travel to and from the capital. Speaking alongside the announcement, business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: "As part of our Plan for Britain this government wants to create a modern Industrial Strategy to support the key sectors of our economy and spread jobs, prosperity and opportunity around the whole country." "The funding I am announcing today, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support to develop the next generation of technologies across a range of sectors, shows our determination and commitment to making sure the UK remains at the very forefront of research and innovation." Picture courtesy of The Gateway Project 19/04/2017: Baidu to open its autonomous driving platform Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced it's to provide an open software platform beginning in July for the automotive and autonomous driving industry to help develop autonomous driving systems. Baidu stated it wants to "build a collaborative ecosystem, utilising its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to work together with other companies to promote the development and popularisation of autonomous driving technology". The initiative has been named Project Apollo after the US' lunar landing programme, as the company believes autonomous driving has the same potential to change the world as its namesake did. Apollo will include a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services. The company is planning to open source obstacle perception code and capabilities, trajectory planning, vehicle control, and vehicle operating systems, as well as testing tools. Baidu President and CEO Qi Lu said: "AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles." The company is also going to set up  alliances with partners "who will provide the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components, to achieve broad participation and collaboration and to provide references and recommendations to participants of a rapidly expanding ecosystem enabled by Project Apollo". It hopes that this will make it easier and more efficient to research and develop self driving car technology. Baidu will restrictively open its technology in July and then open it fully towards the end of the year. It also plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. 05/04/2017: A recent disengagement report from Alphabet's Waymo shows that the company's driverless cars are some of the most reliable in the self-driving industry. According to the report, Waymo's autonomous vehicles drove 635,868 cumulative miles over the past year and had 124 disengagements, which are defined as instances where a human needed to take over driving. This means that these vehicles only experienced roughly one disengagement every 5,128 miles. When compared to the competition, results indicated that Waymo's vehicles are significantly more reliable at this point. While Ford only reported three disengagements over the past year, their autonomous vehicles only traveled 590 cumulative miles - a fraction what Waymo's vehicles have completed. BMW didn't fare much better, reporting one disengagement over 638 miles. Despite Waymo's proven reliability, the self-driving company doesn't stack up to the rest of the competition in terms of overall progress. Navigant Research's leaderboard report on autonomous driving suggests that Waymo is ranked seventh on a list of top 10 vendors. BMW and Ford, whose disengagement reports fared worse results, both top Waymo on the list, with Ford considered the number one vendor. The report rated these self-driving industry players in ten categories: vision, go-to market strategy, partners, production strategy, technology, product capability, product quality and reliability, product portfolio, staying power, and sales, marketing and distribution. While the rankings show that Waymo features the most advanced technology, the report found that the company has no production capacity or production deals. 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project.

And Intel has made the good old PC easy to carry around, without suffering from any withdrawal symptoms.  CNET Here's a disruption in the personal computing space -- the Intel Compute Card -- which also happens to be one of the tiniest computer you’ll ever see. The Intel Compute Card transforms your PC into something you can place in your pocket and take with you on the go. Don’t be fooled by its credit card size, the Compute Card packs in quite a bit of processing power -- it has notebook-class Core i5s inside, despite its diminutive look.  First revealed at CES earlier this year, the Intel Compute Card will support a range of configurations with up to 4GB of RAM, 128GB of flash storage, along with built-in Wi-Fi 802.11 AC and Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless connectivity. What’s more, at the ongoing Computex 2017 technology expo, Intel showcased the Compute Card Device Design Kit, which will be sort of a blueprint for PC manufacturers to replicate and deliver exciting modular, flexible computing products to fully explore the capabilities of the Intel Compute Card. The Intel Compute Card is 95 mm long and 55 mm wide -- just larger than a credit card Intel also put forward a reference design for a tiny desktop PC shell, which comes with USB ports, HDMI, DisplayPort and Ethernet connectivity. Pop in the Compute Card into one of these PC cabinets and it becomes a full-fledged computer. Interested? Well, get ready to buy one of these Intel Compute Cards from August 2017 onwards.

But it turns out AMD’s high-end chip will one-up Intel’s in another way. The Core i9 Extreme Edition has 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Ryzen Threadripper chip has 64. We’ll probably need to wait a little while to know which chip offers better all-around performance, but the additional PCIe 3.0 lanes gives you more options for connecting high-performance graphics cards, storage solutions, or other peripherals.   AMD is also hinting that there won’t just be a single Threadripper chip. Instead, there will be multiple options, including models with “up to” 16 cores and 32 threads. But every version will have the same 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 4-channel DDR4 memory support, and X399 chipset. AMD says ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI all plan to launch Threadripper-compatible motherboards this summer. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

At the top of the Intel Core i9 lineup is the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor -- the first consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads.    RELATED STORIES Review: "Lenovo Yoga Book" Robots star of Taiwan tech fair Father of Android Andy Rubin unveils bezel-less Essential PH-1 smartphone Review: "Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+" Google AI beats master in ancient game of Go The company will begin selling chips with as many as 18 processing cores under a new Core i9 brand aimed at gamers. The world’s largest chipmaker said it’s reaffirming its commitment to providing the fastest PC chips available. Intel’s only competition in PC processors, Advanced Micro Devices, has demonstrated its new Ryzen product outperforming Intel chips. AMD is trying to muscle in on one of the few attractive parts of the PC market with new products the company began offering in the first quarter. Intel estimates that video game enthusiasts and others who are willing to pay for the best computer performance represent a market that will grow as much as 20% a year. That’s amid a total PC market that has shed more than 100 million units since it peaked in 2011, declining each year since then. Underlining just how profitable the high-end processor market can be, the top of Intel’s new range -- called the i9-7980XE -- will go on sale for $1,999 per chip. That’s more than most people will pay for their entire computer. Intel has maintained more than 80% market share and higher average selling prices in PC chips by consistently providing processors that outperform rival offerings. Its strength forced out competitors leaving only AMD, a company that hasn’t turned a profit in five years. But there are those who are still trying to crack Intel’s stronghold. ARM Holdings Plc., announced recently a new design of chips that targets the PC and server markets dominated by Intel. Apple is said to be working on a processor devoted specifically to artificial intelligence-related tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Intel tries to squash rival AMD with new high-end PC chips Review: "Lenovo Yoga Book" Robots star of Taiwan tech fair Father of Android Andy Rubin unveils bezel-less Essential PH-1 smartphone Microsoft unveils new Surface Pro to reverse declining sales Review: "Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+" Google AI beats master in ancient game of Go Market for pet wearables growing in China Vivo V5s: a slight improvement from Vivo's best-selling flagship model Apple plans laptop upgrades as Microsoft enters market    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

The current standard Z270 motherboard chipset is a "consumer" product, and the new X-series processors have a different pin layout, and are designed for a slightly more demanding customer with deeper pockets. The X299 isn't a huge upgrade over the Z270, but it's a major leap past the X99 boards, which hosted the last generation of Intel's most extreme chips. X299 chipsets support up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, compared to the paltry eight PCIe 2.0 lanes on X99. Paired with the new processors, you're looking at an embarrassment of I/O — you can load a system up with multi-gigabit Ethernet, a few GPUs, and a couple of M.2 SSDs, and still have headroom to spare for your USB 3.1 daisy chain, Thunderbolt, and a handful of SATA devices. Unfortunately, the fact that Intel is giving two fairly different CPUs (Skylake and Kaby Lake) the X-series treatment means not all X299 motherboards will be created equally. Depending on which CPU you pick, you'll have different amounts of I/O support, and different compatible RAM configurations. That means, depending on your chosen pairing, you can conceivably buy a motherboard with a lot of "features" that you can't make use of, or a CPU that's held back by the motherboard's limits. It sounds as if the whole reason Intel is even offering the lower-end Skylake chips is to let people get a fancy new X299 motherboard now, and upgrade the CPU when budget allows. But if that's the case, anyone with a competent Z270 system on their desk right now won't probably have much of a reason to sidegrade. As Anandtech writes: "This is arguably a big mess." Anyway, let's look at these motherboards! Image: Gigabyte Gigabyte's Auros Gaming series motherboards highlight something most of these systems have in common: some sort of M.2 cooling or monitoring to make sure your fastest SSD drives don't throttle down due to heat concerns. All three models in the series support up to three M.2 drives, which is a nice upgrade over the one or two slots you can expect on most Z270 boards. Because this series is all about gaming, Gigabyte also packed in a bunch of RGB fluff. Image: Asus Asus has an absurd seven different X299 motherboards right out of the gate. The top-end ROG Rampage VI supports four-way SLI, has a 10Gb Ethernet chipset, and 802.11ad Wi-Fi. There's also a little OLED display for peeking your stats. Image: MSI MSI's Gaming M7 ACK has dual Killer E2500 Ethernet controllers and Killer 1535 Wi-Fi which can all be combined into a single connection. EVGA has an overclocking-focused board called the X299 Dark, which supports four-way SLI and also includes dedicated M.2 cooling. There's also triple BIOS support, which is amazing. EVGA also has a micro-ATX form factor board which supports two-way SLI. ASRock managed to make a mini-ITX form factor X299 board, which still includes four memory slots and three M.2 slots, but cuts the GPU opportunities down to one. ASRock's Gaming i9 board meanwhile has 10Gb Ethernet built in. I'm going to wait for some reviews (or at least price tags) to start rolling in before I try and choose a candidate for an X299 build. To be honest, most of the specs are probably overkill for my purposes — and I still haven't put together a Ryzen system! But it's exciting to see this much power and expandability available out of the gate for these long-awaited CPUs.

The Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 packs about everything that that is possible, including advanced VRMs, multiple PCIe slots, a Wi-Fi module, as well as a 10 GbE port. Despite being extremely feature-rich, the new product is not going to be too expensive. Since Intel’s new X299 platform supports a very diverse range of processors that cost from sub-$300 all the way to $1999, makers of motherboards are trying to address different setups with their products accordingly. Some X299 platforms can be considered as “entry-level” (of the ultra high-end) based on their moderate feature set, others may be considered as mid-range and the most advanced models fit into the “extreme” or “workstation-grade” category for prosumers who need every bit of performance they may get. The ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 belongs to the latter category and is thus aimed at systems without compromises that run processors with 10 or more cores, feature multiple graphics cards, up to a dozen of storage devices, and so on. One of the important features of the ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 is its 13-phase digital VRM that uses high endurance coils as well as solid-state capacitors and designed to ensure high overclocking potential. ASRock claims that this PWM can handle 720 A and deliver up to 1300 W of power, which is well above any CPU can consume (or survive). The motherboard carries eight DDR4 DIMM slots and the manufacturer supports memory overclocking up to DDR-4400 and beyond. Previous-gen Intel Core Extreme (Broadwell-E) processors could not run DDR4 at extreme data transfer rates in quad-channel mode and it isn't clear whether the new multi-core Skylake-X will handle DDR4 at 4000+ GT/s in quad-channel mode. However since the X299 platform also supports quad-core Kaby Lake-X CPUs with a dual-channel memory controller that can handle high memory frequencies, support for high DDR4 frequencies may prove especially important for Kaby Lake-X. Another key selling point of the ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 is the the Aquantia AQtion 10 Gb/s Ethernet controller (presumably the AQN-107) that also supports 2.5G and 5G operation. Installing this specific controller on a motherboard that is priced significantly below $500 makes a great deal of sense, as 10 GbE infrastructure (routers, switches) is still very expensive for most users (even those who buy Intel Core X-series CPUs), whereas 2.5G and 5G equipment promises to be a lot cheaper. Whether or not the owner of the X299 Professional Gaming i9 plans to invest in 10 GbE hardware, they will be ready for everything faster than GbE, and that adds value to the motherboard. In addition to the 10 GbE port, the mainboard also has two GbE headers enabled by controllers from Intel. For scenarios when wired connections are unavailable, the motherboard has a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller). Next up is expandability. The Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 has four PCIe 3.0 x16 slots (2 × x16, 2 × x8): three can be used for graphics cards running in AMD CrossFireX or NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU mode, the fourth can be used for an SSD or any other device. Besides, the board has 10 SATA 6 Gbps connectors for systems that need a huge number of SATA storage devices. ASRock's Fatal1ty X299 for Intel Core X-Series   Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 CPU Support Intel Core i9 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i5 CPUs in LGA2066 form-factor Graphics 4 × PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 × x16, 2 × x8) 3-way AMD CrossFireX and NVIDIA SLI supported Chipset Intel X299 Memory Eight DDR4 DIMM slots Ethernet 1 × Aquantia AQtion AQN-107 10 GbE 2 × Intel GbE controllers Storage 10 × SATA 6 Gbps 3 × M.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) Audio Realtek ALC1220 7.1 channel audio USB 8 × USB 3.0 Type-A 6 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-C 1 × USB 3.1 internal header ASMedia ASM3142 controller for USB 3.1 Other I/O Dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 Form-Factor ATX MSRP $350 When it comes to connectivity, the Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 has something to brag about even beyond its vast networking capabilities. The motherboard uses ASMedia’s latest ASM3142 controller that is backed by a PCIe 3.0 x2 connect (instead of x1 in case of the ASM1142) and thus offers higher bandwidth than its predecessor. In total, the board supports eight USB 3.0 Type-A ports, six USB 2.0 connectors, two USB 3.1 (Gen 2) receptacles (Type-A, Type-C) as well as one USB 3.1 (Gen 2) header for a USB-C port on the front of the PC that can deliver 36 W of power. Finally, the platform has a 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) with the Sound Blaster Cinema 3 software enhancements by Creative. The ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 will be available in the coming months for about $350. For those, who don’t need a 10G Ethernet port, 36 W power delivery on the front USB-C port and some other minor things, ASRock will offer the X299 Taichi motherboard that uses the same PCB, but without the aforementioned features, at around $300.

The only missing thing is a cup holder to keep the coffee warm off the heat coming out of all those components! Reply close - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link This would have commended a much heftier price for all those features if it wasn't for that recent pesky competition. Reply osteopathic1 - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link 720 Amps? Is that correct? Reply Ryan Smith - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Yes. Reply ckbryant - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link 720 Amps would surely be enough to fry most any component imaginable. I assume like the article reads this was a "extreme" scenario where they tested what it would fail at. Cause I've had vacuum cleaners at 25 Amps that the cord would get so hot, you'd have to unplug it. So 'moar cores' don't mean "moar amps" at least not that many lol Reply genekellyjr - Saturday, June 03, 2017 - link Remember that heat is from wattage, which is amps*voltage! These CPUs are rolling at 1.4V max while your vacuum cleaner was rocking 120VRMS so 25A*120VRMS = 3000WRMS (and the cord was possibly inadequately gauged for such a duty) while these CPUs would be drawing a mere 720A*1.4V = 1008W. These are heavily simplified numbers for complicated electronics but will be roughly in the ball park! But yeah that CPU'd be totes toast at that wattage Reply r3loaded - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link $350 is a lot less than I was expecting for a board with everything but the kitchen sink (the kitchen sink in question being Thunderbolt 3). Reply mdriftmeyer - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Big deal. I've got 4 way and 5 way with X399 x16 PCI-E 3.0 and Threadripper. Reply drajitshnew - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Please enquire about where the PCIe lanes for 10 GbE and m2 are coming from. A simple scenario uploading a large file from internal storage to NAS would leave nothing for the USB ports, etc coming off the PCH.

The Surface Pro looks like a 12-inch tablet, but it’s more than just another tablet. The hardware inside lets users install touch-friendly apps from Microsoft’s Windows Store and programs from the internet. The keyboards and built-in kickstands let buyers use them as laptops when they need to get work done. The Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3 account for most Surface sales, according to Microsoft. Together with the Surface Laptop, Surface Studio and Surface Book, the new Surface Pro finally gives Microsoft an up-to-date line-up for every kind of Windows user. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2017 Surface Pro release, including its new features and updated accessories. 2017 Surface Pro Features The 2017 Surface Pro is more than a processor upgrade and less than a complete redesign. It’s still a tablet with the internals of a laptop. The device’s magnesium body is one-third of an inch thick, making it just as thin as the Surface Pro 4. The 2736 x 1824 12.3-inch display isn’t any sharper or brighter than the Surface Pro 4’s. Most of the upgrades are for Surface Pen lovers. The 2017 Surface Pro has a display technology that can sense when users are tilting the new $99 Surface Pen while drawing or taking notes. It’s now capable of sensing 4,096 different levels of pressure from the accessory, too. Microsoft plans to deliver updated Office programs that include these new pen features. Kickstand upgrades let the 2017 Surface Pro achieve a 165-degree angle. Microsoft says that this new angle boosts comfort for users who draw and take notes. This new Windows 2-in-1 isn’t any thinner or lighter than its predecessor, but it is a better tablet and laptop. Using 7th Generation Intel Core processors and new cooling techniques allowed Microsoft to get rid of the fans on the Intel Core m3 and Intel Core i5 models. Nothing is more distracting than the hum the fans in older Surface devices make when you are watching a movie, reading a book or listening to music. The 2017 Surface Pro lasts for 13.5 hours of video playback, which is far more than the 9 hours the Surface Pro 4 is capable of. Loud 1.6-watt Dolby Premium Audio speakers let the tablet fill a room with sound while keeping down distortion. The 2017 Surface Pro will have LTE mobile data. That’s the same technology that lets iPads connect to the internet when there’s no Wi-Fi. The iPad and iPad Pro have had LTE for years, but Microsoft has never included it in a Surface Pro. Read: iPad Pro Review: Why I Returned the 2017 iPad 2017 Surface Pro Release Date & Pre-Orders The 2017 Surface Pro release date is June 15th. Past Surface Pro launches have happened in stages, but this launch is different. The 2017 Surface Pro will come to 26 countries on release day. Both Best Buy and the Microsoft Store have 2017 Surface Pro pre-orders available. More stores and websites than these two should offer pre-orders as we get closer to launch. 2017 Surface Pro Specs & Price Excluding the RAM, processor and storage, every 2017 Surface Pro has the same features. Each of them gets the 13.5 hours of video playback that Microsoft promises. They all have a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that lets users sign in with Windows Hello and a rear-facing 8-megapixel camera that supports autofocus. A microSDXC card reader, Surface Connect charging, headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort and a place to connect a Surface Type Cover come in each. The new Surface Pro starts at $799. This model has an Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB of solid-state storage and 4GB of RAM. It uses Intel HD Graphics 615, which can’t power demanding games, but handles photo editing just fine. The $799 2017 Surface Pro lacks a fan because the Core m3 processor doesn’t need one. The Intel Core i5 model has 128GB of solid state storage, 4GB of RAM and no fan for the processor. Intel HD Graphics 620 are inside, which slightly boosts its performance for really basic games. This model costs $999. There is just a single upgrade option for the new Surface with Core i5 processor. Shoppers can replace the model’s 128GB of storage with 256GB of storage and double its RAM to 8GB. These upgrades cost $1,299. The $1,599 model with Intel Core i7 has Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 for better performance in games, video editing and 3D modeling. This 2017 Surface Pro’s processor has a fan to expel heat. Two upgrades for the model with Intel Core i7 processor are available.  The $2,199 model adds 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. Shoppers can boost the Core i7 model’s storage to 1TB and add 16GB of RAM for a total cost of $2,699. 2017 Surface Pro Accessories & Accessory Compatibility The 2017 Surface Pro works with all existing Surface accessories. The Type Covers from Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3 dock to its connector just fine. It works with the older Surface Pen, but without the additional levels of pressure and tilt sensitivity for drawing. Docking though the Surface Connect port still works. The 2017 Surface Pro doesn’t come with a Surface Dial. That’s the $99 accessory that lets Surface users change settings in apps and programs. Buyers can place the Surface Dial on the 2017 Surface Pro’s screen to get options tailored to their apps. New 2017 Surface Pro accessories are coming. Unfortunately, Microsoft has stopped including the Surface Pen with the Surface Pro. The new Surface Pen costs $99 and comes in black, silver, burgundy and cobalt. It no longer has a clip for securing it to a shirt pocket or the cover. Instead, its magnets let it snap to the left side of the 2017 Surface Pro. Another generation of Surface Type Covers is on the way. These 2017 covers come in silver, burgundy and cobalt and are covered in Alcantara fabric. Microsoft says that Alcantara is softer than the fabric on the Surface Pro 4 covers. Each of these covers costs $159.99. 2017 Surface Pro Deals Best Buy has two 2017 Surface Pro deals. Shoppers that pre-order there can get $100 off their new device. The savings requires a College Student Deals membership, which is free but restricted to students. Best Buy will set up the Windows 2-in-1 and transfer any information that you have on your PC for free. 7 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Huawei MateBook - $399   1 / 7 The Huawei MateBook has an attractive price and two configurations for shoppers to pick from. This machine offers 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor for just $399. More expensive configurations add an Intel Core m5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of solid state storage. Buyers eager for a Windows 2-in-1 without lots of extra ports and distractions may like this device. Its metal frame has just a USB Type-C port, a headset jack and a connection for its add-on keyboard. The front is dominated by a 12-inch 2160 x 11440 display, putting what you're working on or watching at the forefront of your experience. Read: Huawei MateBook Review: If iPad and Surface Mated You’ll need to factor in the cost of the digital pen and the keyboard because neither of these comes with the Huawei MateBook. They, like the tablet itself, are cheaper than what Surface offers. The MatePen is just $49 from the Microsoft Store. The keyboard, which has a kickstand for propping the device up and backlit keys, costs $99. A Surface Type Cover costs $129.99. The Surface Pen sells for $59.99.

Intel is looking to transform how new features are delivered to connected devices with its new Compute Card. By Liam Tung | May 31, 2017 -- 13:50 GMT (06:50 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel has launched Compute Card, a slim, modular PC that it wants other brands to incorporate into connected things, such as kiosks, smart TVs, different form factor PCs, and home appliances. The top-tier model features a seventh-generation Intel i5-7Y57 CPU, 4GB RAM, up to a 128GB solid-state drive, and wireless chip. Intel's ultra-slim Compute Card to ease upgrades for IoT devices Roughly the size of a credit card, the super-tiny PC can fit a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and more in a package that's just 5mm thick. Read More The Compute Card differs from Intel's Compute Stick, which was for consumers who needed a small PC to plug into a living-room display. Instead, the Compute Card will show up in devices like an all-in-one and mini PC from Foxconn, LG smart monitors, Sharp digital signage, and a range of other traditional computing devices. The Compute Card's modular design is meant to make it easier for consumers to upgrade smart features in their connected devices, simply by slotting in a new card. Manufacturers would benefit by incorporating a compatible slot into their connected products, cutting the need, for example, to develop their own circuit boards. Lenovo, Dell, and HP are working on Compute Card-powered products, but they're not ready for showing yet, according to Intel. Intel unveiled the Compute Card at CES earlier this year and is now gearing up to ship the devices in August. Intel has released a Compute Card Device Design Kit for product developers, which includes guides and reference designs to support the card. To get developers started, it's also built its own Card Compute Dock with a 19V DC power supply, HDMI port and USB 3.0 ports to connect displays and other peripherals. Though the dock would appeal to consumers, it appears to be aimed at product developers who support customer signage and conference-room systems. It also has a reference design dock that can be customized to fit other connected products. Intel is encouraging would-be Compute Card developers to consider how they would embed, cool, and eject the compute module in a way that meets its requirements for a mechanical secure lock. The Compute Card will be available in four configurations outlined below. Intel's Compute Card comes in four configurations.

An eSIM is an embedded chip which can remove the need to buy a SIM card – and insert it into a device’s SIM tray – when a user wants to connect to a cellular network. When Apple launched its iPad Pro in 2016, the company included an Apple SIM embedded in the device. The embedded Apple SIM supported networks in the US and UK at the time.

Photographer: John Angelillo/Pool via Bloomberg President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, agreed Tuesday to turn over a limited number of documents sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee for its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Flynn has agreed to initially produce documents the committee subpoenaed from his two companies, Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc., according to a person with knowledge of Flynn’s negotiations with the committee. It wasn’t yet determined what kind of documents will be handed over, the person said. The committee also had issued a separate subpoena for Flynn to turn over personal documents and to testify. Although Flynn initially opposed that subpoena, the committee has since narrowed its focus, the person said. Flynn has now agreed to turn over personal documents that the committee, through legal standards, can prove exist, the person said, but he hasn’t agreed to testify before the committee. Flynn will start producing documents on June 6, with more to follow, the person said, adding that Flynn wants to cooperate with the committee to the fullest extent possible as long as doing so doesn’t jeopardize his constitutional rights. Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after revelations that he misled administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador, had been under threat of a contempt citation after turning down the panel’s request for documents and an interview. His lawyer cited the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, arguing that the committee’s request was overly broad. Russian Influence The committee is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential race and the possibility of collusion by members of Trump’s campaign. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was a top adviser to Trump during his run for president. He has become a central figure in congressional investigations as well an FBI probe that now is being overseen by a special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Sign Up The investigations have entangled a number of Trump advisers and associates, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior White House adviser. In December, before Trump took office, Kushner and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak met in New York and talked about possibly setting up a secure and secretive communications channel between the Kremlin and Trump’s transition team, according to a person familiar with the matter. That’s led some Democrats to call for revocation of Kushner’s security clearance. Separately, Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, turned down requests from House and Senate investigators for information and testimony, saying their questions were “poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered.” Like the president and his other allies, Cohen questioned why the investigation was continuing. Blanket Denial “To date, there has not been a single witness, document or piece of evidence linking me to this fake Russian conspiracy,” Cohen said. “This is not surprising to me because there is none.” Russian officials also deny any collusion. The Kremlin sees “hourly” attempts at “fomenting and maintaining Russophobic sentiments” in the U.S., spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. “It has a very negative impact overall on the atmosphere of our bilateral relations,” Peskov said. Flynn has been under scrutiny since being ousted from the administration. He previously offered to testify to Congress in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a request lawmakers rejected. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last week that Flynn may have lied in his application for a security clearance by saying that his paid speech at a Moscow gala for a Russian TV network in 2015 had been “funded by U.S. companies.” Documents previously released by congressional Democrats show he received more than $45,000 from RT, the Russian government-backed television network, for his participation at a gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin’s table.

Lewandowski explained that "when you have a communications team, they have to have that relationship with the president, to understand how he communicates, because he is the greatest communicator as a president that we've ever had." While the implication that one must already understand how Trump communicates in order to see he's a great communicator may seem dubious, White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks also effused Tuesday that Trump "has an unparalleled ability to communicate with people." The communications shakeup at the White House could see Lewandowski returning to the employ of his former boss. Trump is reportedly considering adding Lewandowski to the communications department; Trump had also considered adding his former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, although Bossie has since expressed his wish not to join the White House. Press Secretary Sean Spicer's on-camera appearances are nevertheless expected to be rolled back and the Great Communicator will reportedly be holding more press conferences on his own.

  Corey Lewandowski raves that Trump is 'the greatest communicator as a president that we've ever had' May 31, 2017 arrests Edit 14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. ET   Scott Olson/Getty Images Police in Portland, Oregon, arrested 14 people Sunday during dueling demonstrations attended by supporters of President Trump, anti-fascist protesters, and residents concerned about hate speech. Hundreds of people attended the "Trump Free Speech" rally at Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, CNN reports, and even more counter-protesters gathered across the street. Police say at first, the two sides yelled expletives at each other, then counter-protesters started to throw glass bottles and bricks at the officers, who responded by using pepper spray. Tensions in the city have been high since three men were stabbed last week, two fatally, on a light-rail train by a man who was allegedly yelling anti-Muslim statements at two young women. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had unsuccessfully requested that the permit be revoked for the free-speech rally, saying, "I'm a strong supporter of the First Amendment no matter what the views are that are being expressed, but given the timing of this rally, I believed we had a case to make about the threats to public safety." Organizer Joey Gibson noted that the protest was planned before the murders, said he is not racist or a member of the alt-right movement, and argued that the rally was not in support of stabbing suspect Jeremy Christian.

Organizers said the concert, which had a heavy police presence, raised £2 million ($2.57 million) for the victims and families of those killed two weeks ago at Grande's concert in Manchester. The crowd was filled with people holding signs of support for Manchester and the victims, and Grande said the "kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now." With the £2 million raised Sunday, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has collected more than £10 million in donations.

Mitchell/Getty Images The Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the Saturday night attacks in London that left seven people dead and 48 wounded. The official ISIS news agency posted a message Sunday claiming that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks yesterday," the SITE Intelligence Group reports, including running into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people at Borough Market. Police shot and killed the three suspects, and later arrested 12 people in East London connected to one of the suspects, a man who wore a fake bomb vest. Investigators said they do not see any links so far between what happened in London and the suicide bombing in Manchester two weeks ago that killed more than 20 people.

"You and I, you and I personally, have a much closer relationship than I had with Mr. Flynn," Putin said in a translated voiceover. In Putin's account of a widely circulated photo of the Russian president eating dinner next to Flynn, the seating arrangement was unexpected. "I got up and left," Putin said. "And then afterwards I was told, 'You know there was an American gentleman. He was involved in some things. He used to be in the security services' ... that's it. I didn't even really talk to him." Flynn is now subject to a criminal investigation pertaining to his possible communication with Russian officials during and after the 2016 election. Watch an excerpt of the Kelly interview below.

"We need to be smart, vigilant and tough," he wrote on Twitter. "We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump's rallying cry has not been met with universal acclaim, including within his own party. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News Sunday he believes "the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting," but that this could be accomplished "without a travel ban." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was even less enthusiastic. "I think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it has been rejected by the courts," she said Sunday in a CBS interview, while allowing that the U.S. should do a "better job of vetting." Across the aisle, Trump's raising of the travel ban topic also came under fire from former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who served under President Obama. "There's a very real risk that by stigmatizing and isolating Muslims from particular countries, and Muslims in general, that we alienate the very communities here in the United States whose cooperation we most need to detect and prevent these homegrown extremists from being able to carry out attacks," she said while appearing on ABC News.

"Just because we got out of a club doesn't mean we don't care about the environment," she added. These comments were more direct than those from EPA chief Scott Pruitt, though Haley echoed his phrasing in saying Trump believes "the climate changes" rather than "in climate change." Haley also argued a main reason Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is he wanted to be honest about what could realistically be accomplished. The climate pact terms former President Obama negotiated weren't "achievable, even if we had stayed in the Paris Agreement, and this is the part everyone needs to think about," Haley said, "If we had stayed in the Paris Agreement ... what President Obama submitted the U.S. to was not achievable under our standards or any other country's standards, and then we've got to look at the fact we didn't want to be in violation of the agreement."

Already the overclocking crews at Computex have been pushing key products from this HEDT CPU range to their limits and are breaking OC and benchmark world records. Intel Core-X TIM and delidding While it's great to see the capabilities of these chips, and the platform, easily exceed those that came before them, that fact is tempered with some not-so-good news. Sadly Intel's most premium consumer processors still use a 'conventional paste' thermal interface material (TIM). They aren't soldered, so getting the best extreme clock speeds from these parts requires delidding (German language, toggle on the English subtitles), says OC expert der8auer. Skylake-X delidded In the linked video you can see first a Kaby Lake-X processor die (with the lid removed). It is the same size as previously available dies but comes on a bigger and thicker package which facilitates higher clocks thanks to better signalling, more VCC and GND pins, explains the overclocking expert. Moving onto Skylake-X it's an altogether trickier delidding process as the die on a raised level under the lid and surrounded by many tiny raised-up capacitors and resistors. Thus der8auer has designed a tool to help you delid a Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processor, called the Delid Die Mate X (available by the end of June). HWBot world records Moving onto the achievements of the new Intel Core-X processors on X299 motherboards, numerous overclocking world record have already been broken. If you head on over to the world record page of HWBot you can see plenty of new records from the last couple of days. Within the CPU benchmarks table, reproduce above, five out of the 12 listed records have been broken by Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors in the past two days. It looks like the Intel Core i7 7740K and Intel Core i9 7900X are particularly popular with overclockers with records broken in PiFast, SuperPi, and more. You will also find a slew of GPU and application world records broken by overclockers using the new Intel Core i7 7740K and Intel Core i9 7900X as you scroll down through the HWBot world record page. Intel's 8th generation Core processors Here's another important Intel News segment from Computex. Intel has briefly announced that its 8th generation Core processors will deliver more than 30 per cent performance improvements compared to 7th gen parts. It announced this as a 'commitment' with the first devices packing these processors expected to be available by Xmas.

Posted by MonkFish - Wed 31 May 2017 14:41 Iota For the prices they are charging, you would have thought they would be soldered. Another reason for me to buy AMD. I agree but solder costs money i mean they would have to add at least another $100 to solder the lids on te cpus. (sarcasm) They are bareley scracping by charging what they do, i mean look at all the innovation they have brough us in the last few years (/sarcasm). I have a feeling in a couple of years we will start to see the same anti competative practises admissions from some OEMs (not by the OEMs but by Intel) which we heard in the past when thunderbird etc could nbot get a foothold in the market despite being better. I mean look at whats already happening with the forcing of optane on motherboard manufacturers… Posted by MonkFish - Wed 31 May 2017 14:43 Corky34 Every time someone accuses Intel of using a poor quality TIM i want to scream, do people really think a company that spends $12.7 billion on R&D is going to penny pinch when it comes to TIM for nothing but financial reasons. Why not, it happens everywhere else. Motor manufacturers spend vast amounts of R&D yet still have to issue recalls because they cheap out on a component. Posted by Corky34 - Wed 31 May 2017 15:04 MonkFish Why not, it happens everywhere else. Motor manufacturers spend vast amounts of R&D yet still have to issue recalls because they cheap out on a component. Because CPUs and material sciences isn't comparable to motor manufacturers where cheaping out on a component isn't financially, let alone scientifically, provable to be detrimental to the final product. And before anyone jumps down my throat I'm not saying Intel uses the best quality TIM full stop, I'm saying they use a TIM best suited for their specific needs and those needs do not include cutting costs, a TIM needs to do more than just provide low thermal resistance.

The Snapdragon 835 processor, which has been used in smartphones, will power the new computers Intel's processors are still more powerful, however Todd Haselton | @robotodd Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | 9:06 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters New Windows 10 PCs will run on Qualcomm chips, but Intel investors shouldn't worry just yet    Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | 1:02 PM ET | 00:51 HP, Asus and Lenovo will build new Windows 10 computers running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. It may sound like something Intel should worry about, but investors shouldn't sound the alarm just yet. First, some backstory: It's the first time Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips have been used to power a full version of Windows, which usually runs on processors from AMD or Intel. Microsoft has tried Qualcomm chips with lighter versions of its OS such as Windows RT, but those efforts failed because the computers couldn't run most apps designed for Windows. That's what changes now. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor, typically reserved for smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, will power the new Windows 10 computers and will offer constant connectivity. That means folks who buy a new computer from Asus, HP or Lenovo should expect it to come with the option to add it to their wireless carrier for data service when Wi-Fi isn't available. Qualcomm said the new computers will be "lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available," while also offering longer battery life than current solutions on the market. It sounds appealing, but here's why Intel shouldn't worry. While the Snapdragon 835 is a powerful-enough chip for smartphones, you shouldn't expect these computers to offer robust support for rendering in Photoshop or video editing, even though Qualcomm promises support for "all Windows applications." Those functions might work in some regard, but don't expect these machines to be the most powerful on the market. Qualcomm's chips are becoming more and more powerful, but they're still not a match for a full-fledged seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, the sorts that are used in the latest flagship computers from companies such as Dell and Microsoft, and which we expect to launch in Apple's new MacBooks as soon as next week. These are some of Qualcomm's first steps onto Intel's territory, where Intel has mainly had to worry about AMD as a competitor, so it's still a move worth watching. A final point: we still don't know when the first Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 computers will launch, or how much they'll cost, the latter of which will be important if Qualcomm wants to take share from Intel.

The new X299E-ITX/ac is small, but it takes full advantage of Intel’s new X299 platform, offering support for all CPUs with up to 18 cores, quad-channel DDR4 memory on the higher-end CPUs, three PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots as well as everything that one might expect from a Mini-ITX board, including Wi-Fi. Besides being a miniature motherboard for Intel's HEDT processors, the most important aspect of the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac is support for quad-channel memory in this form-factor. The company’s previous-gen Intel X99-based Mini-ITX mainboard was feature-packed, but one of the things it missed was the quad-channel memory sub-system, which had an expected negative effect on performance in applications that required high memory bandwidth. By contrast, the new unit has four SO-DIMM DDR4 memory slots and even supports DDR4 overclocking (assuming that there are SO-DIMMs that can be significantly overclocked). In fact, putting four memory slots onto a small motherboard while also fitting the LGA 2066 socket and required high-capactiy VRMs is a rather remarkable engineering achievement. The flip side however is that the very tightly packed design of the X299E-ITX/ac may impose certain limitations on compatibility with large cooling systems. Just like every other Mini-ITX motherboard around, the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac has only one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for graphics cards. In the meantime, the X299E-ITX/ac is the first miniature mainboard to feature three M.2 slots (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) for SSDs. In addition, the board carries six SATA 6 Gbps headers for builds that require multiple storage devices in drive form-factor. It is noteworthy that in order to fit everything it wanted onto a Mini-ITX PCB, ASRock had to place the USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and one M.2 slot on custom DIMM-like modules - essentially going vertical when they ran out of horizontal space. Such modules add certain dimension-related limitations to the size of CPU radiators (plus, it remains to be seen how higher-end M.2 SSDs perform when located near a CPU cooler), but this is a tradeoff that the manufacturer had to take. As for connectivity, the X299E-ITX/ac comes with a 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller), two GbE ports (Intel controllers too), two USB 3.1 headers  (Type-A and Type-C), six USB 3.0 connectors, 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) and so on.

Such a price point is considerably higher than MSRPs of most Mini-ITX motherboards, but given the fact that this is a very high-end platform (with equally high component requirements) aimed at enthusiasts, it is not unusual. In fact, from many standpoint it may be considered as an entry-level X299 board simply because it does not provide opulence of its bigger brethren.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > 6 awesome laptop deals for dads and grads that can… 6 awesome laptop deals for dads and grads that can save you up to $350 By Lucas Coll — Updated May 30, 2017 2:36 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Graduation season is upon us and Father’s Day is just around the corner, so now is a great time to score an awesome deal on a name-brand laptop as a gift for a loved one — or even for yourself. Shopping for a new computer can be a time-consuming hassle, so we’ve handpicked some of the best current discounts to spare you some work. Along with offering a selection of discounted computers from name-brand makers like Apple and HP, our laptop deal roundup highlights a variety of models suited for different needs — from general use to hardcore gaming — to help you find the PC that best fits your lifestyle. The budget option: Acer Aspire ES 15 ES1-572-31KW First on our laptop deal roundup is the budget-friendly Acer Aspire ES 15 ES1-572-31KW, which is available for just $300 on Amazon after a $20 discount. This PC features a 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080 LED display which utilizes CineCrystal technology for a crisp and color-rich HD picture. The sixth-generation Intel Core i3-6100U 2.3GHz processor, 4GB of RAM, and Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU work together to provide sufficient power for work, light gaming, and general use, making the Aspire E5-575-33BM a great choice for an affordable everyday laptop. The computer comes with a 1TB hard drive for plenty of internal storage, and the battery can last more than six hours on a single charge so you have enough power for a day’s work on the go. $300 from Amazon The workhorse: Asus P-Series P2540UA-AB51 Asus manufactures a wide lineup of affordable laptop computers, and if you’re in need of a reliable work companion, consider the Asus P-Series P2540UA-AB51. A step up specs-wise from the Acer Aspire, the Asus P-Series comes equipped with a sixth-generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. The 15.6-inch widescreen display offers a 1080p resolution to let you enjoy your games, videos, and pictures in full HD, while the embedded TPM Security chip and fingerprint scanner keep your important work files safe. Asus Business Manager software makes it easy to set up and customize your system as well. The Asus P-Series P2540UA-AB51 normally goes for $599, but Amazon has it on sale for $100 off, bringing this workhorse laptop down to just $499. $499 from Amazon The slimline option: HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook For those wanting something a bit smaller, the HP Envy 13-ab016nr Notebook is a solid option. This slim laptop features a 13-inch display, a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, and 8GB of RAM, while the 256GB SSD gives you improved disk speeds over traditional hard drives. The Envy’s metal construction and scratch-resistant glass screen increase its durability for when you’re on the move. The lid hinge has a built-in riser that slightly raises the laptop when it’s open, allowing for a more natural typing posture, as well as extra air flow underneath the unit. The full-size keyboard is backlit as well. The HP Envy 13-ab016nr comes in at just $620 on Amazon, which is a nice $180 discount off of its usual price. $620 from Amazon The 2-in-1 option: HP Pavilion x360 Convertible Laptop Tablets are great for their portability and touchscreen functionality, but the lack of a mouse and keyboard makes them less suitable for work and extended use. Enter the 2-in-1 HP Pavilion x360 convertible laptop. This PC functions as a normal 15-inch notebook complete with keyboard and touchpad, but features a Full HD touchscreen display that can be flipped around and folded down for use as a tablet. An Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB hard drive also deliver more than enough power and storage for most needs. The HP Pavilion x360 convertible laptop is currently on sale for $550 on Amazon, giving you a whopping 39 percent discount of $350 for a limited time. Also included with the computer is a Woov laptop sleeve, a $60 value that is yours for free. $550 from Amazon For the Gamer: Acer Aspire VX 15 New on the scene for 2017, the Acer Aspire VX 15 is a laptop built for gamers that – unlike many portable gaming machines – won’t cost you a fortune. With its Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU, the VX 15 is the only laptop on our list equipped with a dedicated graphics card. The seventh-generation Core i7-7700HQ processor can be clocked up to 3.8GHz with Intel Turbo technology, which, when paired with a mighty 16GB of RAM, should give you lots of power for demanding games. The 15.6-inch IPS display lets you enjoy your gaming in full HD, and makes the laptop a good desktop replacement without being too bulky to carry around. The distinctive angular lines and red-and-black color scheme are accented by a red backlit keyboard. Still new on the market, the Acer Aspire VX 15 can be difficult to find, but Amazon now has it available for $1,000 after a $50 discount. $1,000 from Amazon For the Apple lover: MacBook Pro with 13.3” Retina display MacBooks can be expensive but you can score some awesome deals and save hundreds by buying a professionally refurbished model directly from the experts at Apple. The Apple store is currently offering a generous $200 discount on a refurbished 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display, bringing the cost down to $1,099 from its standard $1,299 price tag. Apple’s famous Retina display technology features an impressive resolution of 2,560 x 1,600, giving you an extremely crisp picture for a compact 13-inch screen. Under the hood, the MacBook Pro comes loaded with a fifth-generation dual-core Intel Core i5 2.7GHz processor, 8GB of installed RAM, and 128GB of flash storage. Two Thunderbolt 2 connector ports allow for high-speed data transfers, and the integrated battery provides up to 10 hours of power. $1,099 from Apple
Digital Trends Home > Computing > HyperX revamped its Predator-branded DDR4 lineup… HyperX revamped its Predator-branded DDR4 lineup to include 4,000MHz sticks By Kevin Parrish — Updated May 31, 2017 1:02 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC builders and customers looking to update their current memory configuration now have a load of options from HyperX, including kits running at 4,000MHz. Talk about quick thinking! Kingston Technology’s HyperX gaming division introduced new HyperX Predator DDR4 system memory kits with speeds (frequencies) of up to a staggering 4,000MHz. The company also added kits with high storage capacities of up to 128GB clocked at 3,000MHz. All memory sticks provided in the new kits support Intel’s Extreme Memory Profile (XMP) technology for easy and safe overclocking. Here is what HyperX now offers: Single sticks: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3/8 8GB 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3/8 8GB 2,666MHz CL13 HX430C15PB3/8 8GB 3,000MHz CL15 HX424C12PB3/16 16GB 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3/16 16GB 2,666MHz CL13 HX430C15PB3/16 16GB 3,000MHz CL15 Two-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 2,666MHz CL13 HX436C17PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 3,600MHz CL17 HX440C19PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 4,000MHz CL19 HX424C12PB3K2/32 32GB (2x 32GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K2/32 32GB (2x 32GB) 2,666MHz CL13 Four-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 2,666MHz CL13 HX433C16PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 3,333MHz CL16 HX436C17PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 3,600MHz CL17 HX424C12PB3K4/64 64GB (4x 16GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K4/64 64GB (4x 16GB) 2,666MHz CL13 Eight-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX430C15PB3K8/128 128GB (8x 16GB) 3,000MHz CL15 Regarding latency, that “CL” designation is short for Column Access Strobe Latency. The typical memory stick consists of the printed circuit board (PCB), storage modules soldered onto that PCB, and input/output pins on the PCB that make an electrical connection to the motherboard’s memory socket. Latency starts when the motherboard’s memory controller tells the memory stick to access data stored on one of its modules, and ends when that data is made available on the PCB/stick’s input-output pins. That said, a DDR4 memory stick clocked at 2,400 with a CL17 latency will see that data retrieval process completed in around 14.17 nanoseconds. Typically, the faster the stick’s frequency/speed, the lower the latency. Yet despite the Intel-based XMP overclocking profiles, the HyperX Predator memory sticks work just fine in the latest AMD-based PCs as well. Overall, each Predator-branded stick provided in the HyperX kits consumes up to 1.35 volts of energy, and has an operating temperature ranging from zero degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius. They also measure approximately 133.35mm x 42.2mm. “HyperX continues to lead the gaming memory market with high quality, high-performance memory for anyone building a new DDR4 rig,” says Kristy Ernt, global memory business manager, HyperX. “If you are a fan of AMD or Intel, HyperX memory offers the enhanced performance needed to game at your best.” HyperX didn’t provide any pricing at the time this article went live, but the company appears to have completely revamped its lineup of Predator DDR4 kits with this new rollout. HyperX also mentioned a two-pack kit of 8GB (2x 4GB) in its Computex announcement on Tuesday, May 30, but didn’t list the part number along with all the other kits posted above. We expect more information will surface once Computex comes to a close later this week.

Intel Corporation is showcasing the data-driven future at Computex 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan, on May 30-June 3. (Credit: Intel Corporation) At Computex, ASUS* CEO Jonney Shih joined Gregory Bryant, Intel senior vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group, to unveil ASUS’s always connected PC, code-named “Kukuna.” Powered by Intel® Core™ processors and Intel LTE connectivity, ASUS’s super thin, lightweight and stylish 2 in 1 is the latest example in a category of PCs that Intel’s leaders believe will become increasingly relevant as data plan costs decrease and people’s desires for access from any location at any time increases. Press Kit: 2017 Computex This ASUS design joins more than 30 other always connected PCs on the market today. The Samsung* Galaxy Book*, Mi Notebook Air* 13.3” and Lenovo* ThinkPad L470* are other great examples with powerful Intel performance, full Windows* experiences, instant accessibility from anywhere thanks to world-class connectivity and long battery life in amazingly thin, light PCs. These PCs will meet the needs of individuals or professionals who require access to the full PC experience on their terms. Intel is investing in eSIM and LTE technologies, and its leaders are working closely with Microsoft* to validate eSIM-enabled always connected platforms with multiple carriers using the Intel® XMMTM 7260 modem and the upcoming Intel XMM 7360 modem. This joint work is another layer of Intel’s Project EVO collaboration announced at WinHEC* in December to move computing to a new level – one where PCs are capable of even more unbelievable things, including smarter voice inputs, mixed/merged reality experiences for all, powerful gaming innovations, strengthened security and identity protection, and true, always connected experiences. We expect to see more innovation in this category, and that is why Intel each year delivers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative technologies that make powerful computing possible from anywhere, including Intel Core processors, Intel Optane™ memory and connectivity technologies. Going forward, our efforts in establishing new standards and technologies will also be an essential step toward realizing the full potential of 5G for the expanding interconnectedness of devices and things.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Buying a new MacBook this week is a really bad idea - here's why Apple is expected to update its MacBook range at its annual WWDC event on 5 June. By Alistair Charlton May 31, 2017 13:13 BST Put that MacBook down. Apple is set to update its laptop range on 5 JuneReuters Step away from the Apple Store and put your credit card away, because now is a really bad time to buy a new MacBook. Let us explain. Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, or WWDC, kicks off on 5 June with a keynote address led by company CEO Tim Cook. New products are always expected from WWDC, but this year the volume of rumours surrounding an update to Apple's laptop lineup mean you should hold off for now. The MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and regular MacBook lines are all expected to be updated at WWDC, according to Bloomberg, which has a strong track record for Apple gossip. The website reported: "Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp...Apple is also working on a new version of the 12in MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company is also considering updating the aging 12in MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said." By adopting Kaby Lake processors, the MacBook Pro range is expected to get a boost to both performance and battery life. The entire Mac lineup is marked as 'don't buy' or 'caution' by the MacRumors buying guide, which tracks how often Apple traditionally updates each product, then states how many days it has been since the last refresh and whether consumers should buy now or wait. At the time of publication, the MacBook, Apple's smallest laptop, has not been updated for 407 days compared to an average of 375 days. The MacBook Air, however, has gone 814 days since an update compared to an average of 350. The MacBook Pro is the newest of the Apple laptop family, having seen an update 216 days ago. This is just over 100 days short of the computer's average, but MacRumors has applied a caution note to it regardless. Further evidence of a refresh comes from the online Apple Store, which reports a week-long delivery time for some models of MacBook Pro, suggesting that stock is drying up in anticipation of something new. As Apple blog 9to5Mac states: "When shipping dates lapse at the Apple Online Store, it is often a good indicator that a new version is coming soon. When those dates coincide with an Apple event, it's an even stronger signal." The iMac, Apple's desktop computer, is also well overdue an update at 596 days compared to an average of 317 and the Mac Mini sits at 958 days, over double the average update cycle. But, for now, all rumours point towards WWDC 2017 being about MacBooks - and an Amazon Echo rival dubbed the Siri Speaker.

Given the fact that this is a high-end platform, GIGABYTE has opted to use their premium AORUS brand for all three initial models, which are the X299 AORUS Gaming 9, X299 AORUS Gaming 7, and X299 AORUS Gaming 3. Starting off with the flagship X299 AORUS Gaming 9, we get to see GIGABYTE's unconstrained vision for this new HEDT platform. The X299 AORUS Gaming 9 has what appears to be a 12-phase CPU power design, and features Nippon Chemi-Con 10K Durable Black solid capacitors everywhere but in the audio subsystem. There are two 8-pin CPU/EPS power connectors, which should come in handy if a high TDP 18-core Skylake-X processor is installed or just when doing some extreme overclocking. Making full use of this platform numerous PCIe lanes, there are five mechanical PCIe x16 slots, all of which have been mechanically reinforced with steel and additional anchor points for improved retention and shearing resistance. Two of the slots run at x16, one of the slots runs at x8, and the other two are limited to x4, which means that this motherboard will 'only' be able to handle up to three-way graphics card configurations. Storage connectivity appears to be excellent with eight SATA 6Gb/s ports and three M.2 slots that support SATA, PCI-E, NVMe M.2 solid state drives and Intel's new Optane Memory technology. All three slots feature a Thermal Guard cover to help protect and cool the M.2 drives. For those who need a fourth M.2 slot, GIGABYTE have also included an M.2 add-in card in the accessories bundle. If the lack of an U.2 port is a concern, worry not since there is also a  M.2 to U.2 adapter included. This motherboard also supports four USB 2.0 ports (two headers), eight USB 3.0 ports (four rear, two headers), and seven USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (five rear, one header). Focusing on the full-speed USB 3.1 Gen2 ports, there are an impressive four Type-A ports and one Type-C port on the rear I/O panel, and a USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel internal header next to the memory slots. At least some of this USB 3.1 Gen2 connectivity is courtesy of the brand new ASMedia 3142 controller. When it comes to networking, there are two gigabit LAN ports, one powered by an Intel controller and one by a Rivet Networks Killer E2500 chip. The onboard dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi is courtesy of a Killer Wireless-AC 1535 module that supports transfer rates of up to 867Mbps. The wired and wireless Killer interfaces can be used together via the Killer DoubleShot Pro feature to direct high priority traffic to the fastest interface or they can be combined to create one very high throughput interface. While the name might be familiar - Amp-Up Audio - this motherboard features a brand new high-end onboard audio design. It is based on the familiar Realtek ALC1220 codec, but it has been bolstered by some pretty serious components, like a ESS SABRE 9018K2M DAC, Texas Instruments LME 49720 and OPA1622 OP-AMPs, and WIMA audio capacitors. They have also included Creative's Sound BlasterX 720° audio engine software. As should be pretty clear from the above picture, the X299 AORUS Gaming 9 has been outfitted with a ton of RGB LED lighting zones. There are LEDs between the individual memory slots, on both sides of each of the the PCIe slots, built into the chipset cooler, and there's even LED strips integrated into the I/O and audio section covers. Even the rear I/O shield glows! If that's not enough, there are also three headers on which you can plug LED light strips. Speaking of headers, there are seven fan headers, including three water pump headers, one of which is a high current 3 amp version. Apparently some of these Hybrid Fan headers that can provide up-to-the-second information on flow-rate and water temperature and can be monitored in the Smart Fan 5 software suite. The two onboard temperature sensor headers should also be able to feed data into the utility. The bottom edge of the motherboards features an interesting assortment of power and reset buttons, clear CMOS button, ECO button, OC button, and a Debug LED. Last, but not least, the back of the motherboard is covered by a metal armor plate, which will add structural rigidity and protect the various components, solder points, and traces. The X299 AORUS Gaming 7 is far more similar to the Gaming 9 than it is different. When it comes to expansion slots and storage connectivity everything is exactly the same. The only differences are that two of the three M.2 Thermal Guards are missing, and the M.2 to U.2 adapter is not included in the accessories bundle. The onboard audio features the greatest change, with a swap from the ESS Sabre ES9018K2M to the ES9018Q2Ca and the removal of one of the two op-amps. The X299 AORUS Gaming 7 is also missing the fancy glowing I/O shield, though the other RGB FUSION lighting features all remain identical. Since there is no Gaming 5 model yet, the step down from the X299 AORUS Gaming 7 to the X299 AORUS Gaming 3 is a little more severe than between the two previous models. Most notably, the Gaming 3 only has one 8-pin CPU/EPS power connector and only two of its PCIe x16 slots are steel-reinforced. The other clear difference is that there is only two M.2 slots - down one from the higher-end models - and there are no M.2 Thermal Guards at all. The USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel connector has been replaced with a USB 3.0 version, and three of the USB 3.1 Gen2 ports on the rear I/O panel have been replaced by USB 3.0 ports. So in total, this model has four USB 2.0 ports (two headers), ten USB 3.0 ports (six rear, two headers), and two USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (two rear). Speaking of rear I/O, there is only one gigabit LAN port and no Wi-Fi on the X299 AUROS Gaming 3. The onboard audio has also been demoted, with no DAC or op-amps, and no plastic shroud covering that area either. The RGB FUSION lighting feature has also been cut-down a bit, with no LEDs in between the memory slots and only the two primary PCIe x16 slots being lit instead of all five. While we don't yet have any pricing information for any of the models, the GIGABYTE X299 AORUS Gaming series will be available for purchase sometime in June 2017.

Reply Gothmoth - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link other websites have posted images and infos about X399 boards for 2 days now. could anandtech maybe bring some infos about the x399 boards at computex too? i don´t want to pay 1000+ euro to get my hands on 44 pci lanes. Reply Mark02474 - Saturday, June 03, 2017 - link Disappointing. Has Gigabyte forsaken Thunderbolt 3? Dual Thunderbolt 3 ought to be on the CPU PCIe lanes to get full speed unlike starved Z270 implementation. Here too all those USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports +NVMe + SATA3 are vastly oversubscribed. 8 lanes are enough for me for a single graphics card and I'd rather have the others used for TB3 and NVMe RAID. Audio DACs a disappointment too. New ESS Pro series vastly better than older 9018 parts.

School Zone Latest insights, news in education Features Education Sentinel School Zone Trinity Prep student wins a top award in prestigious Intel science competition Amber Yang, 18, a senior at Trinity Preparatory School created a project that tracks space debris in orbit that won a top prize, $50,000 scholarship, in prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist competition. Amber Yang, 18, a senior at Trinity Preparatory School created a project that tracks space debris in orbit that won a top prize, $50,000 scholarship, in prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist competition. Leslie PostalContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Years ago, Amber Yang’s mother decided to feed her daughter’s budding interest in science by hanging a poster of famous scientists in the hallway outside her bedroom. The poster, hung low enough so the then-second grader could read about all their achievements, seems to have done its job. Still on the wall in the family’s Windermere-area home, the poster is now surrounded by plaques and awards celebrating the 18-year-old’s success in science competitions. The latest addition is from earlier this month, a top prize from the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Yang won a “young scientist award” — and a $50,000 prize — for a mathematical analysis used to predict the location of space debris. Her project involves a computer simulation that detects the space junk and then figures out where it will travel next. The goal is to help avoid collisions with spacecraft. The award was an “incredible honor,” she said, and validation of three years of work. She spent hours on her laptop in her room, reading astrophysics journals and learning a computer program to help with her project. She even turned down her mother’s offer to take a cruise during Christmas break last year because she wanted to spend the time on her research. The award also was a huge confidence boost for the teenager who said she had plenty of days when she doubted her efforts, in part because several attempts led to nothing but red error messages on her laptop screen. “This path to success was not easy,” she said. The final round of the competition, held in Los Angeles, was intense and rewarding, giving her a chance to spend time with other teenagers equally passionate about studying science. “It was this great gathering of nerds,” she added with a laugh. Yang’s work stood out even among other excellent projects, said Len Duda, who just retired from the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and served as a coach for the physics and astronomy division at the Intel competition. “I think everyone was just kind of amazed with what she did,” Duda said. The Intel competition “is like the Super Bowl of science fairs,” bringing together some 1,700 student projects from across the country and the world, he said. “To me, just being able to get there is an accomplishment.” Yang won “best in category” in her division and then one of the three top prizes overall. The prize money will help offset costs at Stanford University, where the senior at Trinity Preparatory School will enroll this fall. She plans to major in physics, with a concentration in astrophysics. At Trinity, Yang was a top student who took Advanced Placement chemistry and calculus as a 10th grader — far sooner than most students do — and plenty of other tough courses in the following years. “What’s great is really the way she throws herself into learning,” said Stephanie Dryden, Trinity’s co-director of college counseling. Yang impressed teachers not only with her academic achievements, but also with how down-to-earth and well-rounded she is and how well she tackled challenges, Dryden said. The teenager also played the violin and piano, served as an editor for the student newspaper and read voraciously. As a child, Yang said she was always “the weird kid who was obsessed with space” and loved trips the Kennedy Space Center. Her parents, Joyce Teng and Brian Yang, are both engineers who work at Lockheed Martin and encouraged her interests. Yang liked reading about the scientists on her poster, from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. But early on, she had a question for her mom: “Why are there so few women? They’re all guys.” As she got older, she realized women remain underrepresented in the sciences, particularly in the field she hopes to pursue, and girls often leave the math-science pipeline well before college. She understands why. In middle school, she was the only girl on her school’s robotics team, and the boys left her out, seemingly convinced she had nothing to offer. That discouraged her. But as she explained in a December TEDx talk she gave in Jacksonville, a high school science teacher who said, “Amber Yang can do whatever she wants, if she puts her mind to it” made a difference. “The next time you see the only girl in the room, ask her for her ideas on how to build that robot,” she told the audience at the event meant to showcase “inspiring ideas.” Yang applied to speak at the annual gathering. Her talk was about her efforts to complete her research and to find her place. Yang, who earned a second-place prize at the Intel fair last year and was a finalist in another national competition, said she began her project after reading news reports about an exploded Chinese space satellite and how the debris posed a possible threat to other spacecraft. When she learned data on space debris was publicly available, she knew she could do her project on her laptop, from her pink bedroom stacked with textbooks and notebooks befitting her academic interests and a few relics of her younger years, including stuffed animals and a Hello Kitty pillow. In the years ahead, she hopes to encourage other girls to stick with science, if that is their passion, and some day hopefully help create a different looking famous-scientists poster. “I see myself as having this duty to encourage girls to pursue that,” she added. lpostal@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5273 Student's love of math adds up to big prize » Caption Central Florida’s third graders scored better on the state’s key reading exam this year than last, mirroring an increase seen across Florida.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is reportedly hammering out the details: "They're deciding on whether to initiate a full, formal withdrawal — which could take three years — or exit the underlying United Nations Treaty, which would be faster but more extreme," Axios writes. The Paris agreement, dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, has been signed by every nation except Nicaragua and Syria. Pruitt and Trump have called the global agreement "a bad deal for America." Climate scientists have expressed alarm at the United States' exit: "A Trump presidency might be game over for the climate. It might make it impossible to stabilize planetary warming below dangerous levels," scientist Michael Mann said. "If Trump makes good on his campaign promises and pulls out of the Paris Treaty, it is difficult to see a path forward to keeping warming below dangerous levels." Read more about why the Paris climate agreement is a big deal and why ditching the agreement could have global consequences. Jeva Lange   Trump has reportedly decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord May 31, 2017 arrests Edit 14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. ET   Scott Olson/Getty Images Police in Portland, Oregon, arrested 14 people Sunday during dueling demonstrations attended by supporters of President Trump, anti-fascist protesters, and residents concerned about hate speech. Hundreds of people attended the "Trump Free Speech" rally at Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, CNN reports, and even more counter-protesters gathered across the street. Police say at first, the two sides yelled expletives at each other, then counter-protesters started to throw glass bottles and bricks at the officers, who responded by using pepper spray. Tensions in the city have been high since three men were stabbed last week, two fatally, on a light-rail train by a man who was allegedly yelling anti-Muslim statements at two young women. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had unsuccessfully requested that the permit be revoked for the free-speech rally, saying, "I'm a strong supporter of the First Amendment no matter what the views are that are being expressed, but given the timing of this rally, I believed we had a case to make about the threats to public safety." Organizer Joey Gibson noted that the protest was planned before the murders, said he is not racist or a member of the alt-right movement, and argued that the rally was not in support of stabbing suspect Jeremy Christian.

Rodriguez/Getty Images Wonder Woman brought in an estimated $100.5 million during its North America debut this weekend, making it the best opening ever for a movie directed by a woman. Directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot, the well-received Wonder Woman outperformed such superhero flicks as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy at their openings. Catherine Garcia   Wonder Woman has biggest opening weekend for a female-directed movie 9:54 p.m. Manchester Attack Edit One Love Manchester concert raises $2.6 million for bombing victims 9:09 p.m. ET   Getty Images More than 50,000 people filled the Old Trafford Cricket Grounds Sunday for the One Love Manchester benefit concert, featuring Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, the Black Eyed Peas, Justin Bieber, Oasis' Liam Gallagher, and Robbie Williams. Organizers said the concert, which had a heavy police presence, raised £2 million ($2.57 million) for the victims and families of those killed two weeks ago at Grande's concert in Manchester. The crowd was filled with people holding signs of support for Manchester and the victims, and Grande said the "kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now." With the £2 million raised Sunday, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has collected more than £10 million in donations. Catherine Garcia   One Love Manchester concert raises $2.6 million for bombing victims 9:09 p.m. London Bridge attack Edit ISIS claims responsibility for London attacks 8:33 p.m. ET   Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images The Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the Saturday night attacks in London that left seven people dead and 48 wounded. The official ISIS news agency posted a message Sunday claiming that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks yesterday," the SITE Intelligence Group reports, including running into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people at Borough Market. Police shot and killed the three suspects, and later arrested 12 people in East London connected to one of the suspects, a man who wore a fake bomb vest. Investigators said they do not see any links so far between what happened in London and the suicide bombing in Manchester two weeks ago that killed more than 20 people. Catherine Garcia   ISIS claims responsibility for London attacks 8:33 p.m. Quotables Edit Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. ET   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he has no substantial relationship with ousted U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn while speaking with NBC's Megyn Kelly in an interview that was filmed on Friday and will air in full Sunday evening. "You and I, you and I personally, have a much closer relationship than I had with Mr. Flynn," Putin said in a translated voiceover. In Putin's account of a widely circulated photo of the Russian president eating dinner next to Flynn, the seating arrangement was unexpected. "I got up and left," Putin said. "And then afterwards I was told, 'You know there was an American gentleman. He was involved in some things. He used to be in the security services' ... that's it. I didn't even really talk to him." Flynn is now subject to a criminal investigation pertaining to his possible communication with Russian officials during and after the 2016 election. Watch an excerpt of the Kelly interview below. Bonnie Kristian   Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. A house divided Edit 2 GOP senators critique Trump's travel ban plan 12:30 p.m. ET   Pool/Getty Images President Trump used Saturday's terror attack in London as an occasion to tout his travel ban executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, which remains stalled pending a Supreme Court ruling. "We need to be smart, vigilant and tough," he wrote on Twitter. "We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump's rallying cry has not been met with universal acclaim, including within his own party. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News Sunday he believes "the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting," but that this could be accomplished "without a travel ban." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was even less enthusiastic. "I think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it has been rejected by the courts," she said Sunday in a CBS interview, while allowing that the U.S. should do a "better job of vetting." Across the aisle, Trump's raising of the travel ban topic also came under fire from former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who served under President Obama. "There's a very real risk that by stigmatizing and isolating Muslims from particular countries, and Muslims in general, that we alienate the very communities here in the United States whose cooperation we most need to detect and prevent these homegrown extremists from being able to carry out attacks," she said while appearing on ABC News.

"Just because we got out of a club doesn't mean we don't care about the environment," she added. These comments were more direct than those from EPA chief Scott Pruitt, though Haley echoed his phrasing in saying Trump believes "the climate changes" rather than "in climate change." Haley also argued a main reason Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is he wanted to be honest about what could realistically be accomplished. The climate pact terms former President Obama negotiated weren't "achievable, even if we had stayed in the Paris Agreement, and this is the part everyone needs to think about," Haley said, "If we had stayed in the Paris Agreement ... what President Obama submitted the U.S. to was not achievable under our standards or any other country's standards, and then we've got to look at the fact we didn't want to be in violation of the agreement." Watch two excerpts of Haley's interview below.

While we’ll visit their booth for a product tour tomorrow, this evening that had the Republic of Gamers press conference. Targeted specifically at gamers and DiY enthusiasts ASUS introduced the Republic of Gamers (ROG) segment of products several years ago. The ROG branding these days is so big and special that there now are separate press conferences with product introductions for it.  The photo gallery covers all products launched and shown today, and you guys are in luck as seriously hot babe was presenting them all, so please do get your freak on. New items introduced are motherboards, the X399 and Intel X299 range. On stage also was Mr. Huang, CEO of Nvidia talking all things games, VR, and AR.  ASUS has a ton of stuff to show. A new card VROC that can house up-to eight M2 units and reach silly performance in RAID mode over a full X16 PCI-Express link. The unit default towards software RAID, hardware raid needs to be enabled (unlocked) through a physical unlock key and only allows usage of Intel based M2 units. The RAID 0/1 solution will be expensive and starts at 150 USD, for RAID 5 you need to pay roughly 250 USD. We'll post more info later. At the event we also learned that in the Intel procs launched initially are up-to 12-cores, which verifies that the 14, 16 and 18 core parts will be released in a much later stage in time. In the photos you can see a screenshot of a 10-core Intel processor, ASUS did not even have a 12-core part available for testing. So this means the Intel processor launch certainly isn't a hard-launch. We'll have to wait and see when the many core procs are available.  Now I can write a million words here, but well who am I kidding as chances are pretty good that your focus will be the the hotty presenting the products. Once your blood returns to the head, please do check out the ASUS ROG hardware photos. I’ll try and add some more specs and info once I have time for it. ASUS Talks Aura sync as universal implementation for  everything and anything RGB in the PC platform. ASUS is releasing an AURA SDK that can be used by other manufacturers that want to do RGB. ASUS also shows the PG35VQ monitor, a 35" monitor. We will look at that one tomorrow with the ASUS booth tour and take some photos. ASUS on the ROG event also announced its all new gaming notebook called Zyphyrus. This Core i5 and i7 driven laptop is powered by a GTX 1080, and is a slim laptop, actually the slimmest gaming laptop in the world. The laptop is 16.9mm up-to to 17.9mm tick (on it's thickest spot).  Have a browse through the photos of the ROG event. Tagged as: Computex 2017 Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ...

However, the company also teased its upcoming 8th-generation “Coffee Lake” processors which will be powering Apple’s MacBooks in next year. Intel’s Coffee Lake processors will be able to deliver 30 percent more performance than the 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips. “We will have more to say about the 8th Gen Intel Core processor in the future but it’s exciting to share that in the latest testing, we’re seeing a performance improvement of more than 30 percent over the 7th Gen Intel Core processor,” Intel senior executive Gregory Bryant said. Intel’s most recent testing results appear to be more than what the company initially claimed back in February. At the time, Intel said that the 8th-generation chip would only see a 15 percent improvement. Intel used the benchmark tool SYSmark 2014 version 1.5 to test one processor from each generation, accoridng to Apple Insider. For Kaby Lake, Intel used the 17-7500U with 8GB of DDR4-2133 RAM, while Coffee Lake used an undisclosed “estimates” for a processor with DDR4-2400 memory. The turbo clock speed of the Coffee Lake processor is up to 4GHz, but it’s base clock speed was not given. Although the tests shows that the Coffee Lake processor is indeed a huge improvement from its Kaby Lake counterpart, Intel says that estimates are “Pre-Silicon and are subject to change, with a 7 percent margin of error. Even with that in mind, Intel’s Coffee Lake processors will surely deliver on improved performance. Intel says that it plans to make its Coffee Lake lineup available to computer makers sometime during the second half of 2017. This should mean that the first wave computer rocking the next-generation chips will arrive sometime during the holiday season. The Coffee Lake chips should also be able to provide faster performance and longer battery life for MacBooks. Apple’s current Mac lineup isn’t even using the Kaby Lake yet chips yet, so it’s very likely that MacBooks with Coffee Lake chips will arrive next year. With Intel already teasing its Coffee Lake processors, the new chip seems like a promising feature that will come included on next year’s MacBook Pro lineup. However, the new chip has some caveats. It’s very unlikely that Apple’s future MacBook Pro will feature 32GB of RAM. Coffee Lake doesn’t support LPDDR4 RAM which makes it possible it possible to have that much memory. When Apple starts using Intel’s Coffee Lake chips for its MacBook Pro lineup, users will only be able to get a maximum of 16GB of RAM. IBT reported yesterday that Apple is planning to announce new versions of its 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. There’s also rumors floating around that the MacBook Air, which hasn’t been updated for years now, might also see an upgrade as well. Apple’s upgraded MacBook Pro is said to finally feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. As for the rest of the lineup, those will also receive some upgrades as well, but the Kaby Lake processors have not bee confirmed to be included.

Intel's massive 18-core Core i9 chip starts a bloody battle for enthusiast PCs Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Storage buffs will get a massive dose of fun when Intel’s X299 chipset launches. The new Core i9 chipset will support up to 20 devices in a bootable RAID partition. The overlooked featured is called Virtual RAID On CPU (VROC). We got taste of it courtesy of Asus, which showed the feature running in its new X299 motherboards using a 10-core Skylake-X CPU. Few motherboards support more than three M.2 slots, so Asus used its new Hyper M.2 PCIe card. The Hyper M.2 lets you load up to four M.2 NVME PCIe drives into a single x16 card. You don’t have to worry about heat, because the Hyper M.2 features a beefy heat sink, thermal pads, and an active fan. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] IDG/Gordon Mah Ung The Asus Hyper M.2 features active cooling to keep your drives from overheating If you populated the Hyper M.2 with four drives and dropped it into a slot even on an older motherboard, it would work, but all you would see is four individual M.2 drives. What’s new is the ability to RAID it. All you have to do is boot into the board’s BIOS and enable Intel’s VROC feature. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung You enable VROC simply by going into the Hyper M.2 PCIe card's BIOS. Once you’ve done that you can see your drives. For this demonstration, Asus used eight Intel M.2 600P SSDs. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung The VROC demo used eight Intel 512GB SSDs. But wait, you say, you can only put four drives into the Hyper M.2 card—how did we do eight drives? Just use two Hyper M.2 drives. As Coach Madden says: Boom. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung And yes, you can build a RAID with two Hyper M.2 cards. For a quick performance run, Asus used the industry-standard Iometer test as well as Crystal Disk Mark. Below is what it looks like to have a bootable Windows partition with eight M.2 drives. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung With eight Intel SSDs, this Asus X299 motherboard can hit 12GBps of transfer speed. Yes, that’s 12GBps. What’s crazy is that it’s nowhere close to the maximum that VROC supports. With 20 devices, Intel says it can, in theory, hit 128GBps. Asus officials say right now they’re seeing as high as 13GBps, and they thinks there’s more performance to be wrung out of VROC as it matures. What’s the catch? There’s always a catch, and with Intel’s VROC there’s actually multiple catches. The Asus Hyper M.2 card works perfectly fine with, say, a Samsung 960 Pro, and you could see four individual Samsung drives in RAID. If you want to use VROC to create a bootable partition, though, you can use only Intel SSDs. Here's another catch: X299 will launch with Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs, but Intel VROC will work only with Skylake-X.  What may the biggest catch is this little thing right here: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s Virtual RAID On CPU supports up to 20 drives in RAID 0 for free, but if you want more RAID 1 or other redundant setups, you need to buy this key from Intel. No, we’re not making this up. That little dongle is a key that Intel will sell to consumers. Out of the box, if you have Intel drives, an Asus Hyper M.2, and a Skylake-X, you can build a RAID 0 partition. But if you want to enable RAID 1, RAID 5, or other RAID schemes with redundancy to protect your data, you have to buy this Intel key to enable it. If you scroll back to the first BIOS shot, you can see the “premium” mode is enabled, which means it supports the premium RAID support. How much? No one seems to know. So why would Intel put all this work into a feature and then add a surcharge which could kill its adoption? Intel officials weren’t on hand to say, but the surcharge is related to the enterprise underpinnings of the Core i9 and X299 platform, where the feature is an up-sell. Intel can’t sell it to one customer and give it away to another, can they? To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

One thing the senators — and a federal grand jury in Virginia, and the FBI — will likely find, The Wall Street Journal reports, is a documentary-style film about Turkey that Flynn's consulting firm worked on last year but never finished. The film apparently makes up the bulk of the $530,000 the Flynn Intel Group was paid by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman close to Turkey's president. Alptekin says he hired the Flynn Intel Group to help burnish Turkey's image after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Erdogan's subsequent crackdown. Erdogan has blamed the coup on a Turkish imam in Pennsylvania, Fethullah Gulen, and Alptekin tells the Journal he envisioned the documentary as "a small, 60 Minutes kind of a thing" to expose America to the purported dangers Gulen poses. The U.S. has so far rebuffed Erdogan's demands for Gulen's extradition. Bijan Kian, the head of Flynn Intel Group, told the film crew different things, and some of them — including Rudi Bakhtiar, a former CNN anchor, and ex-VICE News correspondent David Enders — say they were badly misled. Bakhtiar told the Journal that it quickly became clear she was working on a hit-piece on Gulen. Enders said Kian did not want his or Flynn's fingerprints on this: "He said: 'We don't want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this.'" The Journal's Dion Nissenbaum has an overview of the documentary: Alptekin paid the Flynn Intel Group in three installments, saying the money came from his firm, not Turkey's government; with each payment, Flynn's group sent back $40,000 in "consulting fees" that Alptekin insists were really rebates. The last payment was on Nov. 14, two days before Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser. The film was shelved. On Nov. 8, Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill urging the U.S. to extradite Gulen, using an image a PR firm had produced to promote the documentary. In March, after he was pushed out of the White House, Flynn belatedly registered as a foreign agent for his work with Turkey. You can read more at The Wall Street Journal. Peter Weber   Michael Flynn's firm apparently made an unfinished film targeting an Erdogan critic May 31, 2017 arrests Edit 14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. ET   Scott Olson/Getty Images Police in Portland, Oregon, arrested 14 people Sunday during dueling demonstrations attended by supporters of President Trump, anti-fascist protesters, and residents concerned about hate speech. Hundreds of people attended the "Trump Free Speech" rally at Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, CNN reports, and even more counter-protesters gathered across the street. Police say at first, the two sides yelled expletives at each other, then counter-protesters started to throw glass bottles and bricks at the officers, who responded by using pepper spray. Tensions in the city have been high since three men were stabbed last week, two fatally, on a light-rail train by a man who was allegedly yelling anti-Muslim statements at two young women. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had unsuccessfully requested that the permit be revoked for the free-speech rally, saying, "I'm a strong supporter of the First Amendment no matter what the views are that are being expressed, but given the timing of this rally, I believed we had a case to make about the threats to public safety." Organizer Joey Gibson noted that the protest was planned before the murders, said he is not racist or a member of the alt-right movement, and argued that the rally was not in support of stabbing suspect Jeremy Christian. Catherine Garcia   14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. Breaking Records Edit Wonder Woman has biggest opening weekend for a female-directed movie 9:54 p.m. ET   Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Wonder Woman brought in an estimated $100.5 million during its North America debut this weekend, making it the best opening ever for a movie directed by a woman. Directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot, the well-received Wonder Woman outperformed such superhero flicks as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy at their openings. Catherine Garcia   Wonder Woman has biggest opening weekend for a female-directed movie 9:54 p.m. Manchester Attack Edit One Love Manchester concert raises $2.6 million for bombing victims 9:09 p.m. ET   Getty Images More than 50,000 people filled the Old Trafford Cricket Grounds Sunday for the One Love Manchester benefit concert, featuring Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, the Black Eyed Peas, Justin Bieber, Oasis' Liam Gallagher, and Robbie Williams. Organizers said the concert, which had a heavy police presence, raised £2 million ($2.57 million) for the victims and families of those killed two weeks ago at Grande's concert in Manchester. The crowd was filled with people holding signs of support for Manchester and the victims, and Grande said the "kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now." With the £2 million raised Sunday, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has collected more than £10 million in donations. Catherine Garcia   One Love Manchester concert raises $2.6 million for bombing victims 9:09 p.m. London Bridge attack Edit ISIS claims responsibility for London attacks 8:33 p.m. ET   Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images The Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the Saturday night attacks in London that left seven people dead and 48 wounded. The official ISIS news agency posted a message Sunday claiming that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks yesterday," the SITE Intelligence Group reports, including running into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people at Borough Market. Police shot and killed the three suspects, and later arrested 12 people in East London connected to one of the suspects, a man who wore a fake bomb vest. Investigators said they do not see any links so far between what happened in London and the suicide bombing in Manchester two weeks ago that killed more than 20 people. Catherine Garcia   ISIS claims responsibility for London attacks 8:33 p.m. Quotables Edit Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. ET   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he has no substantial relationship with ousted U.S. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn while speaking with NBC's Megyn Kelly in an interview that was filmed on Friday and will air in full Sunday evening. "You and I, you and I personally, have a much closer relationship than I had with Mr. Flynn," Putin said in a translated voiceover. In Putin's account of a widely circulated photo of the Russian president eating dinner next to Flynn, the seating arrangement was unexpected. "I got up and left," Putin said. "And then afterwards I was told, 'You know there was an American gentleman. He was involved in some things. He used to be in the security services' ... that's it. I didn't even really talk to him." Flynn is now subject to a criminal investigation pertaining to his possible communication with Russian officials during and after the 2016 election. Watch an excerpt of the Kelly interview below. Bonnie Kristian   Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. A house divided Edit 2 GOP senators critique Trump's travel ban plan 12:30 p.m. ET   Pool/Getty Images President Trump used Saturday's terror attack in London as an occasion to tout his travel ban executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, which remains stalled pending a Supreme Court ruling. "We need to be smart, vigilant and tough," he wrote on Twitter. "We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump's rallying cry has not been met with universal acclaim, including within his own party. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News Sunday he believes "the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting," but that this could be accomplished "without a travel ban." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was even less enthusiastic. "I think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it has been rejected by the courts," she said Sunday in a CBS interview, while allowing that the U.S. should do a "better job of vetting." Across the aisle, Trump's raising of the travel ban topic also came under fire from former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who served under President Obama. "There's a very real risk that by stigmatizing and isolating Muslims from particular countries, and Muslims in general, that we alienate the very communities here in the United States whose cooperation we most need to detect and prevent these homegrown extremists from being able to carry out attacks," she said while appearing on ABC News. Bonnie Kristian   2 GOP senators critique Trump's travel ban plan 12:30 p.m. Sunday shows Edit Nikki Haley says 'Trump believes the climate is changing' and 'pollutants are part of the equation' 11:40 a.m. ET   CNN/Screenshot "President Trump believes the climate is changing and he believes pollutants are part of the equation," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that taped Saturday and aired in full on Sunday. "Just because we got out of a club doesn't mean we don't care about the environment," she added. These comments were more direct than those from EPA chief Scott Pruitt, though Haley echoed his phrasing in saying Trump believes "the climate changes" rather than "in climate change." Haley also argued a main reason Trump decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is he wanted to be honest about what could realistically be accomplished. The climate pact terms former President Obama negotiated weren't "achievable, even if we had stayed in the Paris Agreement, and this is the part everyone needs to think about," Haley said, "If we had stayed in the Paris Agreement ... what President Obama submitted the U.S. to was not achievable under our standards or any other country's standards, and then we've got to look at the fact we didn't want to be in violation of the agreement." Watch two excerpts of Haley's interview below.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Fintech Blockchain Cornell's blockchain experts tackle off-chain transactions with Intel SGX Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer was demonstrating IC3's Teechain at Consensus 2017. By Ian Allison Updated May 31, 2017 12:08 BST There were many exciting announcements at Consensus 2017, the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry's annual gathering. A particularly nice one involves the continuing marriage between a team of distributed systems experts from Cornell University and Intel SGX (software guard extensions). The latter is a set of new instructions from Intel that allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory called enclaves. Cornell's Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3) was demonstrating the newest version of "Teechain", an off-chain transaction protocol which uses SGX (incidentally, IC3 was not the only team touting interesting blockchain applications using SGX; watch this space for more to come). Teechain can offer state channel-like transaction rates, while addressing the problem of transaction malleability: if you have any piece of data that can be altered in the transaction without having the transaction itself becoming invalid you have a case of malleability. Payment channels offer a very powerful way to remove pressure from the blockchain by netting together transactions in series, while only having to place the opening and closing transactions on the blockchain. However, transaction malleability means it is not safe to accept a chain of unconfirmed transactions because the later transactions will depend on the hashes of the previous transactions, and those hashes can be changed, up until they are confirmed in a block. To counter the potential risk here, both parties would have to closely scan the blockchain for what the other is doing, and know what to look out for. A useful analogy would be cheque kiting, whereby a fraud can be committed when cheques are used as a form of unauthorised credit to make use of non-existent funds in a bank account. Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer said: "The problem until now has been that the existing solutions require changes to the blockchain, they require that the blockchain be non-malleable. "The existing solutions are highly dependent on being able to watch that blockchain. There are rumours, claims that maybe you could get Lightning to not be dependent on this kind of thing, but I have never seen them properly specified; I have never seen them actually implemented. "So everybody wants this non-malleability. It's a good feature to have, but it's one that wasn't being deployed." Teechain, short for "trusted execution environments", uses SGX secure hardware to prevent this sort of cheque kiting, ensuring parties cannot manufacture or push old state onto the blockchain. It also achieves enormous speed ups in off chain transactions. Gün Sirer said: "We are doing UK to US transactions at a rate of about 50,000 transactions per second. So that means a transaction every 20 microseconds. That's a lot of transactions. And you can be doing any number of these in parallel. "So between any two parties it can do 50,000 tsx/s; in fact if the parties are closer together it can do even better than that, and it can do it with multiple pairs of participants at the same time." So if the solution to scaling blockchains lies in hardware, why isn't everyone using this approach? "Partly because it's non-trivial to do that transition," said Gün Sirer. "You need to have some expertise on how to build software on top of these hardware platforms, and partly because the hardware platforms are becoming ubiquitous only now." He also pointed out that signing keys to use Intel's SGX have not been given out willy-nilly; some major players in the blockchain space were denied the right because Intel did not trust them. "Essentially you will be handling people's money so you need to be vetted, in this case by the manufacturer of the hardware platform. They don't want you using their hardware for malfeasance, building Ponzi schemes, say, and they don't want you writing bad code that will lose people's money." In a nutshell, SGX hardware hardware allows the user to perform computations on the chip that are unmolested and that are guaranteed to be isolated from any and all malware. So even if there was a hacker on your machine, he or she could not get to the code that is running inside this encrypted enclave. The other key ability is called remote attestation: the chip running this code securely in this enclave can prove to a third party what exact code is running. "So you can prove that to me that you are running the code I trust and now we have a basis for building up something much more complicated. "Most complications in distributed systems stem from not knowing what the counterparties will do, and so the protocols get complex because you have to deal with anything and everything that the other party might decide to do at any time." Gün Sirer said the Teechain solution would be good for Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. "We are quite excited about this. In fact it doesn't have to be for either of those things, it could also be for SWIFT; you could use it for sending money. They could probably use some of our techniques."

Announced Tuesday at Computex in Taipei, Intel’s answer to AMD’s 16-core, 32-thread Threadripper is an 18-core, 36-thread monster microprocessor of its own, tailor-made for elite PC enthusiasts. The Core i9 Extreme Edition i9-7980XE, what Intel calls the first teraflop desktop PC processor ever, will be priced at (gulp!) $1,999 when it ships later this year. In a slightly lower tier will be the meat of the Core i9 family: Core i9 X-series chips in 16-core, 14-core, 12-core, and 10-core versions, with prices climbing from $999 to $1,699. All of these new Skylake-based parts will offer improvements over their older Broadwell-E counterparts: 15 percent faster in single-threaded apps and 10 percent faster in multithreaded tasks, Intel says.  If these Core i9 X-series chips—code-named “Basin Falls”—are too rich for your blood, Intel also introduced three new Core i7 X-series chips, priced from $339 to $599, and a $242 quad-core Core i5. All of the new chips are due “in the coming weeks,” Intel said. Most of the Core i9 chips will incorporate what Intel calls an updated Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, a feature where the chip identifies not just one, but two cores as the “best” cores, and makes them available to be dynamically overclocked to higher speeds when needed. They’ll be Optane-ready, too, with over 130 Optane-ready motherboards waiting in the wings, Intel said. If there’s a catch, it’s that all of the new 165W, 140W, and 112W chips are designed around the new Socket R4. This 2,066-pin LGA socket is compatible with just one Intel chipset, the new X299, though many X299 motherboards are already being announced. Intel and AMD have a real fight going again, and we’ll have to wait and see who’ll end up on top. With Core i9, Intel’s just staked an aggressive claim to the high end of the market. AMD will now be forced to disclose the 14, 12, and 10-core versions of its Threadripper parts, as well as their prices. Intel’s laid down its cards, but the hand has yet to be played. Intel’s disclosure of the new Core i9 chips may be one of the most significant announcements this week at Computex, the Taipei-based trade show that has quietly evolved into a celebration of all things PC. But you can expect much more from Intel, too, including this bombshell: Intel executives will reveal that its next 10nm chip, Cannon Lake, will deliver 30 percent greater performance than the current Kaby Lake chips, a spokeswoman said. Intel also revealed more details about a wireless link to the HTC Vive VR headset using its WiGig technology. The initial HTC-Intel partnership was announced this past January, at CES. Among the big Core i9 news, Intel also announced availability of its Compute Card, a credit card-sized mini PC that slides into displays, digital whiteboards, and quasi-notebook devices. The Core i9’s speeds and feeds As clock speeds have plateaued at slightly above 4GHz, the challenge has been to find a use for all of the additional cores silicon manufacturers are building into their chips. As we’ve pointed out previously, many games still rely heavily on a single processor core. Intel has turned its attention to a new generation of “streamers” who not only use cores to play the game, but ask other cores within the system to encode the stream to Twitch or YouTube, and perhaps play some music in the background. Intel calls all of these simultaneous activities “megatasking” and sees it as a fantastic way to maintain the demand for ever-greater numbers of cores. “Even gamers are becoming content creators,” Tony Vera, the X-series marketing manager, told reporters. Naturally, with prices topping out at a massive $2,000, only those with money to burn (or a corporate sponsorship) will be able to afford Intel’s latest Core i9 family. The prices and core/thread counts are as follows: Core i9-7980XE: 18-core/36-thread, $1,999  Core i9-7960X: 16-core/32-thread, $1,699 Core i9-7940X: 14-core/28-thread, $1,399 Core i9-7920X: 12-core/24-threads, $1,199 Core i9-7900X (3.3GHz): 10-core/20-thread, $999  For enthusiasts with tighter budgets, Intel will also sell three new Core i7 X-series chips: Core i7 7820X (3.6GHZ), 8-core/16-thread, $599 Core i7-7800X (3.5GHz), 6-core/12-thread, $389 Core i7-7740X (4.3GHz), 4-core/8-thread, $339   All of the new chips are based upon what Intel calls “Skylake-X,” except the i7-7740X, which is designed around the Kaby Lake core.  One of the more interesting features of the new chips is what Intel calls an updated Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. (They apparently ran out of adjectives to describe it.) As Gordon Mah Ung showed in his review of Intel’s Broadwell-E chips, Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 identified one “best core” among all of the available models, varying from chip to chip. The chip could then bind CPU-intensive single-threaded applications to that one core, improving the overall performance. The updated version of Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 identifies two “best cores,” and again assigns the most CPU-intensive threads to them. It’s a nod to games and applications that are better at taking advantage of more cores. Not every chip incorporates the new feature, though, including the new six-core and the two quad-core X-series chips. Here’s Intel’s summary of (some of the) new speeds and feeds, below. Overclocking is a huge focus Not surprisingly, Intel’s not recommending that the new X-series parts be air-cooled. Instead, the company will sell the TS13X cooler, designed for the 165 watts and 140 watts of thermal design power heat the new chips will dissipate. The TS13X uses propylene glycol to pump the heat to a 73.84-CFM fan that generates between 21 and 35 dBA, spinning between 800- and 2,200rpm. The TS13X, priced at between $85 to $100, will ship separately, Intel executives said. Otherwise, Intel will maintain support for per-core overclocking and per-core voltage adjustments, using its Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU). New controllable features include AVX 512 ratio offsets, trim voltage control of the memory control, and PEG/DMI overclocking.  Intel will also offer its “performance tuning protection plan,” a sort of insurance policy for overclockers. The company will let you fry your chip once, just once, and get a single replacement. After that, you’re on your own.  The new X299 chipset keeps the data flowing With all of the teraflop of computational horsepower at its disposal, being able to send and receive data to other parts of the system was a priority. The X299 chipset effectively doubles the bandwidth connection to the SATA 3.0 ports and USB ports by moving to Intel’s latest DMI 3.0. X299 features up to eight SATA 3.0 ports, and increases the USB 3.0 ports to ten, compared with the six ports its predecessor, the X99 chipset, used. The X299 chipset also provides up to 24 PCI Express 3.0 lanes vs. the eight PCIe lanes of Broadwell-E’s X99 chipset. Additional PCIe for such things as high-speed PCIe NVMe drives can also be plumbed directly into the PCIe coming from the CPU itself. On CPUs with 10-cores and up, a full 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 lanes are available for use. The X299 supports faster DDR4-2066 memory, though it’s not clear how much. Intel also tweaked its cache hierarchy, an in-the-weeds adjustment that apparently reduces the overall size of the cache, in favor of putting more near the individual processors. Intel says its new cache shows a higher “hit” rate, which means Intel was probably able to cut the size of the chip but maintain its cache performance. It’s all something to get excited about, whether you’re a potential Core i9 or Core i7 X-series buyer. We’re likely to see motherboard makers and PC makers alike jump on the Core i9 bandwagon, if nothing else but to bring in more of those premium gamer dollars. We’ll keep our eyes peeled for these, and more, this week at Computex.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo Homs: Army Forces Claim More Territory in Syria's Desert Iraqi Volunteer Forces Capture Ba'aj West of Mosul from ISIL Iraqis Leave Zanjili Neighborhood as Security Forces Continue Fighting ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Pounding ISIL with Rockets in Syrian Border Region Syria: Army Soldiers Recapture Maskana's Water Pumping Station in Eastern Aleppo 7 Dead, 48 Injured in London Attacks Damascus: Inside Syrian Army's Tank Factory US-Backed Militants Take Control of Syria's 3rd largest Dam as Kurds Allow ISIL to Withdraw from Raqqa Syrian Soldiers Expel ISIL from Aleppo; Maskana Freed Envoy: Iran to Continue Supporting Syria in Anti-Terror Fight Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in UK Iran Warns Against Terrorist Plots to Undermine Security in Region Iran: Paris Deal Withdrawal Shows US Irresponsibility Towards Int'l Community Dara'a: Syrian Army Kills Tens of Al-Nusra Terrorists, 3 Commanders Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army managed to capture 22 villages and farms near Maskana and eventually forced the ISIL terrorists to retreat from its last stronghold in Aleppo province, the town of Maskana, towards Raqqa province.

(Getty Images) New Delhi: As cricket lovers get ready for the ICC Champions Trophy starting in Britain from June 1, Intel technologies has announced advanced pitch analysis by an Intel drone, profiling the bat swing using a bat sensor and a virtual reality (VR) packed experience for the fans at the stadiums. The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our 'Official Innovation Partner' of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, CEO, ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort," Richardson added in a statement. The bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. Intel will also showcase VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston, to allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," said Atul Srivastava, Managing Director, Speculur which is a Bengaluru-based smart wearables and cognitive computing company. With "Speculur BatSense", aspiring cricketers can measure, track and improve their batting skills.

Reuters/Albert Gea With the Worldwide Developers Conference fast approaching, most are keeping their fingers crossed for the much-talked about release of an upgraded MacBook Pro. While most know that the refreshed notebook will most likely sport an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, it seems logical that an eventual MacBook Pro 2018 will come with a more powerful chipset. Coffee powered MacBook Pro in 2018? According to Apple Insider, the Cupertino company teased the potential release of a MacBook Pro 2018 backed by an Intel Coffee Lake SoC. This would be Intel’s 8th generation processor, pegged to be 30 percent faster than the current Intel Kaby Lake chipset.  Those should be angles worth looking into, though the amount of power in the Intel Coffee Lake chipsets comes a bit of a surprise. This is mainly because of the fact that Intel previously claimed that the next chips would offer performance improvement of only 15 percent.  Intel brands the Intel Coffee Lake as an optimisation of the current Intel Kaby Lake. They are targeting the second half of 2017 to release these new chips.  Going back to the fate of future MacBook Pros, the release date of the Intel Coffee Lake will be crucial. Most know that the Intel Skylake-backed MacBook Pro 2016 garnered disappointment. A lot of it had to do with the timing of the release of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset, something that only stabilised earlier this year.  The 16 GB RAM problem is back While the added power to a MacBook Pro 2018 should be something, there may be bumps ahead. The problem rekindles an issue tied to the MacBook Pro 2016 – the RAM.  In the event that the MacBook Pro 2018 comes with Intel Coffee Lake, it will not include support for LPDDR4. This means that such would allow quantities of memory to be used without requiring the use of a new RAM controller. Instead, it may be best for the MacBook Pro 2018 to consider using the Intel Cannon Lake. These are chipsets produced using a 10-nm process – something that offers a reduction in power usage. The only problem is that there is no certainty when these chips will be shipped.  For now, it would be best to focus on whether an upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 will be shown at the WWDC 2017 on June 5. A launch could hamper the regular schedule of the Cupertino company and may eventually dictate when to expect a MacBook Pro 2018.

Nier: Automata sales hit 1.5m units HTC and Intel team up to bring WiGig wireless tech to Vive by Katharine Byrne Tuesday, May 30th 2017 at 11:36AM BST Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn HTC and Intel have teamed up to bring Intel's WiGig wireless VR tech to the Vive, the companies announced today at Computex. HTC will also be taking on manufacturing duties for the WiGig wireless VR accessory. This isn't the first wireless accessory that will be coming to the Vive, as TPCast's wireless upgrade pack is currently due to go on sale in Q2 this year. TPCast was one of the companies borne out of HTC's ViveX accelerator program, and its $249 tether-less upgrade kit is designed to sit on top of the main head strap. Judging by the prototype unveiled at this year's Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, it seems Intel's WiGig accessory will be incorporated into the headset in much the same way, but we'll have to wait until E3 before the company reveals exact details.  Either way, it should dramatically improve the headset's overall VR experience. Based on the 802.11ad standard (which is about 11x faster than 802.11n), Intel's WiGig tech works solely in the interference-free 60GHz band, allowing for high throughput and low latency in both directions between a PC and Vive headset.  This should mean video quality with a latency time of under 7ms in any environment, with HTC stating it should also support multiple users in the same space – something that will be good news for anyone interested in setting up location-based VR facilities.  More details are coming soon, but those heading to E3 in a few weeks time will be able to see HTC's proof of concept on display at its booth.  Advertisement Tags: intel , virtual reality , htc vive Follow us on Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

With the focus firmly on enhancing the tournament experience for fans, players, media and broadcasters, the innovations will use data, analytics and visualisation and ensure cricket remains at the forefront of technological advancements. The technology being introduced at the ICC Champions Trophy includes an Intel drone that will provide advanced pitch analysis, a bat sensor powered by an Intel Curie module that will allow for profiling of the bat swing and a VR experience for fans at the stadium. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our Official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, Chief Executive of the ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort." Intel Sports Group vice president Sandra Lopez highlighted the role of technology in transforming the way sport is played and viewed. With higher levels of digitisation, Intel is in a unique position to enable the sports industry to capture and analyse data to uncover and respond to new insights in real time. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," Lopez added. In a first at the Champions Trophy, the Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health, and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. The new bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. Analytics from the sensor will be available for fans to analyse.

(hpq) to sell Windows laptops running on its newest mobile chips. Qualcomm had announced in December that it was working with Microsoft to create a version of Windows 10 that could run on the Snapdragon 835 chip that typically is used in cutting-edge smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S8. Windows PCs usually run on Intel's x86 line of chips. The move marks the counter punch, perhaps, to Intel getting into one of Qualcomm's main lines of mobile chip business. Intel started making its own wireless modem chips to compete with Qualcomm, and last year signed up Apple (aapl) as a customer. About half of the new models of the iPhone 7 contained Intel modems instead of those made by Qualcomm. Both Qualcomm and Intel (intc) face challenges finding growth as their largest markets mature. Intel has been dealing with the declining PC market for years and has since targeted higher growth markets like cloud data centers, wireless modems, and smart devices, or the Internet of things. Qualcomm is seeing mobile device growth slow and also is turning to the Internet of things and data centers for growth, along with the new push into Windows laptops. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. At the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Wednesday, Qualcomm unveiled its three PC partners. Windows laptops running on the Snapdragon chips would gain the benefits of longer battery life and wireless modem capability to get online via mobile networks at up to 1 gigabit-per-second speeds, Qualcomm said. That's exactly what many PC users want, according to Jeff Meredith, senior vice president at Lenovo. "Today’s PC users want solutions that provide better battery life and the ability to connect anytime, anywhere, while also being lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available," he said in a statement. The laptops will be able to run any Windows software, including Microsoft (msft) Office, Qualcomm (qcom) said. But none of the laptop models was ready for a public unveiling. That will happen in the second half of this year, Qualcomm executives have said. Just how well the new Snapdragon-based laptops will run Windows apps is a key question, because poor performance killed earlier efforts to run Windows on chips like Qualcomm's that use ARM Holdings' basic designs. On the new laptops, some programs will run with code that is completely compatible with ARM, but many more will have to use an emulation mode, notes analyst Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. "This emulation results in a performance hit of unknown percent and may be one of the major make or break points for Windows on ARM," Moorhead wrote in a post on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Intel was showing off connected Windows 10 laptops at Computex running on both its CPU and wireless modem chips. Acer, Dell and many other PC makers are on board with its connected laptop push, Intel said.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Intel Brings The Fight to AMD With New X-Series Processors Haamiz Ahmed 5 days ago A few weeks ago, AMD revealed an ace up its sleeve – the 16 core, 32 thread ThreadRipper. Aimed at the high-end desktop (HEDT) market, the processor was meant only for the PC enthusiasts, software developers or CAD designers. At Computex, Intel revealed its own HEDT platform, stepping it up a notch. The new platform uses the X299 chipset with X-series of processors. The biggest and baddest of them all, Intel Core i9-7980XE will come with a whopping 18 cores and 36 threads. Unlike the consumer friendly version, the HEDT platform are more of a “prestige part” thing. Regular Joes won’t be able to make full use of the processors threads and cores but software developers or video streamers can. Intel is aiming for them with the X-series. Kaby Lake-X Starting at the bottom, we have the Intel Core i5-7640X and i7-7740X. These two fall under the Kaby Lake-X sub category. These two are very similar to the regular Kaby Lake counterparts with four cores and four threads (or eight threads with the i7), two memory channels and 16 PCIe 3. The difference is in the power draw and clock rates. TDP has gone up from 91 W (non X) to 112 W (Kaby Lake-X). The base clock for the i5-7640X is now 4.0 GHz, up from 3.8 GHz with a turbo clock of 4.2 GHz. The i7-7740X also has a slightly higher base clock of 4.3 GHz, up from 4.2 GHz with a turbo clock of 4.5 GHz. Skylake-X Moving up you get the 6, 8 and 10 core processors. They’re called the Skylake-X processors and feature double the memory channels compared the Kaby Lake-X counterparts as well as a higher power draw of 140W. Another feature in the Skylake-X processors is Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (limited to i7-7820X and i9-7900X) which boosts the base clock even further than Turbo Boost 2.0. PCIe 3.0 lanes also increase from 16 to 28 for the i7-7800X, 7820X. The i9-7900X, however, gets 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The final 4 processors, i9-7920X, 7940X, 7960X and 7980XE feature 12, 14, 16 and 18 cores respectively (double the thread count). They will also have a TDP of 165W. The rest of the details weren’t revealed by Intel for now. All of these processors use the same LGA 2066 socket which can give you a strong upgrade path if you start with the lower end processors. All of the processors will be have unlocked multipliers, which makes them easier to overclock. Additionally the chips will Intel Optane Memory, up to three PCIe/NVMe SSDs, 8 SATA ports, and 10 USB 3.1 generation 1 ports. No Intention of Backing Down The new series shows that Intel isn’t changing its strategy because of AMD. The 8 core i7-7820-X costs $599 which is a $100 higher than AMD’s corresponding processor. The price premium is still there. One area where Intel has the advantage is the single threaded performance where AMD lags behind. The Intel X299 motherboards and chips will be available in coming weeks.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

International Cricket Council (ICC) Champions Trophy 2017, is just around the corner and the most awaited match, India vs. Pakistan, is on 4 June.  To enhance the tournament experience for fans, players and broadcasters using data, analytics and visualisation Intel has come up with a couple of Innovations which will be showcased from June 1.   Solutions from Intel that will be utilised during the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 are a drone, profiling the bat swing and bringing a cricket VR experience to the fans at the stadiums. Sandra Lopez, Vice President,  Intel Sports said,  “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports.” Lopez added.   Drones The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health, and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts.   Bat Sensor This one is a new solution. In this, a sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Former English Captain turned commentator, Nasser Hussain, said “ technology has and will continue to impact cricket in a lot of ways positively. Player performance, Game strategy, adjudication and fan experiences will all change with the introduction of new technologies to the sport.”   Virtual Reality At the stadium,   Intel is also creating Virtual Reality (VR) experience zones for spectators as well players. Using a head-mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler.   Intel ICC 2017 First Published : Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - 11:07 Advertisement Similar News Top 5 Smartphones under Rs 25000: May 2017 Travelling to Indian airports, Avoid Reliance Jio Nikon launched Coolpix W300, claims to be freeze and shock proof Will Essential smartphone be launched in India?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman New Intel, AMD CPUs Bring More Options to Gamers It’s not just a good time to be a PC gamer. It’s a great time. The new high-performance Intel Core i9 family of CPUs and AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPU announced this week at Computex in Taiwan represent just the latest major investments in the thriving PC gaming ecosystem. Esports events are filling stadiums — and offering prize pools on par with the world’s richest sporting events. Behind those headline-grabbing numbers: an eSports market that research firm NewZoo projects will grow more than 40 percent to $696 million this year. That market, in turn, is propelled by great games. Overwatch has surpassed 30 million gamers, and Destiny 2 is coming to PC. Overall, the PC gaming software market will grow almost 140 percent over the course of a decade to more than $38 billion in 2020 from $16 billion in 2010, market research firm DFC Intelligence forecasts. PC gaming hardware sales are growing, too. While analyst projections vary, leading analysts estimate gaming PC hardware sales will grow between 7 and 10 percent over the next few years. It’s a virtuous cycle. Growing sales of PC gaming hardware, new PC games and the rousing success of eSports are sparking investments that will pay dividends for everyone in PC gaming. New Intel Core, and AMD Ryzen CPUs Give Gamers More Options AMD this week rolled out new, high-performance versions of its Ryzen processors. Ryzen’s new Threadripper CPUs for high-end desktops will offer as many as 16 cores and support for 32 threads. Earlier this week, Intel introduced its new high-end, X-series processor family, featuring the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition Processor, with 18 cores and 36 threads. We’re more than ready for the arrival of both. NVIDIA Battlebox PC Program with GeForce GTX: Now with New CPUs Our GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, introduced in February, owns the PC gaming performance crown. It’s the flagship in a full lineup of GPUs we’ve introduced over the past year based on Pascal — the world’s most advanced gaming GPU architecture.

The Worldwide Developers Conference event to be held in San Jose, CA on June 5 is said to the be venue for the announcement. While this may sound exciting to Apple fans, perhaps looking at what the future might bring for the MacBook 2018 might give them some more enjoyment. Intel just announced yesterday at the Computex 2017 event in Taiwan that is has successfully tested its latest processor architecture. The company registered a 30-percent performance improvement on its Coffee Lake processors. This performance boost, compared to the current Kaby Lake lineup is quite impressive in the scheme of things. In addition to announcing the said performance gains, Intel also said that it will make the Coffee Lake processors available in the market as early as the second half of 2017. MacBook lineup (via engadget.com) This could mean that MacBook 2018 releases will be able to take advantage of the new processors’ performance gains. This and longer battery life due to the improved efficiency of the new processors. At the moment, the current MacBook laptops are still on older Intel processors, mostly with Skylake architecture. Many consumers expected Apple to release the MacBook Pro on Kaby Lake processors. Unfortunately, the availability made it impossible at the time. This is why Apple is reported to be planning a release of Kaby Lake-powered MacBook laptops next month. Having an updated MacBook 2018 release is a welcomed change especially for hardcore Mac fans. For now, it is still too soon to tell whether Intel will be able to deliver its promise for the Coffee Lake processors. Last year, the company experienced some major delays in the release of the Kaby Lake processors that inevitably affected the MacBook Pro.

Both solutions offer wireless connectivity to the HTC Vive VR headset and the host computer. In addition to these two, HTC has partnered with Intel to bring the very first WiGig Wi-Fi technology to the HTC Vive. According to Digital Trends, Intel has announced in yesterday’s Computex 2017 opening that it is working closely with HTC to bring faster wireless connectivity to the Vive VR headset. In the presentation, Intel did a first public demo of the WiGig Wi-Fi technology with the Vive. The new wireless connectivity technology, otherwise known as 802.11ad, offers transmit rates of up to 7Gbps over various frequency bands. This rate is more than enough to carry data across the host computer and first generation VR headsets. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the WiGig system can even support uncompressed data transmission with as little latency as possible. TPCast (via pcauthority.com) Although there are third-party wireless VR headset interfaces available in the market, like the TPCAST and KwikVR Wireless Kit, the Intel WiGig interface offers much faster connectivity. Furthermore, these third party interfaces rely heavily on compression algorithms in order to transmit massive amounts of data. This affects video quality to certain extent. On other notes, the WiGig interface will make use of DisplayLink XR Codec. This means that there will be some measure of data compression involved. Nevertheless, it would still be less than the compression rates offered by current wireless VR solutions. Unfortunately, at the moment, it is not clear yet when exactly the device will hit the market. However, Intel and HTC claimed that it will be ready sometime in early 2018. As for the price, perhaps consumers would have to wait until Intel and HTC makes to official announcement later this year.

If we were to give a brief history of the CPU space in the personal computer (PC) market, we can summarise it as follows: Intel had a monopoly on the PC space since at least 2006 and nothing from only rival AMD has even come close to dethroning Intel. Intel allegedly took advantage of its position to keep the price of computing performance high. It wasn’t until AMD got its act together and released Ryzen, a new CPU that democratised computing power, that Intel started to get worried. When it comes to computing performance, two things matter a great deal, core count and IPC efficiency. The latter relates to the efficiency with which each core can perform calculations. With Ryzen, AMD doubled the core count compared to Intel’s offering in the same price range. This move, despite Ryzen’s lower IPC, suddenly resulted in customers having dramatically more computing power at their fingertips. Of course, there are some caveats, most notably with regards to Ryzen’s gaming performance, but these are being sorted out. Intel enjoyed a monopoly for a long time, but it also did good work in that time. Intel’s processors are still the best overall option for most high-end consumers, but AMD wasn’t that far behind. High-end processors, especially in serious workstations and servers, is Intel’s core strength. It had to do something to counter Ryzen and it looks like Skylake-X and the Core i9 is the answer. The Core i9 lineup looks like this: Intel Core i9 7900X – 10C/20T @ 3.3 GHz (TurboBoost 3.0 up to 4.5 GHz) for $999 Intel Core i9 7920X – 12C/24T for $1,199 Intel Core i9 7940X – 14C/28T for $1,399 Intel Core i9 7960X – 16C/32T for $1,699 Intel Core i9 7980XE – 18C/36T for $1,999 Details of only the Core i9 7900X are available. As it stands, the base model core i9 7900X will have 10 cores and 20 threads, operate from 3.3 GHz to 4.5 GHz and have a 140 W TDP. You’ll get 44 PCIe lanes and 13.75 MB of L3 cache as well. The 12-core model goes up to 165 W and the rest might be rated higher. One can extrapolate on the specifications of the rest of the lineup based on this. The top of the line Core i9 7980XE is claimed to be the first CPU ever to cross the one teraflop mark. Rounding off the Skylake-X lineup are the Intel i7-7800X and the i7 7820X. These are 6C/12T and 8C/16T parts clocked at 3.5 GHz and 3.6 GHz respectively. These will be priced at $389 and $599 respectively. Also included in the lineup are two Kaby Lake X processors. These are the i5 7640X and the i7 7740X. Both of these are 4-core parts, where the i7 supports hyper-threading, which means that it supports 8 threads. These CPUs are priced at $242 and $339 respectively. These processors are rated at 112 W TDP. As you can see, Intel hasn’t dropped the prices or increased the core counts on its mid-range and higher end processors. These processes will be released on a new LGA-2066 socket, but it will apparently be backward compatible with the 2011 socket. While all these processors are overclockable, the ace up Intel’s sleeve is that the cores on Skylake-X at the very least can be individually overclocked. This is something that AMD can’t do yet. Oh, and did we mention that Skylake-X will come with a bundled liquid cooler? At that asking price, Intel had better provide one anyway. For now, let the information sink in. We’re getting a brand new processor lineup and a slightly revamped architecture. We’ll delve into the details of the new CPUs at a later date. Until then, be sure you stay tuned for more of our coverage on Computex 2017.

And it has, with a new line-up of Core i5, i7 and a new i9 with as many as 18 cores and 36 hyperthreading threads. They'll be phenomenally fast, of course, but will have a price tag that puts any other PC component you could think of to shame. Introduced at Computex in Taipei, Intel's latest CPUs use a new X299 chipset and new 2066-pin socket. CPUs with from four to 18 physical cores are on offer, so there's a huge range of options at — a huge range of prices. The cheapest quad-core Core i5-7640X (with no hyperthreading) is a $US242 part, for example, while the top of the line 10-core (and 20 thread) i9-7900X is an eye-bleeding $US999. Image: Intel Those 4, 6, 8, and 10-core chips will launch first around the world, and 12, 14, 16, and 18-core CPUs will follow soon enough. All the chips have comparatively very high TDP thermal thresholds, so you'll need to invest in a gutsy water or air cooler to let these Core X processors run free without throttling back under load. Where Intel's mainstream desktop CPUs top out at around 90 Watts, these ones will hit 140 — and Intel's recommending water cooling as standard for the first time. Intel says it's by far the most extreme desktop processor it's ever produced, and it's taken a page from the book of its server-grade Xeon chips to put the new hardware together. Compared to its previous generation of "most powerful ever" Extreme chips, the company is quoting a 10 and 15 per cent jump in multi- and single-threaded performance respectively. Ryzen must have Intel spooked, because AMD's massively multi-core chips represented the first time that 8-core CPUs hit the mainstream desktop PC market. AMD's Ryzen is a superlative multi-core performer and brings that "mega-tasking" multi-tasking — gaming, streaming, saving content — to the mainstream in a way that the company hasn't seen success with in years. It has a new server and high-end desktop CPU, too, called Threadripper — up to 16 cores and 32 threads — and likely at a competitive price. Intel also took the opportunity to hint at its 8th-gen Core processors, still a few weeks away from an official unveiling — expect up to 30 per cent better performance, it says, bringing quad-core and eight-thread performance to its mainstream Core i7-7500U equivalent mobile chips which are currently only dual-core. Laptops could be getting a significant speed boost in the near future. Gizmodo traveled to Computex as a guest of Dell. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments warcroft @warcroft May 31, 2017, 1:11pm I mean this in the nicest posible way... Fuck you Intel! Because you had no competitionfor 10+ years you have been drip feeding consumers with minimal, yet expensive, upgrades each generation. Now that AMD are making a comeback you up your game and announce a crap load of new chips. Yes, its "business", but it doesnt stop you from being opportunistic, gouging arseholes. Reply 2 miak @miak May 31, 2017, 1:28pm Yeah there's a reason I'm still running with my 6-year old i5 2500k ... their incremental upgrades have generally been pathetic and I still have no problem running freshly released games at stable frame rates. I keep telling myself "next generation I'll upgrade" and then change my mind when I see I'm still only gaining 10-15% in raw power, unless I want to go to an i7. At this rate, I'll be using my current setup until it finally breaks down (and it's somewhat surprising it hasn't done that already). Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 May 31, 2017, 2:15pm +1 to the i5 2500K I have the i7 2600K the top of the line Kaby Lake has only a 25% increase in power and better power 25% in 6 years? WTF Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 2:37pm To be fair, we're practically at the speed limit of silicon. There's not a lot of extra speed to be had without overhauling the way we make CPUs in a major way - carbon, etc. That's why they're moving towards more and more cores - 4-5Ghz has been the magic ceiling for standard CPUs for a long time - hell, even late model Pentium 4s were getting close to 4Ghz, and how many years ago was that? And extra cores are great, but unless you're utilising software that's written to take full advantage of extra cores, or you're doing something like VMs where you can allocate specific cores, it doesn't benefit the average user. Until more software is made to utilise the extra cores. Last edited May 31, 2017 2:38 pm Reply 2 soldant @soldant May 31, 2017, 3:21pm This. People might remember back to the early-mid 2000s when CPUs basically stagnated until dual core CPUs came out. The limitations aren't just about complacency. Also AMD had its own period of complacency where it kept churning out comparatively worse CPUs. They share some of the blame. Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 1:33pm Yes and no. These CPUs aren't intended for gamers or average desktop users. Hell, 99% of the PC users in the world would have zero need for anything above a quad core. These are for high end users - people using virtual machines, doing video encoding, streaming, compiling, etc. Everything Intel is overpriced, but you also have to realise anything above a quad core is going to start costing a lot more. I'm still using a six core 3930K I originally bought because I thought it being six core meant it would destroy everything at the time. Then I learnt it was getting beaten in gaming benchmarks by my friend's 4770K quad core with less L3 cache. It all depends on your intended use. If you're just a desktop user/gamer, you'll get absolutely nothing out of anything more than a bog quad core i7. I wouldn't get too offended, you're not missing out on much unless you're a super-high end user.

Just food for thought. I know the Australian market is heavily regulated by the ACCC to encourage competition between brands. Reply 0 os42 @os42 May 31, 2017, 4:16pm To be fair, there's not been much reason to own a hyperthreaded 18-core CPU for gaming until recent years - a lot of games up to 2014-15 were still CPU-capped by their main thread. I remember deliberately skimping a little on my CPU for my current rig (admittedly nearly five years old by now) by going for the 3570k because the only difference between it and the first step into the i7 range was about $200 for hyperthreading, and I've only noticed it being much of an issue in the last 12 months or so. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 1:18pm I haven't really been paying attention. Do we have confirmation on the socket set? Might be nearly time for an upgrade (my 4771 is getting a little long in the tooth). Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 1:25pm I was looking at upgrading my 4790K when Skylake originally dropped and promptly decided not to. Even moving up to 6th/7th gen Intel and DDR4, there honestly wasn't an earth-shattering performance benefit to be had for dropping almost a grand on a new CPU/mobo/RAM. Depending on what your needs are, you'd be better off saving your money. If you were on a 1st gen i7 or something, that'd be a different story. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 1:58pm Its more than just the performance though. I live in Alice, which means that heat is a constant issue when it comes to parts wear. Even with a pretty good single bin water cooling unit I still see issues with keeping parts cool and thats before overclock. More powerful parts means running cooler due to lower overall cpu loading. Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 2:16pm Yeah, that makes sense. Just need to be careful you don't catch a tick instead of a tock. 4770Ks were actually fairly warm compared to the 4790K, which was the Haswell refresh. I hear the Kaby Lakes are better on the heat front compared to Skylake too. Lucky being in Melbourne, the central heat would probably wreak havoc on my water loop. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 3:47pm It gets so hot that even with the pump on high I experience throttling (though my 970 isn't helping). Thankfully winter sees a flip, but if I decide that I wanna have a day on the computer it still sees a bit of slowdown after a few hours. Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 May 31, 2017, 2:17pm There really is no need unless your constantly hitting 100% and believe that extra 10% boost will be enough? Reply 0 n_n @n_n May 31, 2017, 1:48pm those boxes look like condom boxes Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR May 31, 2017, 2:00pm Always use a firewall. Practice safe SSEx. Reply 6 fermian @fermian May 31, 2017, 6:13pm Is Intel's top new extreme crazy way-more-than-four core CPU being US$999 especially noteworthy? That's about $1350 in AUDs right now, though of course we'll have to pay GST and Australia Tax... But the i7-6950X came out last year and still costs $2400. The i7-6900K is $1299. The i7-980X from 2010 was US$999. They always have a top-dog zany super-CPU and it always costs US$999. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Unveiled at the Computex trade show in Taiwan, the new family is dubbed the “Intel Core X-series processors family”. One member of the family is a the Core i9 Extreme Edition, which takes the Core range's upper limit from a “7” to a “9”. The Register imagines the next step might be a Core 11 and Spinal Tap jokes. But we digress. The new Skylake-based X-series starts at the i5, compared to the i3 at the bottom of the barrel for plain old Core CPUs. Here's the new lineup. Intel's new Core-X CPU range But wait, there's more! Intel says before too much time has passed it will add models with 18, 16, 14, and 12 cores. For now, Chipzilla is pitching the range at enthusiasts and gamers. But an 18-core, 36-thread beast may well excite some workstation buyers especially when paired with Intel's new X299 motherboard chipset as that product offers up to 24 PCI Express lanes, 14 USB ports (10 of them USB 3.0) eight SATA slots and the ability to handle RAID 0,1, 5 or 10. Chipzilla's also shown off partners' efforts to employ more about the Compute Card it showed off earlier this year. The 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm computer will come in the four configurations below. Partners signed up to play with the device include Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, Seneca Data, InFocus, Contec, Dtx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.

Intel expects the Compute Card to go wherever small form factor computers are required. The Register last year tested an Intel Compute Stick, but didn't review it because we found almost nothing nice to say. Above all, the device was just inconvenient because it was so big that your correspondent's telly needed an adjacent HDMI slot to be empty if the Stick was going to fit. Intel thoughtfully supplied a short HDMI cable with the stick, but that just made it dangle unpleasantly. Hopefully Intel's partners will make that problem go away this time around – and they should because the Card connects over USB-C, a rather more flexible interface than HDMI! ® Tips and corrections 49 Comments MORE Intel Processors Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Intel, Samsung join Apple, FTC firing squad against rival Qualcomm Two more chip heavyweights enter the patent fray 4 Comments Apple weans itself off Intel with 'more ARM chips' for future Macs Cook bakes up another Chipzilla-free component for fruity computers – report 33 Comments Utah fights man's attempt to marry laptop Foe of same-sex unions seeks to wed machine 97 Comments Sysadmin 'trashed old bosses' Oracle database with ticking logic bomb' Always ensure the office laptop gets returned 68 Comments Oracle gets to Wercker, dines on container biz Larry goes Dutch on Docker support 3 Comments Oracle crushes Apiary's hope in slightly awkward email to customers We OWN you, WE review the products, WE say what stays 19 Comments Whitepapers Hybrid and Public Cloud for Mission-critical Deployment Red Hat is a modern-day success story; it’s open-source software (OSS) model has now penetrated nearly every layer of IT systems that were once proprietary.

The company announced today at Computex 2017 that it has partnered with Intel to create a "wireless VR accessory" for the Vive HMD. That accessory will rely on WiGig, the wireless tech Intel created to let you connect basically everything to your PC without having to plug in a single wire, and is expected to work with existing Vive HMDs. This is how HTC described the accessory in its announcement: The WiGig technology, based on 802.11ad standard, works solely in the interference- free 60GHz band, and enables high throughput and low latency in both directions, from the PC to HMD and from HMD to PC. This means pristine video quality with <7ms latency in any environment, supporting multiple users sharing the same space. All of this results in the seamless wireless VR with the Vive! The extent to which the wireless VR is "seamless" depends on how much lower than 7ms latency HTC manages to get. Low latency is crucial to VR--too much can hurt your sense of immersion at best and make you feel sick at worst. The good news is we might not have to wait long to find out how well this accessory works: HTC said it's going to show off a proof of concept when it heads to E3 from June 13-15. In the meantime, we can take comfort in knowing HTC isn't the only company that's chasing that wireless VR dream. AMD acquired an Austin startup called Nitero for its wireless XR technology in April, and we recently went hands-on with Sixa's Rivvr wireless VR system. Oh, and Oculus is also working on a self-contained, untethered HMD with Project Santa Cruz. Hopefully we can bid adieu to all these wires sooner than later.

POST A COMMENT 9 Comments View All Comments boeush - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link So, here's what I don't get. If these wireless VR headsets are intended to display video content rendered on an external graphics card, then let's see: 90 [FPS - 'meh', I'd rather see closer to 120, but OK] x (1080 x 1200 x 2 [kinda 'meh', IMO, but OK]) x 24 [bpp - no HDR, sorry] =~ 5.6 Gbps WiGig is only capable of up to 7 Gbps (under ideal conditions, and only by simultaneously using 60, 5, and 2.4 Ghz bands in a tri-band configuration.) So how are they planning on "supporting multiple users sharing the same space"? (And what is 'multiple' - do they seriously mean more than 2 ?!?) Sure, they can try to compress the hell out of the video stream. But intensive decompression workloads would help kill the battery of the headset even faster than the constant-on WiGig streaming, video display to both eyes, and audio to both ears would be doing already... Also, what is 'XR'? Reply MrHollow - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Well i think they meant multiple users but with a different PC and HMD and not one PC and multiple HMDs. Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link That wasn't the point: the point is all those users would be sharing the same spectrum in the same room, and within that room there are only so many bits that can be flying around at any given time (any more, and packets would be getting dropped due to signal interference.) Reply yhselp - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Isn't there some compression happening along the way? HDMI 2.0 supports 4K@60fps with HDR, which by your calculations would require 28.8 Gbps, and yet HDMI 2.0 only allows for 18 Gbps. Is there something I'm missing?

Insofar as foveated rendering goes, my impression is that the point was mostly to reduce load on the GPU -- though I can certainly see how it might be leveraged for video signal compression (still, this kind of a non-uniform compression scheme would be pretty novel, as far as I know.) And I'd still question the ultimate efficiency of any such compression vs. the impact on visual quality (and attendant nausea-inducing lag or compression artifacts...)

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Teases 8th-Generation Core Processors The chip giant has repackaged some old claims around its upcoming eighth-generation Core processors to make them seem new. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 30, 2017 at 8:00PM In addition to launching its new Skylake-X processor family for the high-end desktop market, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently teased its upcoming eighth-generation Core processor for the notebook market. The company had previously said that it expected that its eighth-generation Core processors to deliver a ">15%" performance improvement over its currently available seventh-generation Core processors. Now, Intel claims that its eighth-generation Core processors deliver "more than 30% improvement performance" relative to those seventh-generation Core chips. Image source: Intel. Let's dissect Intel's claims and then put this announcement into broader business context. Moving the goalposts In a footnote accompanying the performance claim, Intel said that this 30% performance improvement compares the Core i7-7500U notebook processor with an unnamed eighth-generation Core i7 chip. Both chips have a value known as PL1 ("power level 1") set to 15 watts. Per Intel, PL1 is "a threshold for average power that will not exceed." In other words, both chips are set to consume the same amount of power on average. The i7-7500U, Intel says, has two cores and four hardware threads (two per core) with a turbo frequency of 3.5GHz. The unnamed eighth-generation Core chip has four cores and eight hardware threads, with a turbo of "up to 4GHz." The performance lift within the same power envelope is certainly nice, but it's important to note that when Intel put its original ">15%" claim out there, it compared seemingly the same unnamed eighth-generation Core processor with a seventh-generation Core chip known as the Core i7-7600U. The 7600U runs at a maximum turbo speed of 3.9GHz, an 11.4% boost compared to the maximum turbo on the 7500U. Indeed, it's clear that the fundamental characteristics of the eighth-generation Core chip haven't improved since the last time that Intel talked about it -- it just picked a weaker seventh-generation Core chip to compare this upcoming eighth-generation Core notebook chip with. Eighth-generation Core still looks good Although I'm not a fan of Intel moving the goalposts to try to paint its upcoming eighth-generation Core chips in a better light, I do think that what Intel has cooking with its eighth-generation Core processors looks quite good. If Intel delivers its eighth-generation Core processors this holiday, as the company claims it will, then that will mark two years in a row of the company delivering new, meaningfully improved processor families for the personal computer market. Now, Intel has had it a bit easier than it did in the past, as it is delivering refined versions of the same basic Skylake architecture and 14-nanometer manufacturing technologies to enable this improvement, rather than radical changes in either the chip architecture or in the underlying manufacturing technology. As I've noted before, I'm waiting to see if Intel can continue this momentum in the years ahead, especially as the company faces a transition to newer, more complex 10-nanometer manufacturing technologies and brand-new chip architectures. If Intel can, then I won't be able to help but become incrementally more enthusiastic about the company's execution and ultimately its long-term business prospects. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Look a Lot Like Intel 30 Years Ago Will Proofpoint, SunPower, and Axon Enterprise transform their industries the way Intel did? Rich Duprey, Daniel Miller, and Matthew DiLallo (TMFCop) May 30, 2017 at 6:24PM Thirty years ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the world's largest computer chip maker, a position it still holds today, but it was on the cusp of transforming itself and the industry in ways unforeseen at the time. We've asked three top Motley Fool contributors to identify a company they think can similarly change the way they're seen in their industry, and how their industry can transform as well. Read on to find out why they think Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), and Axon Enterprises (NASDAQ:AAXN) sit on the threshold of change. Intel changed the world, these stocks could do the same. Image Source: Getty Images. Solution for growing threats Daniel Miller (Proofpoint, Inc.): When you think of Intel 30 years ago, you conjure the image of a young technology company with innovative products. Intel's chips would bring processing and memory capacities that helped usher in the worldwide adoption of PCs. One company that also conjures the image of a young tech company that could alter the landscape of its industry is cyber security company Proofpoint, Inc. PFPT data by YCharts. For those who haven't heard of Proofpoint, it's a security-as-a-service provider with data protection solutions. Those services and solutions include threat protection, data governance, and secure communication, among many others. Just recently, the company launched its Digital Risk Defense service, which, according to Proofpoint, is the industry's first integrated phishing and fraud defense solution across critical digital channels. The good news for investors? The cyber security company has high renewal rates (90%-plus last year), and it consistently ropes in new clients and consumers. Take the first quarter of 2017 as an example: Its total revenue was up 43% year over year, its billings were up a similar 40%, and it nearly tripled its cash flow. More good news for investors: These problems aren't going away. Email threats remain a huge concern, with over 17,642 organizations victimized in the U.S. alone, according to Proofpoint's Analyst Day presentation in 2016. These concerns will only elevate with the expanding mobile and social networking presence in our lives. You'll have to pay a premium to own shares of Proofpoint, but it's a small price to pay if it can indeed change the industry's landscape as Intel did 30 years ago.  Image source: Getty Images. The Intel of solar technology Matt DiLallo (SunPower): While the solar industry has been around for decades, it's just starting to gain traction in the mainstream. Fueled by climate-change worries and economics, solar installations around the globe are growing rapidly, with America's installed capacity, for example, doubling last year alone. Meanwhile, there's plenty of growth up ahead, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, for example, anticipating that the nation's utility-scale solar generation capacity could increase another 48% by the end of next year. Despite that stunning growth, solar would still only account for about 1% of the country's total utility-scale electric generation. While that massive addressable market alone is a big-time opportunity for leading solar technology company SunPower, what makes it stand apart from the crowd is its Intel-like innovation focus. That drive has enabled the company to build products that are light-years ahead of the commoditized components of its rivals when it comes to energy efficiency. For example, its Maxeon solar cells harness substantially more of the sun's power than a conventional panel, with its latest iteration expected to produce 70% more energy over the first 25 years than competitors' products. The company's efficiency lead should continue to widen in the future thanks to its investments in research and development that are driving improvements in energy production and cost. It's SunPower's focus on always setting the bar higher that reminds me so much of Intel. It's why I think its stock could one day rival the tech giant's success and be a powerful value creator for investors.  Image source: Axon Enterprises. A stunning transformation Rich Duprey (Axon Enterprise): Being able to reimagine your core business and transform yourself into a wholly new -- but related enterprise -- is how I see Intel, and it's how I picture Axon Enterprise. While Intel is still closely linked with processors that came to define computing, today, it is so much more, and it's deeply embedded in the digital world around us. That's what I see Axon doing. It is still very much the same company that came to define stun guns and has seen its Taser become synonymous with the less-than-lethal weapon, but it has now expanded beyond those narrow confines and opened up for itself new avenues of growth. According to TASER's own figures, almost 98% of the 18,250 or so police departments in the country have purchased its stun guns. Certainly, there will be a need for upgrades and replacements over time, but it has pretty much tapped out that market. It's in body cameras and evidence management where the best opportunities lie. As of the end of the first quarter, 36 of the country's 68 major city law enforcement agencies have purchased Axon's body cameras, its digital evidence management systems, or both. And it's the latter that ought to be the real driving force, because not only does it provide Axon with recurring streams of revenue, but it makes itself sticky in that once a department dedicates its evidence management to Evidence.com, switching costs rise astronomically. Unlike a department swapping out a Smith & Wesson duty weapon for a Sig Sauer if features or firepower improve from one manufacturer to the other, logging evidence would seemingly have a huge cost in time and money if a department wanted to switch. It's much easier and cheaper to continue with what you've got. That may ultimately prove to make Axon Enterprise even more of a transformational company than Intel, since swapping processors doesn't necessarily incur the same problems. And it's easy to see Axon moving beyond its close association with law enforcement -- perhaps even into the consumer realm. Daniel Miller has no position in any stocks mentioned. Matt DiLallo has no position in any stocks mentioned. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Axon Enterprise.

computex 2017 feature video feature Share Image: Intel When AMD came out guns blazing with its multi-core, heavily multi-threaded Ryzen CPUs, we knew that Intel wouldn't take long to respond. And it has, with a new line-up of Core i5, i7 and a new i9 with as many as 18 cores and 36 hyperthreading threads. They'll be phenomenally fast, of course, but will have a price tag that puts any other PC component you could think of to shame. Introduced at Computex in Taipei, Intel's latest CPUs use a new X299 chipset and new 2066-pin socket. CPUs with from four to 18 physical cores are on offer, so there's a huge range of options at — a huge range of prices. The cheapest quad-core Core i5-7640X (with no hyperthreading) is a $US242 part, for example, while the top of the line 10-core (and 20 thread) i9-7900X is an eye-bleeding $US999. Image: Intel Those 4, 6, 8, and 10-core chips will launch first around the world, and 12, 14, 16, and 18-core CPUs will follow soon enough. All the chips have comparatively very high TDP thermal thresholds, so you'll need to invest in a gutsy water or air cooler to let these Core X processors run free without throttling back under load. Where Intel's mainstream desktop CPUs top out at around 90 Watts, these ones will hit 140 — and Intel's recommending water cooling as standard for the first time. Intel says it's by far the most extreme desktop processor it's ever produced, and it's taken a page from the book of its server-grade Xeon chips to put the new hardware together. Compared to its previous generation of "most powerful ever" Extreme chips, the company is quoting a 10 and 15 per cent jump in multi- and single-threaded performance respectively. Ryzen must have Intel spooked, because AMD's massively multi-core chips represented the first time that 8-core CPUs hit the mainstream desktop PC market. AMD's Ryzen is a superlative multi-core performer and brings that "mega-tasking" multi-tasking — gaming, streaming, saving content — to the mainstream in a way that the company hasn't seen success with in years. It has a new server and high-end desktop CPU, too, called Threadripper — up to 16 cores and 32 threads — and likely at a competitive price. Intel also took the opportunity to hint at its 8th-gen Core processors, still a few weeks away from an official unveiling — expect up to 30 per cent better performance, it says, bringing quad-core and eight-thread performance to its mainstream Core i7-7500U equivalent mobile chips which are currently only dual-core. Laptops could be getting a significant speed boost in the near future. Gizmodo traveled to Computex as a guest of Dell. Comments Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja May 31, 2017, 11:44am and we wait..... Reply 0 ANumberOne Guest Jun 3, 2017, 11:50pm AMD throws down, and Intel hits back even harder! Reply 0 Danny Gonzalez Guest Jun 5, 2017, 7:56am Preliminary results from UserBenchmark are only showing a 4% total increase in speed over the Ryzen 7 1800X. I don't think it's a very hard hit, especially at that hypothetical price tag. If they bump it down to maybe $650 for the chip, then it'll definitely be a stiff blow. Most people are willing to cough up the extra $150 for what would be the equivalent of maybe an i3 taped to an i7 (so to speak). But unless the price changes in a downward motion, it's not a serious threat to the Ryzen. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Intel Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPU Lids Will Not Soldered – Still Using TIM Intel Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPU Lids Will Not Soldered – Still Using TIM Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Tue, May 30, 2017 - 5:02 PM A number of sites today have been reporting that Intel will not be soldering down the lid on the upcoming Intel Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors based on word from renowned overclocker der8auer. The news has upset many enthusiasts as they feel Intel should spend the extra money to solder the lids onto to have far superior CPU temperatures. We directly asked our contacts at Intel if they would be using Thermal Interface Material (TIM) on Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X and got the following statement back in an e-mail. Intel is using the same thermal interface material as was used on the prior Intel Core X-series processor (Broadwell-E). We don’t share further detail on TIM as it pertains to Intel products as performance characteristics of our thermal interface material is considered Intel intellectual property. The news that Intel isn’t soldering down the lid is good news for der8auer though as he just happens to sell enthusiast friendly delidding tools that take off the Integrated Heat Spreader on Intel processors quickly with minimal risk to the processor. His DELID DIE MATE 2 (DDM2) is just one example of the many Intel CPU delid tools that have come out in recent years. You also have the Rockit 88 or if you wanted to 3D print your own tool you can download free plans for an Intel Kaby Lake delid tool! There are also relid attachment kits that you can purchase! Delidding a processor can drop temperatures on a quad-core Haswell processor by roughly 10-20C, so it has to make a dramatic difference. Enthusiasts are speculating that delidding an Intel Core i9-7980XE with 18-cores right will have even better results since it has four times as many cores.  We’ve seen people at Computex 2017 say that you can expect temperatures of over 85C on the 165W TDP Skylake-X parts and thus the reason for required water cooling. It looks like Intel Core i9 X-series processors are going to be interesting to overclock due to the low thermal headroom thanks to having so many cores! Here is the latest video der8auer has up about the Delid Die Mate X (DDM-X) that he is making for Skylake X where it seems a 20-30C temperature drop might be possible by delidding the processor. Six_Tymes And if INTEL Soldered the lids people would Bitch, moan and complain that they cannot de-lid and apply their own TIM of choice. I very much dislike these bash INTEL articals, its tiring reading the same old hate on INTEL. keithplayspc nobody bitches about lids being solder…NO ONE. If it’s soldered you seriously can’t improve the temps and I’ve never met an enthusiast that ‘I wish they hadn’t soldered it so I could use worse performing TIM if I wanted to’ Seriously….think about it. Coach My initial thoughts regarding the new HEDT chips from Intel is that they are listed as having quite high clocks for this type of chip….great right? Well, with the above TIM information, I’m guessing that we will see a lot of throttling issues with these. They’ll be great chips but the paper may tout a bit more than we will see in reality. The competition has made this all very interesting. Nathan Kirsch We shall find out next month!

It came with an eye watering $1700 USD price and filled a prosumer niche for users who needed more cores, but didn’t want to invest in Intel’s Xeon enterprise ecosystem. Fast forward a year and 10 cores seems almost mid range with the announcement of the new high end X299 Platform and Core-X series of processors, squarely aimed at enthusiasts. The flagship of the range is a spectacular 18-core CPU, the i9-7980XE. It will have an equally spectacular price of $1999 USD. The i9-7980XE with its 18 cores is going to be well out of the reach of most users, but luckily there will be an entire range of processors available with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16-core variants. We’d expect the i7-7820X and i7-7800X to be around the sweet spot with 8 cores at $599 USD and 6 cores at $389 USD. As we saw with X79 and X99 platforms from Intel, all of the CPUs in the range will be fully multiplier unlocked, allowing for easy overclocking. The previous Broadwell models, in all their iterations were relatively poor overclockers. Skylake and Kaby Lake use an improved 14nm manufacturing process so we’re expecting overclocking to be significantly improved. The official turbo boost speeds point to this fact too. Do you fancy a 10 or 12 core CPU at 4.5 Ghz+ on all cores? This may (should?) be possible. It will be interesting to see how the 18 core model overclocks. We expect it will take a very very good motherboard and PWM system to be able to push it hard as the power consumption will go through the roof.     Note the two CPUs at the bottom of the slide above. These are the Kaby Lake-X processors. They are Socket 2066 versions of their mainstream Socket 1151 siblings. Some will question why Intel would release processors like these on the high end platform when you could buy a low end H110 motherboard and get the same performance. We actually think this is a good move from Intel. Critics of the X99 platform and it’s Broadwell-E based processors pointed to a lack of clock speed and overclocking capability as reason not to buy into the X99 platform. In many cases, a relatively cheap i7 7700K destroys a i7 6950X at a quarter of the price. This is something that didn’t quite fit with the high end desktop narrative. This dilemma is now solved, with X299 having a full range of processors that perform better than their Z270 counterparts. Buyers of the Kaby Lake X processors also have a very good upgrade path, with the platform likely to be relevant for at least a couple of years to come. There is little incentive to buy a high end Z270 motherboard now. Intel has yet to fully detail the specs for the high end Skylake-X parts. This would indicate some late fine tuning perhaps in response to the threat from AMD. Did the release of AMD’s Ryzen series of processors poke the bear? There’s no doubt that Ryzen was a massive step for AMD, offering higher core counts and competitive clock for clock performance. News of AMD’s 16 core Threadripper CPU and X399 platform surely contributed to Intel’s decision to accelerate the launch of their own platform, and perhaps introduce the models with the higher core counts. My 18 cores are better than your 16 cores! We’re also seeing the i9 branding for the first time, something that Intel has kept in the war chest for the best part of a decade. Whatever the reasoning for bringing out the big guns, a competitive AMD and Intel arms race can only benefit the consumer. Intel are aiming to release the first wave of Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs in late June. We’re looking forward to preparing our review and analysis then. The higher core count models will follow later. Of course we also have AMD’s Threadripper to look forward to as well. It’s looking like a very interesting time ahead in the PC world.

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

The company has also outed an important detail about its upcoming 8th generation Core CPUs for the mainstream. These will become available in the second half of this year, as successors to the currently selling 7th generation Core SKUs. Intel says the next generation chips will perform up to 30% better than the ones out today, at least in some circumstances and for some use cases. The company has seen such a boost in SYSmark 2014 version 1.5, and the quoted improvement applies only to the 15W U-series processors. Intel pitted a 7th generation Core i7-7500U CPU (two cores, four threads, 2.7-3.5GHz clock speed) against an unnamed next generation chip with four cores, eight threads, and 4GHz maximum clock speed in order to achieve the aforementioned result. Like the 6th and 7th generation Core processors, the 8th generation models will also be built using a 14nm process, but a "refined iteration" nevertheless. The new 8th gen architecture is codenamed Coffee Lake.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Computex / Computex: Intel promises 30% performance boost for 8th gen CPUs Computex: Intel promises 30% performance boost for 8th gen CPUs Matthew Wilson 5 days ago Computex, CPU, Featured Announcement We’ve had a lot of Intel news over the last 24 hours and while we have managed to tackle the bigger announcements, there was one small but interesting detail that snuck by during the Intel conference at Computex. In the midst of the big reveal for X299 and Skylake-X, Intel began talking about its future 8th generation CPUs, promising a 30 percent performance increase and availability before the end of the year. Intel’s upcoming 8th generation CPUs are currently code-named ‘Coffee Lake’ and during the press briefing, Intel claimed that while engineers were initially planning on a 15 percent performance improvement over 7th gen. However, it seems that the competitive landscape has now caused this to be bumped up to a 30 percent improvement. A 30 percent performance boost would be a very impressive generational bump, particularly given that yearly performance improvements have generally sat in the 10 to 15 percent range for the last few years. Aside from that, Intel says that great progress has been made with 8th gen already, so the company plans on having the first Coffee Lake CPUs out by the end of 2017, both in laptop and desktop form. For laptops, it is likely that we will see low-power U-series chips first, alongside OEM availability of some Coffee Lake CPUs some time before we get around to the 8600K or 8800K though. The usual Core i7s and Core i5s that the average custom PC builder can go out and buy will likely arrive later in the first half of 2018. This release timetable would be similar to what we observed with Kaby Lake last year.   KitGuru Says: A 30 percent generational leap certainly isn’t anything to scoff at. It will certainly keep things in the CPU market interesting as we edge closer to 2018.

It will only apply in very specific use cases.). jim k i agree Mike Laste I’ve been wanting to replace my 3470 for the same $200 price for a while and this may be the generation I do. 30% performance between mine and the 6500k in 5 years… seems like intel is spitting in my face. Dracono 30% performance boost, but they never specified it as 30% increase in IPC. This could mean many things from being limited to the platform Mobile or HEDT and where it improvement is affected, be it integrated GPU, better battery life, more cores etc. Mace ya face Intel has always referenced “performance boost” as meaning IPC, though I understand the skeptisism.

Usman Published 12:32 PM, May 30, 2017 Updated 12:59 PM, May 30, 2017 TAIPEI, Taiwan – Taiwanese firm Asus unveiled on Monday, May 29, their 2017 lineup of laptops, including what Asus chairman Jonney Shih described as "the world's thinnest convertible" and "the world's most prestigious laptop." Shih was referring to the ZenBook Flip S (UX30), a 2-in-1 convertible laptop and the ZenBook 3 Deluxe (UX490), respectively. Asus dubbed its product presentation "The Edge of Beyond" held at the HNBK International Convention Center at Computex 2017, which runs until June 3, Saturday. Also part of the company's revelations are the ZenBook Pro (UX550), which Shih described as "super powerful with compact design"; the VivoBook S15, trumpeted as a unit with a "thinner and lighter design"; and the VivoBook Pro 15, with its "unprecedented performance." The Asus chairman beamed pridefully as he called their new products as representative of "the new age of innovation." Shih took aim at Apple's MacBook Air, declaring that the ZenBook Flip S is thinner and lighter than the Apple product. On the software side, Shih boasted of the new products' support for new Windows 10 features, among them Windows Link, Windows Hello, Cortana and Modern Standby. "Today is all about our relentless effort in striving toward perfection. Our brand new ZenBook and VivoBook lineup truly goes to the edge of beyond, providing everyone with a new definition of thin, beautiful and powerful laptops," Shih said. Asus also highlighted its long partnership with Intel, calling onto the stage, Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's client computing group. "Asus has been at the forefront of delivering new technology and experiences for many years. Its stunning lineup of new ZenBook and VivoBook PCs, all powered by 7th-generation Intel Core processors, give people a choice of thin-and-light PCs that merge high performance with style," said Bryant. Below are photos and specs of the 5 laptops unveiled. 1) Asus ZenBook Flip S (UX370) Photo by Edd K. Usman/Rappler The Asus ZenBook Flip S – among the winners of a Computex 2017 d&i award – is the world’s thinnest convertible laptop, the company claims. The convertible is 10.9-mm thing and weighs 1.1 kilograms, making it among the lightest in the laptop market today. It features a 360°-flippable display, designed with an "ErgoLift" hinge that lifts and tilts the keyboard to an angled typing position when the display is opened beyond 135°.

It has two USB Type-C ports that are Thunderbolt 3-enabled. Thunderbolt 3 allows for fast 40Gbps data transfers, and the ability to connect to dual 4K UHD external displays.

It has less powerful and cheaper siblings, too. A teraflop of performance in an Intel desktop CPU? Yes, please. You'll need to shell out handsomely to get it, but Intel's new Core X processor family, unveiled on Tuesday, is designed to handle any task an extreme gamer or video editor can throw at it. Its flagship is the Intel Core i9 7980X Extreme Edition, which boasts 18 cores and and 36 threads. That chip will retail for $1,999, while the base Intel Core i5-7640X goes for $242. In between are seven new processors, and in a bit of a departure from recent Core CPU lineups, each one offers a different core count, base clock speed, and Turbo Boost version. As you step up the price ladder, each rung adds two processor cores and four threads, topping out at 16 cores and 32 threads for the Intel Core i9-7960X, which retails for $1,699. The more expensive the processor, the slower the clock speed too, at least in the initial tiers. That's due in part to Intel's improved Turbo Boost technology, which is designed to maximize both single-core and dual-core performance by choosing a "favored core" for each processing task. That means if you opt for the Intel Core i7-7740X, you'll get a 4.3GHz base clock speed that can increase to 4.5GHz thanks to Turbo Boost, while the Intel Core i9-7900X offers a base clock speed of 3.3GHz that can be boosted to either 4.3GHz or 4.5GHz thanks to the favored core selection. It's worth noting that we don't have availability details for each new processor SKU yet, nor did Intel announce the clock speeds or other specs of the Extreme Edition or the other top-of-the line Core i9 X-series CPUs. Still, the applications for the Core i9-series are clear: simultaneous video editing workloads like transcoding a file while you edit another one, or creating high-resolution graphics for use in virtual reality or 4K games. If you've been waiting for chips that will let you perform these tasks and you have the budget to spend what amounts to $100 per processor core, you'll want to pore over the product sheets for more on the new Core X lineup. But many people will end up comparing the SKUs that Intel announced today with their AMD Ryzen equivalents. In some of the matchups, as Anandtech notes, the Ryzen chips come in a generation behind in terms of performance but significantly cheaper.

Intel’s technology will be deployed at the three Champions Trophy host grounds – the Oval in London, Edgbaston in Birmingham, and Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The aim of the project is to demonstrate how innovative technology can improve the experience of watching cricket matches and keep fans engaged with what is going on on the pitch by giving them access to more statistical data. “We love the fact that cricket is a numbers game, a 360-degree sport with angles and speed and strike and run rates that lends itself to using statistics and figures in storytelling,” said Anuj Dua, director of marketing for Intel’s New Technology Group. ICC CEO and former South African international Dave Richardson added: “Our long-term ambition is to make cricket the world’s favourite sport and one way to do this is to offer fans premium content, and by embracing technology.” The first element of the ICC’s bespoke smart cricket technology will comprise Intel Falcon 8 drones equipped with high-definition, infrared cameras that will be used to conduct advanced pitch analysis before each match. By overflying the pitch, the drones will generate rich visual data on grass cover, health and even pitch topology, which will be used to generate daily reports for use in live broadcasts. Meanwhile, Intel has developed a bat sensor tool – a clip-on module powered by its Curie technology – that is mounted on the handle of the cricket bat to track and generate data on each stroke played by the batsman. The sensor gathers data on parameters such as backlift, bat speed, impact angles and follow-through angles. Read more about IT in sport The growing trend of analytics in sports has caused much debate, and even though data-driven decisions can provide some benefits, they are not right for all occasions. Computer Weekly visited the Land Rover BAR sailing team in Portsmouth to find out how mobile innovation may help bring the America’s Cup back to the UK for the first time since 1851. To support this, Intel and the ICC have implemented a private ultra-wideband network – alongside the stadium Wi-Fi – to stream the data back to the match broadcasters, who can then make the statistics instantly available to TV viewers around the world. The final piece of the package will be a virtual reality (VR) showcase at the matches, which will use head-mounted displays to immerse fans in a virtual cricket match and let them test their batting skills against a virtual bowler using the Curie-powered smart bat. But both the ICC and Intel also see value beyond merely entertainment, and data gathered from the drones and the connected bats will also be made available to the teams and players to help them make strategic decisions ahead of, and during, the matches. Intel has also engaged Speculur, a manufacturer of wearable devices, to commercialise the bat sensor technology into a product called BatSense, which it hopes will help junior players improve their game. Ex-England captain and Sky Sports commentator Nasser Hussain, who now also coaches junior cricket, said he hoped BatSense could become an “absolutely vital” coaching tool in time.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 05.30.17. 05.30.17 Time of Publication: 3:48 pm. 3:48 pm Intel’s New Processors Are Built For the High-Powered Future of PCs Intel Corporation In recent years, the rollout of desktop processors has felt a bit stale. You generally know what you’re going to get: a little more power, a little more efficiency. And while Intel’s latest update doesn’t reinvent the chip, it does provide obscene horsepower at a time when that’s increasingly all that matters. The Core-X series ticks off the usual performance gains, with Intel claiming up to 10 percent faster multi-threaded and 15 percent single-thread performance over its predecessor. But the focus falls to the top-end, and a desktop chip so powerful that Intel carved out a new brand name for it: the Core i9. Uncommon Core The rebranding might sound like marketing hype, but it’s not—or at least not entirely. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to cram 18 cores and 36 threads into a single piece of silicon, a feat that enables the kind of full-throttle task-juggling that a world full of 4K video and virtual reality demands. Guts Galore Brian Barrett Intel’s Plan to Thunderbolt 3 All of the Things Cade Metz Intel Can’t Win Mobile, But It Owns the Cloud—For Now Brian Barrett The Flash Storage Revolution Is Here The more cores and threads a single CPU contains, the more dedicated tasks it can manage simultaneously without sacrificing performance. Is an 18-core, 36-thread processor overkill for most people? Sure! But for the right applications, it could be a lifesaver. “When it comes to people who are doing any type of video editing, this is like a dream come true,” says Patrick Moorhead, industry analyst and founder of Moor Insights & Strategy. “This is a big deal.” Video isn’t the only use case for Intel’s $1,700 monster truck CPU. Compiling code and running intensive virtual reality experiences could use the boost. And the real benefit goes to those who need to navigate several interrelated tasks at once, like live-streaming video games. “Streaming to Twitch is no light task,” says Moorhead. “Not only are you playing the games, you’re taking two to four threads and recoding that video and broadcasting it out on the internet. And then if you’re at the same time chatting with your friends, that’s probably one extra thread.” Intel Corporation The new Core X line should also have some trickle-down benefits for those not in need of ludicrous speed. Intel also upgraded its Turbo Boost tech, which now picks the two top-performing cores for single-threaded or light-threaded workloads—think gaming or basic office applications—to give even the entry-level Core X products some pick-up. Still, the high-end horsepower is the real draw, and it offers more than just bragging rights or edge-cases. Leading at the high end of consumer PCs matters because eventually, that’s the only end that will be left. Last PCs Standing Those who keep even a modest eye on consumer tech trends know that PCs don’t sell like they used to. Or actually, the problem is that they do sell like they used to: Last quarter, according to research firm Gartner, PC shipments dipped to the lowest levels since 2007. You can guess the reasons. Tablets and smartphones can now handle the bulk of home computing chores, while affordable, low-power Chromebooks pick up whatever slack remains. The PC makers still in business can look forward to fighting over the enterprise market for the foreseeable future—if they make it that long. “Vendors who do not have a strong presence in the business market will encounter major problems, and they will be forced to exit the PC market in the next five years,” wrote Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. Not bad, as far as doom and gloom goes. But it also belies the one consumer PC segment that’s not going bust. “The high-end desktop market is on fire,” says Moorhead. “It’s about 30 percent bigger than it was five years ago. It’s a really bright spot for the industry.” That growth stems from interest in Oculus-ready rigs, sure, but also the recent accessibility of 4K and 360-degree video. Mostly, it’s really the only kind of computing left for which you truly need a traditional computer. While Intel rightly may see its future in providing the chips that underpin cloud computing, it’s not about to cede ground on the last PC hill worth defending. You can see that impulse, too, in its recent efforts to spur Thunderbolt 3 adoption. As more and more data gets transferred over the air, the only hardware interface people will actually need is the one that can clock 40Gbps. So no, most PC owners today won’t be able to take full advantage of an 18-core, 36-thread behemoth. But that’s not really the point. Core X exists less for the present than it does for the future, one in which “extreme” becomes normal, because there’s nothing else left. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

At Computex in Taipei, Intel has unveiled the updated Core X-Series with a flagship Core i9 CPU and the company’s first teraflop desktop CPUs. The top-of-the-line Core i9 has an incredible 18 physical cores with Hyper-Threading for a total of 36 threads. It’s obscenely expensive, though. The Core X-Series consists of Core i9, i7, and i5 CPUs. The i3 isn’t welcome in what’s clearly intended as a high-end family of CPUs. The Core i5 7640X is the entry-level model in the X-Series. It only has four cores and no Hyper-Threading, just like current-gen mainstream i5 chips. However, it has a higher clock speed, supports faster RAM, and uses the new Intel Socket R4 (LGA 2066). It’s priced at a reasonable $242. If you want to step up to Intel’s new i7 family, the cheapest variant is the four-core, eight-thread 7740X. It’ll retail for $339, which is only a little more than current i7 CPUs. Things begin to diverge from existing Skylake and Kaby Lake designs with the 7800X, which has six cores and 12 threads for $389. There’s also the 8-core, 16-thread 7820X for around $599. That brings us to the new Core i9 lineup, which starts at 10 physical CPU cores with 20 threads. This 7900X chip will retail for $999. The other i9 CPUs come in configurations with 12, 14, 16, and 18 cores (all with Hyper-Threading). Intel’s recommended price for those is $1,199, $1,399, $1,699, and $1,999, respectively. The 7980XE is the first consumer chip to offer 18 cores, which will probably be overkill for almost everyone. The full X-Series lineup. The quad-core X-Series chips are based on Kaby Lake, but all the others are still derived from Skylake. Most of the improvements between those generations came in the form of power efficiency, but that’s not really what the X-Series is about. Intel says these chips are intended for gamers who want to play, livestream, and record their gameplay at high resolution. Anyone who needs to edit large images or videos might also be tempted to grab one of Intel’s new many-core CPUs. Of course, all X-Series CPUs are unlocked for easy overclocking. The X-Series chips plug into the new LGA2066 socket and are designed to work with the X299 chipset. The combination of high core counts and new chipset features should offer big performance gains compared with the last time Intel went beyond quad-core with Broadwell-E. These new CPUs will cost you a pretty penny, but a certain class of enthusiast and professionals will be happy to plunk down $2,000 for the fastest CPU Intel offers. Stay tuned for more analysis here on ExtremeTech, including how these processors stack up against AMD’s Ryzen lineup. Now read: L2 vs. L3 Cache: What’s the Difference?

The aim is to both provide more information to television audiences and, longer term, develop a coaching aid. Former England captain turned cricket broadcaster Nasser Hussain told a news conference at The Oval: "How many times have we spoken about people having 'fast hands' or 'great bat speed'? But what does that mean? We've never quantified it." Hussain, speaking ahead of the Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday, said he would have benefitted had this technology been available in his career. "When I first played for England, I had never really seen myself on television. I remember playing in Jamaica, getting out and walking through the hotel lobby and Geoffrey Boycott shouting at me 'Hussain, you'll never get any runs with that open bat face'. Something like this can show you the exact angle of your bat." Hussain said Roy, going through a run drought that has yielded four single figure scores in his last five one-day international innings, might gain from the new system. "Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say 'is everything I'm doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?' and if you know it was, you know that's not the issue." Hussain added: "There will be traditionalists thinking 'is this relevant?'. But if it gives you that one percent to improve the game, someone will be using it." Other innovations at the Champions Trophy include the use of high-technology drones to provide more in-depth pitch analysis and a virtual reality system that allows fans to experience what it's like to face the world's best bowlers. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, speaking alongside Hussain, welcomed the developments by saying: "If the technology is available to enhance and amplify the cricket experience, over the years we've shown a real willingness to trial and support it. "Our long-term vision is to make cricket the world's favourite sport and really there's only one way to achieve this -- to keep the fans engaged and interested in the game." The former South Africa wicket-keeper added: "That's all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology."

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe VR Intel and HTC tease upcoming WiGig accessory to untether the Vive Will Shanklin May 30, 2017 View gallery - 2 images PC virtual reality is going wireless soon – we've already tried accessories that successfully do just that. Today HTC announced another upcoming option, an accessory that uses Intel's WiGig technology to untether the Vive. Intel's WiGig (Wireless Gigabit), based on the 802.11ad standard, gives compatible PC accessories their own interference-free 60 GHz wireless band to connect cable-free, at high speeds (up to 7 Gbps). It sounds like an ideal match for PC-based VR, allowing for high-throughput and low-latency wireless headset connections. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW HTC and Intel were light on details today, but they did say the Vive accessory will provide "pristine video quality" with less than 7 ms latency, which should be practically imperceptible to the user. While high-end VR will eventually need lower pricing and more convenient setups to crack the mainstream, going wireless is another important box to tick. Along with the HTC-funded TPCast and offerings from lesser-known companies like KwikVR (both of which missed their original estimated launch windows), it's clear the VR industry is still pushing hard to untether PC headsets. If you're open to a mobile-VR alternative, Google is partnering with hardware makers (including HTC, above) to produce standalone/wireless Daydream headsets later this year. Oculus also teased its own standalone headset late last year, though we haven't heard anything about that since. There's no release or pricing info for the Intel/HTC WiGig accessory, but Intel will be showing off a proof of concept at E3 2017 in Los Angeles in June.

By Rob Thubron on May 30, 2017, 7:30 AM 63 comments TechSpot Just as expected, Intel has revealed its new family of enthusiast processors at Computex. At the top of the Core X-series sits its answer to AMD’s 16-core/32-thread Threadripper CPU: the $1999 i9-7980XE, which boasts an astounding 18 cores/36 threads. Intel says the i9-7980XE is the first ever teraflop desktop PC processor. Two grand is an awful lot of money, but this is the flagship chip; the rest of i9 X-series are cheaper. Available in 16-core, 14-core, 12-core, and 10-core versions, these Skylake-based chips range from $999 (for the ten core i9-7900X) to $1699. Intel says that compared to Broadwell-E chips such as the $1723 10-core i7-6950X, the new CPUs offer 15 percent faster single thread performance and are 10 percent faster when it comes to multithreaded tasks. The i9-7900X chip comes with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz, which jumps to 4.3GHz dual-core speeds when using Turbo Boost 2.0. And thanks to the improved Turbo Boost 3.0, which can dynamically identify and overclock the two “best” cores, it can hit 4.5GHz. Intel hasn't yet revealed the clock speeds for the rest of the Core i9 chips. For those on a tighter budget, there’s the Core i7 and i5 X-series CPUs. These include the only two Kaby Lake-X processors in the new line: the i5-7640X ($242) and i7-7740X ($339). All the Core X CPUs use the new X299 chipset (socket 2066), which boasts up to eight SATA 3.0 ports, up to ten USB 3.0 ports, and, when using CPUs with 10 cores or more, 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes All those cores mean things can get toasty. As such, Intel is selling its own liquid cooler designed for the 165W TDP and 140W TDP of the new chips. It's estimated retail price is between $80 - $100, and it also works with some previous generation CPU models. Both the new X-series processors and compatible motherboards should arrive “in the coming weeks.” Related Reads With the 9700-series, Intel lays the Itanium family to rest Intel unveils business-class SSD Pro 2500 Series with self-encryption Intel launches budget-minded 540s Series SSDs, pricing starts under $55 63 comments 678 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Logitech updates high-end mice: MX Master 2S and MX Anywhere 2S Intel Core X vs. AMD Ryzen Threadripper: What we know so far The Eve V is a feature-packed Surface Pro-like device that even Microsoft approves of Load Comments 63 ...

The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. “We couldn’t be more excited to have Intel as our ‘Official Innovation Partner’ of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017,” said David Richardson, CEO, ICC, on Tuesday. “The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort,” Richardson added in a statement. The bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports,” said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. Intel will also showcase VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston, to allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. “Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers,” said Atul Srivastava, Managing Director, Speculur which is a Bengaluru-based smart wearables and cognitive computing company. With “Speculur BatSense”, aspiring cricketers can measure, track and improve their batting skills. The company plans to make ‘Speculur BatSense’ available in Australia, India, the United States and Britain in the second half of this year.     Print       Email Published: 5 days ago on May 30, 2017 By: IANS Last Modified: May 30, 2017 @ 10:36 pm Filed Under: Sports NEXT ARTICLE → MRH FC gets revenge over MRH Sunrisers ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Maradona declines offer to commentate with Pele About the author IANS View all articles by IANS » LATEST NEWS Seven killed in London terror, three terrorists shot dead Nagaland BJP’s PAC wants dropped members reinstated Mokokchung’s regional leaders join Democratic Progressive Party Acharya calls for greater commitment to environment Negligence takes toll as disaster destroys Kohima road again Women to be allowed in combat role in Army,says Gen Bipin Rawat PM mishandling Kashmir issue: Rahul India’s heaviest rocket with GSAT-19 all set for maiden flight SEARCH Custom Search Sign up for our newsletter!

At Computex this week, the company officially launched the card with a full list of partners and what we can expect to see from them product-wise. These devices will all be at the show and vary widely. Sharp, for example, is showing off digital signage while Seneca and Foxconn are making mini PCs. LG is sticking the Compute Card in its monitors to turn them into all-in-ones. The card might also show up in tablets and interactive whiteboards. Nexdock will be showing something off, too, which we can assume is its touchscreen concept that it announced in January. Intel says the Compute Card will start shipping in August. Weirdly, Intel’s most well-known partners, including Lenovo, HP, and Dell, aren’t ready to show off their products. Intel says they’ll definitely create something but we don’t have an idea of what those devices might be. The compute card will be available in four variants: Image: Intel The company’s also putting out its design kit today that includes guides and reference designs for developers. The Compute Card might not take over, but it at least is giving us hope for a future of powerful pocket PCs.

CT 17 schedule and squads With the focus firmly on enhancing the tournament experience for fans, players, media and broadcasters, the innovations will use data, analytics and visualisation and ensure cricket remains at the forefront of technological advancements. The technology being introduced at the ICC Champions Trophy includes an Intel drone that will provide advanced pitch analysis, a bat sensor powered by an Intel® CurieTM module that will allow for profiling of the bat swing and a VR experience for fans at the stadium. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our Official Innovation Partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, Chief Executive of the ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort." Intel Sports Group Vice President Sandra Lopez highlighted the role of technology in transforming the way we play and view sports. With higher levels of digitization, Intel is in a unique position to enable the sports industry to capture and analyze data to uncover and respond to new insights in real time. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitization and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," Lopez added. In a first at the Champions Trophy, the Intel® FalconTM 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match.

Roston - May 30, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 7/10 Pros Ample ports Durable construction Classic ThinkPad design Long battery life Fingerprint reader Cons Thick bezels Bulky for an ultrabook Dim display Lenovo has released the second-generation version of its ThinkPad 13, a business ultrabook with the same no-nonsense style we’ve come to know and love. Unlike some ultrabooks, the ThinkPad 13 packs a bunch of ports that (most likely can) cover all of your workday needs, tossing other features on top including a fingerprint sensor and customizable hardware. Is the latest version worth the upgrade? Read on to find out! Hardware & Design The latest ThinkPad 13 comes in two flavors: black and sliver. Our review model is silver, as you can see in the photos, though you can also get it in the traditional black ThinkPad style if you prefer. This model falls on the ‘budget’ end of the ThinkPad lineup with a starting price of about $440 USD on Lenovo’s website, making it attractive from a monetary point of view, and it helps boost its appeal by offering a bunch of ports and long battery life. The ThinkPad 13 is designed for businesses, as well as anyone else who needs a durable, reliable laptop — students, teachers and similar. Lenovo boasts that its new laptop was tested across a dozen different military specifications, making it durable enough to handle your bumps and jostles while on the road or at the office. The company explains that the second-generation version of the ThinkPad 13 passed more than 200 quality checks, and it helps round out that attractive feature by offering a battery capable of taking you through a full workday (and perhaps longer). The design itself is basic and highly usable, including a large trackpad, red trackpoint nub, three trackpad buttons, and a fingerprint reader. The keyboard features a two-stage adjustable soft white backlight, which can be turned on and off by pressing Fn + Spacebar. All of this is joined by a 13.3-inch matte display with a Full HD resolution and IPS technology. The touchscreen is quite sensitive and accurate, and the viewing angles are excellent, though the screen still suffers from glares in bright environments despite its non-glossy nature. MacBook Air 13-inch and ThinkPad 13 2nd-gen The design is simplistic and fairly angular; as far as ultrabooks go, it’s also a bit beefy as shown above and heavy with a starting weight of 3.17lbs. That’s not surprising given the number of ports Lenovo packs into this machine, but it should be noted that there are thinner ThinkPad alternatives (like the X1 Carbon) if thinness is important to you. TECH SPECS Processor: – Up to Intel® Core™ i5-7300U Processor (3MB Cache, up to 3.50GHz) – Up to Intel® Celeron® 3865U Processor (2MB Cache, 1.80GHz) Operating System: – Windows 10 Home – Windows 10 Pro – Lenovo recommends Windows 10 Pro Display: – 13.3″ HD (1366 x 768) TN Anti-Glare – 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS Anti-Glare Multi-Touch Storage: – Up to 128GB SSD – Up to 256GB SSD OPAL2.0 Memory: Up to 16GB DDR4 2133 MHz Audio: HD Audio Security: – dTPM 2.0 – Swipe fingerprint reader Camera: 720p HD camera with integrated dual array microphone Graphics: Up to Intel® HD Graphics 610 Battery: Up to 11 hours Ports: – 2 x USB 3.0 – 1 x USB 3.0 (powered) – 1 x USB-C – 1 x HDMI – OneLink+ – 4-in-1 card reader (SD, SD-HC, SD-XC, MMC) – 1 x headphone / microphone combo jack Connectivity: Intel® Dual Band Wireless AC (2×2) 8265 + Bluetooth® 4.1 Dimensions: 12.69″ x 8.77″ x 0.77″ / 322.4 mm x 222.8 mm x 19.8 mm Weight: Starting at 3.17 lbs / 1.44 kg Color: Silver Software & Performance One important element we hope to see in business laptops is the ability to get through a full work day on a single charge. While that may not be important for desk jockeys, anyone who travels with any sort of regularity knows the hassle of having to charge mid-way through the day. The ThinkPad 13 is able to meet this need, offering up to 11 hours of run time per charge depending on usage. I was able to successfully use the next-gen ThinkPad 13 through a full 10ish hour workday with a bit of charge to spare, though the battery indicator was close to empty at this point. That’s perhaps skirting too closely to the charge point for some users, but I was pleased with the results. Performance, meanwhile, was great during average usage — that is, web browsing, photo editing, and similar. Your experiences will vary based on your laptop’s own configuration, however; Lenovo offers up to a Core i5 or up to an Intel Celeron 3865U Processor, 16GB of RAM, and up to Intel HD Graphics 610. The laptop runs Windows 10 and includes some of Lenovo’s own software preinstalled. Things we like The ThinkPad 13 is the type of laptop I call utilitarian — it’s more about function than form, and there’s nothing wrong with that. There’s no single thing that stands out among competing products. Rather, the laptop as a whole brings a variety of items that will appeal to certain users: many ports, a matte display, touchscreen, relatively thin profile, excellent keyboard, and great audio quality. Issues While the ThinkPad 13 is mostly a great laptop, the screen was disappointing. I caught myself attempting to turn up the brightness a couple times, only to realize that it was still turned up to max brightness. It truly felt too dim in most environments with the exception of dark ones, and that was a problem for me. After using this ThinkPad model for a day, I felt that I was developing eye strain and had to resist the urge to use an external monitor. Your mileage may vary, but for me personally, the next-gen ThinkPad 13’s screen is lacking. Wrap-up If you’re in the market for a ThinkPad but you can’t drop several hundred on one of the higher-end models, Lenovo has a great compromise in the ThinkPad 13. While you’re not getting the thinnest ultrabook out there nor a bright 4K display, you will enjoy a combination of long battery life, multiple hardware options, a touchscreen, many ports (including USB-C), and a comfortable keyboard. If all that sounds perfect, you can pick up the ThinkPad 13 (2017) from Lenovo’s website starting at $439 USD.

News & Analysis Apple, Intel Attack Rivals SoC hire, new CPUs hit Qcomm, AMD Rick Merritt 5/30/2017 02:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Apple and Intel got an edge on rivals in separate moves that came to light Tuesday (May 30), showing heated competition in semiconductors. Apple hired a top Qualcomm engineering manager expected to lead its SoC efforts while Intel announced a new high-end PC processor family, leapfrogging renewed competition from Advanced Micro Devices. Apple hired Esin Terzioglu, a vice president of engineering who led the central engineering group at Qualcomm’s semiconductor division for the last eight years. For its part, Intel announced its Core i9 Extreme Edition family, including an 18 core, 36 thread chip that leapfrogs AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper, a 16 core, 32 thread chip announced in mid-May. Terzioglu announced his move in a LinkedIn post made public in a tweet by Neil Shah, an analyst for Counterpoint Research. Terzioglu has not updated his LinkedIn page to provide his new title at Apple, but given his experience observers expect he will lead Apple’s semiconductor efforts, perhaps launching a foray into creating the company’s own baseband processor. The move comes at a time when Apple is locked in a major legal battle with Qualcomm over as much as $2 billion in annual royalties it charges for its cellular communications patents. Last year, Apple started using baseband chips from Intel. Apple filed suit against Qualcomm in January, claiming that Qualcomm’s royalties were exorbitant and the chip vendor pressured it to remain silent. In a countersuit filed in April , Qualcomm said that it paid Apple to refrain from asserting patents and revealed that it got royalty payments for iPhones and iPads through Apple’s contract manufacturers including Compal, Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron. Before joining Qualcomm, Terzioglu was CTO and CFO of startup Novelics, acquired by Mentor Graphics. Previously he served six years as a principal scientist in the office of the CTO at Broadcom. He holds a doctorate and masters in electrical engineering from Stanford. “It does seem Apple increasingly wants to design almost everything in the iPhone,” said Mike Demler, an analyst with the Linley Group. “If you look at its patent filings its obvious Apple has been doing a lot of work in baseband radios for the past few years and they might even try to design their whole RF signal chain,” he said. In addition, Apple recently informed Imagination Technologies it intends to design its own mobile GPUs.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web How Intel is bringing in a new era for cricket By Michael Moore News  Cutting-edge technology introduced across all areas of 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. Shares The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy is set to be possibly the smartest sports tournament ever thanks to a new partnership with Intel. The technology giant has revealed details on a number of new technology platforms it is launching to help make this year’s tournament, which kicks off in London on Wednesday, the most connected to date. This includes an all-new approach to media analysis, as well as a chance for cricket aficionados to get a real hands-on experience that will help them improve their own game. However fans attending any of the games at Lord’s and The Oval in London, as well as Edgbaston in Birmingham, will be able to benefit from free and fast Wi-Fi in the stadium, as well as enjoy a futuristic Virtual Reality experience that puts them at the heart of the action. In a first for a sports tournament in England, Intel-powered drones will scan every inch of the wicket at the three grounds to provide in-depth information on the state of the pitch, crucial information for players, fans and commentators alike. For example, the scans (example pictured below) would give real-time information on how the pitch is faring during the day’s play, and whether it would benefit spin or seam play. “Our long term vision is to make cricket the world’s most popular sport, and we need to engage the fans,” ICC CEO David Richardson (pictured above) said at the launch event at the Oval today. “We need to offer premium content and use technology”, he added, “If the technology is available to enhance the cricketing experience, then over the years we’ve shown a  willingness to support it.” For players fans looking for that little extra, Intel, which has previously partnered with major sports tournaments including Spain’s La Liga football and the PGA golf circuit, is also supporting the launch of BatSense, a new service which allows players to monitor their own performance. Taking the form of a small accessory that clips onto the top of a cricket bat, the product contains a multitude of sensors that will provide real-time information on their stance, movement and even the speed they swing their bat. This information can then be used to create a 3D avatar of the player, allowing them to analyse their strengths and weaknesses in a far more advanced way than has ever been available before. “We think this of a technology that can be the difference between playing club cricket and international cricket,” Intel’s Anuj Dua declared. BatSense will be used by a number of top players during the ICC Champions Trophy, before going on public sale in August across the world.

The new Core i9 is aimed at enthusiasts and power users. It offers up to 18 processing cores. The Core branding began with the Core 2 Duo, the chip that saw Intel regain the top of the market from rival AMD. It has held that position ever since with AMD struggling to create compelling high-end options. The status quo is now shifting though. Earlier this year, AMD unveiled its all-new Ryzen series of processors, its most competitive range in half a decade. Ryzen's price to performance ratio is far higher than the Intel Core series. Whereas Intel's cheapest eight-core chip retails at over $1,000, AMD offers a flagship model for $499. A few weeks ago, AMD went a step further, announcing it will start selling a 16-core, 32-thread chip later this year. AMD's long-anticipated return to competition has now forced Intel into action. At the Computex computer show in Taiwan today, Intel made official what rumours have been suggesting for weeks. It is responding to Ryzen by adding a new series to the Core family. Branded as "Core i9" and part of the wider Core X enthusiast offering, the options range from 4 cores and 4 threads right up to 18 cores and 36 threads. Intel's new Core i9 processors Intel Intriguingly, this span doesn't align with the initial Core i9 rumours from a couple of months ago. PC Gamer reports that the slides Intel distributed to media at Computex ahead of the event only mentioned 12-core parts. Intel's executives launched the Core i9 onstage without accompanying background material, releasing the official images later on. Intel claimed it has kept the 18-core models close to home to prevent details leaking out. Many have speculated that they're actually a late addition though. The company may have decided to launch them earlier than intended after AMD revealed the 16-core "Threadripper." Aware that AMD was about to steal headlines once again, it's possible Intel has been forced to take defensive action for the first time in years. Even today, Intel hasn't publicly detailed the specifications for the highest end parts. Clock speeds, memory support and power consumption figures for the most important Core i9 components remain conspicuously lacking. Intel has revealed pricing details though, confirming that an 18-core desktop chip will set you back $1,999. 16-core, 14-core, 12-core and 10-core options will retail at $1,699, $1,399, $1,199 and $999 respectively. At the lower end of the range, Intel is also offering new more conventional processors for gamers and less demanding enthusiasts. Its new flagship Core i7 chip, the i7-7740X, offers 4 cores and 8 threads for $339. It has a base clock speed of 4.3GHz and can turbo up to 4.5GHz. There are also 6-core and 8-core i7 variants priced under $600 and a $242 Core i5. With four cores, four threads and a 4.0GHz base clock, this chip is likely to become the processor of choice for new gaming builds later this year. Intel new Core X processors Intel Intel said it has decided to launch an 18-core desktop processor because its 10-core i7-6950X was received "really well" by enthusiasts. The company's repeated claims that it's not merely trying to one-up AMD haven't held water with analysts though. While it's not willing to directly admit it, it seems as though the classic rivalry between AMD and Intel is returning in full force. "The Intel® Core™ X-series processor family introduces a series of firsts that reflect the extreme performance we are delivering," said Intel's Gregory Bryant. "This family includes Intel’s first teraflop desktop CPUs, a prime example of just how much raw compute these processors can handle. We’re also introducing the entirely new Intel® Core™ i9 processor, representing the highest performance for advanced gaming, VR and content creation." With the core count on desktop processors finally being forced up, the renewed competition will lead to more powerful computers at lower prices. The new Core i9 range will be available later this year. They'll be joined in the second half of 2017 by Intel's upcoming "Coffee Lake" series of Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, promising up to 30% higher performance than the outgoing Kaby Lake series.

favorites Intel has launched its X-series processor with 18-core i9 chips to accelerate the data-driven vision of the connected future. At this year’s opening keynote at Computex, Intel GM Gregory Bryant took to the Taipei stage to push Intel’s data-driven vision of the future. Such is this vision that Intel is willing to cast off the moniker of PC giant in favour of becoming a data company. The GM went through the motions like any other big exec delivering a keynote – Bryant mentioned the anticipated 80 billion devices by 2025, autonomous cars becoming mainstream and how Intel wants to position itself, like other big tech, at the forefront of this data-driven revolution. The race is on to grab a share of the lucrative ‘data-driven’ market, but Intel has an ace up its sleeve – its chips and hardware can power every segment of the data journey – from the cloud and network to the device. In support of this vision, the chip giant Intel introduced the new Intel Core X-series processor family, which is designed to power performance at scale. In a blog post, Bryant said: “The Intel Core X-series processor family introduces a series of firsts that reflect the extreme performance we are delivering. This family includes Intel’s first teraflop desktop CPUs, a prime example of just how much raw compute these processors can handle. Read more: Intel’s Thunderbolt 3-for-all adds USB-C to all CPUs “We’re also introducing the entirely new Intel Core i9 processor, representing the highest performance for advanced gaming, VR and content creation. At the top of the lineup is the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor – the first consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads.” Intel also introduced a new X299 chipset, which includes more I/O and overclocking capabilities that enable Intel to launch HEDT processors on Skylake. This delivers high-performance rates as content creators are provided with fast image rendering, video encoding, audio production and real-time preview in order to spend less time waiting and more time creating. For gamers, the new capabilities enable them to play games whilst also streaming, recording and encoding their gameplay that they can share on social media. This can be accessed with a selection of screens for a 12K experience that will include up to four graphic cards. The GM also gave a sneak preview of the much anticipated 8th generation of Core processor-based devices later this year, which will drive performance at a rate of over 30% improvement compared to the 7th generation. Other announcements include the release of always-connected PCs, which in collaboration with Microsoft, Intel delivers high performance with Windows experiences, longer battery life and connectivity all built-in to a thin PC. Latest devices shown include Lenovo’s Yoga 720 with an H-series processor and Acer’s Predator Triton which has launched today. Still innovating with connected devices, Intel also launched a new Compute Card that enables devices outside of PCs to be connected to VR headsets. The Intel Compute Card will begin shipping in August 2017.

Samsung tie-up Internet of ThingsCognitive Computing Back to Home ICC Champions Trophy: Intel heads to the crease with IoT cricket bat Increase / Decrease text size James Nunns   - Deputy Editor 30th May 2017 Add to favorites The chip maker is hoping to hit a six with its tech enabled cricket revolution. The cricket season is back with a bang with the ICC Champions Trophy due to kick off on Thursday and Intel is hoping to score big with some new innovations to the sport. With drones, Internet of Things, and Virtual Reality advancements, Intel and the International Cricket Council are hoping to deliver the first smart cricket tournament. The first of the announcements is a cricket bat that has an Intel Curie module attached to it. The device, created by Speculur and called Speculur BatSense, uses the Intel Curie module mounted on the bat to generate data from every stroke that the batsman plays. This means that the batsman can see data on things like back-lift, bat speed, and follow-through. The device, which will be launched globally in August this year, will be used during the event by several batsmen. Read more: Virtual reality, the future of sport: NBA live streams as the NFL and Premier League play catch up Speculur Managing Director Atul Srivastava said: “Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers.” “Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman’s technique ultimately helping him perform better.” The device is expected to cost around $150 and will be available for cricketers of all abilities to use as they can use the associated app to analyse their play. In addition to the smart cricket bat, Intel is to deploy its Falcon 8 Drones during the Champions Trophy.  The drone is equipped with HD and infrared cameras and will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Broadcasters will be able to see the health of the pitch and gain insights into things like whether it will spin or seam. If that’s not enough cricket innovation for you then Intel has one more trick up its sleeve. The company is also going to be showcasing Virtual Reality tech at special zones in The Oval and Edgbaston stadiums. Fans will be able to use a head mounted display to test their skills against a virtual bowler.   Tags Cricket Homepage News List Intel IoT Sports Previous ArticlePutting IoT into real world use Next ArticleUFC grapples with virtual reality in Samsung tie-up Most read Bluewolf taps Einstein & Watson to bring AI to telecoms Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 UK General Election hacked – 80% think it could happen Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 Cisco Enterprise Agreement revolutionises software licensing James Nunns 31st May 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Editor’s Pick OneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 Red Hat CEO on being an open source zealot James Nunns 31st May 2017 IBM, Cisco team up to fight cyber crime across networks and cloud Ellie Burns 31st May 2017 Related News Using Data Gravity to Accelerate your Business Ellie Burns 2nd June 2017 The rise of autonomous agents in the most unusual of places James Nunns 2nd June 2017 Need a Quick Data-based Decision in the US? – Don’t Hold Your Breath James Nunns 22nd May 2017 Latest in 4th Revolution 4th Revolution Qualcomm patent issued for ‘The Internet of Shoes’ Joe Clark 19th May 2017 4th Revolution Report: Automation boosts revenues 15% and creates, not steals, jobs Ellie Burns 10th May 2017 4th Revolution Self driving car push by Intel sees BMW tie-up and Autonomous Driving Garage Joe Clark 4th May 2017 Latest in Analysis The CEO’s Guide to Data Security – Protect your data through innovation Ellie Burns 3rd May 2017 Why a 3D David Attenborough points to a Planet Earth driven by virtual customer experience Ellie Burns 20th April 2017 Exploring Antarctica with Eugene Kaspersky: From art and penguins, to the Glaciator robot Ellie Burns 18th April 2017 What Is About Us Editorial Team Advertise With Us Contact Us Help Privacy Policy RSS Feeds Site Map White Papers © 2016 COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW.

Intel® just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. The new LGA2066 processors require new motherboards, and ASUS has a diverse lineup split between the Prime, TUF, and ROG families. ROG has three models expertly tailored for different priorities: the Rampage VI Extreme lives up to its name for drool-worthy dream machines with custom liquid cooling and ultra-fast networking, the Rampage VI Apex unabashedly targets peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking, and the Strix X299-E provides gamers the powerful tuning, cooling, and personalization options they need to get the most from their rigs.  ROG does more than just offer checkbox featureswe take the time to ensure each one is empowering for enthusiasts and accessible for beginners. The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same. Shared Innovations Define The ROG X299 Family All three boards share the same DNAessential features that enthusiasts in the Republic of Gamers demand. That starts with critically acclaimed overclocking and cooling controls for liquid and air.

These include advanced pitch analysis by an Intel drone, a bat swing profile using a bat sensor powered by an Intel® Curie module and a cricket VR experience for the fans at the stadiums. The Digitization of Sports We couldnt be more excited to have Intel as our official innovation partner of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017, said David Richardson, CEO of the ICC. The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort. Intel Sports Group Vice President Sandra Lopez highlighted the role of technology in transforming the way we play and view sports. With higher levels of digitization, Intel is in a unique position to enable the sports industry to capture and analyze data to uncover and respond to new insights in real time. Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitization and personalization of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports, Lopez said. Later, Anuj Dua, director of marketing for Intels New Technology Group, detailed the innovations Intel is bringing to the current edition of Champions Trophy. Drones In a first at the Champions Trophy, the Intel® Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with high-definition and infrared cameras will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. Bat Sensor During his presentation, Dua introduced a new bat sensor powered by Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich storytelling during broadcasts. Speculur* Managing Director Atul Srivastava said, Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers. Srivastava added: Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsmans technique ultimately helping him perform better. Speculur also announced plans to bring this technology to consumers later in the year. With Speculur BatSense, hundreds of thousands of young and aspiring cricketers will soon be able to measure, track and improve their batting skills. Speculur plans to make Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside available in Australia, India, the United States and the U.K. in the second half of 2017. Former English captain-turned-commentator Nasser Hussain, who joined Dua on stage, stressed that technology has and will continue to positively affect cricket in a lot of ways. Player performance, game strategy, adjudication and fan experiences will all change with the introduction of new technologies to the sport. Virtual Reality Intel is also showcasing innovative experiences for in-stadium fans. Virtual reality (VR) experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston will allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skills against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from a swing, such as bat speed and back-lift angle, as well as a simulated score from the VR session. ###   About Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) expands the boundaries of technology to make the most amazing experiences possible.

Instead, the company has detailed the Intel Compute Card at Computex 2017 this week, effectively a full Windows PC squeezed into something the size of a credit card. Intel is betting on it igniting a new age of modular computing. We first saw hints of what Compute Card could do back at CES in January. Then, Intel was promising the unusual combination of a regular CPU – albeit a fairly low-power one – in a 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm enclosure. Manufacturers could add a Compute Card slot to their devices, allowing users to slot in a chunk of processing power if they wanted more advanced features in their smart fridge, for instance, or connected camera. Upgrades would be more straightforward in future, too, while those who didn’t want the advanced functionality could ignore the slot altogether. Now, we know just what’s inside those little cards. Four versions of the Intel Compute Card will be offered initially, running the gamut from an affordable Celeron up to a full Core i5. All will include not only the processor, storage, and memory, but wireless connectivity. The range kicks off with a Celeron N3450, paired with 64GB of eMMC storage and Intel Wireless AC 7265 with WiFi 802.11ac 2×2 and Bluetooth 4.2. A step up gets you the Pentium N4200 in its stead. Both have 4GB of DDR3 memory. A 7th-Gen Core i3 m3-7Y30 comes inside the third Compute Card model, also with 4GB of DDR3 memory but now hooked up to a 128GB Intel SSD for storage. It upgrades the wireless chipset, too, to Intel’s Wireless AC 8265 with faster 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2. Finally, the most powerful Compute Card variant has a 7th-Gen Intel Core i5-7Y57 processor. Importantly, while the credit-card sized PC may be fully functional, it won’t work on its own. There’s no battery inside, for a start, since it gets power when it’s plugged into another device; nor does it have regular connectivity. If you want to actually use it, you’ll need some sort of enclosure. Eventually Intel expects those enclosures to include laptop chassis which can be instantly upgraded by slotting in a new Compute Card, desktop PCs which are “dumb” until the Compute Card is installed, and displays which can be instantly made connected. For the reference design, though, it’s a simple desktop dock. That has a slot for the Compute Card on one side, and then a bevy of ports to go with it. Three USB ports – at least two of which are USB 3.0 – along with ethernet, DisplayPort, and HDMI aren’t bad going considering the tiny footprint. Of course not all devices with a Compute Card will have the same, since it’ll depend on what the OEM responsible decides is appropriate. OEMs are already lining up to use the modular design, however. Dell, HP, and Lenovo are already working on products, while LG Display, Sharp, Foxconn, and others are showing gadgets using Compute Card at Computex this week. NexDock has already announced that its laptop will use the Compute Card for its smarts. The Intel Compute Card is a modular computing platform with all the elements of a full computer, including Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options. It is slightly longer than a credit card at 95mm x 55mm x 5mm and can plug into a dock.

Computex 2017: Asus reveals a ton of new ZenBooks and Vivobooks by Tony Thomas  11:13 AM on May 29, 2017 Happy Memorial Day, gerbils. While you're presumably kicking back with a hot dog and beer, we're in balmy Taipei, Taiwan for the kickoff of Computex 2017. The first event of substance was a combined press conference by Asus and Intel. Asus chairman Jonney Shih took to the stage to unveil the company's latest and greatest laptops. Steel yourself for a lot of superlatives. Zenbook Flip S Asus opened with the most interesting product of the bunch, the ZenBook Flip S. Introduced as "the world's thinnest convertible laptop," the Flip S measures 0.4" (10.9 mm) thick and weighs 2.4 lbs (or 1.1 kg). The company was quick to point out that Flip S is about 20% thinner than the MacBook and 55% thinner than the Macbook Air. Zenbook Flip S The convertible's 360° rotating hinge was touted as "mesmerizing as a ballet dancer." Setting aside the odd simile, the hinge felt robust and rotated smoothly during our brief hands-on with the device. The Flip S transforms easily between a traditional laptop, a tent format, and tablet form. Regardless of the form, the Flip S proved to be quite fingerprint-prone, so Asus staff regularly swooped in for a microfiber wipe-down. The Flip S sports a 13.3" 4K display with a mere 0.24" (6.1 mm) bezel. Taking a leaf out of Dell's "InfinityEdge" book, Asus has slapped a "NanoEdge" branding on its new lineup of narrow-bezeled notebook displays. The machine also supports Windows Ink and Windows Hello. To take advantage of Ink, users must avail themselves of the Asus Pen with 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity. Asus didn't say whether a Pen would be bundled with the Flip S, but we'd bet it'll have to be purchased separately. On the Hello front, there's fingerprint sensor integrated into the right edge of the display's bezel. So well-integrated, in fact, that it wasn't readily discernible when I had the device in hand. Zenbook Flip S Now for what's under the hood. In what is presumably its highest configuration, the Flip S is powered by an unspecified Core i7 ultrabook processor with a turbo clock of 3.5 GHz. Intel's Gregory Bryant later made passing mention of Asus' use of seventh-generation Intel processors in its new lineup, so we wager the CPU inside the Flip S is the Core i7-7500U. 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD are along for the ride. The specs are rounded out by a 39 WHr battery that's allegedly good for 11.5 hours of computing. Asus says its fast-charging technology will take that battery from 0% to 60% in 49 minutes. When it's available later this year, the ZenBook Flip S will start at $1099. Rest assured that the configuration outlined above will cost substantially more. Zenbook 3 Deluxe Next up was the ZenBook 3 Deluxe, the 'world's thinnest 14" laptop.' In the same way that Dell calls the XPS 13 a 13" laptop in an 11" body, Asus is styling the ZenBook 3 Deluxe as a 14" laptop in a 13" chassis. The 0.5" (13 mm) thick all-metal body and 2.4 lbs (1.1 kg) weight make for a svelte package. Alas, whatever "aerospace-grade" metal the Zenbook 3 Deluxe is made out of doesn't appear to be any better at repelling fingerprints than the material used for the Flip S. Unlike that model, the Zenbook 3 Deluxe has a glass-covered touchpad and a fully-backlit keyboard. Zenbook 3 Deluxe Asus didn't make the 14" NanoEdge display's resolution known, so it's a fair bet that it's not 4K. However, the company was proud to announce that the ZenBook 3 Deluxe is the first laptop display armed with Corning's Gorilla Glass 5. Users at the bleeding edge of peripheral connectivity will be glad to hear that there are two USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 support. Asus asserts that there's enough bandwidth on tap for the machine to drive two external 4K displays simultaneously. In its most powerful configuration, the Zenbook 3 Deluxe is powered by an again-unspecified Core i7 CPU, a 1TB PCIe SSD, and 16GB of RAM. The starting price for this machine is $1199. Zenbook Pro To make for a smudgy metal trifecta, Asus trotted out a new ZenBook Pro. This time around, the guts of the machine were the main focus. The ZenBook Pro has a discrete graphics card—a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti—and a quad-core H-series Core i7 CPU. The flagship configuration again sports a 1TB PCIe SSD and 16GB of RAM. This time around, though, the RAM is 2400 MT/s DDR4. All that grunt drives a 15.6" NanoEdge 4K display, which the company says covers 100% of the sRGB color space. If that display isn't to your liking, the Pro's pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports will let you easily connect an external monitor. At 0.75" thick (or 19 mm) and 4 lbs (1.8 kg), the updated machine is considerably heftier than its non-Pro siblings, but it's nonetheless the thinnest and lightest ZenBook Pro yet. Some of that heft comes from a 73 WHr battery rated for 14 hours of use. Despite the larger capacity, Asus says its fast-charging technology will again take the battery from 0% to 60% in 49 minutes. The Pro again ratchets the price up a notch, starting at $1299. Vivobook S Lastly, Asus debuted a pair of VivoBooks. The company considers its VivoBooks "mainstream notebooks," as opposed to the more enthusiast-oriented ZenBook line. The VivoBook S is surprisingly trim for a non-ultrabook: only 0.71" (18 mm) thick and weighing in at 3.3 lbs (or 1.5 kg). Inside, you'll find a Core i7 U-series processor, a GeForce 940MX graphics card, up to 2TB of spinning rust or 512GB of solid-state goodness, and up to 16GB of 2133 MT/s DDR4 memory. The big hook for the VivoBook S is the price. Even at $499, you still get a 15.6" 1080p NanoEdge display and Asus' fast-charging tech. Yet again, Asus delivers an absurdly consistent estimate that the battery will go from 0% to 60% in 49 minutes. Vivobook Pro The VivoBook Pro, as you might expect, is a bit more of an upmarket machine. Its aluminum body rings in at 0.76" (19.2 mm) thick and 5 lbs (or 2.3 kg), but with great size comes, er, great hardware. You can ratchet the VivoBook Pro all the way up to a quad-core Core i7-7700HQ accompanied by 16GB of DDR4 and a GeForce GTX 1050. In addition to the 2TB HDD and 512GB SSD options, you can apparently provision the VivoBook Pro with Optane Memory, though Jonney Shih didn't delve into more detail here. On the outside, the VivoBook Pro packs a 4K display covering 100% of the sRGB space and a fully backlit keyboard. Starting price is set at $799.

Aorus X299 boards keep Core X PCs cool and colorful by Bruno Ferreira  6:00 AM on May 30, 2017 The impending release of Intel's X299 high-end desktop platform has been one of the worst-kept secrets in the industry lately. There have been jokes running around the TR Slack of late about referring to it as another buffalo, but the overall reaction was "eh, why bother?" The chipset is out, the socket is LGA 2066, and Gigabyte has four super-fancy boards ready for Intel's Core X-series CPUs. Meet the Aorus X299 Gaming series. We'll talk about four models in turn, but let's first take a look at all of the common features among them. The high-endness of these offerings is quite visible from the outset, since the boards pack a massive backplate. Depending on the exact model, there are RGB LEDs with Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software running the show. One might find RGB LEDs around the PCIe slots, DIMM sockets, and even on the I/O shield on these boards. Around the back, there are Type-C port and Type-A connectors, and another four USB 3.0 ports. All models also include a total of 8 hybrid fan headers, seven thermal sensors, two headers for thermistors, and a 3A header specifically for juicing up pumps. It's safe to say that even the most affordable model in the series is high-end enough. The Aorus X299 Gaming 3 couples the features above with two M.2 sockets, an Intel Ethernet adapter, and six-zone RGB LED lighting. Moving up the range, we find the Aorus X299 Ultra Gaming, which we figure represents the "just right" offering in the series. This model also comes with an Intel Ethernet adapter, but it has three M.2 slots and a header for a front-panel USB 3.1 Type-C connector. The Aorus Gaming 7 gets a little more serious. In addition to the features above, it packs a dual-Ethernet setup with both Killer and Intel Ethernet controllers, along with a Killer 1535 Wi-Fi adapter. The audio section gets a boost, too, thanks to the presence of an ESS Sabre DAC and TI op-amps. As an additional nod to audiophiles, this board has two of Gigabyte's DAC-Up 2 USB ports, which purportedly offer less electrical noise than the regular ones, for the purpose of plugging in external audio gear. Finishing touches on this model include four USB 3.1 Type-A ports, a total of eight LED zones, three M.2 slots with heatsinks, and Gigabyte's Q-Flash Plus functionality for updating firmware without a CPU. The final model in the series is the Aorus X299 Gaming 9. This version builds on the features of the Gaming 7 model above, but comes with an M.2-to-U.2 adapter and an M.2 add-in card. This model also comes with an acrylic I/O shield with RGB LED lighting, plus a massive backplate reinforcing nearly the full area of the board. Pricing for these mobos hasn't been revealed, but our eight-ball says "not cheap." Tags: Motherboards Chipsets Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Asus starts its X299 assault with seven motherboards by Zak Killian  6:00 AM on May 30, 2017 So you're all hyped and ready to plunk down the considerable chunk of change for an Intel Core i9 CPU. The question is, what motherboard should you put it in? Asus is ready with no less than seven boards equipped with the requisite X299 chipset for your shiny new CPU. Three models from the Republic of Gamers are joined by two "Prime" boards and two board from the company's TUF series. Asus ROG Strix X299-E The finest model in Asus' new fleet of fancy motherboards is the Rampage VI Extreme. Asus says this flagship motherboard is designed specifically for custom-loop liquid-cooling, and intended for "showcase" PCs. It has a specific connector to let waterblocks provide flow rate, temperature, and leakage data to the system. It also has two more headers onboard specifically for monitoring the flow rate through your loop. Like previous Rampage Extreme boards from Asus, the new model includes everything and the kitchen sink. That means you get 10-Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ad Wi-Fi, triple M.2 slots, on-board Thunderbolt 3, and even a tiny OLED screen. The "LiveDash" allows builders to monitor temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds right on the board. On the way down from Extreme to Apex, we lose half the board's memory slots. Asus says the Rampage VI Apex is targeted at "peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking." To that end, the board only has one memory slot per memory channel, which simplifies the board's wiring and improves signal integrity. That, in turn, should allow overclockers to hit the highest possible memory speeds and the lowest possible latencies. The Apex can take up to four M.2 SSDs, too. If you've got a burning desire for the beauty of the Rampage boards but no desire to burn a hole in your pocketbook, the ROG Strix X299-E is probably where you'll want to look. This model has the features you expect from a ROG X299 mainboard, like dual M.2 sockets, Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet, onboard Wi-Fi, USB 3.1, and diagnostic LEDs. Of course, it also includes RGB LED accents, Aura Sync headers, and a couple of pump control headers. Asus Prime X299-Deluxe Gaming isn't the only reason people build high-end PCs, though. If you need a high-end motherboard with all the trimmings, but you don't want to be saddled with the gamer stigma, the Prime X299-Deluxe has most everything offered by the Rampage VI Extreme above. That includes the LiveDash OLED readout, 802.11ad Wi-Fi, and a pair of M.2 sockets. It also includes a U.2 port for enterprise SSDs, and a pair of Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet connections. The Prime X299-Deluxe doesn't have the Extreme's Thunderbolt connection on-board, so Asus includes a ThunderboltEX 3 card in the box. The X299-Deluxe also includes a "Fan Extension" card that will apparently provide even more fan headers in case the motherboard's standard provisions of five fan headers and two pump headers won't suffice. Neither of those cards are included with the Prime X299-A which also drops the Deluxe's 802.11ad Wi-Fi and LiveDash OLED. Asus TUF X299 Mark 1 Not so long ago Asus' TUF family of motherboards was better known as Sabertooth, but the company seems to have dropped the moniker with its Z270 boards in favor of a military-style "Mark" designation. Along those lines, we're getting two TUF motherboards based on the X299 platform: the TUF X299 Mark 1 and TUF X299 Mark 2. Asus says the TUF boards "meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine." Unfortunately, the company didn't provide a lot of details about the capabilities of these boards, but we can see from the pictures that both include two M.2 sockets and minimal emphasis on glitz. The TUF Mark 1 is covered in metallic "Thermal Armor" both front and back, and it integrates a squirrel cage fan to blow cool air directly over the beheatsink'd M.2 drive below. The TUF X299 Mark 2 is fundamentally very similar to the Mark 1, but it doffs most of the other board's Thermal Armor for a "stripped down" appearance that should suit the tastes of gerbils allergic to flash and style. Asus also remarks that the Mark 2 board should be more economical than its sibling. Unfortunately, we don't know just how economical any of these boards will be, because the company hasn't finalized its pricing. Asus says its X299 motherboards should become available in late June, and that it will announce pricing on June 26. We'll surely be covering these motherboards in more detail and perhaps even reviewing one or more. Stay tuned. Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Drones, bat sensors, VR and more Max Langridge30 May 2017VR Intel Intel will demonstrate using several technologies at the ICC Trophy Drone to analyse pitch data, bat sensor to analyse swing data Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Intel has announced a few new technological additions to the International Cricket Champions (ICC) Trophy, which starts Thursday 1 June. Chief among the technological advancements Intel will be taking to the tournament, include using the company's Falcon 8 drone to analyse the pitch before each match. The Falcon 8 drone is equipped with HD and infrared cameras and will be able to monitor and assess grass cover, grass health and topology. All the data will then be available for commentators to access and use during matches. Intel also has a cricket bat sensor that's powered by the company's own Curie technology. The sensor can be attached to any cricket bat to generate data for each individual player. Data monitored includes back-lift, bat speed and follow-through. The sensors will be used by several batsmen during the tournament to not only allow them to assess and improve their game, but to give the audience a greater insight into stroke play.  Intel It's not just the professionals that will ultimately get to benefit from the Speculur BatSense technology either, as Speculur plans to launch a consumer version of the bat sensor later in 2017. The consumer version will be available in Australia, India, the US and the UK in the second half of 2017. With its applications within sport rising all the time, it may come as no surprise to know that Intel will be bringing virtual reality to the ICC Trophy too. There will be dedicated virtual reality zones at both The Oval and Edgbaston cricket grounds, where fans and visitors can don a VR headset to test their batting skills against a virtual bowler. The bat used when participating will also have the BatSense sensor attached, so players can view their bat stroke data and be given a final simulated score from the session.

The Intel Core i9 X-Series is for power users and seriously hardcore PC gamers as it starts at around $1,000 and goes up to a mighty $2,000 for the 18-core i9-7980XE. And that's not including new motherboards you'll likely need to run them. For that though, you'll more than likely be futureproof for years. The Intel Core X-Series of processors also includes i5 and i7 CPUs, but it is the i9 range that's garnering the most attention. The i9-7980XE, for example, is the first consumer chip from the manufacturer that offers over a teraflop in computing power. Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Want to play games in 4K 60fps and run other processes over the top? It's a doddle with that chip. The i9 series of chips all run at base clock speeds of 3.3GHz. Turbo Boost can increase that up to 4.5GHz. To keep the chips cool, Intel has developed its own liquid cooling system although if you're willing to shell out so much for the ultimate in processing it is likely you are willing to build your own ultra cooling into your new gaming rig.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | MYT 4:43 PM ARM announces new chip design aimed at cracking Intel stronghold A file photo of computer chips on a motherboard inside a communications room at an office in London, UK. ARM's Cortex-A75, whose predecessor is at the heart of many smartphones, will increase performance by 50%, said the UK-based company. — Bloomberg ARM Holdings Plc, the division of SoftBank Group Corp whose technology is the most widely used in the chip industry, announced a new design that targets the personal computer and server markets dominated by Intel Corp.  The new ARM Cortex-A75, whose predecessor is at the heart many of the world’s smartphones, will increase performance by 50%, the Cambridge, UK-based company said. That step up will be crucial to find a place for it in machines that aren’t constrained by battery life and need the ability to move around huge chunks of data quickly.  “Cortex-A75 has the broadest market implications of any premium processor we’ve ever brought to market,” said Rene Haas, president of ARM’s IP Products Group.  ARM’s customers, who use its designs or create their own chips using a more basic level of the company’s technology, have so far failed to make a dent in Intel’s lead in the PC and lucrative server markets. While 50 billion ARM-based chips were shipped in the last four years, the majority sell for tens of dollars or much less. Some of Intel’s Xeon processors cost thousands.  The improvement in the A75 and a new more efficient A-55 design are also aimed at bringing more computing power to a range of devices, ARM said. That’s necessary because the increasing use of artificial intelligence software in everything from cars to television set-top boxes places more strain on the processors at the heart of such devices. Voice recognition, image recognition and other tasks that require instant manipulation of data will need strong local processing.  Future ARM-based designs will also be more flexible, which would allow for a combination of powerful and efficient processors on the same chip. For example, a set-top box that infrequently needs a burst of computing power could be equipped with a chip that has one powerful processor core – an A-75 – and many smaller A-55 types that could perform a number of tasks in parallel.  The new designs will start to show up in devices beginning in 2018, ARM said. Its customers include chip companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and gadget and phone makers including Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Stopping Internet use can cause physical withdrawal symptoms, increased anxiety: study Baidu in self-driving car tech tie-ups with Bosch, Continental 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read AirAsia warns of ticket scams Fed Cup squabble overshadows home fans' joy Saudi Arabia cuts ties to Qatar, cites 'terrorism' advertisement Latest News Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

John Rosevear, Keith Speights, and Keith Noonan (TMFMarlowe) May 30, 2017 at 10:33AM What stocks are the "smartest" investors buying? We asked three Fool contributors a version of that question: Which stocks are either already getting attention from highly regarded professional investors or should be? Here's why they think Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), and an old favorite -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- deserve a close look right now.  An under-the-radar way to invest in self-driving cars John Rosevear (Delphi Automotive): A lot of analysts and pundits will tell you that Silicon Valley companies are the best way to invest in the coming wave of autonomous vehicles. But some smart investors know that there's plenty of cutting-edge work being done within the "legacy" auto industry -- and old-line auto supplier Delphi Automotive increasingly stands out as a company that could profit big as cars and trucks learn to drive themselves.  Look past the tech-press hype and you'll find Delphi Automotive in the forefront of commercializing self-driving technology. Image source: Delphi Automotive. Delphi is deeply involved in a number of ventures that aim to bring self-driving technology to market in the next few years. Those include a partnership with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) that will make a "Level 4" self-driving system available to any automaker -- old or new -- by the end of 2019. (Learn about the "levels" of self-driving technology here.)  Delphi is also working with those two partners to help BMW AG (NASDAQOTH:BAMXF) create a series of self-driving systems -- and Delphi and its partners will have the right to sell those to other automakers as well. Delphi is also believed to be working with several other automakers and tech companies on projects to develop or integrate autonomous technology.  How big does it expect those businesses to be? Let's put it this way: Delphi recently announced that it will soon spin off its legacy internal combustion engine components business to focus on "electronic safety systems" -- specifically, self-driving technology. It's realigning its whole business around this future technology, and it's doing so from a strong position. Delphi's status as a long-established industry supplier means that the automakers will know that its self-driving offerings will perform as advertised. That's not necessarily true of new high-tech entrants.  Intel's pending purchase of Mobileye means that there's no longer a pure play for those who want to invest in autonomous vehicle technology, at least among public companies. But Delphi is becoming the next best thing. At 20 times earnings, it's not cheap for an old auto industry supplier -- but investors who buy today might look very smart indeed in a few years.  A smart personalized medicine play Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Investors who bought shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals early this year are probably feeling really smart right now. The biotech stock is up more than 60% so far in 2017. The main reason behind Vertex's big surge this year was the company's announcement in March of results from two late-stage clinical studies of a combination of tezacaftor and Kalydeco in treating cystic fibrosis (CF). Those results were so promising that Vertex intends to submit the combo therapy for regulatory approval in the U.S. and in Europe in the third quarter of 2017.  Vertex also received more good news for Kalydeco. On May 18, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for use in CF patients ages two and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. This was the fourth FDA approval for the drug, which first gained approval for treating CF patients ages six and older with the specific G551D mutation in the CFTR gene.  In the meantime, Vertex is continuing to finalize reimbursement deals in European countries for another CF drug, Orkambi. Although Orkambi is the company's newest drug on the market, it has already leaped past Kalydeco to become Vertex's top-selling product. Based on the strength of Kalydeco and Orkambi, along with good prospects for approval of the tezacaftor/Kalydeco combo, Vertex is one of the top biotechs developing personalized medicines and appears to be poised for tremendous earnings growth. I think buying Vertex is still a smart move even after the stock's big run-up. Buffett takes another bite of Apple Keith Noonan (Apple): No investor has cultivated a more esteemed reputation than Warren Buffett, so news that he and his company Berkshire Hathaway have been buying up shares of Apple has understandably attracted a lot of attention. Berkshire now owns roughly 2.5% of outstanding Apple shares, and the company has been increasing its position in the tech giant at a time when there's considerable debate about the iPhone maker's valuation. Buffett has added to his company's stake in Apple even as shares traded at record highs, making it his company's third-largest holding despite a previously stated aversion to tech investing. The Oracle of Omaha has praised Cupertino's long-term earnings growth potential and also pointed to the company's recent move to increase its share buyback authorization by $35 billion as a favorable sign. The Apple Watch. Image source: Apple, Inc. While iPhone sales are showing signs of softening, Apple is seeing strong performance from its services business and has some exciting projects on the horizon including its long-in-development push into smart cars. Also encouraging for Apple investors is momentum in wearables. While the Apple Watch got off to a bit of a rough start, it looks like consumers are becoming more receptive to the company's smartwatch offerings. Sales data from Strategy Analytics for the first quarter of 2017 shows that the company is now the top wearables company by market share, with shipments of its smartwatch increasing 59% year over year to reach 3.5 million units. With its brand and business strengths, stellar cash flow, and a forward P/E of 17 that still notches below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 18, it's not hard to see why Buffett keeps coming back to Apple.

(AMD) Stock on Any Good-Sized Dip The company Advanced Micro Devices is today isn't the company it was even just a year ago. AMD stock is just overbought. May 30, 2017, 9:04 am EDT  |  By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer Source: Shutterstock     View All   The past two weeks have been miserable for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders. AMD stock has fallen nearly 14% since its analyst day meeting on May 16, when the company didn’t confirm rumors that it and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) weren’t teaming up. Source: Nvidia Intel’s GPU contract with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expired in March, and the company was supposed to be shopping around. Fanning the bearish flames since then was a downgrade of AMD stock from Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees. She lowered her stance on the company from a “Buy” to a “Hold” on concerns that Advanced Micro Devices’ business model isn’t going to work well enough in the long run. Van Hees doubts AMD and Intel will ever come to an accord, simply because Intel doesn’t need to make a deal. Several other analysts expressed similar concerns shortly after the analyst day event. It begs the question: Was the market wrong to push AMD stock up more than 400% between March 2016 and March 2017 on hopes that a true turnaround was underway? Or does Advanced Micro Devices have enough in its pipeline to justify the huge rally? The New and Improved AMD No suspense or teasing is required here — Advanced Micro Devices is the real deal, and has positioned itself for massive growth that simply wasn’t possible as recently as a year ago. Just don’t conflate the company with the stock. As yours truly pointed out in April, there was and still is a disconnect between AMD stock and AMD’s plausible near-term future. In other words, the stock’s price got too far ahead of its near-term prospects. It happens. Counted among the bullish factors is the development of a central processing unit (or CPU) called the Ryzen. It’s built to compete with Intel’s Core iX series at about half the price, and it achieves its goal. While the initial reviews of Ryzen processors were a bit wobbly, the reason for their subpar performance underscores the underlying problem: Video game designers didn’t develop many of their recent publications to be played on the new CPU architecture. Now with AMD’s developer tools in hand and good reason to create patches that utilize the Ryzen’s eight cores and 16 threads, gaming on the processor will improve as patches and updates are released. Another weapon in Advanced Micro Devices’ arsenal is its yet-to-be-released Vega graphics processing unit, which takes aim at Nvidia’s growth within the GPU space. Vega’s architecture allows for the offloading of the graphical processing from the video card to the motherboard’s memory, which is generally more powerful than a video card itself. Yet, AMD’s GPUs are powerful in their own right. They’re so fast that when several of them are used in parallel, they’re fast enough and accurate enough to serve as the computing power needed in artificial intelligence applications. Its Radeon line of graphics processing units have already been tweaked for this purpose, effectively throwing its hat in a ring largely controlled by Nvidia. There’s still more on the company’s R&D plate to unveil, then launch. It’s interesting simply because it’s all new. While Advanced Micro Devices has remained in business, it has been far more focused on development than production for the past several years. The fruit of that labor is just now starting to ripen, and these fruits are considerably more competitive than its previous fruit has been. This isn’t the AMD of three years ago, or even one year ago. Bottom Line for AMD Stock Still, Advanced Micro shares look and feel overextended. That’s because they are.

Unveiled at Computex 2017 this week, the new chips are part of what Intel says is recognition that no, not all PC users are created equal. Indeed, when it comes to gamers, content creators, and people dealing in compute-intense segments like virtual reality, the needs are higher than the current Core i3, i5, and i7 range can deliver. The new Core i9 gamely steps into that open space. Billed as offering the highest performance for those doing “advanced gaming, VR and content creation” it’s the first consumer desktop CPU that packs – in Core i9 Extreme Edition form – a full 18 cores and 36 threads. “This is by far the most extreme desktop processor ever introduced,” Intel boasts. It sits in a new range of Core X-series chips targeting enthusiasts. Not all will be quite so over-specified, mind. They’ll start out at four cores, with Intel promising more affordable options than what will undoubtedly be a premium price tag for the Core i9 Extreme Edition. Then there’ll be 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 core options, all using the new LGA 2066 socket. New too is the Intel X299 chipset to go with the Core X-series. Improving the I/O capabilities over Intel’s old version, it’ll have 30 total high-speed I/O lanes and up to three Intel Rapid Storage Technology PCIe 3.0 x4 storage support. Intel Ethernet Connection 219 is also supported, together with up to eight SATA 3.0 6 Gb/s ports, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, and up to three independent displays. It can handle DDR4 memory, Intel Optane memory, overclocking, and has Intel Platform Trust Technology 3.0. Updates to Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, meanwhile, now allow the system to spot which are the two top performing cores, and then target them with the most critical workloads. That, Intel promises, should deliver a sizable jump in both single- and multithreaded performance. The upshot is more than just on-paper boasting, though. For video editing, Intel suggests, it opens the door to even faster image and video rendering and encoding, and real-time previews of even the most complex projects. Gamers will be able to configure rigs with up to four discrete graphics cards, with 12K video and both maxed-out settings on their games of choice while also streaming and recording in the background. The first systems running the X299 chipset will be available in the coming weeks, along with motherboards using the chipset and the LGA 2066 socket.

The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our 'Official Innovation Partner' of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, CEO, ICC, on Tuesday. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort," Richardson added in a statement. The bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. Intel will also showcase VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston, to allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," said Atul Srivastava, Managing Director, Speculur which is a Bengaluru-based smart wearables and cognitive computing company. With "Speculur BatSense", aspiring cricketers can measure, track and improve their batting skills.

No word on price, battery life. Mark Walton (UK) - May 30, 2017 1:34 pm UTC Enlarge Nvidia reader comments 103 Share this story In a thinly veiled branding exercise, graphics card maker Nvidia has unveiled "Max-Q," a series of thin and light gaming notebooks. Much like Intel's Ultrabook initiative, Nvidia is hoping that Max-Q will encourage laptop makers to create gaming laptops that can actually be used on the go, rather than remain permanently tethered to a wall socket, because humanity's best scientists haven't yet created a battery-sized fusion power cell. To that end, Max-Q (a co-opted NASA term that defines the point at which the aerodynamic stress on a rocket in atmospheric flight is maximised) has some recommended physical specs. Those include a thickness of 18mm and a weight of 2.3kg—a significant reduction over the 51mm and 4.5kg of GTX 880M-era laptops. Naturally, Max-Q laptops sport one of Nvidia's desktop-class graphics cards, which include the GTX 1060, GTX 1070, and GTX 1080. Further ReadingAcer Predator 21X: The world’s first curved-screen laptop Fan noise, a perpetual problem for gaming laptops, is kept low by a new feature dubbed WhisperMode. WhisperMode dynamically changes the game's frame rate, while simultaneously tweaking the graphics settings in order to save GPU resources. While Nvidia is yet to reveal the technical details behind WhisperMode, it sounds an awful lot like AMD's Radeon Chill feature, which lowers the frame rate during less action-orientated scenes in order to save power. What isn't part of Max-Q are battery life recommendations. Gaming laptops are notorious for having terrible battery life. While more efficient CPUs and GPUs have helped increase battery life over the past few years, slim Max-Q designs leave even less room for a battery. Perhaps the oddest part of Nvidia's Max-Q announcement were comparisons to games consoles. While running a live demo of Project Cars 2, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that a GTX 1080 Asus laptop is 60 percent faster than a PlayStation 4 Pro. While the performance is certainly better, Huang failed to mention the price of the Max-Q laptop. Currently, a GTX 1080 laptop costs at least £2,000; a PS4 Pro costs a mere £335.

YouTube/Apple Apple has conspicuously changed the delivery schedule for the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 for US customers. The Cupertino company has pushed the delivery date for buyers of the 2016 model with the fastest delivery option set for June 5 and the free delivery option on June 6 at the earliest. Apple has been known to alter the delivery dates, though most have somehow associated it with the potential release of upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 models. As mentioned in a previous post, the Cupertino company may introduce upgraded models of the variant which would be armed with an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, Mac Rumors reports. It is possible that Apple may be trying to control stocks and opt to produce 2016 MacBook Pro models in safer volumes. That version drew its share of criticism, mostly hitting on Apple’s decision to use an Intel Skylake chipset. As most know, Apple was backed into a wall before eventually deciding to release the MacBook Pro refresh. Availability of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset was unstable last year before eventually normalizing in early 2017. The reason behind the release of the MacBook Pro 2016 was seen as a way for Apple to maintain its regular schedule of releasing new models for its laptop line. But now, it seems the Cupertino company will break that anyway with a suggested revelation of upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 models at WWDC 2017. Another point worth noting is that it is only the 15-inch model that got a pushed back delivery date. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is in stock and can be delivered as early as the next day. It remains to be seen if there will be an upgraded 13-inch MacBook Pro models, something that could be announced at the upcoming Apple event. In other regions, it seems that 15-inch MacBook Pro delivery estimates have also hit a snag. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and several other countries are reportedly experiencing long waits, hinting that Apple may have other plans ahead. The Cupertino company may have toned down production, as they expect demand for the anticipated MacBook Pro 2017 to run like crazy if it is introduced at the WWDC 2017. Apple normally allows 320 days before a new model is released. If a MacBook Pro 2017 does come out on June 5, the 2016 model would be below that average with only 220 days passed.

It’s the fourth time in a row that the company has stuck to this process for its new lineup of chips. The company didn’t really say then what the improvements were going to be but it did claim a 15 percent performance improvement over the existing 7th Generation of Core processors. Intel now says that the performance gain is actually going to be 30 percent. Intel confirmed at Computex 2017 that the performance improvement that it talked about previously doesn’t show the full picture. It says that the upcoming 8th Generation Core processors will actually provide 30 percent improved performance compared to the 7th Generation Core processors. It merits mentioning here that Intel has based this figure off of the Sysmark benchmark, but it goes to show that we can expect more from the company’s next-generation processors. The company didn’t really say more about the 8th Generation processors during its keynote at Computex 2017. There’s no change in the fact that they’re based on the 14 nanometer architecture and that Intel is going to release them at some point later this year. Intel has launched its new Core X family of processors today, based on the Skylake architecture, the new family even comes with top-of-the-line Core i9 models for those who want more performance.

The new chips are mostly based on an updated version of Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake platform, called Skylake X, with the exception of a pair of entry-level four-core models that are based on the Kaby Lake X platform. Billed as Intel’s most scalable, accessible and powerful desktop platform ever, the lineup includes a new Core i9 processor brand along with a Core i9 Extreme Edition processor—the first consumer desktop chip with a whopping 18 cores and 36 threads of power. Intel’s Turbo Boost technology has been updated with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology as well. According to Intel, the new Core X family sports ten percent faster multithread performance over the previous generation, and a 15 percent boost in single thread performance. The entry-level Core X i5-7640X chip with four cores and as many threads starts at $242. The more powerful Core i7 X-Series starts at $339 for a four-core, eight-thread model and goes all the way up to a $599 eight-core, 16-thread chip. The flagship Core i9 X-Series chip, which stars at ten processor cores and 16 threads, is priced at $999, with its 16-core, 32-thread variant going for $1,699. The new desktop Core X chips are designed to work with Intel’s new X299 motherboard chipset which should be rolling out on partner products in the coming weeks, along with the new CPUs. As you know, Apple is expected to update its iMac all-in-ones with server-grade Intel Xeon processors and discreet graphics later this year. The chip giant says its upcoming eighth-generation Coffe Lake platform will see up to a thirty percent performance improvement over the current seventh-generation Kaby Lake. It did not provide a timeframe for Coffe Lake chips. “We will have more to say about the eightht-generaiton Core processor in the future,” said Intel. The Coffe Lake chips may power updated MacBook Pros, coming later this year.

Name: Subject: Message: What ever happened to LG’s NUCLUN processors? Featuresby Gary Sims6 days ago 4 600 11   Towards the end of 2014 LG announced its first mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC), the octa-core NUCLUN. The chip debuted in the LG G3 Screen, a smartphone developed specifically for the Korean market, but since then it hasn’t been used in any smartphones. At the time of its release LG was quite buoyant about the benefits of building its own SoC. “NUCLUN opens up a new chapter in LG’s history of innovation in the mobile industry,” said Dr. Jong-seok Park, head of LG Mobile. “With this in-house solution, we will be able to achieve better vertical integration and further diversity our product strategy against stronger competition. NUCLUN will give us greater flexibility in our mobile strategy going forward.” So what happened? The NUCLUN (pronounced NOO-klun) was designed using ARM’s big.LITTLE technology with four 1.5GHz Cortex-A15 cores and four 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 cores. The chip also included a CAT 6 4G modem and an PowerVR GPU from Imagination. For 2014, that was a reasonable setup, however not a flagship setup as the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 had a similar SoC configuration. A year later towards the end of 2015 rumors started to circulate that LG was working on its second generation NUCLUN SoC. Dubbed the NUCLUN 2 it was suggested that the new chip would keep its octa-core heritage, however it would make the jump from 32-bit to 64-bit by using four ARM Cortex-A72 cores and four Cortex-A53 CPU cores. It was also suggested that LG Electronics was working with Intel Foundry to build the new chip on a 14nm FinFET manufacturing process and simultaneously working with TSMC on a 16nm version. Either of which would be a notable improvement over the 28nm process used for the first chip. By the end of 2015 the rumors had reached full speed and it was thought that the NUCLUN 2 would be used in the LG V20. However, nine months later the V20 was launched with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820. But just before the launch of the V20, ARM and Intel Custom Foundry announced an agreement to accelerate the development and implementation of ARM SoCs on Intel’s 10nm manufacturing process. As part of that announcement ARM said that the initial agreement covers the manufacture of  “two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE™ or stand-alone configurations.” The key to understanding the above statement is that it tells us about two yet unreleased (i.e. future) Cortex-A cores that will be built on 10nm. Why two? Because processors in a big.LITTLE configuration need use the exactly the same ARM architecture revision. The only reason to release two new Cortex-A designs simultaneously is when a new architecture revision is being used. At the time of the announcement I said, “In a nutshell, ARM’s current 64 bit CPUs use the ARM v8 architecture. However there are revisions known as v8.1 and v8.2. big.LITTLE needs the CPU cores to use the same architecture revision. The sentence above hints that ARM will release a new big CPU and a new LITTLE CPU at the same time on 10nm using, I guess, the latest architecture revision.” Now that the ARM Cortex-A75 and the ARM Cortex-A55 have been launched we can see that my prediction was correct. But what of LG? In the same announcement Intel also said that LG will produce “a world-class mobile platform based on Intel Custom Foundry’s 10nm design platform.” Since the only core designs being built by Intel on 10nm are the Cortex-A75 and the Cortex-A55 then it follows that LG’s next SoC will use these new ARM cores. Why the LG G6 didn’t use the Snapdragon 835 LG doesn’t exclusively use Qualcomm’s chips. Quite a number of its mid-range device use MediaTek processors including the LG Stylo 3. However for the high-end LG needs Qualcomm’s offerings, mainly because it has no alternative. In fact it can be argued that a lack of alternatives to Qualcomm is hurting the ecosystem. If you look at the other major handset makers you will see that they all make their own mobile processors. Samsung has its Exynos range, while Huawei has its Kirin line. Everyone else has to use either Qualcomm or MediaTek. The LG G6  didn’t ship with the Snapdragon 835 but instead with the 2016 Snapdragon 821. Many people found this surprising as it was assumed that all the flagships devices using a Qualcomm processor would use the 835. However you need to take into account the timing of the G6’s launch. Although the first 835 chips were available by time the LG6 hit the shelves, it takes months to ramp up production of these premium handsets, which meant that LG needed the processor parts before the Snapdragon 835 was available in quantity. Since meaningful volume production of the Snapdragon 835 was not available to LG before the planned launch of the G6 then LG either had to go with the Snapdragon 821 or delay the launch of the G6 for two, three, maybe even four months. However it is now assumed that since the Snapdragon 835 is in full production that it will be used in in the LG V30, or whatever LG calls its mid-season V20 successor. Such a reliance on Qualcomm could be seen as a problem for LG, especially since this isn’t the first time that LG had to opt for a different processor due to problems with Qualcomm’s leading offering. Remember how LG cleverly avoided the whole Snapdragon 810 overheating drama by opting for the 808 in the LG G4? The solution for LG is to make its own processor (again), just like Huawei and Samsung. Naming and timing So, we know that LG is making a Cortex-A75 / Cortex-A55 based processor using Intel’s 10nm process. There are no current clues about the GPU, however it makes sense for LG to go with the ARM Mali-G72, since it was also announced at the same time as the two new processor cores. In fact, it is easiest for LG to use as many ARM designs as it can in its new processor as ARM can provide a complete SoC solution (CPU, GPU, Video processor, Display processor, Image Signal Processor, etc), along with all the system integration services. It seems that the NUCLUN 2 did actually make it to silicon, however it was never used in any devices, remember that it is now 2.5 years since the NUCLUN 1 appeared. So it is likely that the new LG SoC will be either called the NUCLUN 3 or LG will adopt a new naming scheme, probably still based on the NUCLUN brand but with a more complex structure, something like the NUCLUN 300, or whatever. But why didn’t the NUCLUN 2 ever see the light of day? One possible answer is because LG may have received tax breaks or tax incentives to build a processor research lab from the Korean government, and as such it needed to actually make something, but not necessarily ship any products using the designs that came from the lab. LG has received help from the Korean government before, most notably with its OLED business. It is interesting to note that the original NUCLUN only appeared in one device, one developed specifically for the Korean market and not sold anywhere else! However such tax breaks are, at the moment, just a speculation, but if true it seems that any new NUCLUN processors would certainly justify the costs, especially if it ends up in a popular handset or two. There remains however one big problem for LG, and that is Intel’s 10nm process. At the time of writing Intel has not shipped any 10nm chips, not even for itself, let alone for any of its Foundry clients. The current rumor mill suggests that we won’t see any PC type end-products shipping with Intel based 10nm chips until the end of this year (2017) and some people are suggesting that this could slip into 2018. That means that if Intel are putting the demands of its customers like LG on a equal footing with its own internal demands (and it probably isn’t doing that) then LG’s mobile processor won’t be available until the end of 2017. That means that LG might not get development samples in time for the LG G7. If Qualcomm isn’t able to supply LG with its next generation of Snapdragon processor in a time frame that meets LG’s development cycle, then the G7 might use the Snapdragon 835, in a similar way to how the G6 used the Snapdragon 821. However there would be hope for the LG V40. But there are reports that LG and Qualcomm are already working together to make sure that the rumored Snapdragon 845 will be available for the G7. This means that if all this supposition is correct then the V30 will use the Snapdragon 835, the G7 will use the Qualcomm SoC that comes after the Snapdragon  835 (the Snapdragon  845?), and the LG V40 will use the new Intel made NUCLUN. Wrap-up One aspect that I haven’t touched on is the LTE modem for the new NUCLUN. Whose LTE modem will LG incorporate in to the new processor? Qualcomm’s? Intel’s? Probably the latter and it was likely part of the deal between LG and Intel. What do you think? Is this just pie-in-the-sky thinking or do the clues point to LG moving away from Qualcomm for its flagship devices?

Called GeForce GTX Max-Q, NVIDIA is undertaking their own Ultrabook project of sorts, encouraging partners to develop thinner and lighter high performance gaming laptops, giving them better tools to do so, and then bundling it under a catchy name. The end result is that, not unlike Intel’s efforts in this space, NVIDIA wants to sell consumers on the idea that they can have their cake and eat it too with a light laptop that is still substantially more powerful than their old laptop. As a bit of historical context to this, last year NVIDIA shook up their high-end laptop branding a bit by doing away with “Mobile” video card designations. Rather than having a GeForce GTX 1080M for example, the company simply offered a laptop version of the desktop GTX 1080. Or rather, that was the basic idea behind the policy. In practice these mobile-but-not SKUs had their own specs (e.g. a GTX 1070 with an additional SM enabled), not to mention the greater thermal constraints of a laptop, and of course the use of laptop-appropriate MXM boards. Consequently from a product designation standpoint, this is a bit of a return to form for NVIDIA. They never stopped making mobile parts – and I haven’t seen any evidence that partners couldn’t try for a thin laptop before now – but now at least some of their mobile parts have a mobile designation, just that the ‘M’ stands for Max-Q instead of Mobile. Which admittedly may be a bit of a cynical read on the situation, but as there’s only a very limited amount of new tech involved – and no new GPUs – Max-Q seems to be more about branding and setting performance expectations for high efficiency (as opposed to high performance) parts. On which note, this isn’t the first place we’ve seen the name Max-Q show up, either. So I wouldn’t be too surprised if we see NVIDIA use it in more places. In any case, as part of the Max-Q initiative, NVIDIA is releasing Max-Q designs for the GTX 1080, GTX 1070, and the GTX 1060. Not explicitly stated by NVIDIA, but something I suspect, is that these designs are using new MXM cards and aren’t just a different clockspeed profile for the original cards. But at any rate, these are still the same SM and memory configurations as the original mobile parts, but now with lower TDPs and lower clockspeeds to match. NVIDIA GeForce 10 Series Laptop Max-Q Specifications   GTX 1080 GTX 1070 GTX 1060 CUDA Cores 2560 2048 1280 Core Clock 1101 - 1290MHz 1101 - 1215MHz 1063 - 1265MHz Boost Clock 1278 - 1468MHz 1265 - 1379MHz 1341 - 1480MHz Memory Clock 10Gbps GDDR5X 8Gbps GDDR5 8Gbps GDDR5 Memory Bus Width 256-bit 256-bit 192-bit VRAM 8GB 8GB 3GB/6GB Max-Q TDP 90 - 110W 80 - 90W 60 - 70W Full Perf TDP 150W 115W 80W GPU GP104 GP104 GP106 Manufacturing Process TSMC 16nm TSMC 16nm TSMC 16nm In a specification document NVIDIA released to the press, they listed both the normal and Max-Q TDPs and clockspeeds of their mobile products. I do feel this is a bit disingenuous, as mobile parts are commonly subject to thermal throttling – and few laptops could sustain the 115W+ TDPs of the original GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 – so comparing Max-Q to the desktop-like TDPs of the original parts doesn’t tell the whole story. But in any case, the point NVIDIA was looking to drive how is that while official clockspeeds have dropped by a few hundred MHz compared to the original parts (a not insignificant drop), TDPs have dropped by even more. A GTX 1080 Max-Q that tops out at 110W may only have a boost clock of 1468MHz (a drop of about 15%), but the TDP has dropped by 40W. Which ultimately is the principle purpose of the Max-Q branding from the NVIDIA side of matters: these are slower parts at the more energy-optimal point in the curve, instead of going further up the curve in the name of performance. Clockspeeds aside, there are some hardware changes to mention. In discussing the Max-Q design, NVIDIA noted that they have implemented some changes over the years to reach this point. A big part of this is of course Pascal, which gives them a solid starting point for high efficiency performance. But the company has also cited improvements in voltage regulators as part of the Max-Q formula, apparently using very low loss regulators optimized for around 1 Volt(a). And this is where things get a bit fuzzy, since NVIDIA was similarly promoting power delivery improvements for their desktop GTX 1080 reference boards last year; so I’m not sure if there’s anything new here specifically for Max-Q, or if it’s just about how NVIDIA has put the pieces together for boards going into Max-Q laptops. The final piece of the puzzle then is what NVIDIA is calling “advanced thermal solutions”, which the company doesn’t go into much detail on, but notes that it’s responsible for allowing their partners to cool such powerful cards effectively, and to do so without blowing out any eardrums while blowing out hot air. Taken altogether, I’m not sure what here is new. NVIDIA always talks up their latest wares – they’re trying to sell GPUs, after all – but there’s an implication that NVIDIA and their partners weren’t already using high efficiency regulators and good coolers on past products, which of course isn’t the case. The company has been making high-efficiency laptop GPUs for the 100W mark for a while now, and these designs have been powerful in their own right thanks to a combination of solid design and chip binning. So there’s a very fuzzy line here in terms of what’s actually new in terms of video card design, and how much of this is NVIDIA talking up what’s essentially the successor to the GTX 980M (i.e. low voltage parts). WhisperMode Meanwhile, buried in NVIDIA’s announcement is a new feature for GeForce Experience, which they are calling WhisperMode. As noted in NVIDIA’s press release “WhisperMode intelligently paces the game's frame rate while simultaneously configuring the graphics settings for optimal power efficiency.” This description sounds almost identical to AMD’s Radeon Chill, in which case we should have a good idea of what to expect: framerate throttling combined with GeForce Experience/Battery Boost settings adjustment to turn down the image quality, lowering the overall rendering needs. What isn’t clear is whether NVIDIA is also duplicating AMD’s efforts to time frame rendering such that frames are submitted as late as possible to minimize input lag. In any case, while WhisperMode is being announced as part of Max-Q, it’s actually part of GeForce Experience. So once released, it will be available to all Pascal laptops – including existing laptops – and not just Max-Q laptops. Max-Q Design Laptops Coming June 27th Last, but certainly not least of course is the end product of all of this: the Max-Q laptops. The goal of NVIDIA’s initiative is to get their partners out promoting thin laptops with high performance GeForce video cards, and their partners have quickly jumped into action. NVIDIA has not publicly announced a definition for what a Max-Q laptop should be, but there is a very common thread among all of the laptops they’ve detailed so far: under 5lbs and under 20mm thick. The marquee laptop for the program appears to be Asus’s new UX501 “Zephyrus” laptop, which NVIDIA showed off at their press conference. This is a 15.6” laptop with an Intel Core i7 quad and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1080. NVIDIA has also named laptops from Clevo and MSI, which come with the GTX 1070 and have a similar build. In which case at least among the laptops NVIDIA has shown off so far, 15-inches seems like the sweet spot for this program. Graphs Corrected To Use 0.0 Origin NVIDIA is promoting these laptops as having significantly better performance than existing thin laptops – in this case comparing it to an 18mm thick GTX 1060 laptop – though this seems to be more about the GPU used than the thickness of the laptop. The big question of course is just what performance such a thin laptop can sustain; even at the lower-bounds of the GTX 1080 Max-Q configuration, that’s still 90W for the GPU, along with another 35W for an Intel quad-core CPU in a cTDP down state. To NVIDIA’s credit, they definitely know a thing or two about cooling (see: reference blower), so applying that knowledge to laptops could be a boon. But sub-20mm still leaves limited room for heatsinks and fans. Anyhow, expect to see Max-Q design laptops show up later next month, on June 27th. Along with the partner designs NVIDIA is explicitly showing off at Computex this week, they have lined up many of the major OEMs for this initiative. And particularly with Clevo participating, this means their reference designs will be able to filter down to a number of smaller vendors who sell Clevo’s designs.

POST A COMMENT 13 Comments View All Comments ZeDestructor - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link As someone with a penchant for high-performance laptops: Can we keep the big, thick designs with overkill cooling for suboptimal ambient situations please? Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link I'd be shocked if they go away just because you can cram more cooling into a thicker package and despite whatever improvements NVidia may have on offer I suspect the 1080 model's either going to be a lot louder or more heavily throttled in a 20mm chassis than in a 40mm one. At the same time, as someone who wants something that doesn't look like a brick and only get a few hours of on battery runtime when web surfing; I hope that this initiative does get thinner laptops with midrange GPUs into mainstreamish products instead of just pricy halo items like the XPS15 and Razer Blade. Reply Samus - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link I can't wait for those monstrosities to die. A 10lb laptop with 30 minutes of battery life is about as practical as a mini ITX computer with a carrying handle that cost 1/3rd the price. Reply extide - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Don't forget this is putting the same parts (~100w GPU + ~35w CPU) into a much smaller chassis with much less room for battery, so compared to a thicker/bigger laptop with, again, literally the same parts, these will get less battery life. There is nothing magic about the thickness of the chassis that makes ultrabooks last longer, it's the slower much lower TDP parts typically found in them (~35w GPU + 15W CPU). Reply extide - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link ...and many ultrabooks don't even have a dGPU, in which case you are comparing a ~135w laptop to a 15w one, that's almost a difference of 10x! Reply ZeDestructor - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link That's fine by me. I don't have a thick, 5kg laptop to use on the go, I have a thick, 5kg laptop so I can drop it onto a desk at my destination, plug a 2kg brick into the wall and then do things at full blast for hours. Note: I also have a lovely thin lightweight laptop for more laptopy things. And before the mini-ITX cabal shows up: mini-ITX requires me to also carry around a keyboard, mouse, screen, and power strip, or have one at the destination. In comparison, a 5kg, 40mm thick laptop is one hell of a lot more portable. Reply zepi - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link OEM's have decided that you can have any thickness as long as it is less than 20mm and deliver requires yearly happiness reviews which only have "like" and 5/5 rating buttons. Reply drajitshnew - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Very true, I don't know what is the status in US but in India HQ series are hard to find and when you do find one, it has a disproportionate price increase, and even then it gets a stepmotherly treatment from the manufacturer -- at least that is the case with lenovo. Reply Freakie - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Desktop Replacements are still a thing, you shouldn't worry. Reply Ej24 - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Seeing as there's a single slot desktop 1070 that's only about 20mm thick, I can definitely see this being doable with a lower tdp binned gpu. This is good news. I'm getting tired of anemic igpu in ultrabooks. If you're lucky you can find an ultrabook with a crappy old 940m which is an utter joke. This is a step in the right direction.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Unveils Skylake-X Processors This chip giant just announced a compelling refresh of its enthusiast-grade desktop processors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 30, 2017 at 8:30AM On May 30, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its new Skylake-X family of processors aimed at the high-end desktop market. Intel is pitching this family of processors (as well as the accompanying X299 platform) at gamers, content creators, and overclocking enthusiasts. The high-end desktop market is a relatively small one, but it's a market that's growing and a market in which customers are generally willing to pay premiums in exchange for higher performance (something that translates into relatively rich average selling prices). Image source: Intel. Let's go over the key announcements vis-a-vis the Skylake-X processors and what it all could ultimately mean for Intel's business. More cores, much better value Intel's previous high-end desktop processors, known as Broadwell-E, came in six, eight, and 10 core options. The 10-core part ran at modest speeds out of the box (3GHz base frequency/3.5GHz maximum turbo frequency) and cost customers about $1,700. The eight-core part below it sold for about $1,100, with the two six core parts (differentiated by PCI Express lanes and frequency) listed for about $617 and $441, respectively. With Skylake-X, Intel has built much higher-performance and much better value parts across the board. The very top model -- the Core i9-7980XE -- packs 18 cores and carries a $1,999 price tag. Below that is the 16-core Core i9-7960X for $1,699, the 14-core Core i9-7940X for $1,399, the 12-core Core i9-7920X for $1,199, the 10-core Core i9-7900X for $999, the eight-core Core i7-7820X for $599, and the six-core Core i7-7800X for $389. Although Intel has yet to disclose the frequencies of the Core i9-7920X and up (Intel is likely still in the process of finalizing these SKUs), the frequencies of the Core i9-7900X and below have been disclosed and are up nicely from their Broadwell-E counterparts. For example, the 10-core Core i9-7900X runs at a base frequency of 3.3GHz and a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency of 4.3GHz. The 10-core Core i7-6950X runs at a base frequency of just 3GHz and only offers a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 3.5GHz. To top it all off, the Skylake-X parts use an updated processor architecture that should yield performance improvements relative to the Broadwell-E parts at identical core counts and frequencies. The 7900X is also much cheaper than the 6950X, making the former a substantially better value than the latter was. Intel finally takes high-end desktop seriously With the Skylake-X family of processors, Intel has seemingly built "no-compromise" parts. These parts scale to ridiculously high core counts, pricing is far more rational (there are no irrational jumps in pricing between different models in the lineup, either), and the chips also run at very high frequencies when fewer cores are loaded up (this is important for gaming).  In other words, these chips should do very well at content creation (and other tasks that can take advantage of multiple cores) while at the same time delivering strong out-of-the-box performance for gaming applications, which generally can't make good use of many processor cores today. I expect that the new Skylake-X lineup will reinvigorate enthusiasm in the gaming/PC enthusiast community for Intel's high-end desktop processors and platform after the company had seemingly neglected it for years in favor of its cheaper mainstream desktop platform.  If I'm right, this should translate into both an acceleration in unit shipment growth and a richer product mix within the company's desktop processor shipments. Now, enthusiast/gaming-related chips make up a relatively small portion of overall desktop computer market, but these chips are high value and shipments of them seem to be growing as the overall desktop personal computer market declines. This suggests that, over time, enthusiast/gaming-related chips will become increasingly important revenue and profit drivers for Intel's Client Computing Group, its largest business unit.

At Computex in Taipei on Tuesday, it showed off the first systems that will support its Compute Card—an ambitious attempt to popularize modular PCs. The card will begin shipping in August, but Intel hasn’t yet announced pricing. Most of the first wave of hardware will come from contract PC makers, but Intel said three big brand names are also working on devices: Dell, HP and Lenovo. The devices could range from laptop-like machines to tablets, displays and even digital whiteboards. Each will have a slot for Compute Card, and users will be able to plug the card into each device to use it. The Compute Card is a little bigger than a credit card and several times thicker at 95mm x 55mm x 5mm (that’s 3.7 inches x 2.2 inches x 0.2 inches). Intel Intel’s Compute Card alongside a credit card. Despite its small size, there’s enough space to fit one of four Intel processors, from a Celeron up to a Core i5. The card also contains 4GB of DDR3 memory, flash storage (from 64GB of eMMC to a 128GB SSD); and WiFi and Bluetooth. The four initial models look like this: Intel Intel Compute Card configurations. On stage at Computex, the only traditional computer Intel demonstrated was a touch-enabled all-in-one PC from LG Display. It had a slot for a Compute Card in the side and was easily portable with a carrying handle built right into the top of the case. Martyn Williams/IDG Intel’s Craig Raymond holds up a Compute Card enabled all-in-one from LG Display during a keynote at Computex in Taipei. Intel also showed a prototype laptop for students that’s powered by a Compute Card. The company envisions a student removing the card from the laptop, and popping it into a classroom whiteboard (Intel had a non-working prototype on display). Then, after school, the student could take the card and insert it into a desktop dock at home. The Compute Card architecture allows for easy upgrading, with more powerful cards replacing older models, allowing users to keep their systems fast and up-to-date. This isn’t the first time the PC industry has tried to popularize a portable computing unit that can plug into dumb terminals, but it’s the smallest and most compact attempt yet.

This is by far the fastest desktop processor every released, but Intel is actually introducing a total of 9 processors for the new ‘Basin Falls’ X299 platform ranging in price from $242 for a quad-core Intel Core i5-7640X all the way up to $1,999 for the Intel Core i9-7980XE 18-core monster. The new Intel Core X-Series used the brand new LGA2066 socket and consists of a mixture of ‘Skylake-X’ and ‘Kaby Lake-X’ CPUs. Since this is a new desktop CPU socket, it means that you’ll need an ‘Basin Falls’ X299 HEDT (High-End Desktop) platform to run any of these new processors. Intel’s new X299 platform and raises the bar for CPU performance with support of up to 18 cores, support for up to 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 directly connected to the CPU, and Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. When it comes to memory support, the X299 platform supports up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory for an incredibly potent and flexible platform. Who needs a $1,999 processor with 18-cores and 36-threads like the Intel Core i9-7980XE for 1080P gaming? No one on a budget, but that really isn’t the target audience for the Intel Core X series. Intel is suggesting the Core X-series for 12 gaming, 4K/12K VR gaming and live streaming, 360 degree 4K video editing, music creation with over 16 tracks and lastly those that do 3D modeling and animation. It also is coming to compete with AMD’s new brand of processors called ThreadRipper that have up to 32 cores and will be coming out this summer as well. AMD is entering the HEDT market for the first time in years and the Threadripper is going to bring a solution derived off AMD’s EPYC server processors just like Intel does with Xeon server processors. We all saw the AMD versus Intel battle in this segment coming, but it’s actually here now! Here is the table of Intel’s nine is processors that make up the Core X-Series processor family. The bottom two parts (Intel Core i5-7640X and Core i7-7740X) are based on Kaby Lake-X while all the rest are Skylake-X processors.   The first thing you might notice is that Intel isn’t revealing everything today.  Intel is only revealing clock speeds and details on the 4-core to 10-core parts and keeping the 12, 14,16, and 18-core parts a secret until mid June. As we already mentioned the Intel Core i9-7980XE is the flagship processor with 18c/36t for $1999, but don’t let that price freak you out. Take a look at the Intel Core i9-7900X processor real fast. The Intel Core i9-7900X has 10 cores, 20 threads with 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes and clock speeds of up to 4.5GHz for $999.  Less than one year ago we saw Intel introduce the Intel Core i7-6950X with 10 cores, 20 threads, 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes and clock speeds of 3.5 GHz for $1,723. Intel has slashed the price of their 10-core processor by $724! So, you might get hung up on the fact that there is a $1,999 desktop processor now, but when you take a second look pricing has actually improved over last year thanks to pressure in this market space from AMD. All of the processors are interesting, but another standout would be the Intel Core i7-7800X at $389. This processor has 6 cores, 12 threads, a 3.5GHz base clock, 4.0GHz Turbo Boost 3.0 clock, 28 PCIe lanes and quad-channel DDR4 2666MHz support. That isn’t a bad price as it is around $50 more than the current Intel Core i7-7700K quad-core processor and $10 less than the MSRP of the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X processor. A good number of high-end gamers are willing to spend $400 on a processor, so we see this processor being the most popular as to go up to the Core i9-7820X 8-core/16-thread processor will cost you over $210 more. Let’s take a look at some of the new Intel technologies for the unlocked Intel Core X-Series Processor Family! Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

It has finally done that today. Intel announced its new family of high-end Core X desktop processors today at Computex 2017. The new family brings more powerful models of the existing Core i5 and Core i7 models as well as a new Core i9 line for those who require more power. Intel is targeting its Core X platform of high-end processors towards gamers and content creators, the kind of people that actively seek out the best in PC technology. Intel has built almost all of the new Core X family on its updated Skylake platform that it calls Skylake X. The two 4 core models are built on Kaby Lake X architecture. Intel has developed the Core X with scalability in mind so there are entry-level models with 4 cores and the top-of-the-line Core i9 Extreme model which according to Intel is the first consumer desktop processor to feature 18 cores and 36 threads. The entry level model, Core i5-7640X, offers 4 cores and 4 threads for $242. The Core X i7 models are slightly more expensive with prices starting at $339. Intel will be offering a total of five Core i9 models, including the Core i9 Extreme, with prices starting at $999 for the 12 core and 24 thread model to a whopping $1,999 for the 18 core and 36 thread model. All of these new processors will work with Intel’s new X299 motherboard chipset which will be out on partner products in a few weeks. Filed in Computers.

This new platform brings unprecedented power to professional content creators, hardcore gamers or anyone that demands serious performance.  The new Intel Core X-Series processors are available with up to 18 cores and support 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory and multiple graphics cards and PCIe NVMe SSDs thanks to 44 PCIe lanes on the CPU and even more from the chipset. ASUS today announced that they will be offering Intel X299 based boards in three motherboard series; Prime, TUF, and ROG. All three of these series feature dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in- one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for quiet and efficient system cooling. All of the Intel X299 boards have RGB LEDs that make up the ASUS Aura Sync lighting ecosystem and solid audio thanks to SupremeFX integrated audio graphics. ASUS X299 boards also support Intel VROC technology that can be combined with ASUS’ optional add-in M.2 card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. This means you can hit ludicrous speeds of over 10,000 MB/s on sequential Read and Writes with the right drives! Let’s take a closer look at the ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe that was designed for high-end builders who want it all. The ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard is a standard sized ATX board that supports three-way graphics configurations from NVIDIA or AMD. The three main x16 slots feature ASUS SafeSlot technology that have structural reinforcements to ensure the slots don’t get damaged over the years with heavy graphics cards. You won’t find any SATA Express slots on this board, but you will find a U.2 port for enterprise-grade SSDs! We are glad to see SATA Express slots go after all these years as we never used one and never got a retail product to test for the site. When it comes to M.2 PCIe slots the Prime X299-Deluxe comes with dual M.2 slots for gumstick-sized NVMe drives. The primary (main) slot sits under the chipset heatsink, which ASUS says reduces drive temperatures, while the secondary one mounts drives vertically near the DIMM slots, where they can be exposed to airflow generated by system fans. These M.2 slots will work with a bootable RAID array, so get ready to see some wicked fast storage solutions on the Intel X299 platform. On the ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe we have been told that ASUS went with Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier for the SupremeFX audio solution. When it comes to networking performance ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard has an integrated 802.11ad Wi-Fi module. The dual-band solution can push wireless rates up to 4.6Gbps—several times the speed of most wired connections. And the Deluxe has you covered on the wired front, too, with dual Intel Gigabit Ethernet controllers delivering fast and reliable connectivity. We were hoping to see something beyond Gigabit for wired LAN on this generation, but that didn’t happen on this board/ If you want 10G ethernet you’ll need to move up to the ASUS ROG Rampage VI Extreme. ASUS ran out of room on this standard size ATX board, so they included a daughter board called the ThunderboltEX 3. This add-in card features two USB Type-C connectors and a USB 3.1 Gen 2 connector for 40Gbps of bandwidth to external peripherals. ASUS didn’t give us a photo of the Fan Extension card that is also included that adds additional fan headers and temperature sensors to the ones already on the board. ASUS ROG Strix X299-E Gaming Motherboard The ROG Strix X299-E Gaming is the lowest priced Republic of Gamers (ROG) board in the X299 series for ASUS and they say that they didn’t have to sacrifice the looks and features to do so. This standard ATX sized board features dual M.2 slots for PCIe NVMe SSDs, Intel Gigabit networking, onboard Wi-FI, USB 3.1 Gen2, SupremeFX audio technology with Sonic Studio III and RGB lighting options with Aura Sync. ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E Gaming motherboards will be available in North America starting in late June with the STRIX series arriving first. ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available in late June as well. Suggested MSRP pricing will be announced on 6/26/2017, so we expect that to be the day the ASUS STRIX X299 model will be launched.

As we have come to expect from ASUS there is a diverse range of models split between the Prime, TUF, and ROG series. Although we don't yet have access to full specifications lists, given the capabilities of the Skylake-X processors - like a quad-channel memory controller and up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes - all of the motherboards share certain obvious characteristics like eight DDR4 memory slots, a ton of PCIe slots, at least two full-speed M.2 slots, and both 8-pin and 4-pin CPU/EPS power connectors to handle the elevated power draw of high core count processors. Since it is the feature du jour all of the models also have some form of AURA RGB LED lightning. As you will see below, with so many PCIe lanes coming from the CPU and even more from the chipset, these X299 motherboards have an unprecendented amount of expansion and storage connectivity. Prime: X299-Deluxe & X299-A Since it is the backbone of the ASUS motherboard lineup, let's start off with the Prime series which will initially consist of the higher-end Prime X299-Deluxe and more affordable Prime X299-A. The Prime X299-Deluxe - pictured above - is a standard ATX form factor model that carries over the black and white aesthetic of its forebearers, though with some fancy new flourishes. It has an 8-phase digital CPU power design managed by some variant of the DIGI+ PWM controller. There are both 8-pin and 4-pin CPU/EPS power connectors, which should come in handy if a high TDP 18-core Skylake-X processor is installed. There are Japanese 10K capacitors used throughout the motherboard, not counting the Nichicon audio-grade capacitors used in the onboard audio section. The eight Q-DIMM memory slots are clipless on one side, and they can handle up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. No word yet on what the highest supported overclocked memory speed is for this model. While this motherboards has four mechanical PCIe x16 slots, only the two grey ones are actually x16 capable. The middle slot is limited to x4 and the bottom slot is limited to x8. This means that the X299-Deluxe will 'only' be able to handle three-way graphics configurations. Three of the four PCIe x16 slots have been given the SafeSlot treatment, which is to say that they have been mechanically reinforced with steel and additional anchor points for superior retention and shearing resistance. There are also two PCIe x1 slots. Storage connectivity appears quite good with six SATA 6Gb/s ports, one U.2 port, and two M.2 slots that support SATA, PCI-E, and PCI-E NVMe M.2 solid state drives. Intel's new Optane Memory technology is also supported. One of the M.2 slots is under the large chipset heatsink and the other is next to the right bank of memory slots, and has been designed to hold M.2 drives vertically. In addition, the motherboard supports six USB 2.0 ports (four rear, one header), eight USB 3.0 ports (four rear, two headers), and six USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (four rear, one header). Focusing on the full-speed USB 3.1 Gen2 ports, there are three Type-A ports and one Type-C port on the rear I/O panel, and a USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel internal header next to the memory slots. If that wasn't enough, ASUS are also including their ThunderboltEX 3 add-on card, which means Thunderbolt 3 capabilities, 40Gbps transfer speeds, and 36W of power delivery to external peripherals. When it comes to networking, there are two gigabit LAN ports powered by some variant of Intel controller, and an onboard dual-band Wi-Fi solution that supports the new 802.11ad protocol and is capable of theoretical tranfer rates up to 4.6Gbps. The onboard audio duties are handled by a new Crystal Sound implementation, which features a Realtek S1220A codec paired to an amplifier, Nichicon audio-grade capacitors, and a PCB-level audio isolation line. If you want a motherboard that looks even better than it sounds, the highly customizable Aura Sync RGB LED lighting feature is well-represented on this model. There are unique-looking and independently controllable light bars integrated into the rear I/O shield and the chipset heatsinks, there is a 4-pin header that can power RGB LED light strips, and thanks to Aura Sync you can synchronize the colors and effects of compatible products to match that of your motherboard. While we are on the topic of aesthetics, one of the more unusual new features is the OLED screen has been integrated into the chipset heatsink. Known as LiveDash, it is capable of displaying system information like temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds, or it can display custom graphical animations or text messages for no other reason than to make your build unique. Rounding things out are the usual assortment of value-added features like the USB BIOS Flashback feature, Q-Code Debug LED, diagnostics LEDs, onboard power and reset buttons, clear CMOS button, EZ_XMP switch, MemOK! button, and the EXT_FAN header. That last header is important because it leads us to the fact that ASUS is also bundling their Fan Extension card, to further expand the X299-Deluxe's already generous assortment of CPU and system fan headers and temperature sensors. When it comes to the Prime X299-A - for which we have no picture - this model omits a few of the extras found of the Deluxe model in order to reach a more affordable price point. However, it will have the same 8-phase digatal CPU power design, it will also support up to three-way graphics configurations, it will have two M.2 slots, and have similar if not identical storage and USB connectivity. The onboard audio solution should be identical as well. When it comes to differences, we expect this model to only have one gigabit LAN port, and to also not feature any onboard Wi-Fi solution. It should have a more simplistic chipset heatsink and be missing at least one of the two integrated light bars. However, it will have two RGB LED light strip headers instead of the one on the Prime X299-Deluxe. Needless to say that we don't expect the ThunderboltEX 3 add-on card or the Fan Extension card in this model's accessories bundle. TUF: X299 Mark 1 & X299 Mark 2 Moving on to the TUF series, these models prioritize reliability and durability thanks to tougher components and more stringent testing. This series is comprised of the TUF X299 Mark 1 and the slightly stripped down TUF X299 Mark 2. Like previous TUF Mark 1 motherboards, this TUF X299 Mark 1 model features a protective armor and advanced cooling options. Not only does the cover prevent dust from accumulating on the board, but it helps direct the integrated fan's airflow to the proper areas, like towards the primary M.2 slots. Speaking of fans, there are four fan headers near the CPU socket and six other spread throughout the motherboard. In order to manage thermals you need to be able to monitor temperatures, and this model takes care about with a number of onboard temperature sensors that monitor seperate zones on the motherboard and then feed that data into the Thermal Radar 3 utility. The TUF Detective mobile app returns, but this serving as a wireless means of diagnosing and monitoring the system via a smartphone. Although not visible, the Mark 1 features a Fortifier backplate, which ASUS claim is their strongest one yet. This metal plate serves to stiffen the motherboard against warping, but it helps dissipate heat from various thermal hotspots that can appear on the back of the PCB. ASUS has also included a removable GPU Holder that can support the weight of a graphics cards, and prevent strain on the PCIe slots. When it comes to basic specs, this model shouldn't disappoint. It features same the 8-phase digital CPU power design and 10K Japanese capacitors as the two Prime series model. It has eight SATA 6Gb/s port and two M.2 slots. There is one USB 3.1 Gen2 header, two USB 3.0 headers, and one USB 2.0 header. While we do not have a picture of the rear I/O panel, we do know that this model has at least one USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-A port and USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C port, as well as dual Intel-powered gigabit LAN ports. This motherboard has three visible PCIe x16 slots, only of two of which are actually x16 capable. Both of those PCIe x16 slots are steel-reinforced SafeSlots, which should protect them from the shearing effects of heavy graphics cards. The third PCIe x16 slot is limited to x8, which means that this model can still handle up to three-way SLI or CrossFire. There are two open-ended PCIe x4 slots which can physically support expansions cards with up x16 connectors. There is also one PCIe slot that is not visible to us since it is hidden under armor cover, but which is likely a PCIe x1 slot. There is RGB LED lighting integrated into the logo at the center of the board, and it will glow different colors based on the system load. If that is not enough lighting for you, there is also what appears to be a RGB LED light strip header at the very bottom of the motherboard. Rounding out the known features list is an onboard power button, a MemOK! button, and diagnostics LEDs. The more affordable TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down some of the Mark 1's unique features to create a more conventional motherboard. Much like the Prime X299-A is to the Prime X299-Deluxe, this model delivers much of the same functionality, but at a more affordable price. ASUS has done this by removing the protective armor and the backplate. It also loses two SATA 6GB/s ports - down to six total - and one of the PCIe x4 slots has been swapped for a PCIe x1 slot. There is also no USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel header on this model, and the total fan header count has been reduced from ten down to seven. On the plus side, the TUF X299 Mark 2 appears to have greater onboard RGB LED lighting, with LEDs mounted under much of the right side of the motherboard. However, there does not appear to be an LED light strip header anywhere on the Mark 1.

Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link FWIW, WCCFtech has a picture of what's supposed to be the Strix's rear IO. Assuming the picture is valid, each 'header' referred to in this article refers to a pair of ports not 1 for a total of 8 (7xA, 1xC); which is a much more reasonable number of ports for a high end board (even if there is room for a few more due to the lack of other IO). http://wccftech.com/asus-rog-strix-x299-e-motherbo... Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Is the USB3.1g2 header proprietary or a new standard? I'm hoping the latter; not just because proprietary connectors suck; but because the big header from 3.0 needing twice the space of a 1.x/2.0 header is an impediment to putting larger numbers of headers on the board than the 1 or occasionally two we get today. Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link I think it's rather disappointing that the Prime X299-delux only has a single C port on the rear. In models with lower port counts it's a semi-defensible decision although even there I'd prefer 2x C ports because A ports aren't fully forward compatible with C ports (lower max power allowed: 2.4A vs 3 or 5A). But with 12 total ports and 4x 3.1g2 ones it's a very poor decision IMO for a product that's likely to be used for at least 4 years. Reply Quil0n - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link It has the add-in board with TB3 ports, though Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link That card only adds a single USB-C port; and has a cost of 4 PCIe lanes. The latter is at most a minor issue with the 44lane chips, depending on how they're routed it could be a problem for the 28 and 16 lane versions if they're cutting into CPU lanes that would otherwise go to a GPU. Costwise it's a stupidly inefficient way to add a C port vs just configuring a additional A ports as Cs. Reply TEAMSWITCHER - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link Seven X299 Motherboards!

The thought of a $500 CPU going up in smoke due to a pin slipping out of the hole scares me to death. ( I know, I know, the overtemp will be detected before that happens, but still ...).

The Core i7 X-Series range from a $339 and i7 models come in 4, 6 and 8-core variants. The entry range 4-core i5-7640X and i7-7740X are built on Kaby Lake X chipset design. Intel has alongside introduced three SKUs for the Skylake-X CPUs. The Skylake-X starts with Core i7-7800X. “This is by far the most extreme desktop processor ever introduced. With such a wide range of options and price points to match, the new Intel Core X-series processor family delivers the most scalable and accessible desktop platform for the enthusiast community,” noted Gregory Bryant, Corporate Vice President and General Manager Client Computing Group in a blog post. About the Core i9, these Intel chips feature base clock speeds of 3.3GHz. Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor is company’s first consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads. Other than 18-core Core i9 Extreme Edition, the i9 series also includes chips in 10, 12, 14 and 16-core variants. The Intel Core i9-7900X 10-core processor will retail for $999. The 18-core extreme edition Intel Core i9-7980XE is the most expensive offering at $1,999. Intel has also upgraded its Turbo Boost technology, but for some of the Extreme Edition chips (higher end models). The technology dubbed Turbo Boost Max 3.0 according to Intel ensures that each core is also able to achieve improved performance. The company notes that Core X series performs 10 percent faster in multi-thread and 15 percent faster for single thread over the last generation.

Alan Martin @alan_p_martin 30 May 2017 whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin reddit email After years of seeking efficiency rather than raw power in the world of laptop processors, the CPU arms race has suddenly got a bit more interesting. Last year Intel released the first 10-core consumer CPU for those with wallets that were just too damned heavy. AMD, not to be outdone, then released a 16-core Threadripper CPU, to which Intel has a big, if predictable, response: 18 cores and 36 threads; shoot the works.

As with Intel’s older Extreme edition CPUs it’s based on the previous-generation Skylake architecture, but it’s still plenty powerful, packing over a teraflop of power into its diminutive frame. It’s the spearhead for a new line of chips for enthusiasts known as the Core X-series, which also come in 10, 12 14 and 16-core flavours if you want to save a few quid. But you’ll still be spending a lot. The 18-core beast at the top of the pile will retail for $1,999 (~£1,554), while the 10-core Core i9-7900X still goes for an eye-watering $999 (~£777). Video of Introducing the Intel Core X-Series Processor Family As for speed, only one of the new Core i9 chips has confirmed specifications. It runs at a base frequency of 3.3GHz, which can be boosted to 4.5GHz with Turbo Boost 3.0 and has a TDP (thermal design power) of 140W. Intel hasn’t forgotten those on lower budgets with the X-Core series, with three new i7 and an i5 chip with in 4, 6 and 8-core flavours, starting at $242 (~£188). Is all of this overkill? For 99% of people reading this, yes. But Intel is banking that 1% of remaining enthusiasts being spendthrift enough to make the range a success, and judging by how well the 10-core Broadwell E models went down last year, you wouldn’t bet against them.

Intel has taken to the stage at Computex in Taipei to unveil its newest range of processors, dubbed the X-Series. With its eyes set on content creators, overclockers and pro-gamers (plenty of whom are crowding the Computex halls this week) Intel is pulling out all the superlatives it can muster to talk up the "extreme" processing power offered by its new prosumer range. Popular Searches General Motors Co GM ▲ 34.45 +0.02 +0.06% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 155.45 +2.27 +1.48% General Electric Co GE ▲ 27.88 +0.16 +0.58% Herbalife Ltd HLF ▼ 73.92 -0.19 -0.26% But extreme don't come cheap. As the world waits patiently for Intel's eighth generation processors, the company says its next iteration of seventh-gen chips will offer "extreme enthusiasts" greater speeds and less downtime with its most powerful range of processors to date. These aren't the kind of processors that are going to power your next family PC, and that's why the top-of-the-line chip will set you back a cool $2K. But the X-Series is built for a niche market. Sure, we've seen updates to processors for laptops and PCs already this year from Intel, but we didn't get anything meaningfully faster than what we already had. With the traditional PC market stagnating over the past two years, Intel has to up the ante and target high-end consumers looking for a power fix  And that's where those 18 cores come in. The X-Series will range from four to 10 core chips, with Intel promising 12-, 14-, 16- and 18-core options in the future. To put it simply, more cores give you more processing power and Intel's architecture makes sure the right core is optimised for the right job. We saw 10-core processing power with last year's Broadwell-E launch, which brought improvements in processing power and a focus on "megatasking" (think multitasking, but for people who have epic stuff to do). This year, Intel is going one better with "extreme megatasking." (There's that "E" word again). Aside from sounding like a side-effect of too much caffeine, that essentially means the ability to run multiple "compute intensive" tasks at a time. As examples, Intel said editors could run Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop and Lightroom and handle multi-gigabyte files without a meltdown. Content creators will be able to stitch together six concurrent 4K streams to create 360-degree video like it's no big deal. Pro gamers will be able to capture 4K gameplay, livestream it to fans and record their highlight reel all at once. And overclockers? They'll have all the knobs they've ever dreamed of.  We saw some of these features with Broadwell-E, but as with all chip updates, the X-Series promises to do it faster, better and with less downtime. We're also getting updated Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 to improve single- and dual-core performance. Now, time for the price tag. The 10-core X-Series (Core i9-7900X) will retail for $999 (£780, AU$1,340), while 18-cores of grunt (Core i9-7980XE) will retail for $1,999 when it's released (£1,560, AU$2,683). And don't forget, that new processing power will need a new motherboard (the new CPUs use a new socket) so you're looking at a significant overhaul of hardware. But at least it will be extreme.

Barely bigger than a credit card, the Compute Card is basically the foundation of a modular PC. Under the hood, a Compute Card has a low-power Intel processor, memory, storage, and just about everything else you need to run a modern operating system. But it’s not really designed to be a standalone PC. Instead it’s designed to slot into smart TVs, laptop or desktop docks, or other devices… allowing you to swap or upgrade cards at will instead of buying a whole new device. First unveiled at CES in January, the Compute Card is set to begin shipping in August, 2017. Intel made the announcement at the Computex show in Taiwan, where the company also spelled out a few new use cases. First up, Compute Cards could be used in VR headsetssta… like the HTC Vive, which Intel demonstrated working wirelessly using Intel WiGig tech. We already knew that NexDock plans to launch a laptop shell that’s powered by a Compute Card. But now Intel has revealed a few bigger-name partners. Dell, LG, and Lenovo all plan to offer products designed around the Compute Card platform. Intel has also unveiled a new Docking System designed to help developers integrate Compute Card support into their devices… or which could be offered as a standalone solution that lets you use a Compute Card as a desktop computer. Slide a Compute Card into the dock and you get USB 3.0, Ethernet and HDMI and/or DisplayPort functionality. While Intel still hasn’t had much to say about the spec sheets for these little compute modules, we recently learned that Intel plans to launch models with Celeron N3450, Pentium 4200, Core M3-7Y30, and Core i5-7y57 processors. Each version should have 4GB of RAM with entry-level models featuring 64GB of eMMC storage and higher-end versions using 128GB of PCIe SSD storage.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Samsung Chromebook Pro launches for $550 05/29/2017 at 10:16 AM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Samsung’s first Chromebook with an Intel Core M processor and a convertible tablet-style design is just about ready to go. Amazon, B&H, and Newegg are all taking orders (or pre-orders) for the Samsung Chromebook Pro for $550. The laptop looks virtually identical to the $450 Samsung Chromebook Plus that launched earlier this year, but while the Plus has an ARM-based processor from Rockchip, the Chromebook Pro has an Intel Core M3-6Y30 Skylake processor which should offer better performance… for some tasks. One of the key selling points for convertible Chromebooks is their support for Android apps, which are optimized for touchscreen displays. But Android-on-Chrome OS is still a beta feature, and there have been some recent supports suggesting that Android apps currently run better on Chromebooks that have ARM processors than on those with Intel chips. That said, if you’re more interested in running Chrome OS itself and/or Ubuntu or another Linux-based operating system, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a pretty nice looking machine. The $550 laptop features a 12.3 inch, 2400 x 1600 pixel touchscreen display with pen support, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of eMMC storage. It measures 11.1″ x 8.7″ x 0.5″ and weighs about 2.4 pounds. The notebook isn’t just competing with Samsung’s ARM-powered model though. Earlier this year Asus launched the Chromebook Flip C302, which features a Core M3 Skylake CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. You can pick up an Asus Chromebook Flip C302 for $499, making it cheaper than the Samsung Chromebook Pro. But at 2.7 pounds, the Asus model is a bit heavier. And it has a lower-resolution 12.5 inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel display.

I bought an Asus Chromebook C302, but it didn’t come with Google Play preinstalled. Even after I installed Google Play from the Beta Channel, I still couldn’t install Android apps like Firefox, Skype or Angry Birds. I got a message saying they would be installed ‘soon’. That’s the same message I got last year, trying to install Android apps on my old 2012 Samsung chromebook. Android apps for ChromeOS are not ready for prime time, so I returned the C302 for a refund. This article says the Samsung Chromebook Pro ‘supports’ Android apps, then it says “But Android-on-Chrome OS is still a beta feature”. It appears that Android apps are not ready for prime time on the Samsung Chromebook Pro either.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel X series chip details leaked, including Core i9 chip with 18 CPU cores 05/29/2017 at 12:30 PM by Brad Linder 5 Comments So you thought AMD’s 16-core “Threadripper” CPU was a beast? Intel may be preparing to launch an 18-core processor as one of its first chips to wear the Core i9 name. Intel is scheduled to deliver a keynote at the Computex show in Taiwan tomorrow, but VideoCardz has already published a leaked slide providing some details of Intel’s upcoming Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 X-series chips. The details have not been officially confirmed by Intel, but VideoCardz notes that the information comes “from multiple sources.” In a nutshell, it looks like the new Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X chips will be available with between 4 and 18 CPU cores. Most models also support hyperthreading, so an octa-core chip, for example, supports 16 threads… and an 18-core CPU supports 36 threads. Other features support for 4-channel DDR3-2666 memory, 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes, Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0, and TDPs between 140 watts and 165 watts. Clearly these chips are designed for desktops and note for mobile devices. Expect more details tomorrow.

While I love the Skylake architecture (use it in almost everything now), it is going to kind of limit these monster CPU’s cause of its limited support for decoding certain 4K streams like from Netflix. Not sure if it supports HDMI 2.0 either so while performance-wise it can certainly handle 4K content, it’s going to be a little limited with the kinds of 4K content it can handle.

Of note, is the new Intel Core i9 series, and the 18-core Core i9 Extreme Edition. Typically, Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs have always been a generation behind their mainstream counterparts. For instance, Broadwell-E was launched at a time when Skylake was mainstream but this time, Intel has brought its high-end SKUs on par with today’s mainstream architectures with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs. Availability and exact pricing for India should be known in the coming months. We begin with Kaby Lake-X, which will initially launch with two SKUs – a Core i7-7740X and a Core i5-7640X. The Core i7-7740X is a quad-core CPU running at 4.3GHz and a boost clock of 4.5GHz, supports HyperThreading, 8MB of L3 cache and supports 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Core i5 variant will run at a slightly lower 4GHz with a boost clock of 4.2GHz and does not support HyperThreading. The L3 cache is also a bit lower at 6MB but it does support the same number of PCIe lanes. Both CPUs will support dual channel DDR4 memory at up to 2666MHz and have the same TDP of 112W. Kaby Lake-X CPUs won’t support Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology. Skylake-X CPUs will support Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology (except for the Core i7-7800X) along with higher core counts (up to 18 cores), more than double the PCIe lanes and support for quad-channel DDR4 memory. Intel has so far announced three SKUs for the Skylake-X CPUs, starting with the Core i7-7800X. This CPU runs at 3.5GHz with boost clock set to 4GHz and features six cores with HyperThreading. The slightly faster Core i7-7820X CPU runs at slightly higher clock speed but also packs in eight cores with 11MB of L3 cache and 28 PCIe lanes. In order to differentiate the extreme edition SKUs, Intel has introduced a brand new Core i9 series and right now, we only have details about the Core i9-7900X. The base and boost clock speeds are lower compared to the other Core-i7 models in the line up but this CPU has 10 cores with HyperThreading, 13.75MB of L3 cache and a massive 44 PCIe lanes. Intel has listed the names of future Core i9 CPUs but haven’t revealed finer details of clock speeds, cache, etc, yet. This includes the 12-core Core i9-7920X; 14-core Core i9-7940X; 16-core Core i9-7960X and the insane 18-core Core i9-7980XE. All CPUs from the Core-X family will be using Intel’s new X299 chipset, which uses a new LGA 2066 socket. The new chipset introduced features like DMI 3.0 link which should help improve throughput times and support for Intel Optane memory. It also brings I/O capabilities like support for up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, up to eight SATA 3.0 ports and up to 10 USB 3.0 ports. We can expect to see new motherboards from Intel’s board partners showing up in the months to come. Speaking on the launch, Gregory Bryant, Corporate Vice President and General Manager Client Computing Group said in a blog post, “The Intel Core X-series processor family introduces a series of firsts that reflect the extreme performance we are delivering. This family includes Intel’s first teraflop desktop CPUs, a prime example of just how much raw compute these processors can handle. We’re also introducing the entirely new Intel Core i9 processor, representing the highest performance for advanced gaming, VR and content creation.

Intel didn't provide any details about the system, but that's presumably where the electronics and radios are fitted to make wireless VR possible. [ Further reading: The best DVRs for cord cutters ] Martyn Williams/IDG Intel's Craig Raymond demonstrates a wireless HTC Vive headset during a keynote at Computex in Taipei on May 30, 2017. The system was running over a wireless gigabit (WiGig) link and used the DisplayLink XR codec to provide what Intel said was a "low latency" wireless experience. Latency is the lag between when the user does something, like turn their head, and when the system and display reacts. Wireless can often introduce small delays that aren't present on cables, so keeping this low is key in VR, where any stuttering or unnatural movements can potentially cause nausea. Running an HTC Vive over wireless isn't an easy job. First-generation headsets like the Vive require a 6Gbps data stream, according to DisplayLink, and engineers have to ensure this data doesn't lag or fail as the user jumps and turns around. Wireless VR will free users from the messy and potentially dangerous cables that surround them when using virtual reality, but the price of all this fast wireless is yet to be disclosed.

Game on, PC fans! By: Steven Bassiri | Intel CPUs in CPUs, Chipsets & SoCs | Posted: 5 days, 20 hours ago Comment () | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Intel's New X-Series Processors] Page 1 [Intel's New X-Series Processors] Page 2 [Intel's Breakthroughs and New Technologies] Page 3 [The X299 Platform] Introduction     We all knew that the launch of Intel's Basin Falls platform was imminent and now we get confirmation on rumors and speculation directly from Intel regarding the new platform. The new platform will be Intel's "most scalable", meaning it will support CPUs with as little as four cores up to 18. That 18 core 36 thread CPU will cost almost $2000, but the new 10 core 20 thread CPU will cost $1000, while the lower-end CPU for the platform will cost under $300. They are even offering a 6 core 12 thread CPU at under $400. Yes, 18 cores with Hyper Threading, which is big news for the consumer industry. The new platform also upgrades Intel's HEDT segment to include newer technologies such as PCI-E 3.0 in the PCH. Intel has also made minor improvements and added some features to the new processors.       The X299 platform will support Kabylake-X and Skylake-X CPUs. The Kabylake-X CPUs will only come in the 4-core variety, and are pretty much transplants of their desktop counterparts. I expect the same IPC, but higher clocks, as the TDP of the Kabylake-X CPUs is 21W higher than the 7700K and I doubt it will have an iGPU. The Skylake-X CPUs will offer four more PCI-E 3.0 lanes from the CPU for your GPUs and will use the new LGA 2066 socket (same mounting as LGA2011). You might also notice shared cache has decreased compared to Broadwell-E, and this is part of a cache restructuring effort that should improve performance.     The shift to scale the X299 platform is an interesting one for Intel. They have basically added in two new core series lineups to their HEDT, signaling a change in strategy when it comes to the high performance consumer computing market. It should also result in lower platform prices, and we might see motherboards that feature the X299 chipset and only support some of the processors rather than all of them. The 10 core 20 thread i9-7900X will cost $1000, while the i9-7980XE will cost $2000 when launched. The pricing on their six-core processor, puts six Intel cores in the reach of many consumers.

Read the latest about Skylake X release date, features and specs. Intel's high-performance Skylake X-series Core i9 and i7 are here By Jim Martin | 30 May 2017 Skylake is the codename for Intel's sixth-generation range of Core laptop and desktop PC processors. They've already been superseded by the seventh-gen CPUs and you can find out how Skylake compares with Kaby Lake. But Skylake isn't dead yet. No. Intel has launched Skylake X CPUs, which are the high-end enthusiast versions. Also see: Windows 10 is coming to Snapdragon 835. Interestingly, Intel isn't using the Core i7 branding as it has done in previous years but add a new number: 9. The Core i9 range could be in response to AMD's Ryzen processors, which were named to seem similar to Intel's Core i5 and i7 ranges.  Rather than cut profit margins and compete on price, Intel might be trying to position the new chips as 'better than Ryzen 7' by using a higher number.  AMD, of course, has already announced its Threadripper range, which is expected to be branded Ryzen 9. Intel has trumped AMD's 32-core flagship chip with the 36-core i9-7980XE monster, but AMD could be keeping a similar chip under wraps for now. Pricing will be key, though, and the $1999 i9-7980XE will hit any wallet hard. When is the Core i9 release date? Release date: June 2017* At the chips' launch at Computex 2017, Intel said the new processors would be on sale "in the coming weeks". *That applies to the Core i9-7900X downwards.  The i9-7920X will go on sale in August, while the top three chips don't yet have an official release date. Originally, Skylake processors (including the Core i7-6600K and Core i7-6700K) went on sale on 5 August 2015, and the locked-multiplie desktop chips launched at the start of September 2015. What are the Core i9 models and specifications?   Core i9-7980XE Core i9-7960X Core i9-7940X Core i9-7920X Core i9-7900X Core i7-7820X Core i7-7800X Core i7-7740X Cores / Threads 18/36 16/32 14/28 12/24 10/20 8/16 6/12 4/8 L3 Cache TBC TBC TBC 16.5MB 13.75MB 11MB 8.25MB 8MB PCIe lanes TBC TBC TBC 44 44 28 28 16 Base clock TBC TBC TBC TBC 3.3GHz 3.6GHz 3.5GHz 4.3GHz Turbo 2.0 TBC TBC TBC TBC 4.3GHz 4.3GHz 4.0GHz 4.5GHz Turbo 3.0 TBC TBC TBC TBC 4.5GHz 4.5GHz N/A N/A Memory TBC TBC TBC TBC Quad-channel DDR4-2666 Quad-channel DDR4-2666 Quad-channel DDR4-2666 Dual-Channel DDR4-2666 TDP 165W TBC TBC 140W 140W 140W 140W 112W Price $1999 $1699 $1399 $1199 $999 $599 $389 112W The processors will require a motherboard with the LGA 2066 Socket (called R4) and the X299 chipset, which is part of the Basin Falls platform. The eagle-eyed will note that there are three Core i7 models in that chart: Skylake-X isn't just Core i9. (However, the i7-7740X is based around a Kaby Lake Core).  There's also a single Core i5 model. These cheaper processors are aimed at enthusiasts who want an overclockable processor on a tighter budget. They have 1MB of L2 Cache, which is four times as much as the Core i7-7700K. All Core i9s support quad-channel DDR4-2666 RAM. X299 chipset Here's how the X299 chipset compares with the X99 chipset: X299 motherboards double the bandwidth to SATA and USB connectors compared to X99, and allows up to ten USB 3.0 ports and eight SATA III ports.  There are up 24 PCIe lanes provided by the chipset, but additional lanes supported by the CPU itself can be used by a motherboard for things such as NVMe storage. Original Skylake CPUs Here are the key specs for the original Skylake desktop processors, which you can buy from Amazon: Core i5-6400 Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 2.7GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 950MHz 65W Price: £149.99 inc VAT Core i5-6500 Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 3.2GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 11050MHz 65W TDP Price: £159.99 inc VAT Core i5-6600 Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 3.3GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 1050MHz 65W TDP Price: £179.99 inc VAT Core i5-6600K Socket 1151 Quad-core (4 threads) 3.5GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 6MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 350MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £199.99 inc VAT Core i7-6700 Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 3.4GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 4.0GHz 8MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 53MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £244.99 inc VAT Core i7-6700K Socket 1151 Quad-core with HyperThreading (8 threads) 4.0GHz, with Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz 8MB L3 cache Intel HD 530 graphics @ 53MHz, boosting to 1150MHz 91W TDP Price: £263.99 inc VAT What are Skylake's features and chipsets? When it launched, one of the reasons to buy a PC with a Skylake chip was the sheer number of new features it brought. Rather than being a simple performance bump, Skylake was first to support DDR4 memory. Skylake arrived with the '100-series' chipset, codenamed Sunrise Point. The Z170 Express replaced the Z97, which itself was not a massive upgrade from Z87. The chipset supports up to 20 PCI Express 3.0 lanes, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports and 14 USB 2.0 ports. Motherboards with the Z170 Express chipset can have up to six SATA ports and an eSATA channel, plus Intel's Rapid Storage Technology for PCIe storage devices including NVMe. The Core i7 chips have 16 PCI Express 3.0 lanes for graphics which can be split into 1x 16-lane, 2x 8-lane or 1x 8-lane and 2x 4-lane channels. The memory controller supports dual-channel DDR4 or DDR3L DRAM, and they use Socket 1151. The H170 chipset replaced the H97 for mainstream PCs, while the H110 is the 'value' offering, replacing the H81 and various other chipsets. Overclocking The K versions of Skylake are multiplier unlocked. Interestingly, the base clock is separate from the PCI-E bus. This means you can adjust the core clock frequency of the chip without affecting anything else. However, overclockers will still change the multiplier and voltage to see the biggest performance gains, so there's not much change overall.

This is the first time such a "scalable, accessible and powerful desktop platform," has been offered to consumers, says Intel. With the new processors comes the new Intel X299 chipset, which adds extended I/O and overclocking capabilities. Intel Core-X Series processors The new Core-X Series offers SKUs boasting from 4 to 18 physical cores. Today Intel has detailed an initial family lineup with up to 10 physical cores. It promises that "18, 16, 14, and 12 cores are coming soon". However, at the top of the range we are teased that the 18C/36T Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor is the "first teraflop desktop CPU from Intel". Key features of the Core-X Series are as follows: Intel X299 chipset with improved I/O capabilities LGA 2066 socket for Intel Core X-series processor family Additional system performance and amazing responsiveness with Intel Optane memory support Improved Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 (select SKUs) for single- and multithreaded performance Up to 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 directly connected to the CPU Up to 4 channel DDR4-2666 memory support, support for the Intel Extreme Memory Profile (Intel XMP) specification, revision 2.0 for DDR4 Fully unlocked for performance tuning Rebalanced smart cache hierarchy I think it would be a good time now to look at a table that summarises the initial batch of Core-X series offerings. The currently available top Intel consumer CPU from is the 10C/20T Core i9-7900X, with a TDP of 140W, at $999. At the other end of the table you can see the 4C/4T Core i5-7640X, with a TDP of 112W, priced at $242. Intel talks about many of the same benefits delivered by its Core-X series processors that AMD visited with the Ryzen launch. For example, Intel says that: content creators can multitask much more smoothly and efficiently with several processor intensive tasks; and gamers can enjoy smooth gaming while they record, encode and stream their gameplay. Intel X299 Chipset Intel's accompanying new chipset is built to match the Core-X Series enthusiast aspirations. More specifically, the X299 chipset offers; 30 total high-speed I/O lanes, up to three Intel Rapid Storage Technology PCIe 3.0 x4 storage support, support for Intel Ethernet Connection I219 (Jacksonville LAN PHY), and are Intel Optane memory ready with DMI 3.0. In tabulated form you can check through the base tech specs below. X299 motherboards and systems supporting Intel Core-X Series processors will be available in the coming weeks from Intel partners. Intel will have more announcements at Computex 2017 including shared details of the Intel Compute Card, VR innovations, new devices with Intel processors, and some information regarding the 8th generation Intel Core processors.

Register today! Posted by azrael- - Tue 30 May 2017 11:40 I do so love how Intel can't help themselves artificially segmenting their processors. While AMD has no problem supporting ECC in their mainstream Ryzen processors Intel fuses off this functionality in their desktop offerings. And of course that must equally be so for their rebranded Xeon processors. Heaven forbid that anyone get Xeon features when not paying Xeon prices… Posted by 00oceanic - Tue 30 May 2017 12:00 I can't help but think that none of this would have happened if AMD didn't have a strong product. Posted by watercooled - Tue 30 May 2017 12:16 Apparently they won't be soldering the die to the IHS again, which could be a bit of a nightmare with so many cores able to boost to very high clocks: https://www.overclock3d.net/news/cpu_mainboard/intel_s_skylake-x_and_kaby_lake-x_cpus_will_not_be_soldered/1 Also of note is how they're moving away from an inclusive L3 cache, which is interesting given the similar design choices made by AMD for Ryzen. It seems Intel's isn't quite a victim cache as it still has prefetchers, but I also wonder how the ring-bus is implemented in these HEDT Skylake parts. Posted by tantaku - Tue 30 May 2017 12:38 It's great that intel actually tries hard now. I'd love to see AMD crush them so they try even harder Posted by Sunderas - Tue 30 May 2017 13:37 For withholding stuff Intel is not getting my money again. My next build will be AMD.

I have to admit I find Intel's product and platform names completely and utterly confusing, but from what I gather, the company announced new high-end i7 and i5 processors, as well as even higher-end, high-core counts i7s and a new line, the i9. The X299 chipset brings it all together. I was keeping an eye on these new processors as I just ordered all the parts for my brand new computer, but I had already decided not to wait for these since I prefer not to jump onto new processors and chipsets right away (which is why I didn't opt for Ryzen either). Looking at the replacement for the processor I eventually settled on - the 7700K - I'm pretty sure I made the right call, since the speed bump seems minor (100Mhz), while TDP goes up relatively considerably. The high core count processors are - much like the Ryzen 7 1800X - incredibly alluring in a "I want all the cores" kind of way, but for the most part, few workloads actually benefit from more cores in processors. Aside from workstation-oriented workloads I personally do not engage in, it really seems like processors are running ahead of the software they run. Still, with Ryzen and now Intel's new parts, there's a ton of choice out there if you're building a new computer.

The Intel Core i9 is the world's first ever consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads – out gunning even AMD's upcoming Ryzen 9 Threadripper CPU, which is due to come out with 16-cores. It is also the first ever teraflop desktop CPU, according to Intel. So, it looks like Intel and AMD are engaging in a full-on CPU arms race again – which is exciting news for us consumers. Its full name is the Intel Core i9-7900X X-series processor, and this first version will be made available with 10 cores and 20 threads, with 18, 16, 14 and 12 core variants coming soon. The 10-core i9 variant will come with a base clock speed of 3.3GHz, Inel Turbo Boost Max technology, which ups the frequency to 4.5GHz, 13.75MB of L3 cache, support for 4 channels of DDR4-2666 RAM and a TDP (thermal design power) of 140W. At launch it will cost $999 (around £780, AU$1300). The 18-core Core i9 7980XE, along with the 16-core Core i9 7960X, 14-core Core i9 7940X and 12-core Core i9 7920X should follow soon. All will come with up to 44 PCIe lanes and support for Intel Optane memory. Keeping it in the X-Series family While the new Core i9 CPUs are understandably stealing the limelight, Intel also revealed the rest of the X-Series family of processors, which Intel says is its most "scalable, accessible and powerful desktop platform ever", and covers a range of processors with 4 to 18 cores. These eighth generation Core processors offer a 30% performance improvement over the current seventh generation CPUs, according to Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel Corporation, who took to the stage at Computex to announce the new generation. These CPUs will also be up to 10% faster for multi-thread performance, and up to 15% faster for single-thread performance compared to the current generation of Core processors. These new processors will make use of Intel's new X299 chipset, which comes with improved I/0 capabilities. Gaming, and virtual reality in particular, will benefit from these new processors, according to Intel, and will also improve streaming for gamers who want to show off their gameplay.   At the launch event Intel demoed a PC running a Core X-Series processor that was live streaming someone playing a virtual reality game to Twitch. Thanks to the power improvements of the new CPUs, the PC was able to simultaneously broadcast a number of views and angles of the gameplay live – something that would normally take a number of separate PCs to achieve. It's all very exciting stuff, and Intel said that we should see many Core X-series processors available to buy by the holiday system this year. Maybe even in time for Black Friday, we hope.

Life is Strange is getting a sequel, but it might be getting a prequel too Intel announces Core i9 CPUs, with a blistering fast 18-core beast leading the pack By Alessandro Barbosa Posted on May 30, 2017 3 min read 15 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Last year, Intel upped the ante of its desktop CPU endeavour’s with Broadwell-E, their first ever 10-core processor. It was aimed at real enthusiast, with performance that had a niche market and a price of $1799 that put it well out of most people’s grasp. A year later, and two things are clear. One, Broadwell-E was a rousing success. And two, Intel is feeling the heat from AMD. Why else would the company who has been so confident in quad-core processing reveal an 18-core CPU? The Core i9 series of CPUs has been rumoured for some time now, but Intel have officially revealed the line at Computex. It’s lead by the i9-7980XE – a behemoth of a CPU that features 18 cores, 36 threads, a base clock speed of 3.3 GHz (with boosts of around 4.3 and 4.5 with different modes), and a price of $1999. It’s the to[ of the top, aimed at heavy video editing users or gamers who want to play at 4K while streaming their footage in HD at the same time. It’s Intel posturing to AMD, who have their top of the line Ryzen chip launching later this year. That’s only ringing in at 16 cores, which somehow seems inadequate now with Intel’s announcement. The Core i9 series is making sweeping changes all round too. Based of an improved version of Skylake (called Skylake-X), the chips will come in 16, 14, 12 and 10 core variants. The 10-core, which is the equivalent to the Broadwell-E, is now only $999. That’s how much of a difference a year makes. Read  Corsair’s Zeus mouse pad charges your mouse wirelessly, so you never have to worry The X-Series, as Intel calls it, won’t just be made up of Core i9 processors. The range is rounded out by quad-core i5-7640X and i7 models in 4, 6 and 8-core models, the smallest of which aren’t even based on Skylake-X technology. It’s a broad sweep of the spectrum from Intel though, catering to nearly every demographic in its line that you could possibly think of. It’s also a strong return to desktop computing, which Intel had somewhat left to the wayside with its advances in more mobile CPU chips. This all ahead of what is rumoured to be Coffee Lake – the next generation of processors that Intel claim are already seeing 30% performance improvements over Skylake.
