Fedora Should Soon Have The Intel Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Fedora on 2 September 2016 at 11:11 AM EDT. 5 Comments While the Intel Vulkan Linux driver has been part of mainline Mesa for months and shipped in Mesa 12.0 with support for running Dota 2 and The Talos Principle, the Fedora packages don't yet enable the Vulkan driver but that should soon change. The Fedora Mesa packages currently build without the Intel Vulkan driver while it's been requested with no support yet. From an inquiry on the Fedora mailing list. landing the Intel Vulkan driver is just held up until Fedora has the generic Vulkan loader landed as a package. Per this bug report, the Vulkan loader and validation layers are currently being reviewed. Hopefully that will land in short order so Fedora users will begin having out-of-the-box Intel Vulkan support. Now to hope RADV is mainlined in Mesa soon or that AMD puts out their open-source Vulkan code for getting more OSS Vulkan exposure... 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets Intel reportedly delays its 7nm shift from 2020 to 2022 Intel has delayed its 7nm process to 2022, will have 10nm++ products on the market by 2020 By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Sep 5, 2016 10:25 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel had previously pegged its upcoming shift to the 7nm node for 2020, but according to the latest rumors it has been delayed through to 2020.     The company has been looking for a processor designer to work in their new Microarchitecture Research Lab that's based in Bangalore, India. The new processor designer would join a team of engineers to "spearhead the research and advanced development" of both processor cores and graphics processors that will be deployed in the "2020 and beyond timeframe" using Intel's "futuristic" 7nm manufacturing tech.   Intel has recently updated the job advertisement, changing the date of its 7nm node from 2020 to 2022, with the job noting: "The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade".   Intel wants there to be multiple waves of 10nm technology, with 10nm being succeeded by 10nm+, and then again with 10nm++. The first 10nm++ processors should arrive in January 2020, while the first 7nm products to pop their head in January 2021 at the earliest, and more likely in 2022.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 5, 2016 at 3:29PM Image source: Intel.  Back in 2013, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a series of chips based on its Haswell architecture (fourth-generation Core) with a graphics technology known as Iris Pro. This graphics technology made the chip larger and more expensive to make than the variants without Iris Pro, but performance in graphically intensive applications such as 3D games went up significantly. For the right customers, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the product family made sense. Intel followed up the original Haswell-based Iris Pro chips with variants of its Broadwell (fifth-generation Core) and Skylake (sixth-generation Core) architectures that included updated versions of the Iris Pro technology. An early leak suggested that Intel also planned to introduce an Iris Pro-powered variant of its Kaby Lake architecture (seventh-generation Core). However, I believe that it is very likely that this product has been canceled. Sifting for clues In a product brief that Intel posted alongside the announcement of its seventh-generation Core processor family, it included the following slide: Image source: Intel. Notice that Intel says that in January it will launch "additional products for enterprise, workstation, Intel Iris Graphics and enthusiasts [sic] notebooks and desktops." Note that Intel didn't say Iris Pro here, just vanilla Iris Graphics (a type of high-performance graphics included in Intel's lower-power notebook processors; Iris Pro is for higher-performance/power chips). Although the above should be enough to raise the proverbial yellow flag, there's even more evidence. Take, for example, a recent leak from NotebookCheck.net, of what looks like an Intel internal slide showing the launch timelines for each of the seventh-generation Core processors. It lists the following chip variants: U 2+2 (HDCP 1.4) U 2+2 (HDCP 2.2) S 4+2 (HDCP 2.2) H 4+2 (HDCP 2.2) U 2+3e (HDCP 2.2) S 2+2 (HDCP 2.2) Don't worry too much about the specifics, but a seventh-generation Core processor with Iris Pro graphics would have been an 'H' series processor (high-performance notebook) in a 4+4e configuration (four processor cores + GT4 graphics + eDRAM). This configuration is absent from this particular leak. If that weren't enough, there's still even more evidence. NotebookCheck.net also got its hands on another image that appears to be from Intel, showing the company's planned seventh-generation Core processor product stack. Unsurprisingly, it, too, lacks a 4+4e part. The future of Iris Pro remains unclear Intel's Iris Graphics processors in low-power laptops appear to be doing well and are gaining momentum, something that should serve to enrich the company's notebook product mix. This makes sense, as an integrated graphics solution is generally preferable for size and battery life in the kinds of laptops that would use either a 15-watt or 28-watt processor.  Iris Pro, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have been as successful. Apple's current 15-inch MacBook Pro still uses fourth-generation Core-based Iris Pro processors. Very few notebook vendors seemed to adopt Intel's fifth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro (though Apple's 21.5-inch iMac uses such a chip), and I can't find any notebooks with Intel's sixth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro (even though Intel's product page says that such products have been launched). Customer demand for Intel processors with Iris Pro graphics may simply not be there, particularly as the high-performance laptops that Iris Pro would be suitable for can generally support stand-alone graphics processors without much issue. And, if personal computer manufacturers are, by and large, not interested, then it makes little sense for Intel to invest further in that product line (especially in light of the company's recent restructuring actions).  I think the big "tell" for whether Iris Pro has a future will be the processor Apple uses when it updates the 15-inch MacBook Pro (rumored for later this year). If Apple uses a chip with Iris Pro, then the technology may have a future. If Apple simply uses a quad-core chip with GT2 graphics (in other words a "4+2" configuration) in the system, then it may be "game over" for Iris Pro.       Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 5, 2016 at 4:29PM Image source: Intel.  According to DigiTimes, citing "sources from Taiwan PC makers," microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will start shipping next-generation desktop processors based on its Kaby Lake architecture (branded seventh generation Core) by "year-end 2016" -- in line with previous leaks and Intel's own public statements. That's all well and good, but DigiTimes has some information on Intel's future processor plans beyond this year's Kaby Lake. Let's take a closer look. Coffee Lake and Cannonlake for desktops and notebooks, respectively DigiTimes says that in 2017, Intel plans to release two separate processor families targeting notebook personal computers and desktop personal computers, respectively. The report says that for notebooks, Intel will release a product family known as Cannonlake, manufactured in the company's upcoming 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. For desktops (and likely, as PC Watch previously reported, high-performance notebook systems), Intel is expected to release a fourth generation of products manufactured in its 14-nanometer technology known as Coffee Lake. Both Cannonlake and Coffee Lake, per the report, will arrive in the second half of 2017 -- though it's not clear whether this refers to shipments to system vendors or availability of systems using the chips to end-users. Icelake for both in 2018 DigiTimes goes on to say that Intel will introduce a new processor family, known as Icelake, in 2018. Presumably, processors based on the Icelake architecture will replace both Cannonlake in thin-and-light notebooks and Coffee Lake in desktops and high-performance notebooks. Icelake is expected to be manufactured in Intel's 10-nanometer technology (likely the second-generation 10-nanometer+ technology that Intel mentioned last month). Additionally, under Intel's "Process-Architecture-Optimization" product development methodology, Icelake should also bring to bear a significantly enhanced architecture relative to what the company is likely to ship with both Cannonlake and Coffee Lake. Still some unanswered questions Although Intel's strategy of splitting the desktop/high performance notebook lines from the mainstream notebook processor lines is now known, there are still a lot of things that we don't yet know about it.  For example, we know that Cannonlake includes a new processor architecture (it's not the same processor core as Skylake or Kaby Lake) and a new graphics architecture. However, very little is known about what Coffee Lake really is. PC Watch says that Coffee Lake will come in configurations with up to six processor cores and will include the company's GT3e graphics (Intel's desktop chips and most of its high-performance notebook chips top out at four processor cores and GT2 graphics).  Are these processor cores going to be the same ones used in Skylake and Kaby Lake? Or is Intel doing an implementation of the enhanced Cannonlake cores in the older 14-nanometer technology? How about graphics? Is Intel simply planning on scaling up the same graphics engine found in Skylake/Kaby Lake (known as Gen. 9 graphics) or does Coffee Lake get the newer Gen. 10 graphics and media engine? My suspicion is that Intel will take the path of least resistance and that Coffee Lake will ultimately just be "scaled up" Kaby Lake with more of the same processor and graphics cores. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad strategy, as it would still ultimately yield more performance (and could speed time-to-market), but from a performance/power efficiency perspective, it wouldn't be ideal.     Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

PC Watch says that Coffee Lake will come in configurations with up to six processor cores and will include the company's GT3e graphics (Intel's desktop chips and most of its high-performance notebook chips top out at four processor cores and GT2 graphics).  Are these processor cores going to be the same ones used in Skylake and Kaby Lake? Or is Intel doing an implementation of the enhanced Cannonlake cores in the older 14-nanometer technology? How about graphics? Is Intel simply planning on scaling up the same graphics engine found in Skylake/Kaby Lake (known as Gen. 9 graphics) or does Coffee Lake get the newer Gen. 10 graphics and media engine? My suspicion is that Intel will take the path of least resistance and that Coffee Lake will ultimately just be "scaled up" Kaby Lake with more of the same processor and graphics cores. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad strategy, as it would still ultimately yield more performance (and could speed time-to-market), but from a performance/power efficiency perspective, it wouldn't be ideal.     Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Android-86 released first build of Nougat for the PC Christian de Looper Digital TrendsSeptember 5, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share It’s safe to say that Android and Intel don’t play that well together these days, and neither Google nor Intel are doing much to change that. Despite that, however, the Android-86 project, which is aimed at bringing Android to computers, is alive and well. In fact, the Android 7.0 build for developers has just been released through the project. What does that mean? You can now run Android 7.0 Nougat on your computer. Related: Google testing a new, streamlined search history format on Android Of course, it’s important to note that the software, which is based on Google’s Android Open Source Project, is still under development. You will, however, be able to enjoy some of Nougat’s standout features, such as multi-window mode and split-screen mode. It’s also important to note that the project is by and large aimed at developers. The official page for Android-x86 tells you how to create the operating system from the source, but you’ll need to know what you’re doing in order to do that. To download a disc image, you can head over to Geek Til it Hertz. Of course, Android on a PC might not be the best choice for everyone, especially because of the fact that it doesn’t yet support all of Nougat’s features. For example, the file manager doesn’t yet work. Before the Nougat build was made public, there was a build of Android Marshmallow for computers in the form of Remix OS. Remix OS was stable enough to run on computers, and was created specifically to run fast and perform well. It also excelled in things like multiple window support, optimizations for the keyboard and mouse, the taskbar, and so on. Android Nougat, however, will bring a number of great new features to the operating system. The aforementioned multitasking features are perhaps the most important, however the OS also brings improved notifications, and customizable quick settings.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 5, 2016 at 3:29PM Image source: Intel.  Back in 2013, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a series of chips based on its Haswell architecture (fourth-generation Core) with a graphics technology known as Iris Pro. This graphics technology made the chip larger and more expensive to make than the variants without Iris Pro, but performance in graphically intensive applications such as 3D games went up significantly. For the right customers, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the product family made sense. Intel followed up the original Haswell-based Iris Pro chips with variants of its Broadwell (fifth-generation Core) and Skylake (sixth-generation Core) architectures that included updated versions of the Iris Pro technology. An early leak suggested that Intel also planned to introduce an Iris Pro-powered variant of its Kaby Lake architecture (seventh-generation Core). However, I believe that it is very likely that this product has been canceled. Sifting for clues In a product brief that Intel posted alongside the announcement of its seventh-generation Core processor family, it included the following slide: Image source: Intel. Notice that Intel says that in January it will launch "additional products for enterprise, workstation, Intel Iris Graphics and enthusiasts [sic] notebooks and desktops." Note that Intel didn't say Iris Pro here, just vanilla Iris Graphics (a type of high-performance graphics included in Intel's lower-power notebook processors; Iris Pro is for higher-performance/power chips). Although the above should be enough to raise the proverbial yellow flag, there's even more evidence. Take, for example, a recent leak from NotebookCheck.net, of what looks like an Intel internal slide showing the launch timelines for each of the seventh-generation Core processors. It lists the following chip variants: U 2+2 (HDCP 1.4) U 2+2 (HDCP 2.2) S 4+2 (HDCP 2.2) H 4+2 (HDCP 2.2) U 2+3e (HDCP 2.2) S 2+2 (HDCP 2.2) Don't worry too much about the specifics, but a seventh-generation Core processor with Iris Pro graphics would have been an 'H' series processor (high-performance notebook) in a 4+4e configuration (four processor cores + GT4 graphics + eDRAM). This configuration is absent from this particular leak. If that weren't enough, there's still even more evidence. NotebookCheck.net also got its hands on another image that appears to be from Intel, showing the company's planned seventh-generation Core processor product stack. Unsurprisingly, it, too, lacks a 4+4e part. The future of Iris Pro remains unclear Intel's Iris Graphics processors in low-power laptops appear to be doing well and are gaining momentum, something that should serve to enrich the company's notebook product mix. This makes sense, as an integrated graphics solution is generally preferable for size and battery life in the kinds of laptops that would use either a 15-watt or 28-watt processor.  Iris Pro, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have been as successful. Apple's current 15-inch MacBook Pro still uses fourth-generation Core-based Iris Pro processors. Very few notebook vendors seemed to adopt Intel's fifth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro (though Apple's 21.5-inch iMac uses such a chip), and I can't find any notebooks with Intel's sixth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro (even though Intel's product page says that such products have been launched). Customer demand for Intel processors with Iris Pro graphics may simply not be there, particularly as the high-performance laptops that Iris Pro would be suitable for can generally support stand-alone graphics processors without much issue. And, if personal computer manufacturers are, by and large, not interested, then it makes little sense for Intel to invest further in that product line (especially in light of the company's recent restructuring actions).  I think the big "tell" for whether Iris Pro has a future will be the processor Apple uses when it updates the 15-inch MacBook Pro (rumored for later this year). If Apple uses a chip with Iris Pro, then the technology may have a future. If Apple simply uses a quad-core chip with GT2 graphics (in other words a "4+2" configuration) in the system, then it may be "game over" for Iris Pro.       Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The next generation of PCs look set to benefit from thinner and more attractive designs thanks to improved efficiency and performance from AMD’s line-up of desktop processors. While all of AMD’s press coverage might have been geared towards its revamped graphics card line-up and Zen CPU core architecture, goings on elsewhere in the company look set to shake-up the all-in-one PC market. The company unveiled its 7th-generation ‘Bristol Ridge’ architecture for laptops earlier this year, and now it’s followed that up with a series of desktop-level APU announcements. Related: Best gaming PC specs to build yourself The line-up includes eight desktop processors, although for now they will only be available for OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for now – sorry custom builders, no word on what 7th-generation AMD chips will be in your next rig – starting from the low-end dual-core A6-9500 and 9500E chips all the way up to top-end quad-core A12-9800 and 9800E. The E-suffix represents a lower-power chip tuned to work at a thermal design power (TDP) of 35W, whereas the non-E version works at a full 65W and requires a more powerful cooling system. AMD’s claims – via PCMark 8 benchmarks – that the A12-9800 matches the equivalent Intel Core i5-6500 CPU while the A12-9800E manages 17% better performance when compared with the equivalent 35W Core i5-6500T. It’s not hugely surprising, however, since AMD’s own chips run at a higher clock speed than Intel’s. Still, managing better performance from the same power consumption is impressive. If the numbers add up in the real world, AMD could have a decent, albeit brief advantage. Why brief? Intel’s yet to show off its desktop-specification 7th-generation ‘Kaby Lake’ desktop chips, so we don’t know how much of an improvement they’ll be over the previous generation. If we were to hazard a guess, we'd reckon the new processors will put Intel slightly ahead on full desktop chips and neck-and-neck when it comes to its lower-power ‘T’-suffix chips that go toe-to-toe with AMD’s ‘E’-suffix models. Graphics performance is on the up, too. AMD has traditionally managed significantly better on-chip graphics performance than Intel, and while the gap has narrowed in recent generations, it’ll be interesting to see how the two stack up. RIght now, AMD reckons its graphics performance advantage over Intel in is between 88% and 99%, which is significant. Good news for gamers. The new APUs slot into the new AM4 chipset platform, which applies across AMD’s range of 7th-generation processors. The AM4 platform supports all the latest standards you’d hope from a desktop chip including DDR4 memory, USB 3.1, NVMe storage and SATA Express. There’ll be a selection of chipsets when the time comes to launch motherboards for custom PC builders, with X300, B300 and A300 forming the small form-factor chipset line up. A320, B350 and an as-yet unnamed chipset fills up the rest of the range. What does all this mean for consumers? Thinner, more powerful all-in-one PCs initially and more power-efficient custom builds when the time comes to sell the new processors as standalone items. While Intel still hasn’t shown its hand, it looks like 2017 is going to be an exciting year for desktop PCs. You'll see the fruits of AMD's labour on Lenovo and HP all-in-ones this Autumn.

Chris Griffith The Australian 12:00AM September 6, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Chris Griffith Technology reporter Sydney https://plus.google.com/116849779175391500455 @chris_griffith I’m a big fan of tiny computers. They improve the aesthetics of their location, hiding under desks and behind monitors and they breathe new life into old and not-so-clever displays and TVs. A $50 WiFi-enabled Raspberry Pi attached to an old monitor can transform it into a media powerhouse, streaming movies and TV series from your home media server. I use a square Intel NUC (next unit of computing) to stream TV via WiFi to a projector set up for home cinema. The little NUC takes up no space at all and I can project literally everything: TV, movies, Netflix, you name it. That’s why I was excited to try out another Intel miniaturised device, the Compute Stick, which the company bills as a Windows computer that fits in the palm of your hand. It’s just 11.4cm long and it doesn’t actually sit in your hand. Instead you plug it into an HDMI slot at the back of a display. There’s also an HDMI extension cable in the box if you find it awkward to plug it in directly. The Compute Stick turns a monitor into an all-in-one computer, and a TV into a Windows equipped smart TV. Add a keyboard and mouse, and you’re on your way. In Australia four versions of the Compute Stick have been available with Intel Atom processors for under $200. But they offered basic performance. Now there are more powerful second-generation models with Core m3 and Core m5 mobile processors. Until now the PC-on-a-stick routine has been strictly a low-performance affair designed for those looking to perform basic tasks. The latest iterations of Compute Stick aim to change that to some extent but are they really powerful enough and value for money? I tested the Core m3 version with Windows 10 Home, codenamed STK2M3W64CC. It supports dual band 802.11ac WiFi, is Bluetooth-enabled, has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of eMMC (embedded Multimedia Controller) storage, and Intel HD Graphics 515. The stick is connected by a USB Type-C cable to a rather large power plug. Both offer connectivity. There’s a USB3.0 and microSD card slot that supports microSDXC cards on the stick itself. The power plug, which might be a metre away, has two more USB3.0 slots that you can use to plug in a keyboard or mouse. Having cords going from the stick to the power plug and from the power plug to the keyboard and mouse can look untidy. If your power plug isn’t near your desk, I would recommend a wireless set-up to minimise cord clutter. You can use the power point’s two USB3.0 slots for other devices. I plugged in a flash drive and a 2TB USB-powered external hard drive during my tryout. The Compute Stick doesn’t have a 3.5mm audio jack so you depend on sound from the HDMI link to your display or Bluetooth headphones/speakers. The dual core processor’s clock speed is 1.52 Gigahertz. It managed to play 4K clips without issue and in the Cinebench 15 benchmark test scored 145 cb for the CPU test and 22.30 frames per second for 3D graphics. That’s OK for basic computing tasks that don’t require much power and graphics capability. It does the job with Windows 10. But that’s about it. Given these limitations, it is expensive for its relatively entry level performance: $599 for this model and $777 for the faster Core m5 system. That’s double the price of the original Atom processor versions. For that price you could buy a decent tablet computer or a notebook. For $60 less ($539) you could buy a more highly specced Core i5 Intel NUC. The 6i5SYh version of the NUC has a 1.8 Gigahertz processor, WiFi, dual band Bluetooth, four USB3.0 ports, HDMI, Ethernet, audio out and supports SDXC microSD cards. It also has in-built infra-red. It’s better specced and cheaper. Further, you can attach a NUC to the back of monitors with a bracket that Intel usually provides in the kit. They can be invisible too. Core M does use less power, but the benefit of Core M technology for battery-life savings is lost as this device is connected to the mains power. In the end a NUC, which isn’t that much bigger, is a better deal from Intel. Overall I like the Compute Stick concept but the end result is not a lot of grunt for a lot of money. I would look around for other options, including from Intel. For example, the latest ASRock BeeBox has two HDMI ports and a DisplayPort, supports three monitors, 4K video, and 48 IP security cameras and has USB Type-C and USB3.0 for a few hundred dollars.

Everykey Tech & Science John McAfee Intel Cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee is fighting Intel to prove he still owns his own name, after the computing giant accused him of infringing on the “McAfee” trademark it owns. McAfee created the eponymous antivirus computer software, which Intel acquired in 2010, almost 20 years after selling his assets to the company. He has since become CEO of MGT Capital Investments and plans to rename the firm “John McAfee Global Technologies.” McAfee antivirus has since been renamed Intel Security, but Intel still warned McAfee earlier this year that any use of his name would infringe on the company’s trademark. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week “When MGT was renamed John McAfee Global Technologies, Intel sent a cease and desist order claiming they owned my name,” McAfee tells Newsweek. “In truth, when I formed McAfee Inc I signed over only the name ‘McAfee Antivirus.’ “Intel has been illegally using my name for every product that they sell,” McAfee says. “It never bothered me but now that they are trying to prevent me from using my name I’m pissed off.” McAfee and his new company MGT Capital filed a lawsuit against Intel on September 2, arguing that the Asset Acquisition Agreement from 1991 did not assign the rights to his personal name or agree to restrict his right to do business using his own name. Related Stories I May Be a Political Hot Shot but I’m No Charlie Sheen Mr. McAfee Goes to Washington How Artificial Intelligence Is Helping Japanese Farmers According to the lawsuit, MGT’s proposed name change is “a clear reference to McAfee as an individual and as a famed international figure in his own right.” Since selling his antivirus company, McAfee has had several business ventures and has remained consistently in the public eye. Earlier this year, McAfee sought the Libertarian Party nomination for the U.S. presidential election. The nomination was eventually won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson.

I’m lucky enough to get my tech support from JK Scheinberg, the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he’d be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. “On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, ‘We’ll be in touch,’ ” he said. “I never heard back.” I wonder whether they read his CV or Googled him … ? Scheinberg worked on the Intel conversion privately in his home office. When he was able to demo it running on a Sony Vaio, Steve Jobs rushed off to Sony to offer it to them, the company originally aiming to take the route of allowing other companies to license the OS.

He had applied to work at a Genius Bar, according to The New York Times. The Times used it as an example of age discrimination in the workplace. Ashton Applewhite wrote in The Times: "I'm lucky enough to get my tech support from JK Scheinberg, the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he'd be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. 'On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, "We'll be in touch,"' he said. 'I never heard back.'" Apple, notoriously, employs very young workers in its stores. It is unlikely that anyone is more qualified to work at an Apple store than Scheinberg, who ran the "Marklar" Intel project. Business Insider described Marklar in an article on the extreme culture of secrecy inside Apple: "Kim Scheinberg tells this story about her husband, Apple employee JK, who invented an Intel version of Mac OSX that ran on PCs. Bertrand Serlet, the svp of software engineering, liked the project: "'Bertrand sits JK down and has a talk with him about how no one can know about this. No one. Suddenly, the home office has to be reconfigured to meet Apple security standards. "'JK points out to Bertrand that I know about the project. In fact, not only do I know about it, I am the person who named it. "'Bertrand tells JK that I am to forget everything I know, and he will not be allowed to speak to me about it again until it is publicly announced. "'I guess he had some kind of "Total Recall" memory wipe in mind.'" MacRumors has a nice summary of the story too. It begins with Scheinberg realising that he could use an off-the-shelf Sony PC to run a version of Mac OS X, the Apple desktop operating system: "Bertrand walks in, watches the PC boot up, and says to JK, 'How long would it take you to get this running on a (Sony) Vaio?' JK replies, 'Not long' and Bertrand says, 'Two weeks? Three?' "JK said more like two *hours*. Three hours, tops. "Bertrand tells JK to go to Fry's (the famous West Coast computer chain) and buy the top of the line, most expensive Vaio they have. So off JK, Max and I go to Frys. We return to Apple less than an hour later. By 7:30 that evening, the Vaio is running the Mac OS. [My husband disputes my memory of this and says that Matt Watson bought the Vaio. Maybe Matt will chime in.] "The next morning, Steve Jobs is on a plane to Japan to meet with the President of Sony." Scheinberg later tweeted: Wonder if Apple will finally give me callback on that genius bar interview https://t.co/9fXt5fBFTU #ageism — JK Scheinberg (@tiltdad) September 5, 2016 NOW WATCH: Why Korean parents are paying for their kids to get plastic surgery Loading video...

McAfee joined MGT Capital Investments as chairman and CEO earlier this year and was keen on a rebrand. However, in a newly revealed letter sent to the firm in June (via The Register), Intel managing counsel Kelly Smith stated that the chip firm would not countenance a name change. “If you move forward with the name change, Intel will take all necessary legal action to protect its trademark rights,” the letter concluded. McAfee sold the naming rights to the eponymous company back in 1991, before eventually leaving altogether three years later. Intel then announced it was acquiring the firm in 2010 for a massive $7.7 billion. However, although it subsequently changed its name to Intel Security, elements of the McAfee brand still live on in various parts of that business, for example in the branding for research division McAfee Labs, and various security products. Intel could be keen on preserving the name as it is looking to offload the company in order to concentrate on its core business, despite promising at the time that building security into the silicon represented a turning point for the industry. McAfee is, of course, no stranger to controversy. Back in 2012 he released a video ostensibly describing how to uninstall McAfee AV, in response to the frequent questions he gets from irate customers keen to ditch the software. In that expletive-laden video the eccentric millionaire is seen snorting white powder half naked whilst surrounded by a harem of scantily clad ladies. McAfee is now suing Intel for the right to rebrand his new company with his name, but given how well-known the trademark still is in the industry he could be facing a tricky time in court.  Why Not Watch? 28 Jul 2016Virtually Solving the Path to GDPR Compliance 30 Jun 2016The Journey to GDPR: Your Guide to Data Protection Technology, Tools and Tips 8 Sep 2016In an Uncertain Era of Brexit and GDPR, What is the Best Approach for Protected Data Transfers? 8 Dec 2016How to Keep on Top of Security Hygiene Without Sacrificing Speed and Efficiency Related to This Story #infosec15: John McAfee - There’s More Wrong than Right in the Security Industry The Anonymous logo is not for sale Taiwanese company threatens Apple with legal action over iPad name Testing begins for Intel's remote kill technology FaceTime transfers trademark to Apple for iPhone 4 video calling application What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

Documents filed (PDF) in the Manhattan federal court over the weekend tell us that in June, Intel wrote to McAfee-the-man's investmentvehicle, MGT Capital Investments, telling it not to try changing its name to John McAfee Global Technologies. McAfee-the-man might have thought that Intel wouldn't care, since it put McAfee-the-brand on the end-of-life list in 2014 in favour of "Intel Security". However, Chipzilla didn't follow through on the promise to free him from association with its products; remnants of the brand live on in various domains which carry the McAfee livery, or still explicitly carry the name. Now Intel's trying to sell its security business, so it's decided to declare its love for McAfee-the-brand. So how did we get here? Back in the mists of time, McAfee-the-man wrote antivirus software that was ultimately so successful he founded McAfee-the-company. In 1991, McAfee-the-company paid (PDF) McAfee-the-man US$9 million for McAfee-the-brand, and in 1994, McAfee-the-man decided to put his feet up and leave McAfee-the-company to its own devices. Intel acquired McAfee-the-company in 2011 for US$7.7 billion, and in doing so, inherited the 1991 agreement in which McAfee-the-man relinquished McAfee-the-brand. In trying to sell its security business, Intel wants to keep McAfee-the-brand, at least long enough to help its pitch to buyers (Bloomberg names US private venture fund TPG as an interested party). As Intel counsel Kerry Smith wrote to McAfee-the-man: “any use of the McAfee name would be likely to dilute the McAfee mark … by reducing its unique association with McAfee and Intel Corporation”, says a letter from Intel managing counsel Kelly Smith. Smith's letter to McAfee-the-man adds that “through extensive use, the McAfee trademark is a strong mark and extremely well-known in the industry”. True: it's so well-known that when McAfee-the-man crafted a NSFW video telling people to uninstall McAfee-the-product with a pistol, it scored a rather respectable six million views. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Undetectable NSA-linked hybrid malware hits Intel Security radar While Flash malware nastiness detections quadruple – we're all clearly doomed 56 Comments Kill Flash now.

Keep in mind that at this point Android-x86 7.0 is aimed at developers, so the official page for the software explains how to build the operating system from source, but if you want to download a pre-built disc image, Geek Till it Hertz has you covered.

Documents filed (PDF) in the Manhattan federal court over the weekend tell us that in June, Intel wrote to McAfee-the-man's investmentvehicle, MGT Capital Investments, telling it not to try changing its name to John McAfee Global Technologies. McAfee-the-man might have thought that Intel wouldn't care, since it put McAfee-the-brand on the end-of-life list in 2014 in favour of "Intel Security". However, Chipzilla didn't follow through on the promise to free him from association with its products; remnants of the brand live on in various domains which carry the McAfee livery, or still explicitly carry the name. Now Intel's trying to sell its security business, so it's decided to declare its love for McAfee-the-brand. So how did we get here? Back in the mists of time, McAfee-the-man wrote antivirus software that was ultimately so successful he founded McAfee-the-company. In 1991, McAfee-the-company paid (PDF) McAfee-the-man US$9 million for McAfee-the-brand, and in 1994, McAfee-the-man decided to put his feet up and leave McAfee-the-company to its own devices. Intel acquired McAfee-the-company in 2011 for US$7.7 billion, and in doing so, inherited the 1991 agreement in which McAfee-the-man relinquished McAfee-the-brand. In trying to sell its security business, Intel wants to keep McAfee-the-brand, at least long enough to help its pitch to buyers (Bloomberg names US private venture fund TPG as an interested party). As Intel counsel Kerry Smith wrote to McAfee-the-man: “any use of the McAfee name would be likely to dilute the McAfee mark … by reducing its unique association with McAfee and Intel Corporation”, says a letter from Intel managing counsel Kelly Smith. Smith's letter to McAfee-the-man adds that “through extensive use, the McAfee trademark is a strong mark and extremely well-known in the industry”. True: it's so well-known that when McAfee-the-man crafted a NSFW video telling people to uninstall McAfee-the-product with a pistol, it scored a rather respectable six million views. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Undetectable NSA-linked hybrid malware hits Intel Security radar While Flash malware nastiness detections quadruple – we're all clearly doomed 56 Comments Kill Flash now.

This is thanks to a growing number of micro PCs launching that are small enough to bolt onto the back of a PC display. Intel have long been strong proponents of the micro form factor PC with their Next Unit of Computing (NUC) micro PCs.  Uncluttered desks are always a good thing. If there is a downside, it is this. Most mini PCs lack the raw grunt to do anything beyond basic office productivity chores. Heavy duty tasks like multimedia editing or gaming were well out of bounds - At least until now. Now Intel are back. They’ve gone all out and beefed up the power of their latest NUC, the NUC6i7KYK (Kind of rolls off the tongue doesn’t it?). Question is, does it deliver? Look and Feel The NUC6i7KYK hasn’t inherited the looks of its earlier siblings. Where previous NUCs resembled an Apple TV with a steroid habit, the NUC6i7KYK is flatter and more squarish. These changes aren’t just skin deep. The NUC6i7KYK  comes apart, allowing you to add in your own RAM and storage. It isn’t much of a looker, but then it is designed to be hidden away.   Under the Hood Under its hood the hardware includes Intel’s latest quad-core i7 CPU. The usually anemic Intel integrated graphics got a serious dose of steroids. The result is a pint-sized widget that can handle compute and graphics intensive tasks.  Throwing a crucial 750GB SSD and DDR4/2133MHz memory helped the Nuc along. Boot up was almost instantaneous. With the addition of Steam, plus a few wireless game controllers, I had the makings of an invisible PC games console once it was plugged into my telly.  Performance doesn’t come cheap. This is reflected in the NUC6i7KYK’s steep RRP ($1,089). Add to that the cost of RAM, storage and an OS (unless of course you choose LINUX) and things soon add up. That said, you do get a surprising amount of compute in the NUC6i7KYK’s tiny footprint. Powering things is a 2.6GHz Core i7-6770HQ quad-core Skylake CPU. With turbo boost, it clocks in at a pleasing 3.5GHz, giving the NUC6i7KYK  more grunt than a bacon farm.  Also included is Intel’s Iris Pro Graphics 580 which has 128MB of eDRAM. It ran photoshop and even better still, a bunch of games with passable frame-rates. The NUC support SATA 6Gbps and can run two drives in RAID 0 or RAID 1. Tucked away in the NUCs Swiss watch-like interior is a Wireless card which supports 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, and Wireless Display 6.0. Two RAM slots sockets take up to 32GB RAM.  The connectivity options are surprisingly plentiful for such a small box. There’s several USB 3.0 sockets plus a USB C port which also supports Thunderbolt 3 and 10Gbps USB 3.1. For extra storage Intel have added an SD card slot.  Networking options are also flexible thanks to the addition of a gigabit Ethernet port. Multimedia gets covered by a 3.5mm audio jack, SPDIF, mini DisplayPort, and 4k friendly HDMI 2.0 port.  In keeping with previous NUCs. Intel included an infrared receiver on the NUC6i7KYK's front. Pairing this with Kodi and a spare windows media centre remote worked, making my invisible PC games console into a solid yet invisible media centre too. Thunderbolt support allows the NUC to connect to an external and more powerful GPU. Trouble is there aren’t all that many thunderbolt external GPUs kicking around yet. So how good is the NUC6i7KYK’s integrated graphics for gaming? Compared to a dedicated system with a high end graphics card, the NUC6i7KYK was always going to under whelm. For those wanting a compact home theatre PC that’ll do a passable job playing games, the NUC6i7KYK didn’t perform too bad at all. Older, less demanding games such as Serious Sam, delivered a playable experience. More complex titles required graphics settings were dropped down a few notches. Tomb raider managed just a still playable 40fps with graphics set to high. This soared to just over 60fps when graphics were set to low. With previous NUCs gaming just wasn’t doable. There wasn’t enough CPU juice, nor was there enough GPU grunt. It is pretty impressive to see how far Intel’s integrated graphics have come. So if that’s the good, what’s the not-so-good? There isn’t a lot to fault with the NUC6i7KYK. As a media box its performance and compact form factor make it hard to beat.  While it works for gaming, detail settings often need to be tweaked downwards. For not much more money, some may find a bigger PC with a dedicated graphics card delivers more.  That said, as a photoshop or video editing machine, it is impressive. Being able to drop the NUC6i7KYK into a laptop bag without worrying about a hernia is pretty cool. The only real negative with the NUC6i7KYK is that its fan can get noisy when it operates under load. Verdict The NUC6i7KYK is Intel’s first stab at a performance NUC and showcases just how far they've come. Here's hoping that the NUC6i7KYK isn't a one-off. Either way, it’ll give competitors a wake up call to kick their own Micro PCs up a notch. Either way, it’s a definite win for end users.

The Burning Basis Vector Uncivilized Computer Graphics Musings GPU Ray Tracing The Wrong Way September 4, 2016 by Joshua Barczak If you’re familiar with my blog, you know I’ve lately taken a fancy to doing abominable things to my Intel GPU’s OpenGL driver. In my last post, I emphasized thread-level GPU programming, and showed that significant gains are possible. In this post, I’m going to look at what happens if I pretend that my Haswell GT2 GPU is really a 20-core CPU with 7-way hyperthreading, a big register file, and a really awesome SIMD instruction set, and then write ray-tracers with it. We will see that the “wrong” way is sometimes better than the obvious way. Experimental Setup The benchmark for this post will be constructing a photon map with 10M photons in a variation of the BART Kitchen scene. For simplicity’s sake, I use only diffuse surfaces. This generates a large number of extremely incoherent rays, and is a pretty nice worst-case scenario. The acceleration structure used for all experiments is a simple binary BVH. This is the same experiment I used a while back when did my AVX Optimized CPU tracer, so I’ll borrow that benchmark for the GPU tracer. The CPU version of this test can be found here. My test code can be found in my HAXWell github repo. All graphs show ray rates in KRays/s on an Intel Core i3-4010U, averaged over three runs. I only use one of my 2 cores for these tests but I’ve also included the extrapolated two-core results to give an idea of what the CPUs limits are. Disclaimer: I Can’t Feed The Beast I opted to implement this by treating the GPU as a raytracing co-processor. I have a CPU thread which generates a queue of rays and dispatches a compute job for every 4096 rays that are pushed onto the queue. After “priming” the queue with a large number of photon rays, the CPU thread starts reading rays back, and either generating secondary rays or starting new photon paths and pushing the new rays onto the queue. The idea is that we can hopefully pipeline this thing deep enough that the GPU and CPU can run in tandem. GPU does the raytracing, and CPU does shader evaluation and such like. This is an ideal design if we want to design a renderer that can support a plugin architecture, where arbitrary user code can feed rays to the raytracing core. Unfortunately, try though I might, I wasn’t able to achieve complete GPU utilization with this setup. No matter what method I use for the GPU trace, the GPU is finishing rays faster than I can launch new ones. The best I can do is roughly 60% GPU utilization. A GPUView run makes the situation quite obvious. I have little chunks of GPU work landing in the queue at regular intervals with bubbles in between. This is largely the result of using OpenGL as my backdoor API. Profiling shows that the bulk of my time is being spent in OpenGL calls. There are ways around this problem, and it probably wouldn’t be an issue if I could do this with OpenCL or Vulkan, but it’s too much hassle for me to figure out how to feed custom ISA to an entirely different API. As much as I’d like to be able to demonstrate a complete, scalable implementation, it’s going to have to wait. It’s a solvable problem but one I can’t solve at the moment. Instead, I’m simply going to measure the GPU duration of my ray tracing jobs and report which Kernel structure uses the GPU most efficiently, and what the theoretical ray rates are. Baseline To start with, we’ll look at doing this in GLSL, the way you might expect to. We’ll take a straightforward stack-based raytracer and shoot one ray per thread. We’ll use a thread-group size of 16 because allegedly what Intel’s ideal SIMD width is. The results are not great. Actually worse than what our CPU could do if I bothered to utilize the other cores. Here it is, compared to two different streaming CPU raytracers. Purple bars show what the blue bars would be if they scaled perfectly to both of my cores. As a quick test, let’s see what happens when we drop the thread group size in our GLSL shader from 16 down to 8. When we do this, we find that things go a little faster. According to my instruction issue tests, SIMD8 has roughly 50% less compute throughput than SIMD16, at least for the common dual-issuable floating point instructions. Yet we get a sizable performance gain. Why? There are two main factors. First, less rays per threadgroup means less rays in flight, which means there is more cache available to each ray. Second, SIMD8 instructions have lower latency, which means there is less of a relative performance loss when coherence goes to pot near the bottom of the BVH. In situations where lots of thread masking is expected, wider SIMD is a liability. Going Beyond SPMD Now lets look at other ways of doing this. In CPU raytracing, one of the classic techniques is “packet tracing” whereby a group of rays (4 or 8) is traversed through the scene along the same path. At each node, intersection tests are performed on the entire group simultaneously using vector instructions (SSE or AVX), and if any of the rays in the group wants to proceed further, the entire group is dragged along with it. The goal is to amortize the cost of stack manipulation and node access across multiple rays. The results are generally very good when rays are coherent, and terrible when they are not. So let’s start by implementing a simple 8-wide packet tracer using GEN assembly. It turns out that there are some really interesting tricks we can play here: The packet tracer differs from the GLSL tracer in a significant way. In the GLSL tracer, the SIMD lanes can take divergent paths through the tree. In the packet tracer, this does not happen. Because all the SIMD lanes in the packet tracer always take the same path, and because Intel gives each thread a full register set, we can afford to store our traversal stack entirely in registers and access it using register indirect addressing. This is considerably cheaper than using memory. But we can do something even more interesting than that: Normally the traversal stack contains pointers to the nodes that we need to visit. Each traversal step pushes the next two nodes onto a stack and the next loop iteration reads the top one. We have enough register space that instead of storing node addresses, we can just store whole nodes. So, instead of doing our loads at the start of traversal, we can do them at the end, which allows us to hide a bit more latency. Here is the skeleton of our raytracer, glossing over the details. The important instructions are written out in my HAXWell assembly syntax. All of my hand-written kernels follow this structure, differing only in the way the traversal and intersection tests are written. 
// load first node into working reg
send DwordLoad8(Nodes), node.u, node_address.u  
    
// begin traversal loop
traversal:

   // intersection test against node in working reg

   // if ray missed, goto pop_stack
    
   // if this is a leaf, goto visit_leaf
    
    // start reading near node into working register for next traversal step
    send DwordLoad8(Nodes), node.u, node_address.u 
    
    // start reading far node into stack head for some future traversal step
    // and increment stack pointer (stored in address register a0)
    send DwordLoad8(Nodes), Stack[a0.0].u, node_address.u 
    add(1) a0.us0, a0.us0, 32
    
    jmp traversal

visit_leaf:
   // intersection tests here.

pop_stack:

    // check if we've reached the bottom of the stack
    cmpeq(1) (f0.0) tmp0.u, a0.us0, 0

    // decrement stack ptr before the jump, 
    // if jump is taken we don't care about underflow
    add(1) a0.us0, a0.us0, -32      
    
    jmpif(f0.0) finished

    // copy next node from stack into working reg for traversal test
    mov(8) node.u, Stack[a0.0].u
    
    jmp traversal


finished:

    // Store hit info
end

 Each of our traversal steps, if it finds a hit, will read the next two nodes. The next node to be visited is fetched directly into the register that our intersection test reads it from. The other, we fetch into the next register on the traversal stack, using indirect addressing on the send instruction. Since the messages are asynchronous, the issuing of the second fetch is able to hide some of the latency of the first fetch. Because we adopt the standard trick of storing sibling nodes in the same cache line, there is (hopefully) no bandwidth penalty from the second fetch. In fact, it’s likely that we come out ahead in bandwidth since we don’t need to worry about the sibling node being evicted and re-fetched later. Let’s see how an 8-wide packet tracer does: Compared to GLSL, the results aren’t stellar. Part of the reason is that I couldn’t figure out a nice, cheap way to do ordered traversal for the packet tracer. Another reason is that, as I’ve said before, my GEN assembly code sucks, because I’m not as good at this as the compiler is. The raytracer is very heavy on flow control, and all of my ‘jmp’ macros expand into adds on the program counter, and this is probably the wrong way to do uniform control flow on GEN. Still, the fact that we’re at parity means that there’s probably more performance to be gained from thread-level programming if we had an actual compiler generating this code for us. And Now For Something Completely Different Now lets do something that everyone tells us not to. Instead of trying to use data-parallelism, let’s use instruction-level parallelism. We’ll trace one ray per hardware thread, and vectorize our intersection tests as best we can. We use the same stack and traversal strategy as before, but our ray-box test turns from this: 
    sub(8)  tmp0.f, node.f0<0,1,0>, ray_Ox.f
    sub(8)  tmp1.f, node.f4<0,1,0>, ray_Ox.f

    cmple(8) (f0.0) tmp0.f, tmin.f, tmax.f
    cmpge(8) (f0.1) tmp1.f, tmax.f, 0.0f
    and(8) tmp0.u, tmp0.u, tmp1.u
    cmpgt(8) (f0.0) null.u, tmp0.u, 0
    jmpif(!f0.0) pop_stack
 into this: 
    sub(8) tmp0.f, node.f,  ray_O.f 
    mul(8) tmp1.f, tmp0.f,  ray_invD.f 
    min(1) tmax.f, tmp1.f4, tmp1.f5
    max(1) tmin.f, tmp1.f0, tmp1.f1    
    min(1) tmax.f, tmax.f,  tmp1.f6
    max(1) tmin.f, tmin.f,  tmp1.f2
    min(1) tmax.f, tmax.f,  ray_data_rcp.f3
    cmpgt(1) (f0.0) tmp0.f, tmin.f, tmax.f
    cmplt(1) (f0.1) tmp1.f, tmax.f, 0
    jmpif(f0.0) pop_stack     
    jmpif(f0.1) pop_stack // if ray missed, goto pop_stack
 Our triangle intersection test also gets quite interesting, utilizing dot-product instructions and SIMD4x2 instructions with lane swizzling. On the face of it, this code sucks. Its ALU utilization is abysmal, and the number of instructions per ray is considerably higher. However, in return for poor utilization, we get lower latency, and it’s not going to lose anything near the bottom of the tree when ray divergence kicks in, because this simply doesn’t apply anymore. Let’s see how it does: Here is a strange result. Tracing one ray per Warp/Wave/Thread on a GPU is not sucking nearly as much as it’s supposed to. We can really start pulling ahead if we do the same thing, but vectorize 8 ray/triangle intersection tests instead of looping over individual ones. If we also tweak our SAH parameter a bit to bias towards a shallower tree, we end up with a marked improvement. We’re at 25% more perf than the GLSL tracer, and starting to show significant gains over a threaded CPU implementation. I gave up trying to do a 16x vectorization, because I’ve finally started running out of registers and I don’t feel like hand-allocating them. I also started to work on a qbvh version of this thing, but it’s getting to be a real pain in the neck to write all of this complicated code directly in assembly. Maybe I’ll pick this back up when I’m less burnt out, or maybe we’ll just have to wait until somebody builds me a compiler to see how much better we can get, but we are now ahead of the throughput we could expect from the CPU, and this with terrible hand-written assembly code. Remember, this is running on a low-end, low-voltage laptop chip. Our rays per watt number is probably looking really good. Closing Thoughts Warp level programming has the potential to be a useful GPU programming model. It warrants serious consideration. We can potentially do some very powerful things with it but we need better tools before we can make the attempt. As a thought experiment, consider the same kind of implementation on GCN. A small (~32 entry) traversal stack could fit into SGPRs, and be manipulated using the S_MOVREL instructions. 32 extra sGPRs might hurt occupancy a little bit but should be affordable. Single-ray intersection tests could be implemented on the vector units, albeit very inefficiently, but the utilization matters less here than the latency, and the node access is probably going to swamp everything anyways. Once a leaf is reached, intersection testing could be unrolled 64 times instead of 8 or 16. An unroll factor of 64 means shallower trees, meaning less performance lost on the inefficient traversal code. The idea is sound, and interesting, in light of the results I’m getting, might be worth trying. You cannot possibly get a GPU language compiler to generate this code for you, but the required hardware is all there. We just need the software to catch up. Maybe this will help. Posted in: Uncategorized 3 Comments Allan S MacKinnon September 6, 2016 at 5:10 pm Another great post on the idiosyncratic GEN architecture! Warp-centric programming is a great fit for GEN given its 7 isolated threads and register files per EU. But don’t forget that there are a couple architectural gotchas working against writing purely warp-centric code: 1. A shared memory allocation for a subslice work group must be at least 4KB and is increased in 1KB steps. You can still perform very warp-centric programming but you have to be a little creative in your workgroup sizing if you want to use all 64KB of local/shared memory across all 56 (Gen8+) subslice hardware threads. 2. There are only 16 hardware synchronization barriers per subslice. If your 8-lane warps are truly isolated then this won’t matter but if your SIMD8 warps are coordinating then this is something to be aware of. Semi-related: note that Intel just released an OpenCL extension that will force a kernel to be compiled to a desired warp “width” (8/16/32). This makes it possible to reason about how a CTA will map onto a subslice. Knowing the kernel’s SIMD with also makes it easier to reason about the shuffle extensions. Bram September 4, 2016 at 6:37 pm I always thought that single-ray-multiple triangles would be the way to go. Thus 1 ray vs 8 triangles on AVX2. And if you have a low-poly world, heck, just blast all triangles, so you have no spatial indexing that is a drag to build an update all the time. No problem with diverging paths. I’ve done some experiments with single-ray-vs-8-voxels too, to photon map a voxel world. I tried GLSL, OpenCL and AVX2 with this: http://thelittleengineerthatcould.blogspot.ca/2015/01/rocket-engine-illumination.html Rob Wentworth (geekmaster) September 4, 2016 at 4:23 pm This is really thought-provoking. I love bending hardware in ways its designers never envisioned, so this fascinates me. I am curious how I can apply these methods to AI algorithms, and though I have countless hours of ASM programming experience, a C compiler would be appreciated to help postpone the burnout you mentioned. Thanks for sharing, and now I must check out your other posts as well for more thought-gems like this. Comments are closed.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 2, 2016 at 9:23PM Image source: Intel.  Last year, I spotted an interesting job listing on microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) job boards. The listing talked about how the company was looking for a processor designer to work in the company's relatively new Microarchitecture Research Lab located in Bangalore, India. This processor designer's job would be to join a team of engineers to "spearhead the research and advanced development" of both processor cores and graphics processors intended to arrive in the "2020 and beyond timeframe." These designs, per the listing, were intended to be manufactured in Intel's "futuristic" 7-nanometer manufacturing technology, signaling that Intel planned a significant advancement with this technology. Interestingly enough, Intel has posted an updated version of this job listing that might offer some clues into the company's future technology introduction plans. 2020 becomes 2022? Here's the relevant quote from the updated job listing (emphasis mine): The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade. It would appear that Intel's new launch time frame for these new processor cores has been pushed out by a couple of years, from 2020 to 2022. Although it may be the case that Intel is now targeting, perhaps, the 5-nanometer manufacturing technology with these cores, rather than the 7-nanometer technology as explicitly mentioned in the original version of this listing, I don't think Intel would have said "sub-10nm technology nodes" if that's what it meant; it would have said "sub-7nm technology nodes." Expect the first 7-nanometer products in 2021 I suspect what's going on here is that Intel had originally planned to release products manufactured on its 7-nanometer technology in the 2020 time frame, but for whatever reason the company has delayed that until 2022. If we consider what Intel has publicly said about its manufacturing plans, this actually makes a lot of sense. Intel is expected to go into manufacturing on its first 10-nanometer products during the second half of 2017. For simplicity, let's assume that volume availability of 10-nanometer product doesn't happen until January 2018. Intel has said that it plans three waves of 10-nanometer technology: 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. If Intel keeps to an annual product launch cadence, then we should see volume availability of the first 10-nanometer+ products in January 2019, and the first 10-nanometer++ products in January 2020. Based on this cadence, which is admittedly probably on the pessimistic side, the first products based on 7-nanometer would be expected to launch in January 2021 -- a bit earlier than the 2022 time frame given in the job listing. What Intel could be planning, then, is to introduce substantially enhanced chip designs a year after the first 7-nanometer products, which could very well be modest updates to the final 10-nanometer++ products. In fact, Intel's product cadence is now referred to as "Process, Architecture, Optimization," so fundamentally new architecture products on 7-nanometer could, indeed, arrive in January 2022.  What does this mean for Intel? It's unfortunate that Intel seems unable to get back to releasing significantly new manufacturing technologies every two years. However, because the company now plans to make annual performance improvements to each new technology over a period of three years, Intel should still be able to deliver improved and competitive products to the marketplace -- which is what ultimately matters.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 3, 2016 at 11:29AM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) built their businesses around the PC. Intel, the dominant supplier of x86 CPUs, has felt the sluggish demand for PCs. It produced a lower net income in 2015 than it did in 2010, driven by slumping PC sales and the failed attempts to break into the mobile market. NVIDIA, on the other hand, has benefited from a resilient gaming PC market. Sales of its graphics processors, particularly high-end models, have surged in recent years, driving the company's revenue to record levels. Both have been diversifying away from PCs, with Intel putting a heavy focus on data center products and NVIDIA growing its enterprise and automotive businesses. The two companies are clashing in the accelerator market, where NVIDIA's dominant Tesla GPUs are being challenged by Intel's 72-core Knights Landing chips. Intel is aiming to increase the quantity and variety of chips it sells into the enterprise, putting NVIDIA in its crosshairs. With the heyday of the PC long gone, Intel and NVIDIA will likely look very different 10 years from now. With that in mind, one question remains: Which stock is the better buy? The case for Intel Image source: Intel. Despite a weak PC market, Intel remains a wildly profitable company. Its growth engine in recent years has been in its data center segment, where its server CPUs enjoy a near-monopoly. That may not be the case forever: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), International Business Machines, and ARM Holdings are all attempting to chip away at Intel's server dominance. But for the time being, Intel remains the king. The data center segment now generates almost as much operating income as the client computing segment, which includes chips that go into PCs and mobile devices. The company's recently updated five-part strategy reflects this shift. The first priority for Intel is the cloud and the data center, with connected devices coming second. Intel still enjoys a major advantage in the PC CPU market, as one of just two companies that sell x86 PC CPUs. AMD, which hopes to win back market share from Intel next year with its upcoming Zen CPUs, is the other. Historically, AMD has never been able to remain competitive for all that long. The last time AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market was about a decade ago. Analysts are expecting Intel to produce $2.50 per share in adjusted earnings this year, putting the P/E ratio at about 14. The company will face many challenges over the next few years as it deals with more competition in its core markets and that could derail earnings growth. But for those who believe Intel can successfully navigate through this post-PC era, the stock trades at a fair price. The case for NVIDIA Image source: NVIDIA. Shares of NVIDIA have exploded over the past year, soaring 170%. Over the past five years, the stock is up more than 360%. There have been multiple factors driving these impressive gains. The company's core PC graphics card business has been booming, with sales of its higher-end cards driving record revenue. NVIDIA's unit share of the discrete graphics card market increased from around 60% in 2014 to 80% in 2015, leaving AMD with the scraps. Beyond PC graphics cards, NVIDIA has been growing two other businesses. In the enterprise, the company's Tesla GPUs are increasingly being used for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks, with the largest cloud computing companies buying the cards by the thousands. In the automotive market, NVIDIA's DRIVE platforms are being adopted to both power in-vehicle displays and aid with the development of autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA's chips are already in a variety of models, including the Tesla Model S. In all of these markets, NVIDIA will be facing plenty of competition. In the graphics card market, AMD recently launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards in an effort to win back market share from NVIDIA. In the enterprise, Intel is gunning for NVIDIA with its Knights Landing chip. And in the automotive market, there's no shortage of companies aiming to stake a claim in the self-driving car of the future. Its stock has surged because investors expect NVIDIA to be able to grow swiftly in the coming years. But with shares now trading for 40 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company's falling short of expectations could send shares tumbling. The verdict While NVIDIA appears to have superior growth prospects, in part because it's so much smaller than Intel, the lofty valuation makes it difficult to recommend. For that reason, Intel looks like the better buy. A lot of things will need to go right for NVIDIA in the coming years for the stock to grow into its valuation, and I suspect that the market has gotten a little too optimistic. Intel also has the benefit of a far superior dividend, with the stock yielding nearly 3% compared to just 0.75% for NVIDIA. Intel is facing many challenges, and its extraordinary dominance of the server CPU market may not last. But despite these issues, the stock looks more attractive than NVIDIA's.

This ex-Apple engineer was involved in the migration of OS X to Intel but never got a call back after a retail Genius interview. An op-ed in the NYT has raised the issue of age discrimination in Silicon Valley as it’s believed that the engineer was not hired because of his age. In an op-ed about workplace biases the author sheds light on age discrimination by giving the example of former Apple engineer J.K. Scheinberg who tried getting a customer support representative Genius Bar job at an Apple retail store. Scheinberg was at Apple proper for a considerably long period of time – from 1997 until his retirement in 2008 – and was directly involved with the first builds of OS X for Intel processors. He said that three interviewers told him that they will be in touch about the Genius Bar job but he never heard back from them. This isn’t the first time that Apple has been accused of preferring to hire younger people. 60 year old Michael Katz sued Apple back in 2010 after less senior employees at an Apple Store in Orlando were promoted above him. He held that they were less qualified individuals for the post and that he was only passed over for promotion multiple times on account of his age. Apple has not yet commented on this op-ed.

Revenue last month amounted to NT$3.46 billion (US$109.8 million), rising 9.15 percent from July’s NT$3.17 billion and 34.6 percent from NT$2.57 billion in the same month last year, according to the company’s filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. “We have been seeing Realtek benefit from the China networking demand and Broadcom’s exit of low-margin Wi-Fi business earlier this year,” Credit Suisse analyst Randy Abrams said in a report released on Tuesday last week. Realtek has multiple growth drivers, which should help boost its revenue by more than 20 percent this year, Abrams said. Realtek made NT$31.75 billion in revenue last year. Major growth drivers include demand from telecom operators for Wi-Fi and switch chips, order gains in TV chips from a South Korean TV brand and Wi-Fi chip upgrade demand to the 802.11ac standard for PCs, broadband and set-top boxes, according to the report. Abrams upgraded RealTek to “outperform” from “neutral.” Capital Investment Management Corp (群益投顧) expects Realtek to grow its revenue by 23.6 percent annually this year to NT$39.24 billion. Sales from communications-related chips is expected to increase by a double-digit percentage this year, supported by rising demand for networking equipment in China, which is deploying infrastructure, Capital Investment said in a report. More than 60 percent of Realtek’s revenue comes from the communication segment, the report said. The investment consultant has a “neutral” rating on Realtek, saying that the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio has reached the upper band of its historical range. The stock is trading at about 17 times its earnings per share, Capital Investment said. Separately, Siliconware Precision Industry Co (SPIL, 矽品精密), the world’s No. 3 chip packager and tester, yesterday reported a mild 1.6 percent increase in revenue for last month to NT$7.43 billion from July’s NT$7.32 billion. That was the best August in the company’s history, SPIL said. On an annual basis, revenue last month climbed 10.7 percent from NT$6.71 billion. Smaller rival chip packager and tester King Yuan Electronics Co (京元電子) yesterday reported record-high monthly sales for last month at NT$1.82 billion. That represented a 1.1 percent monthly growth from NT$1.8 billion in July, or an annual expansion of 25.5 percent from NT$1.45 billion in August last year. King Yuan is expected to grow revenue by 6 percent sequentially this quarter to NT$5.76 billion and an all-time high of NT$19.89 billion for the full year, Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) analyst Andrew Chen (陳治宇) said. Chen attributed the growth to increasing orders from China’s Hisilicon Technologies Co (海思半導體), which supplies smartphone chips only to its parent company, Huawei Technologies Co (華為). King Yuan also landed a new client, Intel Corp, and is expected to ramp up production for the US firm in the second half, Chen said. He expects 4 percent of King Yuan’s second-half sales will come from Intel. This story has been viewed 1902 times. Comments will be moderated.

The OEM PCs featuring these 'Bristol Ridge' processors will benefit from the new AMD AM4 platform supporting DDR4 memory, next-gen I/O, and other qualities. A PC system based upon one of the new APUs is said to "deliver high-speed processing, smooth eSports gaming, and enhanced HD and UHD streaming". The new range of 7th Gen chips from AMD will include a maximum of four 'Excavator' cores. Today AMD has revealed eight new processors; there are five quad-core APUs, two dual-core APUs, and one quad-core Athlon X4. Check out the chart below for individual processor details. AMD highlights that these 7th Gen processors top out at 65W, yet offer performance that could only be realised at 95-watts with the previous generation. Talking of performance, AMD has provided an interesting comparison of the new A12-9800 APU pitted against the year-old quad-core Intel Core i5 6500 65W processor. AMD says that its A12-9800 can offer "up to equivalent productivity performance and up to 99 per cent higher graphics performance," than the Intel chip. PCMark 8 v2 Home was used to compare productivity (scores: 3483.25 vs 3466.5) and 3DMark 11 Performance was used to compare graphics performance (scores: 3521.25 vs 1765.75). Systems both used 8GB dual-channel DDR4 RAM, 228GB SSD, and Windows 10. The AMD system used DDR4-2400 RAM, while the Intel system used DDR4-2133 RAM. Performance-per-watt scores looked even better for AMD - but you will notice a more diverse range of parts have been 'cherry picked' for these graphs (directly below). Other important features of the 7th Gen chips from AMD centre on enhanced graphics and video playback features. AMD's new 'Bristol Ridge' parts support up to 4K Ultra HD in both the popular H.264 and new-and-improved H.265 formats, APUs fully support GCN and DirectX 12. The AMD AM4 platform provides next gen I/O and peripheral support including PCIe Gen 3, USB 3.1 Gen 2, NVMe, and SATA Express. It also offers higher power efficiency than previous AMD desktop platforms (up to 70 per cent power used compared to AM3+). AMD says that the new HP and Lenovo designs featuring AM4 show the ecosystem's readiness for the upcoming high performance 'Summit Ridge' processors, based upon 'Zen' cores. AMD has a "commitment to support AM4 for years to come". The above will be joined by an as-yet unnamed 'enthusiast' level chipset.

A bit boring perhaps, but it follows AMD's usual pattern on these things. EDIT: I notice the slide lists “X/B/A300” chipset for SFF options, which doesn't seem to provide any additional ports at all… so it looks like the additional chip is entirely optional and you can build a board to run the SoC “bare”, as it were… I know the PCIe x8 limit is internal to the Bristol Ridge APU rather than being platform dependent … wonder how many lanes the platform as a whole can cope with? I sincerely hope it's a lot more than 8… :O_o1: Posted by CAT-THE-FIFTH - Mon 05 Sep 2016 14:14 That A12 9800 looks pretty nice - 3.8GHZ to 4.2GHZ clockspeeds for the CPU and around 1.1GHZ for the GPU core!!

Though there’s no shocking new launch at this year’s show, we saw many newer product categories — like virtual reality — expand their influence. There’s also a resurgence in tech you’ve come to take for granted, like tablets and mid-range phones. Here are some major trends we’re seeing at the show that you should know. Mid-range phones cost too much IFA_RU1_01More We haven’t seen many flagship phones at IFA this year, but there have been some interesting tablets. The smartphone field has been distinctly mid-range; the specs war may be ending. Most smartphones have surpassed the point of “good enough” performance. Despite the lack of cutting edge processing power, the trend of premium metallic finishes shows no signs of abating and, we’ve lost count of the number of times a chamfered edge was described as diamond-cut. The companies behind this phones obviously want them to be perceived as affordable flagships with premium builds (like an iPhone or Galaxy). But they just as often feel like adequate phones that cost too much. While it’s good to see quality increase across the board, it’s becoming more difficult to find the true bargains. Read more here. The smartwatch has come full circle IFA_RU1_02More The watch has come full circle (literally), and rectangular smartwatches are out. Apart from the Apple Watch, that is – and its square shape is starting to look, well, square. Companies like Samsung and Asus started their smartwatch journey with rectangular devices a few years ago, but they’ve since made the shift to a more traditional wrist-piece. Case in point? The Asus ZenWatch 3, Asus’ first flagship watch with a circular design. Expect to see more circular watches as we head into the holiday season — and don’t expect to see many (or any) rectangular ones. Read more here. Intel’s 7th-gen chips are inspiring new laptops IFA_RU1_03More Read More Core, Intel’s main line of processors, is now on its seventh generation. The first examples of the new hardware arrived at IFA 2016, and they are paving the way for an estimated 250 designs that are scheduled for release before the end of the year. Those designs are targeting the back-to-school, and then holiday, buying seasons. Because Intel is launching 7th-gen mobile dual-core chips first, you’ll see new designs focused there, and in particular in the high-end market. The next few months will be a good time to buy a laptop. Read more here. Every laptop is a 2-in-1 IFA_RU1_04More Acer’s headline PC at IFA 2016 was the Spin 7, the thinnest 2-in-1 yet produced. But it wasn’t alone. The company announced a full line of Spin devices ranging from the budget Spin 1 up to the $1,200 Spin 7. Lenovo, too, announced affordable and attractive 2-in-1s, like the $550 Yoga Book with Windows and the $600 Miix 510. In fact, every PC announced by Lenovo was a 2-in-1. It’s not clear that users demand 2-in-1s, but it’s also not clear that demand matters. As the technologies that power the category become easier to produce, and more affordable, manufacturers are finding new value in multi-use PCs. Like the ultrabook before it, the 2-in-1 is likely to become more or less standard. You’ll likely find yourself buying one, whether you want a 2-in-1 or not. Read more here. Eye-tracking is gaining popularity IFA_RU1_05More Have you heard of Tobii? If not, we don’t blame you, though we have covered them for half a decade. The company, which has an eye-tracking technology designed for unique user input, has been around for a long time. Now, Tobii is starting to hit its stride. Its hardware has appeared in a new line of Acer Predator monitors at IFA 2016. It’s also in mobile hardware from Alienware and MSI, among others. That list of products might make you think Tobii is all about gaming. But it’s also useful for Microsoft’s Windows Hello login utility – and that may in fact become its killer app. And it’s not just Tobii in this field. Intel’s RealSense is just as capable. It seems these solutions have finally found their problem. Read more here. Everyone wants a slice of VR IFA_RU1_06More Everybody wants a piece of the VR pie, and IFA couldn’t have made that more apparent. It’s not just Oculus and HTC’s arena anymore. In just the first couple days of IFA, we’ve seen a handful of companies — Qualcomm, Alcatel, Acer, and a few others — either showing off new gear or announcing prices and availability for headsets they’d previously revealed. And that’s just the headgear side of things. Once the floor opens up, we fully expect to see a smattering of VR software and peripherals. The VR bandwagon still has plenty of room for people to hop on board. Read more here. Awesome tablets are back, but do we still want them? IFA_RU1_07More Tablets, or more precisely, tablets we may be tempted to buy, aren’t dying as fast as some may have predicted. Huawei and Lenovo in particular have excelled with tablets this year, with the MediaPad M3 and Yoga Book both really impressing respectively, and honorable mention also goes to Asus and the ZenPad 3S. Companies have seen the value in making tablets that can actually do some computing, finally giving the iPad some meaningful competition. The question is, are we bored of tablets, regardless of whether they’re good or bad, cheap or expensive, thanks to phones with massive screens? Read more here. Robots want to help you cook IFA_RU1_08More IFA is packed with appliances, but one trend that’s stood out is guided cooking. Whether it’s Sharp’s Love2Cook, a smart oven that’s preloaded with recipes; Bosch’s non-connected multicooker with accompanying app; or Samsung’s upcoming debut of its Club des Chefs app, where Michelen Star chefs will guide you through the cooking promise, everyone wants to make sure you don’t mess up in the kitchen. The message seems to be you don’t need to be a master in the kitchen to make good food. Take AEG Electrolux’s SenseCook. You don’t even have to know what temperature to cook your steak! Just dial in the level of doneness, and the included probe keeps track of when it’s time to stop cooking. Even kitchen appliances that aren’t connected are getting smarter. Read more here. Tech companies are having an identity crisis IFA_RU1_09More Once upon a time it was enough to hang your company’s reputation on the quality of its products, but if the press conferences at IFA 2016 are any indication, that’s no longer the case. While it’s typical for large corporations to spend several minutes updating the public on how they are striving to innovate and remain competitive in the marketplace at these events, this year it seemed like half the time these companies had our attention was spent on a reaction to some sort of identity crisis. Panasonic told us about how it wants to save the world with clean energy and “smart cities;” LG toured groups through an elaborate art installation which symbolically related products to natural phenomena; Samsung made a point of showing off how it was providing jobs to European millennials floundering in a struggling economy; and Sony continues to hammer home the nebulous concept of “Kando” as the basis for its product development. Philanthropy and artistic endeavors are fine and good, but they always feel a bit hollow when used to sell products. Read more here.

With IFA 2016 in full swing, you’d think that Razer wouldn’t have much new to showcase but that’s not the case. The gaming accessory specialist somehow found time to inject its notebooks with Kaby Lake and Pascal hardware, introduce a new ManO’War headset and open pre-orders for its Stargazer webcam. For its next act, Razer has partnered with boutique PC builder Maingear to create a new line of desktop PCs with a focus on both performance and aesthetics. The Maingear R1 Razer Edition, which starts at $999, includes an Asus H110M-A motherboard, Intel’s Core i5-6500 CPU with a retail cooler, 8GB of HyperX Fury DDR4 RAM (2x4GB), an Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, a 500W EVGA PSU and a 1TB Seagate hard drive running Windows 10 Home, all stuffed in an NZXT H440 chassis with Razer’s own design aesthetics. It’s on the high-end that things really take shape. At a base price of $4,099, you’ll get the same NZXT chassis loaded with a MSI X99A Raider board, Intel’s Core i7-6800K cooled by Maingear’s Epic 640 custom liquid cooler with clear coolant, 16GB of HyperX Fury DDR4 memory, an Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card, a 750W PSU from EVGA and a 1TB Seagate hard drive running Windows 10 Home. If money is no object, you can craft a beast of a system with the looks to back it up. Using Maingear’s system configuration tool, I put together a monster consisting of an Asus Strix X99 motherboard, Intel’s Core i7-6950X processor, the Epic 640 liquid cooling kit with UV-colored coolant, metal hardline tubing with chrome fittings, phase change TIM, the company’s Redline overclocking service, 64GB of HyperX Savage DDR4 RAM, dual liquid-cooled Nvidia Titan X graphics cards, a 1,200W Corsair Processional Digital Series AX1200i power supply with custom sleeving, a Samsung 512GB 950 Pro SSD as the primary drive and two Samsung 850 EVO 2TB drives in RAID 0, an Asus Blu-ray drive and Asus’ Xonar Essence audio card, all running Windows 10 Professional. The total cost? A wallet-shattering $12,890. The cost could be driven up even higher if you opt for Razer input accessories, a gaming-ready display and an extended warranty but I left those out and focused strictly on the system itself. At nearly $13K, a top-end Maingear R1 Razer Edition is well beyond the realm of reason for all but the elite one percent but if you do have the money to spare, you’ll get a drool-worthy system that’ll annihilate anything you throw at it for years to come. The Maingear R1 Razer Edition is available to order as of writing. Ship dates will vary depending on what options you select although the longest wait I saw when tinkering around was just under a month.

Intel Corp. has unveiled its new seventh generation core processors. This generation of processors known as Kaby Lake, which was built for the immersive Internet, was developed at Intel Israel's development centers. Intel VP and general manager Intel Israel Development Centers Ran Senderovitz said that the performance of the seventh generation chips was improved by 12% for applications and 19% for Internet use compared with the sixth generation chips. He added, "Moreover, if you have computer at home that is four or five years old and then bought a PC with a seventh generation processor you'd see an improvement in speed of up to 70% in routine tasks." RELATED ARTICLES Intel Israel hands out layoff notifications Intel Israeli procurements worth $10b in past decade Intel buys Israeli co Replay Technologies for $175m Intel Israel's exports fall to $4.1b in 2015 Senderovitz explained that the main improvement is in the ability to play video material. Computers with 7G chips should be in the stores in September with availability increasing towards the end of the year. He added, "When we started out on the project, we were only thinking about basic improvements from the previous generation. But we began looking at things differently with a lot of innovation and determination and we achieved major improvements. We are talking about amazing technologies, technologies of 14 nanometers, which is like taking a hair and dividing it by 8,000.”The Israeli team has done it again and accomplished achievements that we did not see in the Olympics - a year-on-year improvement of above 10%. The product will sell millions of units for billions of dollars."

Is it faster than a Titan X desktop? By Richard Leadbetter Published 04/09/2016 Asus reckons that the ROG GX800VH could well be the most powerful consumer-level laptop in the world - and I it may well be right. The spec on this gaming laptop monster borders on the insane. An overclockable mobile Intel i7 K chip is paired with twin GTX 1080s in SLI, which works in combination with an 18.4-inch 60Hz 4K display. As long as the game in question is reasonably optimised for SLI, the bottom line is this - the GX800VH offers even more gaming power than a desktop i7 system paired with an overclocked Titan X Pascal. Other dual 1080 gaming laptops are available to challenge the Asus's crown - but to the best of my knowledge, none of them come with a liquid cooling dock to guarantee performance and stability. And yes, you can overclock it too. The GX800VH has a premium finish virtually everywhere you care to look. Our review sample came with a ludicrous 64GB of 2400MHz DDR4 system RAM, capable of overclocking up to 2800MHz. There's 1TB of NVMe solid state storage in RAID-0, split into two drives (a straight copy of game directories from one to the other yields a 1GB/s write-speed - that'll do nicely). The matte finish 18-inch 4K IPS screen offers crystal clear clarity and a preposterously small pixel patch, and audio is taken care of with a top of the line ESS Sabre DAC capable of 32-bit/384kHz output. Oh, and while the Core i7 6820HK is a 2.7GHz quad-core part with specs suggesting a single core turbo boost to 3.6GHz, our review sample happily locked all cores at 3.8GHz out of the box with headroom to spare. The unit itself is large, bulky and very heavy but has a premium finish from top to bottom - though we're looking at a mixture of plastics and metal as opposed to a full aluminium finish. It's also rich in functionality - traditional USB 3.0 is joined by a brace of new Type-C ports, the latest Thunderbolt technology offering cutting-edge expansion while also serving as a DisplayPort output - a nice complement to the HDMI 2.0 port also present. Gigabit Ethernet is joined by an SD card reader and even an antenna input for boosting WiFi reception. The keyboard uses what Asus describes as its MechTAG technology, which it describes as a mechanical keyboard. It feels great, but don't expect the travel and 'click' of a standard mechanical keyboard - it feels somewhat different. Of course, programmable RGB lighting is standard via the ROG Aura app. Asus ROG GX800VH specs It's a laptop so exclusive, Nvidia couldn't even show it as its own Pascal notebook press event. Powered by an overclockable mobile Skylake i7 and paired with two GTX 1080s, it's almost stupidly fast. Anything less than a 4K screen would seem like a waste... CPU: Core i7 6820HK (2.7GHz stock/3.8GHz+ OC) GPU: 2x Nvidia GTX 1080 in SLI RAM: 64GB 2400MHz DDR4 (2800MHz OC) Storage: Hyper RAID PCI Express NVMe 1TB Display: 18.4-inch 4K (3840x2160) Cooling: Liquid-cooling dock Power: 2x 330W Power Supplies (laptop, dock) Display Output: Mini DisplayPort, HDMI 2.0 Expansion: Thunderbolt, USB 3.0, USB 3.0 Type-C, SD Card, WiFi Antenna Slot, gigabit Ethernet, Kensington lock, headphone/mic jack Adding to the insanity, the GX800VH is powered by two 330W power supplies - one apiece for the laptop and the cooling dock. However, the laptop is detachable and can be powered by one PSU. SLI still works here, but the frequencies drop substantially - our recommendation here is to disable SLI: with power attached, boost clocks hit around 1750MHz on a single GPU, while frequencies drop to around 1150MHz running on battery power. Interestingly, running from battery still offers around 70 per cent of performance, with no stutter - just don't expect much in the way of battery life (something you can say about the machine in general no matter what it's doing). Curiously, running a single GTX 1080 with the dock attached sees boost clocks rise to 1866MHz in demanding titles - identical to our Founders Edition desktop model. Rich presents a video overview of the ROG GX800VH - if you want to see its 4K performance in action, start here. The question really isn't what features the GX800VH has - the spec is insanely comprehensive - but rather what it doesn't have. Stacked up against a top-end desktop system, all you're really missing is a six/eight-core CPU (the effectiveness of which is limited in gaming) and perhaps something like a mass storage RAID array - something you can easily add via USB or Thunderbolt, and not something that's likely to cut into your gaming experience. After a moment of chin-stroking, the best we could come up with is the omission of an adaptive sync display. G-Sync at 4K is obviously available, but we suspect that the 18.4-inch form factor limits Asus's options here - just as it did the MSI's similarly nuts GT80 Titan SLI we looked at a while back. Of course, the need for an adaptive sync solution presumes that the GX800VH isn't capable of sustaining 4K gameplay locked to the screen's 60Hz refresh. We're going to tackle performance in two distinct manners here - first of all we're rolling out our benchmarks in order to judge relative performance - we've already benchmarked the machine running with a single GTX 1080 in our Pascal Notebook overview, but now we can factor in the SLI results and toss in some higher-end desktop comparisons. Titan X Pascal, any one? And secondly we're going to be playing some games. Benchmarks are great for grading performance between various piece of hardware, but nothing beats the real life experience of sitting down and enjoying actual gameplay, dipping into the settings in order to optimise for the most silky smooth, fluid experience. OK, so here are the numbers then - we've included running the GX800VH with a single PSU attached in order to get an idea of SLI scalability too. SLI at its best can indeed double performance, as we're seeing with Assassin's Creed Unity, which easily powers past our Titan X Pascal desktop set-up. However, 40-60 per cent boosts at 4K resolution are more commonplace. 3840x2160 (4K) Core i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ GTX 1080 Desktop Core i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ Titan X Desktop Core i7 6820HK 3.8GHz/ GTX 1080 Core i7 6820HK 3.8GHz/ GTX 1080 SLI Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 32.9 43.1 31.1 62.0 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 53.6 63.7 52.7 60.4 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 39.6 50.0 37.3 61.1 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 38.5 49.6 38.5 58.6 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 42.4 49.6 40.1 56.9 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 49.0 62.1 42.5 71.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post-AA, No HairWorks 47.5 63.2 44.4 72.2 To cut a long story short - SLI works, most of the time. It's the extent to which it works that varies from title to title. In an absolute best case scenario we have Assassin's Creed Unity, handing in virtually double the overall performance level and out-pacing Titan X Pascal by 44 per cent (!). At the other end of the spectrum, Ashes of the Singularity's DX12 non-SLI multi-GPU mode offers paltry returns - just a 15 per cent uplift. It's notable that the end result sees the Titan X desktop set-up power ahead here - the only case where this happens in our benchmarks. Other SLI benefits see scalability in the region of 42 per cent on Far Cry Primal - not especially brilliant, but often par for the course, along with a more creditable 63 per cent boost in Crysis 3. This gives the game a 22 point advantage over our Titan X desktop set-up and reaps rewards in actual gameplay too, something we'll touch on shortly. And there are also significant gains in Rise of the Tomb Raider too - anything up to 67 per cent according to the in-game benchmark. We also tested The Witcher 3 - a title renowned for its wobbly multi-GPU support. We actually got decent enough scaling here - a 62 per cent performance boost and the micro-stutter we've previously seen in SLI testing is gone. However, inconsistent frame-times blighted The Division and seemed to wreck Hitman running on DX12 completely, to the point where we couldn't get any kind of consistent benchmark from it (hence its omission from the table above). The liquid cooling dock is what sets the GX800VH apart - it provides extra power for the system as well as managing thermals. GPU temperatures even when overclocking are in the 70-75 degrees Celsius range. In terms of actual gameplay, the GX800VH does an excellent job of matching and then building upon the experience we enjoyed with our desktop system running the new Titan X Pascal GPU - as you would hope when stacking up the combined 5120 CUDA cores we have running two GTX 1080s against the 3584 found in the new Titan's GP102 core. Often, the difference is just a case of additional refinement - simply because a Titan X system is already capable of excellent 4K performance. Take The Witcher 3, for example. We enjoyed a 4K60 lock with silky smooth gameplay. The dips under 60fps we saw on our Titan X system with lush alpha transparencies in play are not a problem at all on this system. Crysis 3 still exhibits some frame-rate dips, possibly down to the CPU in the intensive jungle scenes - but generally speaking, SLI is offering more GPU power here - we achieved a fairly consistent 60fps simply by dropping shader and shadows from very high to high, leaving everything else maxed. We achieved similar performance levels on the Titan X system though we were a little more aggressive with settings management. Asus ROG GX800VH - the Digital Foundry verdict If you have to ask how much the GX800VH is, the chances are you won't be able to afford it. Prices aren't clear yet, but in a world where the previous model featured a single GTX 980 and sets you back anything up to 5000 Euros, we can't imagine it will be any cheaper. It's hard to imagine that these systems find an audience when a dual Titan X Pascal desktop system would probably be cheaper, but all the major manufacturers have their own massively expensive flagships too. Clearly there is an audience. Lionhead: the inside story The rise and fall of a British institution, as told by those who made it. So is this the most powerful laptop in the world? Other GTX 1080 SLI/Core i7 gaming notebooks are available, but the liquid cooling dock ensures stable thermals and thus optimal performance, and it adds overclocking headroom too. Asus reckon the 1080s will hit 1960MHz or thereabouts (we found intense gaming workloads to top out at around 100MHz lower) and promises a meagre 200MHz OC on the G5X RAM (we hit 600-700MHz without too much effort). The cooling system works but when the GPUs are really under load, the dock can be rather loud. But the fact is that the performance is there - and it's monstrous. The GX800VH hands in performance that exceeds the high-end 4K set-up I championed at the beginning of the week and the UHD experience can be epic - Rise of the Tomb Raider is simply breathtaking, for example. Condensing that experience down onto an 18.4-inch screen seems ludicrous, but products like this aren't about practicality or reason. It's all about creating something that's the absolute best it can possibly be, no matter what the cost. It's not a product for me, but I love the fact it's out there, that it exists, that someone dares to make it. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News Laptops Razer's new Blade gaming laptop rock Kaby Lake, GTX 1060 The new Razer Blade rocks next-gen Kaby Lake CPU, NVIDIA's new GeForce GTX 1060 By: Anthony Garreffa | Laptops News | Posted: Sep 4, 2016 2:44 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Razer has just announced its new Blade and Blade Stealth gaming notebooks, with the new laptops being outfitted with Intel's next-gen Kaby Lake CPU, as well as NVIDIA's new Pascal-based GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card.     The new 14-inch Blade notebook doesn't look any different to the current (or is that now last-gen) Blade, which rocks a Core i7-6700HQ and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. Inside of the new Blade, Razer has opted for the GeForce GTX 1060, which is VR-ready.   Razer provides two display options for the Blade, with the original IGZO-based 3200x1800 display on offer, but we also have a IPS-based 1920x1080 offer, too. You can option some higher-end hardware for the Blade, with up to 256/512/1TB PCIe-based M.2 storage on offer.     It's the new Razer Blade Stealth that has me impressed, with some more CPU options on offer in the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7500U, replacing the older Core i7-6500U. Intel's new Core i7-7500U is a dual-core CPU with Hyper-Threading, so we have 4 threads at 2.7GHz base, or 3.5GHz Turbo clock. The same Intel HD Graphics 620 are included.   Razer's Blade Stealth also includes two display options for its 12.5-inch panel, with IGZO Touch display options in both 3840x2160 (4K) with 100% of the Adobe RGB color space, while the 2560x1440 option offers 70% of the Adobe RGB color space.     The new Blade Stealth is capable of taking 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage for the 4K model, while the 1440p model can handle 128/256/512GB storage options.   Razer has also provided a bigger and better battery for the new Blade Stealth, raising it from 45kWh to a much bigger 53.6kWh battery.     Both of the new gaming laptops rock Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, using USB Type-C to connect through to Razer's external graphics card solution: Razer Core. The new Blade is equipped with a GTX 1060, so you should be fine for most things there, but if you wanted to power an external LCD or TV, then you'll want the additional GPU power. If you're using the Blade Stealth, the external GPU could come in handy very quickly, as it only rocks integrated graphics.   Now, pricing... Razer has it's new Blade Stealth starting at $999, while the higher-end Blade starts at $1799. Both models are available right now.

JK Scheinberg, who spent 21 years working for the tech giants, applied to work in an Apple store after he retired but was rejected. chris murphy 1 JK Scheiberg was turned down for a job at the Apple store despite working for the company for 21 years The 54-year-old was the famous engineer who persuaded Steve Jobs to move the Mac from PowerPC to Intel in 2005. But when he got restless after retiring, he decided to work for an Apple store on their Genius bar despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. The interviewing panel apparently never got back to Schienberg and now there are suggestions it was because of his age. Wonder if Apple will finally give me callback on that genius bar interview https://t.co/9fXt5fBFTU #ageism — JK Scheinberg (@tiltdad) September 5, 2016 Apple Stores are notorious for recruiting young staff to their front-of-house roles. The New York Times has now used the incident as an example of age discrimination in the workplace. Ashton Applewhite wrote: “I’m lucky enough to get my tech support from JK Scheinberg, the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. “A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he’d be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview.” related stories YOU WON'T BELIEVE YOUR EARS Apple iPhone 7 'airpods' to replace traditional headphones, rumours suggest RIPE FOR THE PICKING Legendary Apple guru 'Ming the Merciless' reveals EVERYTHING about the iPhone 7 BRUSSELS MAKING A STAND After Apple slapped with £11bn tax bill EU is probing six more American companies SEVENTH HEAVEN Here's a MAJOR clue about what Apple's iPhone 7 is going to look like when it launches next week APPLE COR!

News Obituaries Raymond Niro, a patent attorney, dies at age 73 Raymond P. Niro, Family photo / Handout Raymond P. Niro also was the author of a book titled "Go for It!" on the practice of intellectual property law. Raymond P. Niro also was the author of a book titled "Go for It!" on the practice of intellectual property law. (Family photo / Handout) Bob GoldsboroughChicago Tribune A nationally known patent litigator for more than 40 years, Raymond P. Niro Sr. brought technical prowess and plenty of charisma to his work representing inventors, many of them individuals or small companies, in battles against corporate giants. A series of judgments against large firms in favor of his clients, who sometimes had acquired patents and weren't actual inventors themselves, led Intel Corp.'s assistant general counsel to derisively describe Niro as a "patent troll," a nickname that stuck with him for the rest of his career. Niro, not surprisingly, took a decidedly different view toward his work. "He loved the small inventor and was the champion of the little guy," said his son, Dean, who practiced law alongside his father for nearly three decades. "He was never happier than when he was meeting with the individual inventor, and when he represented those people, it meant more to him than you could imagine." Niro, 73, died of a heart attack on Aug. 8 while vacationing on the island of Capri in Italy, his son said. Niro had been an Arlington Heights resident for almost 40 years until about a decade ago, and most recently had divided his time between a River North condominium and a home in Boca Raton, Fla. Born Raymond Pardo Niro in Pittsburgh to Italian immigrant parents, Niro grew up in the Pittsburgh area. After earning a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh, Niro moved to Texas to work for Shell Oil as an engineer. Photo gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities with Chicago ties who died in 2016. Dissatisfied at work, Niro took a job at DuPont writing patent applications while attending George Washington University Law School at night. After graduating from law school in 1969, Niro moved to Chicago to join the intellectual property law firm now known as Brinks Gilson & Lione. He and a colleague, Gerald Hosier, left the firm in 1976 to form their own small firm. Among the services they offered was a novel one for the time: contingency representation for small inventors who thought that their intellectual property rights had been violated. That meant that individual inventors didn't need to pay their lawyers unless they were awarded damages or reached a financial settlement. The duo found early success, winning their first case on behalf of an inventor who had developed an automatic shutoff nozzle for gas station pumps. The inventor prevailed over a plumbing and heating manufacturer, settling for $200,000 without going to trial. Niro and Hosier's fee was $50,000 each. "In that first case, the money (he made) was nice, but the reward of seeing an inventor recoup something was worth more (to him) than the money," his son said. Tim Haller, a retired partner at Niro's firm who worked alongside him for 38 years, said Niro's ability to communicate with ordinary people, including jurors, was a key to his success. "You can get bogged down in the details of our business. He had a good sense for simplifying things and making his story coherent for people," Haller said. "He was one of the best at it. And he was a people's person. People warmed up to him." Niro and Hosier went their separate ways in 1984 when Niro started his own intellectual property law firm, now known as Niro Law. Patrick F. Solon, a partner at the firm, recalled meeting Niro in 1994. "It was obvious then that he had the talent and ability you see in famous trial lawyers," Solon said. "He excelled in patent and intellectual property cases because he was so smart and had the necessary knack for presenting complicated engineering and scientific subjects to judges and juries. But his secret was making his cases about the inventor, not just the invention." Another partner at Niro Law, Paul Vickrey, practiced alongside him for 23 years and called Niro "a master of cross-examination." "Even though trials can be stressful, it was always fun to sit back and enjoy the show when he took on a key witness," Vickrey said. Colleagues said Niro's gift was being able to communicate to juries how his clients had been wronged "by the behemoths in their industries," Vickrey said, which meant proving that valid patents had been infringed upon. And in casting the battle lines in a David-vs.-Goliath fashion, Niro often invoked his Italian parents. "During closing arguments of cases, he always mentioned that his parents were immigrants from Italy, and that fighting for the underdog was helping people like his parents," his son said. At one point, Niro had won 20 jury verdicts in a row that surpassed the multimillion-dollar mark. And from 1996 until his death, he won verdicts and settlements totaling more than $1 billion. His courtroom wins prompted the National Law Journal in 1997 to name him one of the top 10 trial attorneys in the U.S. Niro in 1999 endowed a professorship at the DePaul University College of Law. In 2009, he wrote a book titled "Go for It!" which detailed how lawyers can win intellectual property cases in courtrooms. A marriage to Judith Niro ended in divorce. Other survivors include his three other sons, Raymond Jr., Brian and Sean; a sister, Mary Lou DiBartola; a brother, William; and 12 grandchildren. Services were held.

Plan 9 from ? I have been saying for years that I am seeing the same phenomonon today that I saw thirty years ago when the microprocessor was first invented. At that time I argued a lot with all the computer scientists. They insisted that microprocessors were not really computers because they did not run the same software that these people had on their large timesharing computers. I argued that microprocessors would revolutionize computing because they were cheap. Within a few years certain models would become cheaper than mechanical switches or a bundle of wires and would replace mechanical control circuits in many appliances. I also argued that they would make personal computers possible, machines that you wouldn't have to timeshare. Microprocessors did revolutionize computing. The embedded computer market grew to billions of units a year, and high end micros go into tens of millions of personal computers each year. But in that same time the high end microprocessors and personal computers have become bigger and faster than the large timesharing systems from the past. Many even run software that became the most popular software in the world for large timesharing computers. I find it strange that after all the work done to make personal computers faster and more user friendly that for the most part their power is wasted by using the most inefficient software available. For the most part personal computer operating system software comes in three popular flavors, Unix, Windows, and Mac. Microsoft Windows has the largest market share, the most apauling performance, and is the most unstable and buggy of the three. It is a common joke in the industry and it is looked down upon by the people who use what they consider industrial strength software, Unix. The place that brought us 'C' and Unix, Bell Labs, has developed a new system called Plan 9 to replace Unix and operate more effectively with new computing paradigms such as distributed networks of PCs, servers, and the internet. In a document first published in 1995 they explain the reason for the development of Plan 9. The document is available online at Plan 9 from Bell Labs From the first few paragraphs of that document: "By the mid 1980's, the trend in computing was away from large centralized time-shared computers towards networks of smaller, personal machines, typically UNIX `workstations'. People had grown weary of overloaded, bureaucratic timesharing machines and were eager to move to small, self-maintained systems, even if that meant a net loss in computing power. As microcomputers became faster, even that loss was recovered, and this style of computing remains popular today. In the rush to personal workstations, though, some of their weaknesses were overlooked. First, the operating system they run, UNIX, is itself an old timesharing system and has had trouble adapting to ideas born after it. Graphics and networking were added to UNIX well into its lifetime and remain poorly integrated and difficult to administer. More important, the early focus on having private machines made it difficult for networks of machines to serve as seamlessly as the old monolithic timesharing systems. Timesharing centralized the management and amortization of costs and resources; personal computing fractured, democratized, and ultimately amplified administrative problems. The choice of an old timesharing operating system to run those personal machines made it difficult to bind things together smoothly." After the thirty years that it took to build up microprocessors beyond the power of old mainframes people in the mainstream of computing are finally beginning to realize that microprocessor based computers are not large multiuser timesharing systems. They are beginning to think about using something other than the old software for large multiuser timesharing computers where things were done in batch mode and real-time response for the one user of the computer was not the idea. A very different approach to software, Forth, is about a year older than Unix. It was designed to use a virtual machine concept and to get high performance by doing things as simply and quickly as possible. Forth become most popular on small, resource starved microprocessor based computes where it could provide high performance. On small machines that simply were not big enough or compilcated enough to run 'C' and Unix effectively very high performance could be achieved in Forth. These small machines that were not big enough for Unix and one user could support hundreds of users like the large timeshareing systems. This was possible because the idea of the design was to reduce as much overhead as possible to get the fastest context switches and multitasking possible. Forth's performance is so much higher than popular mainstream software on this that many people have dismissed it as too good to be true. Forth became somewhat of a niche language used by people in engineering to get some combination of the fastest development, smallest code footprint, and fastest realtime response possible. For the most part most languages are specialized in what they do and are good at and don't directly compete with one another too much for a specific niche. But Forth and 'C' have some things in common and are both often viable choices for language when ease of development, portability and performance are the goals. Forth can also act as its own operating system and so also provides an alternative to Unix for some things where Unix is too big or too slow to be practical. Forth has been widely used in a lot of embedded applications, and it has been particularly successful in high performance, and mission critical embedded applications where there is no operator to fix runtime errors and where old multiuser software models just cannot provide the needed performance or reliability. The Forth virtual machine and common multitasking implementation strategies provide the fastest context switches, interrupt handling, and threading of any enviroment. Typically only a few register need be swapped or copied to and from memory in Forth. This is in strong contrast to 'C' and Unix environments where these things are typcialy far more involved. In discussions between Unix and Forth programmers the former will be talking about milliseconds while the latter will be talking about microseconds. In other contexts the former will be talking microseconds and the latter will be talking nanoseconds. The Plan 9 document from Bell Labs explains that they are seeking a higher level of performance in Plan 9 than that delivered by Unix on the same machine. I have added the timings available in Forth to the table. One should note the microsecond vs nanosecond units. Performance

Test            IRIX    Plan 9   Forth
Context switch  150us   39us     120ns
System call     36us    6us      60ns
Light fork      2200us  1300us   100ns
Pipe latency    200us   100us    100ns Of course this dramatic one hundred to one, or one thousand to one, ratio is only part of the full picture. The full picture involves other issues like using standard "canned" code solutions. When programming is difficult and performance is not important these are important issues. The reduction in the overal complexity in the Forth approach can make the programming much easier and faster and deliver performance. Our experience is that when done properly writing code is not only easier than finding and pasting other people's code from a library, but faster, cheaper, higher performance and easier to debug and maintain. Forth has a long history of competing with 'C' and Unix on many projects. We have many examples of Forth coming to the rescue of projects where 'C' just could not do what was needed. We have many examples where the smaller team of Forth programmers finished the project much faster than the larger team of 'C' programmers. The typcial ratio in required man-months is about ten to one. There are also many examples where the resultant code generated in 'C' was simply too slow or too big or too power hungry to meet the application requirements and where Forth came to the rescue. When people are only exposed to large timesharing computer methods these are the only methods that they are aware of or consider using. If they hear about a different approach that can deliver programs in one tenth the time or cost, and deliver much higher performance they will tend to be very skeptical. They may have a very hard time understanding these other methods if they have never been exposed to anything outside the mainstream popluar software enviroments that even the folks from Bell Labs who invented it describe as "an old timesharing system." In that same document on Plan 9 they go on to say, "The problems with UNIX were too deep to fix, ..." Besides software another factor in the computing equation is hardware. People facing a given computer platform often think of the hardware as something that is fixed and not one of the variables in the computing equation. This is often the case in the desktop environment where the a programmer may be facing a particular machine. But 98% of the microprocessors made do not go into desktop machines but rather go into embedded computer applications. 98% of computers are embedded computers where the cost of the hardware is far more important than the cost of the software because the cost of software is spread accross many units. In these machines it is vital that the software be fast and efficient so that the device can meet its require specifications with a minimal amount of hardware. The attitude in the desktop environment is often that program size or speed are not important because more memory and a faster processor is a cheap investment. In embedded applications the goal is zero cost or zero power consumption. Minimizing the cost of the hardware, the size of the hardware, and the efficiency of the software is most of the game. This is where Forth has traditionally been able to most effectively compete. Instead of upgrading the hardware from a $100 processor to a $500 processor to make up for inefficient software the goal in Forth is often to make the software so efficient that the same job can be done with a $10 processor. If you want to sell a lot of widgets making them work with 1/10th or 1/50th as expensive hardware will be a big advantage. In this area Forth has a special advantage. For the last fifteen years people have been developing Forth hardware based on the same concepts that made Forth work so well in software. These machines can be incredibly small, cheap an low power. For the most part the manufacture cost and power requirement for a microprocessor will be proportional to the number of transistors int he design. Traditional small designs had low performance and to increase performanc and deliver the features that the 'C' compilers wanted to exploit the machines got bigger and bigger until they drarfed the mainframes from the old days. Intel's first introduced the 4004 microprocessor in 1971 and it had only 2300 transistors and only performed 60 thousand instructions per second. By 8086 they were up to 29 thousand transistors and performance was up to 330 thousand instructions per second. Today Intel is up to 28 million transitors and approaching a billion instructions a second. They have increased transistor count by a factor of one thousand and performace by even more. But one must remember that for 98% of the computers made the goal is zero cost or zero power consumption and that cost and power consumption are proportial to the transistor count. The first machine to use the Forth language as its instruction set was intoduced in 1985. The Novix microprocessor used only 4000 transistors yet it was considerably faster than the fastest Intel chip at the time, 80386, on many realtime problems. Today we have machines that run at speeds compeditive with the current Intel machines on our problems, but which have fewer transistors than the antique 8086. The idea is to reduce the hardware cost and power consumption by a factor of 1000 over conventional designs for executing Forth programs. While many other people insist that effiency and cost are not longer issues with personal computers the people working in embedded computers know that all computers have limited memory and limited computing power. Our goal is to minimize cost, power consumption and to maximize performance, efficiency, and the effectiveness of the development effort. When we try to explain what we are doing, to reduce the cost of hardare by a factor of 1000 and increase efficency of software by a similar factor by using Forth instead of Unix and 'C' we are usually immediately dismissed with some comment like "I don't want to get into a language war." It seems that sticking with what they know, and not even considering an alternative, is more important to them than anything else. They will not even consider the possibility that there could be way to improve the performance/price factor by about one million. I haven't talked about Microsoft's software on Intel's hardware. The Unix folks think efficiency and reliabilty are important when they compare Unix and MS software. They enjoy a much more stable and higher performance environment than those using the Microsoft alternative. To bring Microsoft's approach to software into the equation means more zeros since they are much slower and less efficient in their software than Unix. Microsoft's software makes using an old timeshareing operating system on a PC look really great in comparison. In conclusion the world of computing is much larger than Microsoft, Unix, and Forth combined. There are embedded systems ranging from tiny four bit processors that resemble the first microprocessor ever made to multiprocessors with the largest processors avialable. In addition to embedded computing there are handheld computers, wearable comptures, laptop computers, desktop computers, network servers, minicomputers, mainframe computers and supercomputers. Each have their own characteristics and no single operating system or programming language is ideal over the whole range of macines and application domains. Jeff Fox 7/24/00

The best new tech from IFA 2016 Technology Monday 5 September 2016 - 1:12pm A visitor looks at screens at the IFA Electronics show in Berlin, Germany September 2, 2016. Photo: Reuters/STEFANIE LOOS JOHANNESBURG  - The Internationale Funkausstellung, more commonly known as IFA, is Europe’s biggest consumer electronics and home appliances show. IFA is not as well-known as the CES electronic show, or the Mobile World Congress, but some of the best product launches take place at IFA. eNCA.com put together a list of some of the most impressive product launches from the 2016 exhibition. 1. Acer Swift 7 Ultra thin, ultra powerful. Introducing the world's thinnest laptop: the Acer Swift 7. #nextatacer pic.twitter.com/poTEa4lkLd — Acer (@Acer) September 1, 2016 The Acer Swift 7 is only 9.98mm thick and Acer claims that it is the first laptop to get below 1cm. Despite its slimness, the Swift 7 does not compromise on computing power. It features a 13.3-inch Full HD screen protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass (not touch screen), a claimed nine-hour battery life, Windows 10, updated Core i5-Y series processor from Intel, 256 SSD with 8GB RAM, HD webcam, and Two USB Type-C ports. Take that, MacBook Air. The Swift 7 has a starting price of $999; no word on local pricing. 2. Withings Steel HR Meet Steel HR: The first analog watch with heart rate monitoring. #WatchYourHeart #IFA2016 https://t.co/dxz0H0JULS pic.twitter.com/PF2p0cTu1q — Withings (@Withings) September 1, 2016 Nokia-owned Withings released what has to be the sleekest smartwatch to make it out of IFA 2016. While many manufacturers try to fit as much as possible into the watch shape to make a smartwatch, Withings took a different route, keeping everything we like about analogue watches and fitting a small screen for all the “smart’ capabilities of the watch. The screen will display information such as steps taken, calories burnt, distance travelled and your heart rate during activities thanks to an optical heart rate monitor. Best of all, the watch does not get push notifications and the battery will last for 20 days on one charge. The standard 36mm Steel HR costs $179.95 and the 40mm is $199.95. 3. LG Smart InstaView Fridge There's a good knock-knock joke waiting to happen with this new LG InstaView fridge: https://t.co/nbSRmv72iL pic.twitter.com/VbeIh9dkRb — CNET Smart Home (@CNETSmartHome) August 23, 2016 This is one of those things you don’t know you need it until you use it. The LG Smart InstaView fridge sports a 29-inch translucent touchscreen and it runs Windows 10. Being powered by Windows 10 means you can access all kinds of Windows Apps on it, like the kids' favourite Windows Paint. LG offers its own apps that will allow you to do all sort of things like set timers, stick notes, add recipes, get information about the ingredients in the fridge, and mark food so you know when it is to expire or run out. 4. Philips OLED 901F Series The 901F series is Phillips’ first OLED TV and it is beautiful. It features a 55-inch 4k OLED display, the Ultra HD brings vibrant colour and darker blacks, and it also sports HDR, so pretty much standard stuff. To make sure that its first OLED TV stands out from the crowd Phillips has added a feature called Ambilight, which lights up the surface behind the TV to match the colours of the display. It looks awesome and does actually add to the immersive experience.  5. Lenovo Yoga Book ON DEMAND KEYBOARD & a pen w/ 2048 levels of pressure...need we say more? #LenovoLaunch https://t.co/HGZtWJuwNH pic.twitter.com/pxYh4iScmU — Lenovo (@lenovo) August 31, 2016 The Yoga Book is a tablet like no other. It looks more like a laptop than a tablet, but Lenovo insists it is a tablet.  It features a 10.1-inch Full HD touch display, Intel x5 CPU, 64GB internal storage with the option to expand and 4GB RAM. It can run Android Marshmallow or Windows 10. What makes this device stand out, though, is its keyboard -- or lack thereof. The Yoga Book ditches the traditional keyboard for a touch surface. A feature called Halo Keyboard with haptic feedback will feature when you want to type in some documents. - Sthembiso Lebuso eNCA Comment Now!

Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 06, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Samsung made a surprise release of the Galaxy TabPro S premium hybrid tablet during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2016 in January this year. It is another tablet indeed from the Korean tech giant but what made it different from its other tablet lines is the fact that it is Windows 10-based. All the tablets of the Korean tech giant, regardless whether they are high end or mid-range, are running on Android for its operating system. It also came out as a surprise, especially to Microsoft, since the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S was a direct competition to its Surface Pro line of hybrid tablets. It has been barely nine months since the Korean tech giant’s hybrid tablet came out of the market but reports are now rife that its predecessor, called as the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S2, is about to hit the market soon. While there are still no dates given, the rumors are saying that it could come out any time before the end of the year. But it is also possible that it may come out in January next year to give the Galaxy TabPro S time to complete its one-year market cycle. Four models for the new device Reports have it that the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S2 will have four models when it comes out in the market. As they are still in the development stages, they are reportedly being referred to as SM-W728, SM-W727, SM-W723, and SM-W720, reports the Christian Today. There are no details about the specifications of each model but reports, rumors, and speculations going around online about the device appear to focus on one model alone. There are also speculations saying that the different models may be different devices with different hardware specifications or different geographical locations. Accordingly, the Galaxy TabPro S2 will feature a 12-inch Super AMOLED screen with 2160 x 1440 screen resolution. It shall also be powered by the latest offering of Intel with its Core M series processing chip. It is also expected that the device will feature LTE connectivity. The rumored features of the Galaxy TabPro S2 were primarily based on the hardware found under the hood of its predecessor including a 12-inch Super AMOLED touchscreen display, Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor featuring Turbo Boost Technology, Intel HD Graphics 515, 4GB of DDR3L RAM, and 128GB of solid-state drive for storage. The device also sports a USB Type-C 3.1 port, headphones/microphone input combination, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a 5-megapixel rear camera, dual-band Wi-Fi adaptor, Bluetooth 4.1, and a 5,200 mAh battery that can last up to 10.5 hours of continued usage. It also includes a detachable keyboard. A special version of the device called the Galaxy TabPro S Signature Edition black is currently being offered at the Microsoft Store for $749. The special version model does not contain any third-party trial software. In order to lure more takers for the device, the Microsoft Store actually threw in a free Hulu subscription for three months and a NuVision 8-inch tablet while supplies last for their special offer. Users want a better keyboard As a premium hybrid tablet, the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S based on Windows 10 was a great device for the working professionals the way others are being served by the Microsoft Surface Pro lines and the Apple iPad Pro line. However, users felt that there is plenty to be desired on the keyboard of the Galaxy TabPro S which they want to see improved on the Galaxy TabPro S2. The keyboard cover on the Galaxy TabPro S was attached only with a very weak magnet. If a user, for instance, set the tablet up in a laptop mode and begins to jostle things, it could result in the hybrid tablet falling flat on its back or its face smacking the ground first, notes Digital Trends.

Blog :  Dell EMC CTO Envisions Rise of Smarter Hybrid Cloud Apps Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar What I’m Looking for at IBM Edge: A Touch of Amazing Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 05 Sep, 2016          |         |     Share Building High-Growth IT: 5 Things to Know Now I’m not a huge fan of vendor events, largely because I go to a lot of them and, after a wave of them, I tend to be a homesick mess. That isn’t true of IBM Edge, however, because this event tends to embody much of what makes IBM a company to admire. From the name, which speaks to how the company is developing technology to give its customers an “edge,” to content that spans from infrastructure to AI, Edge is one of the few shows that captures the heart of the large enterprise. Given that this show is coming up on September 19, I thought I’d share what I’m looking forward to seeing. Infrastructure IBM is really the only company that seems to make a big deal out of infrastructure. Most other companies are focused on hardware and software. What gets lost is the fact that all of that stuff generally needs a flexible infrastructure that can make it work. Often, in my experience, the reason a new technology fails in a shop is because it simply will not plug in to what is already there and interoperate properly. IBM has turned fixing this into a line of business and it’s interesting that not only is this business doing very well, but it remains relatively unique in the market. I find it fascinating that this focus remains unique to the company. Power IBM remains the only company that is pushing an alternative to x86 at scale, virtually exclusively. IBM's approach is unique in that it seems to have given the technology away by creating the Open Power consortium, which it did in order to get the kind of penetration it needs to challenge x86. IBM’s success has come largely from more tightly targeting large-scale opportunities and creating partnerships like the one with NVIDIA that Intel has been unwilling to match. I’ll be looking for advances and unique solutions in both Big Data analytics and high-performance computing, where the firm’s efforts have made advances. I’ll also be looking for advances in things like mixed technology water cooling, well, because I’m a geek and just find that stuff really cool. Watson Watson remains the only focused AI effort at enterprise scale that is sold as a line of business. IBM was really first to this concept with Watson and I think that whoever gets this right first will likely own the next wave of computing. A lot of focus initially was on what Watson could do. But the cost and time to train the system initially was massive. IBM has been working to automate this training and vastly reduce the resources needed to bring a Watson system into service. I’ll be looking to see what kind of progress it has made and whether it can stay ahead of smaller firms like BeyondCore and internal efforts like Google’s, which are coming up very quickly. I’ll also be looking to see how IBM is using this technology internally for competitive advantage. (I’m a huge fan of checking to see if a firm uses what it sells to advantage.) Wrapping Up: Getting the Edge IBM is a fascinating company. It really is the only modern tech company working on its second century of life and it remains unique with its infrastructure, power and Watson efforts. I’m looking forward to catching up with old friends and maybe, just maybe, one of these days Watson itself may be one of them. I think the world could become a better place if we all made better decisions, and that’s really what IBM, Edge, and particularly Watson are all about.

Both Lenovo and Apple packed powerful specs and a slew of unique features in the devices.  ( Lenovo ) Advertisement Lenovo's Yoga Book has brought to life some pretty futuristic looking technologies, but the gadget might see fierce competition from the purported 2016 MacBook Air. We took the info we have about the two devices and pitted them one against another so you know what to expect. Display Yoga Book does not break ground with its screen, which sports a Full HD resolution of 1,920 x 1,200p. In all fairness, the IPS touchscreen display of 10.1 inches could be better, as brightness only reaches 400 nits and the screen can cover a color gamut of 70 percent. Lenovo's challenger, the rumored MacBook Air from 2016, is said to come packing a Retina Display. The present model packs a 13.3-inch screen able of displaying resolutions of 1,440 x 900p. Insiders say that the upcoming variant of the MacBook Air should have an LED-backlit monitor with a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440p. Hardware The Yoga Book managed to holster a number of powerful specs in a very thin laptop, with a noteworthy 10 millimeters of thickness. This means the 2-in-1 will follow the steps of the MacBook Air 2016, which sources say could be even thinner. Both devices are sturdy and resistant to shocks, despite their thin and elegant construction. What is more, the MacBook Air could pack the next iteration of solid state drive, meaning that it will pack Fusion Drive hybrid support. This will make Apple's laptop superior to Lenovo's gadget, which only holsters a 64 GB storage option, albeit expandable with a microSD card. Taking a leaf out of the latest MacBook design, this year's MacBook Air will feature the good for all USB Type-C port. Meanwhile, the Yoga Book comes with a microUSB port, a headphone jack and a mini-HDMI. Looking at processing power, the MacBook Air 2016 might overapass the Yoga Book. Apple's device is rumored to sport the Intel Skylake i5 CPU, which benchmarked higher than the Intel X5 processor found in Lenovo's laptop. Both devices rely on 4 GB of RAM to back the processing power, but the MacBook Air could offer the possibility for extra RAM. One thing to keep in mind is that the Lenovo Yoga Book can easily transform into a tablet in its own right by rotating the monitor 360 degrees. Unique Features One area where Lenovo stepped into the future is its touch keyboard, dubbed the Halo keyboard. Lenovo turned the standard keyboard into a flat, LED-backlit blank surface slate with matte finish. The surface acts pretty much like a tablet, and some insiders from Apple touted that the MacBook Air 2016 could also feature a similar asset. A neat addition to the Yoga Book is the ability to use the keyboard slate as a drawing/writing surface for the stylus. With a full 2,048 pressure levels and a maximum of 100 degrees of angle, the slate is clearly targeted toward creative users. Keep in mind that if you use the pen to take notes on normal paper, the content can get transferred to the Yoga Book. Software On the software side of things, you should know that Apple will embed the latest laptop OS in the MacBook Air 2016, so users who are used to El Capitan will make a move toward macOS Sierra in this year's laptop. Meanwhile, the Yoga Book offers users two options, so whether you prefer Windows 10 or Android Marshmallow is entirely up to you.

In other news the Razer Blade Stealth has got an Intel Kaby Lake update, and the Razer Blade 14-inch gaming laptop has been updated with Nvidia Pascal graphics. Razer Ornata Razer has launched the Ornata range of gaming keyboards. As you will have read in the intro, these keyboards feature hybrid membrane and mechanical keyswitches. Razer claims this is a "world's first" but I think some Fujitsu keyboards mixed up membrane and mechanical technologies back in the early 90s. (I used to own one of the Fujitsu FKB4700 keyboards, connected to my Amiga CD32 SX1 expansion.) Years of research by Razer found that "users choose membrane rubber dome keyboards for comfort, while mechanical switches are favoured for fast actuations and distinct tactile feedback." Thus it decided to put these two technologies together for "the best of both worlds". The "revolutionary patent pending Razer Mecha-Membrane," is the result and Razer has employed its mid-height keycaps for a particularly good hybrid keyboard action. The first Ornata keyboard is the Razer Ornata Chroma which features the company's individually backlit keys driven by Razer Chroma technology. Gamers get 16.8 million colours and a range of effects which can sync across Razer devices. Lighting profiles can be created, shared and used to enhance games such as Overwatch, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Blade and Soul, and others. A single colour backlight version of the Razer Ornata will also be sold (green LED backlighting). Razer's Ornata Chroma costs US$99.99/ €109.99 / £99.99, and the single colour Ornata isUS$79.99/ €89.99 / £79.99. You can pre-order these keyboards now for October release. Razer Blade / Blade Stealth The 14-inch Razer Blade gaming laptop now benefits from the faster and more efficient Nvidia Pascal GPU architecture. Razer has paired an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5) with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core processor as the foundation of this portable PC gaming system. We saw "the ultimate Ultrabook", the Razer Blade Stealth, launched at CES in January and now Razer has updated it for greater processing potency and efficiency. As you would expect from the timing, following shortly after the release of the first wave of Intel Kaby Lake processors for mobile PCs, Razer has boosted its 12.5- inch thin and light gaming laptop with a 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processor. The new processor is joined by a higher capacity battery which can last up to 9 hours on a single charge.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Macbook Pro 2016 vs. Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Specs, Upgrades, Price and Release Date—Which One is Better? By Krixia Zhienelle Subingsubing Sep 4, 2016 | 10:42 PM Looks like the last quarter of 2016 is jam-packed with top-notch devices making their way into the arena, especially with the debut of so many innovative new technologies at the Internationale Funkausstellung (IFA) consumer electronics trade show in Berlin this month. However, tech fans are particularly looking forward to the clash of two Pros: Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 and Apple's MacBook Pro 2016, which are expected to launch within a month of each other. Both brands are well-known for their top tier specs, further amping up the hype for the highly anticipated laptops. With the competition coming up stiff, which device would give you better worth for your money? Let the battle begin! Hardware and specs In terms of specs, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 gains the upper hand with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors versus the MacBook Pro 2016's Skylake processors. The Microsoft Surface Pro also comes in two screen variants: the 2K and the 4K, and reportedly packs a 3840 x 2160 pixel density. Reports also speculate that the Microsoft Surface Pro will either use a Polaris-based (AMD) or a Pascal-based (NVIDIA) graphics processor. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit On the other hand, the MacBook Pro 2016's specs include a new OLED touch bar that acts like a customizable set of software keys in lieu of function keys, NFC chip technology, and new Touch ID fingerprint scanning. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also expected to pack a 2304 x 1440 HD resolution. Though unlike the Surface Pro, it's unlikely to support 4K. Upgrades and other features Another speculation is that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could lose the 4A battery-powered stylus in favor of an upgraded Surface Pen, which is usually bundled with Surface Pro tablets. The upgraded Surface Pen is juiced up by a rechargeable alkaline AAAA battery that allows it to charge wirelessly when it is magnetically attached to the tablet, or in this case, the surface laptop. Not to be outdone, the MacBook Pro 2016 also has the Apple Pencil, which is also used in the iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is focused on touchscreen interactions, which powered speculations that the MacBook Pro 2016 is going to have a touchscreen display. In its patent, the Apple Pencil uses a three or six-axis sensor to act like an air mouse or joystick. Both laptops are rumored to have the USB Type C ports as well as upgraded camera, WiFi, and bluetooth connectivity specs. Prices and release dates Both devices are definitely expensive. The Surface Pro 5 is estimated to start at $900, with an i7 Extreme version at $1,600. It is expected to launch either October or early 2017. As for the MacBook Pro 2016, if history is to repeat itself, then it's likely to cost the same at $1,099, since the MacBook Air launched at almost the same price. It is expected to launch alongside the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on September 7. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, News and Updates: What to Expect in the New Model; Rumored Specs, Features and Price By Christian Ver Marcelo Sep 4, 2016 | 9:16 PM The rumor mill has been stirring up with rumors regarding Apple's upcoming MacBook Pro 2016. Apple fans have been anticipating new innovations and drastic changes, as opposed to previous minute upgrades in the form factor. Form Factor Shallower curves around the edges are to be expected. This would then give the new MacBook Pro a sleeker overall design. It will also give off the impression of a smaller footprint, which would be ideal for the devices for an optimal screen to body ratio. Apple is also reportedly using specialized hinges for the new laptops. This would allow them to have a thinner overall form factor, which consequently makes for a lighter, more portable device. Variants Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The MacBook Pro lineup has always come in variations. The 13- and 15-inch models would still be offered. In addition to display sizes, Apple may also offer variations in color, that being space gray, silver, and rose gold. Input The most interesting rumored technology coming to the MacBook Pro would have to be the OLED display touch bar sitting on top of the familiar keyboard. This touch bar is said to be replacing the age-old F functions above the number keys. This would also be fully customizable by the end user to suit whatever task or shortcut is needed. The controls will also adapt to whatever program is opened, so music controls would show if a music app is opened, for example. There is also talk going around that the next gen MacBook Pro would feature a touchscreen display. With 2-in-1 devices flooding the market and the Surface Book being its toughest Microsoft competitor, making the display touchscreen capable and ultimately detachable would shake up the competition. Touch ID and Next Gen SSDs Touch ID has now become the standard initial security measure of many Apple devices. Being the highest-end of Apple's laptop range, the MacBook Pro is said to adopt the technology. It will be integrated to the power buttons, so powering on with one touch makes logging in safer and easier. Also, with the MacBook Pro being marketed for its performance, lightning fast SSDs are predicted to be included. Intel's new Optane SSDs could make an appearance on the next gen lineup, but could also still be combined with the Fusion Drive hybrid technology. Processors Intel's new top-of-the-line Skylake chips would be powering most of the MacBook Pro models. This will give the laptops enough juice to power through any task. Also, models with powerful graphic processing would most likely pack the AMD Polaris. USB-C The first implementation of the USB-C in the MacBook last year was met with outrage due to the singular port for the whole device. The same technology is also rumored to be coming to the MacBook, allowing for faster data transfer speeds. While this would be a good idea, more than one port should be incorporated, as this port would be used for charging the device. MacOS Sierra The new universal operating system for Mac devices will be adopting the macOS Sierra out of the box. This software environment gives users a lot more features, accessibility options, and innovations for a more secure, customizable, and productive device. Price and Release Date For the price, Apple may stick to its already established range for the MacBook Pro lineup. The previous iteration 13-inch non-Retina display variant starts at $1,099, topping out at a thousand bucks more for the highest-end 15-inch Retina display variant. The premium pricing would be of good value though, given the lineup's upgraded specs. It is also expected to be released at the fourth quarter of 2016, nearing the end of October or early November.

Apple at IFA 2016 Apple notoriously doesn't have a presence at IFA, or any other trade show for that matter. It does normally steal some of the limelight back with its own event around the time of IFA though. Don't expect anything from Apple at IFA itself but the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and possibly even a third iPhone are expected to be announced within a couple of days of the show. A dedicated Apple event has been scheduled for 7 September in San Francisco. You can read all the rumours for the next iPhone and the third iPhone in our separate features. Asus at IFA 2016 Asus held its press conference on Wednesday 31 August at IFA and its biggest announcement came in the guise of the ZenWatch 3. Asus The smartwatch is the first from the brand to be round, so now matches rivals like the Samsung Gear 2 and Huawei device. It is also thin and comes in three finishes: gunmetal, silver and rose gold. Asus claims that the cold-forged steel build makes it 82 per cent stronger than stainless steel equivalents. Asus ZenWatch 3 preview: Android Wear marches on Asus Zenwatch 3 is here, it's round and charges stupendously fast Other highlights from Asus include the ZenBook 3 - an Intel Core i7 powered device that's just 11.9mm thick - and the Transformer 3 and Transformer 3 Pro. The latter two are ultra-slim 2-in-1 PCs with high resolution displays that as effectively double as laptops as Surface-rivalling tablets, all now hitting Europe. The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 is worth a shout about too, with its 9.7-inch 2048 x 1536 screen and super-slim bezel. The surround measures just 5.3mm. Asus ZenPad 3S 10: Hello iPad lookalike DJI at IFA 2016 Drone company DJI used IFA 2016 to unveil a device that many have been waiting for, the DJI Osmo Mobile. Pocket-lint This device is based on the Osmo released in 2015, but removes the camera. Instead, it invites you to add your own phone and then provides a range of stabilisation and control options to ensure you get nice smooth video. DJI Osmo Mobile: Make incredible buttery-smooth videos with your smartphone Fitbit at IFA 2016 Fitbit announced a successor to the Flex and Charge, with the launch of the Fitbit Flex 2 and the Fitbit Charge 2. They build on the success of the existing wearables, shifting up the design to be more modern and adding smartphone notifications, so do a little more. Fitbit The Flex will now feature four coloured LEDs to give you these alerts and Fitbit is changing its positioning slightly, with a range of accessories so you can wear it as a pendant instead. Fitbit updates activity tracker lineup with new Charge 2 and Flex 2 Fitbit Flex 2 review: Simple, stylish tracking Fitbit Charge 2 review: Taking charge Fossil  Fossil used IFA 2016 to show off the fully working versions of a number of new smartwatches. Announced previously at Baselworld 2016, the new Android Wear watches will span a number of brands, the biggest perhaps being Michael Kors. Pocket-lint The Michael Kors Access picks up on some of the brand's most popular designs and makes things connected, giving you Kors looks paired with smart functions. There will be plenty of customisation options, as well as compatibility with Android and iOS devices. Michael Kors Access: Super sexy smartwatches Aside from the Kors branded devices, Fossil is launching a number of its own smartwatches. The Fossil Marshal and Wander offer a couple of different styles, but again are based on Android wear.  The important thing about these devices - coming from a fashion watch brand - is that they feel really good to wear, offering a design that's a lot better executed than many of the previous Android Wear rivals. Fossil Q Marshal and Wander preview: Doing Android Wear right  Garmin at IFA 2016 Prior to IFA officially starting, Garmin announced two new products: a refresh of its running sportswatch and a 4K action camera to rival GoPro. Garmin The Garmin Forerunner 35 is the latest iteration of its running tracker, which can also be used for cycling and even as a smartwatch, thanks to notifications and music control support. It features GPS and, for the first time, a heart rate monitor that can provide more accurate data on how you perform during a run. It'll be available this quarter in four colours - black, limelight, frost blue and white - priced at £169.99. Garmin Forerunner 35 adds heart rate monitoring to line-up The Garmin Virb Ultra 30 is already starting to roll out globally and offers 4K video shooting at 30fps. It comes with a waterproof case and touchscreen LCD, plus Garmin's own editing software. It retails for £449.99 in the UK. Garmin Virb Ultra 30 takes on GoPro Hero4 Black with 4K thrills of its own Garmin also added a new edition of the Fenix 3 sports watch. Called the Chronos, this premium edition model offers titanium or stainless steel bodies, with a metal link or leather strap. The aim is to give you something good looking that's as suited to the office as it is to the mountains. It's expensive though, with a £1099 price on the titanium model. Garmin Fenix Chronos is about as smart as sportswatches get HTC at IFA 2016 Announced to coincide with IFA 2016, the HTC One A9s is an updated version of the company's mid-range smartphone. And yes, it still looks a lot like an iPhone - even more so perhaps, now that the camera unit has shifted to the left-hand corner. HTC It has a metal rear casing and an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor. There's a 720p screen and 13-megapixel rear camera. A 5-megapixel snapper is mounted on the front. While the specifications are reasonable, if not "spec"tacular, the One A9s shouldn't break the bank and could be a good option for those on a budget. HTC One A9s official: Updated metal mid-ranger drops display to 720p Huawei at IFA 2016 Although there were plenty of rumours ahead of the show suggesting the Huawei Mate 9 would make an appearance, it wasn't part of the Chinese company's IFA announcements in the end. Instead, a couple of mid-range handsets made their debut: the Huawei Nova and Nova Plus. Pocket-lint They are 5- and 5.5-inch handsets respectively, with the smaller of the two sharing similar design aesthetics to the Huawei-made Nexus 6P. Strangely, the Plus model looks more like Huawei's own G8 handset from last year. Both phones do have the same specs though, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and microSD support in each. The Plus offers an uprated camera with 16-megapixels and OIS. They will hit mainland Europe first, in October, and then roll out to other countries in time. Huawei Nova: A mid-range smartphone repositioning with 5-inch and 5.5-inch Plus handsets Huawei Nova preview: Channelling Nexus 6P design into the mid-range Huawei Nova Plus: An elegantly built mid-range challenger Huawei also announced an 8.4-inch tablet, the MediaPad M3 - effectively designed to play media and play media well. Its light, good looking and comes with AKG earbuds in the box. It'll be available from 26 September starting at 349 euros. Huawei MediaPad M3 review: An unfussy Android media tablet Lenovo at IFA 2016 Lenovo announced a range of Yoga and Miix devices at the show, but the most interesting is the Lenovo Yoga Book. Pocket-lint This innovative loses the keyboard, instead offering a Halo Keyboard. This will learn your hand positioning and help you correct mistakes when typing, but also supporting the included stylus, meaning you can sketch or draw too. It really is unique. Lenovo Yoga Book preview: The keyless laptop from the future has landed LG at IFA 2016 LG had a rather low profile at IFA 2016, with few announcements - with the most exciting thing being the huge OLED tunnel to enter its stand. Apart from that it used its press conference to essentially confirm that its Signature products - the 77-inch OLED TV, refrigerator, washing machine et al - are all coming to Europe. LG It did unveil two new 21:9 ultra-wide monitors for computer use, which is a fast-growing sector, especially for gaming. The two curved models are the 38-inch UltraWide 38UC99 and 34-inch 144Hz IPS Curved UltraWide 34UC79G respectively. The latter is especially good for games thanks to the superfast refresh rate. The 38UC99 has a staggering more-than 4K resolution of 3840 x 1600. Motorola at IFA 2016 Although we didn't expect Lenovo-owned Motorola to unveil any new smartphones during this IFA it surprised us with a new variant of the Moto Z that will wing its way to Europe. Pocket-lint The Moto Z Play is a 5.5-inch device, with a Full HD display and mighty 3,519mAh battery that is claimed to last up to 50 hours. It sports a 2.05GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB of RAM and 16-megapixel front-facing camera for those who can't get enough of high res selfies. You can expect to pay around £450 when it hits stores soon. Motorola Moto Z Play preview: Moto Mods meet mega battery life The Motorola team also showcased the Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod at IFA, which transforms the Moto Z into a proper camera. It has a lens that starts at 25mm equivalent, which can stretch to 250mm equivalent, but aperture is sacrificed (f/3.5 to f/6.5). It'll cost you £199 when it arrives. Hasselblad True Zoom preview: The 10x optical zoom Moto Mod is finally here Panasonic at IFA 2016 Apart from some kitchen appliances - IFA is a general consumer electronics show after all - Panasonic announced that it is looking to move into the OLED TV market some time in the future. It is showcasing a prototype OLED telly, but is keen to match the reference status of some of its existing sets before unleashing it as a consumer product. It is stunning, however, so we have high hope for it in 2017. Panasonic 4K OLED TV for 2017 is coming - and looks like it'll be a stunner Pocket-lint In addition, the company has added a new 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player to its line-up as a more affordable option. The Panasonic UB700 player will still cost around 500 euros, but will feature much of the premium picture processing that is seldom found in rivals. Panasonic UB700 4K UHD Blu-ray player takes on Samsung UBD-K8500 in price wars Philips at IFA 2016 Philips revealed that it is moving into the OLED TV market, with the 55-inch Philips 901F. Philips It is, claims the company, the world's first 4K OLED TV with Ambilight, which is no surprise considering the latter is a Philips-only technology. However, it also comes with an integrated 6.1 sound system and quad-core processor to run Android TV speedily and effectively. The set has HDR picture tech, so ticks all the future-proofing boxes. The Ambilight is three-sided, which means you get ambient LED lighting beamed onto the wall behind the TV to the left, right and above. The colours match the action on screen.  We have no indication yet as to when the 901F might hit stores, nor price, but it'll definitely be worth a viewing when it does. Philips 901F 4K OLED TV with Ambilight is as beautiful as it is capable Samsung at IFA 2016 Samsung held its traditional IFA media event on the Wednesday night ahead of the show and it entirely focused on new smartwatch, the Samsung Gear S3. Two models were announced, with different styles for different types of user. Pocket-lint The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier is a more rugged device, which looks like the bolder, chunkier watches worn by adventurers and divers. The Gear S3 Classic is a touch slimmer and more sleek in look. Both are IP68 waterproof and dustproof, have built-in GPS and 360 x 360 pixel circular, always-on Super AMOLED screens. They are compatible with standard 22mm watch bands so you can change the look to suit whenever you fancy. Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch: Release date, specs and everything you need to know Samsung Gear S3 preview: The final Frontier for smartwatches? Samsung Gear S3 Frontier vs S3 Classic: What's the difference? Sony at IFA 2016 Sony usually has a stack of stuff to show at IFA and this year is no exception. Not only did it announce a new waterproof smartphone, plus a smaller, cheery device, but it expanded its audio products and threw in a few surprises during its press conference to boot. Pocket-lint The Sony Xperia XZ arrives to sit at the very top of Sony's "X" phone range and it's an impressive beast, with a headline-grabbing 23-megapixel rear camera. It also has a 13-megapixel snapper at the front and comes with USB Type-C connectivity. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, with 3GB of RAM, and it comes in 32GB or 64GB storage flavours. A 5.2-inch Full HD display, fingerprint sensor and water and dustproofing are also present. For those after something a little more pocketable, the Sony Xperia X Compact is a 4.6-inch 720p device, but has the same fingerprint sensor and, most importantly, 23-megapixel rear camera as the XZ, but is a step down into the mid-range, with an odd plastic build. They will both be available from October. Sony adds two more notches to its X Series bed post with Xperia XZ and X Compact Sony Xperia XZ preview: Sticking to what it knows Sony Xperia X Compact: It's Compact, Jim, but not as we know it Sony Xperia X Compact vs Z5 Compact vs Z3 Compact: What’s the difference? Sony's audio product line is being improved with MDR-1000X active noise cancelling over-ear headphones, which even upscale standard definition audio to higher res through built-in DSEE HX tech. And they are wireless, which is impressive for the category. Sony MDR-1000X preview: Quite simply phenomenal noise-cancelling headphones You might even fancy matching them with the new Sony NW-WM1Z Walkman. It is a high-end audio player that'll set you back €3,300, but everything, including the wire-braided Kimber Kable, has been designed to playback music at its best. The Sony NW-WM1Z is a €3300 Walkman for the audiophile generation The company will also unleash its concept Bluetooth earphones, the Xperia Ear, in November. They are more than music playback devices, they will also whisper information in your ears, through complete phone interaction. Sony Xperia Ear wants to be your discreet personal assistant, from November onwards And the Sony FDR-X3000R action camera has optical image stabilisation for 4K video and even high-speed recordings, to ensure your slow motion clips will be less jerky and judder-free. It'll cost £500 from November. Sony FDR-X3000R action cam offers OIS across all modes, including 4K and slow-mo TomTom at IFA 2016 TomTom revealed a whole host of products at the start of IFA 2016; sportwatches and satnavs galore. It is moving into the activity tracker market with the TomTom Touch, which has all the benefits of rival fitness devices but also measures body fat. It'll cost £129 when it is released later in September. TomTom Touch activity tracker monitors your body fat, not just your steps Pocket-lint The TomTom Spark 3 and Runner 3 sportswatches were also announced, with new route tracking features that use the compass and built-in GPS to trace your path. Plenty of different models will be available, including those that can play music through Bluetooth headphones, with the basic model Spark 3 starting at £119.99. A Cardio + Music version is now available for pre-order at £199.99. TomTom Spark 3 and Runner 3 let you explore on your runs with new route tracking feature TomTom's last sportswatch to be announced was the TomTom Adventurer, aimed at those into more extreme running, hiking or even snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding. It takes into account elevation as well as GPS location. It'll be available in October for £249.99. TomTom Adventurer is the sports watch for your snow sports, hiking and trail running For cars and other vehicles, TomTom unveiled a new range of Go satnavs, with Wi-Fi, smartphone notifications and even voice control through Siri, Google and Cortana (depending on your device). There was also a dedicated satnav for scooters, the TomTom Vio. And the TomTom Curfer links with a cars on-board diagnostics (OBD) system to send data to your smartphone, even turning the results into a form of game. TomTom Go adds Wi-Fi, smartphone notifications and Siri, Google, Cortana voice controls TomTom Vio is a satnav for scooters, to help you get where the funk you're going Gamification of driving: TomTom Curfer will deliver driving stats to improve your performance Withings at IFA 2016 Withings used the Berlin electronics show to off the Activité Steel HR. This latest version of Withing's - now part of Nokia - watch fuses analogue watch style with connected skills. It offers step tracking and heart rate monitoring, as well as offering a top display to give you smartphone notifications and other information.

Razer’s Stargazer webcam is finally ready for its close-up Stars, they come and go. Hayden Dingman (PC World (US online)) on 02 September, 2016 18:00 0 - - - - print email A long, long time ago, way back at CES 2016 in January, we wrote about the Razer Stargazer, a webcam marketed to “the Twitch/YouTube users.” Razer gave us all the specs, gave us a price, paraded it on the show floor—and then it disappeared for eight months, seemingly for no reason. But today it reemerges from whatever chrysalis or hell-portal it fell into, the same webcam but with a new (cheaper) price: $149. You can preorder the Stargazer now, with the first units shipping out in October. Gordon Mah Ung We’ll have a more extensive review once we get our hands on a Stargazer of our own, but I admit I’m intrigued by the idea. Razer’s Twitch/YouTube marketing is a bit opportunistic when the reality is just “It’s Intel’s laptop-locked RealSense tech adapted to a portable desktop form factor,” but opportunistic or not, it’s smart marketing. Not only does the Stargazer stream at 720p, 60 frames per second, but the RealSense tech allows for easy background removal. No longer do you need a hefty green screen setup to isolate your face from the rest of your messy bedroom. RealSense’s depth-sensing abilities will screen it out for you. That’s likely to be a huge deal not just for current streamers but up-and-comers, especially now that Razer dropped the price from $199 to $149. That’s not much more than the perennial favorite Logitech C920, and definitely less than the C920 plus a green screen. The rest of RealSense’s tech makes it over too, of course—facial recognition, gestures, Windows Hello, but I doubt many people will buy a Stargazer just for that grab bag. Those features are there if you want them, though. As I said, we’ll have a review of Stargazer’s capabilities soon. Can it really stop people from seeing my horrible bomb-blast of an apartment?

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets AMD's upcoming 64-threaded CPU based on Zen teased again AMD's upcoming Zen-based CPU teased again, rocking 32 cores and 64 threads of CPU power By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: Sep 5, 2016 5:29 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA AMD's upcoming Zen architecture continues to build hype, with the new Zen-based Naples processor having benchmarks leaked onto the web over the weekend.     The Geekbench database had a new addition with the codename for the platform teased as 2S1451A4VIHE4_29/14_N, which looks to be a dual-socket platform that can take two of AMD's next-gen Naples CPUs. Each CPU has 32 cores and 64 threads, meaning we will see 128-threaded systems in 2017 from AMD, running at 1.44GHz base, and 2.9GHz boost (at least for now, these clocks could improve with time).     Each CPU complex has 4 cores with 8MB of L3 cache, which means the 32-core variant will feature up to 64MB of L3 cache, which means Intel might have something to worry about in 2017. The motherboard used was codenamed "AMD Corporation Diesel", which was powered by a huge 128GB of DDR4 memory, leaving the Geekbench results at 1141 points for single-threaded operation, and 15,620 for multi-threaded performance.   AMD will have their 32-core/64-thread Naples CPU out in Q2 2017, ready for the workstation market with dual-socket goodness.   Why you should be interested: Intel needs competition, just like NVIDIA does in the graphics card market, and Intel has been dominant in the CPU game for far too long. AMD's upcoming Zen architecture looks to disrupt that in a big way, and I'm all for it. Sure, it might not live up to the hype (we have no idea what is real, and what is not - these are all rumors) - but from my industry sources - I have the same information: Zen is going to be awesome.

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Sept. 4: From a slice of Burhi Aair Xadhu (Grandma's Tales), a popular collection of tales by litterateur Lakshminath Bezbaroa, to those from Jataka Tales , 55 short stories told by as many children, some as little as five years old, were heard and applauded today. Tanmanna Mahanta of Class II told one about Christopher and how his friends saved trees from three aliens, while Naman Sarawgi of Class VI chipped in with the virtues of controlling one's temper. There were more stories that conveyed the oft-forgotten messages and truths, relevant to this age as well. The three-hour storytelling competition, a rare event in the days of Google and smartphones, on a Sunday morning is a tradition Vasavi Acharya Bora and Neetu Sarawgi, two women from Guwahati, are trying to revive through a platform, Headway ~ d Intel Club, launched here today. "Storytelling is a centuries-old tradition in every household since time immemorial all over the world. It is an effective teaching and learning activity to help improve confidence, expression, vocabulary, get rid of stage fear and much more. Along with this, our effort will be to inculcate in students the habit of book reading, vocabulary building and make them ready for debates, quizes, spelling contests along with creative writing and thinking," Sarawgi said. The competition was organised among school students of the city in two groups - A (Classes I to IV) and B (Classes V to VII). In group A, Anusha Bharadwaj, a Class III student from Royal Global School, came first. Gargi Kashyap of Class IV, Gurukul Grammar School, came second while Boris Phukan, a Class I student of Don Bosco School and Dhrubajyoti Talukdar of Class IV, Gurukul Grammar School, were declared joint third. In group B, Naman Sarawgi of Class VI, Don Bosco School, and Somyadutta Deb, Class VI, also from the same school , were declared first and second respectively. The judges comprised writer Mitra Phukan and Indrani Deb, chairperson of Ficci FLO (Ficci Ladies' Organisation). The stories had to be narrated in English and no action or props were allowed. "The participants were judged on their voice modulations and expressions of words and how they communicate as opposed to learning one by heart. The narration has to be lively yet natural and simple," said Deb. The objectives of the competition are to enhance students' confidence in speaking English and give them an opportunity to communicate in an interesting, authentic and creative manner. Phukan said it was essential to revive the tradition of telling stories. "The response has been very good. We intend to open more centres outside the city. As of now, classes will be held at two centres here on weekends from October. The modules have been designed to enhance listening and speaking skills, instil interest in reading and writing in English," Acharya Bora said. Apart from a few summer camps in schools, story-telling contest is a rarity here. City-based socio-cultural organisation Anwesha had been organising a festival of books for children since 2001 to inculcate in them the habit of reading books.  More stories in North East Northeast safari train to run soon Gogoi signs off from polls Govt vow to 'cure' ASTC ills Logo & ideas for Assam tourism Dispur target to hike irrigated land area Airport upgrade from January Boost to citizens' services Delay in school campus shift Tale of lake people's struggles creates ripples Cost-cut nod for cement Manas man is Heritage Hero    Copyright © 2017 The Telegraph.

On Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration legalized commercial drone use as its Part 107 rules went into effect, dramatically increasing the potential number of users. Anyone can legally operate a drone as part of their business after passing an aeronautical knowledge test and registering with the FAA. In the first two days after the test became available, 1338 people had completed the test, which as of then had a 88 percent pass rate. The drone market is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2020, according to Macquarie analysts. Analysts said they expect 9 million consumer-grade drones and 6 million commercial-quality drones flying in the skies by 2020. The FAA anticipates that 42 percent of commercial drones will be used for inspections, 22 percent for aerial photography and 19 percent for agriculture. Here are some of the top drone contenders for the rest of 2016, ranging from toy drones to commercial drones used in inspections and agriculture. Courtesy of DJI DJI’s Osmo Mobile Slide 2 of DJI Chinese drone manufacturer DJI exploded in popularity ever since it announced its Phantom line of drones, and it’s only growing bigger. The company, which was founded in 2006, has an $8 billion valuation, according to estimates from Fortune Magazine. But the company is repositioning itself as not just a drone maker, but as a camera company of the future. DJI on Thursday released a new product specifically for smartphones called the Osmo Mobile, a handheld camera mount that gives a silky-smooth, “drone-like” look to videos shot via smartphone camera. The Osmo Mobile automatically takes time-lapse photos and long exposure shots with a phone, and can take both traditional or selfie videos while cancelling out movements from a shaky camera. Matternet Slide 3 of Matternet Think drone delivery is limited to either Amazon AMZN, -2.00%  and Google GOOG, -1.40%  , or marketing stunts like Domino’s pizza DPZ, -1.92% ? Think again. Silicon Valley startup Matternet has been working with Swiss Post since spring 2015 to perfect its drone-based delivery system. Its drones can transport items weighing up to 2.2 pounds and travel at about 12 miles at a time. In August, Matternet raised about $9.5 million of a targeted $11.5 million round of funding that so far lists 36 investors, according to a regulatory filing. Time will tell what types of deliveries come out of this round of funding. Slide 4 of Parrot French drone manufacturer Parrot PARRO, -2.41%  appears to be dominating the market for fixed-wing drones, which can cover larger distances and typically fly for a longer period of time than quadcopter-type drones. On the “prosumer” end of things, Parrot’s $1,300 Disco drone can fly for up to 45 minutes, making it ideal for photographers who have to cover large distances to get a photo. For enterprise customers, SenseFly, which Parrot acquired in 2012, this week launched its eBee SQ fixed-wing agricultural drone. The eBee SQ is intended for crop consultants, growers and researchers to be able to gather precise images of their land over a large area. The drones can cover up to 500 acres in a single flight, enabling users to gather crop data in what could otherwise cost thousands of dollars to get from a manned helicopter. Parrot also manufactures a variety of toy drones, and this week announced a hybrid drone called the Swing. The $139 Swing takes off and lands vertically like a helicopter, and then once in the air transitions to a fixed-wing mode where it flies like an airplane. Sally French, MarketWatch Autel’s X-Star drone Slide 5 of Autel China’s Autel had some enthusiasts skeptical with a drone that looked like a copycat of DJI’s ubiquitous Phantom. But Autel is quickly proving itself as a serious contender in the “prosumer” field with its X-Star Premium drone. The company has taken an unprecedented stance as a serious player in the commercial drone market by offering to reimburse the $150 testing fee for its customers who take and pass the FAA’s aeronautical knowledge test, required for drone operators who fly for commercial purposes. Courtesy of Yuneec Slide 6 of Yuneec With a $60 million investment from Intel Corp. INTC, -1.06%   in August 2015, Yuneec has exploded in popularity among drone enthusiasts and businesses. Shortly after that investment, the company was the first to emerge as a real competitor to DJI with its lineup of camera drones. This year, Yuneec released its Typhoon H drone, which incorporates Intel RealSense Technology to sense and avoid obstacles. Specialized cameras and sensors on the drone allow Intel’s system to map and learn its environment in 3-D, recognize each obstacle and plan an alternative route to navigating around it. Yuneec this week also made its first foray into the mass market by announcing a $500 “selfie” drone called the Yuneec Breeze, which is operated via smartphone. Courtesy of Kespry Slide 7 of Kespry Silicon Valley startup Kespry this week announced its Kespry Drone 2.0, intended for industrial applications such as roof inspections for insurance claims. The drone includes an on-board lidar sensor that automatically detects obstacles in front of it and can reroute itself to avoid them. The drone carries a customized Sony UMC-R10C industrial camera that can be used to create 3-D models from the aerial images it gathers. The Kespry drone can fly for about 30 minutes and cover up to 150 acres. Sally French Sally French covers drone technology and serves as a social media editor for MarketWatch in San Francisco.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid The two most-anticipated laptops of 2016, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Apple Macbook Pro 2016, have been subjects of intense speculation by tech enthusiasts. If one is planning to buy any one of the two in near future, making a decision might be difficult as both are amazing devices to possess. Both Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Apple Macbook Pro 2016 are capable of fulfilling all computing needs. Hence, one cannot go wrong with either of the two. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 It’s hard to outdo this laptop as the upcoming 2-in-1 device from Microsoft is expected to feature the Intel Kaby Lake processors as well as the latest Windows 10 update. It will have a much better battery capacity compared to its predecessor Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and also a better stylus. Fans are expecting an Ultra HD Display of 4K quality and 3,840 × 2,160 pixels screen resolution. The Surface Pro 5 is believed to be a gaming-oriented laptop with AMD graphics processor “Polaris” or NVIDIA’s Pascal. Rumours suggest the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will replace the current AAAA battery-powered stylus with a Surface Pen. Up to now there has been little information as to its release date though an early 2017 release is possible. Some also believe the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will get an October release. For more details, click here. Apple Macbook Pro 2016 Also believed to be released later this year, the Macbook Pro 2016 is expected to receive a massive makeover from its earlier generations. The company has teased “radical changes” such as an ultra-fast second gen USB 3.1. If Apple Macbook Pro 2016 does come with a USB 3.1 support, it would have transfer speeds of up to 10GB/sec, writes GameNGuide. Moreover, the highly-publicised OLED touch bar may replace its function keys. Thunderbolt 3 for the Apple Macbook Pro 2016 is also a possibility. It supports both 10GB/sec USB 3.1 ports as well as DisplayPort 1.2. Intel's new Skylake platform may also be included, which will provide higher CPU powers and better battery life. Experts believe the Apple Macbook Pro 2016 will have the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple's Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology is also expected.

 How 'Uber for truckers' Cargomatic burned through $15 million as it quietly pivoted away from being a tech company at all Lara O'Reilly Sep. 4, 2016, 7:25 AM 20,213 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook/Cargomatic Cargomatic has had a rough ride in 2016 so far. The Venice, California-based "Uber for truckers" has seen several key members of its staff — including its CEO, CFO, and COO — all head for the exit. It has laid off half of its staff, more than 50 people. Multiple sources inside the company tell Business Insider the company is running out of cash, having struggled to raise funding. They also revealed the company's huge, unpublicized pivot away from the strategy that made it sexy. Now the so-called tech platform relies on data being manually inputted by its staff. The company is currently dependent on just one customer to stay afloat. This is the story of how a once promising tech startup went drastically off course, burning through nearly $15 million in investor money and bank loans while deliberately running the business at a loss. As the company continues to spiral down, one of its cofounders is jetting around the world on vacation and employees use a private Slack channel to look for new jobs. The dream: A tech platform to connect truckers with space in their vehicles with people who want to ship freight quickly In theory, Cargomatic is a really good idea. Trucking is a human-run business, controlled by people calling one another on the phone and sending emails and paperwork manually to confirm that trucks have made their deliveries. Automating that system with software could earn someone a fortune. Cargomatic's core product is an Uber-like service for truckers. It matches companies that need goods moved with truck drivers who are able to move them. Like Uber, it solves the "excess capacity" problem beloved by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Truckers, like car drivers, often travel from A to B with spare room in their vehicles. Both Uber and Cargomatic simply let those drivers know whether anyone is willing to pay them to occupy the free space. A shipper logs on to Cargomatic.com or one of its apps, enters details about what is in need of shipping, where it is going, and when it needs to get there. Cargomatic pre-verifies its drivers to ensure they have the correct paperwork. Qualified drivers see the job pop up on their app, and the first to click "book it" gets the work. The short-haul "less-than-truckload" business has revenue of about $77 billion a year, on journeys of 200 miles or less. The wider US trucking industry is huge. It is how most freight is transported in the US. In many states, driving accounts for the most workers of any occupation. Venture capitalists have been interested in the space because of the sheer size and fragmentation of the companies within it — there are probably about 500,000 trucking firms, ranging from companies with just two trucks and a phone to huge fleet haulage businesses. About 27 tech startups that match truckers with loads — both full load and less than truckload — have raised more than $180 million in venture backing since 2011, according to the research firm Armstrong & Associates. Some of the biggest trucker/shipping tech startups are Otto, which Uber acquired in August; Convoy; Transfix; Cargo Chief; and Trucker Path. The Los Angeles-based Cargomatic was founded in 2013 by friends Brett Parker and Jonathan Kessler. The two were introduced by Parker's wife. Parker comes from a trucking and logistics family. His father, Allan, owns The Triangle Group, a 44-year-old company that delivers apparel to retailers' distribution centers. The younger Parker grew up working in the family business, and he was the managing partner at the firm from 2009 to 2013. Around 2012, Parker shared an idea with Kessler. As the Los Angeles Times reported in 2014, Parker lamented the time-consuming chore of finding and vetting drivers. He wanted a service that could more quickly connect him to verified drivers. Cargomatic cofounder Jonathan Kessler. LinkedIn Kessler, a perma-tanned marathon runner whom the Los Angeles Times has described as "an adventurer and technology tinkerer who's gone from being an Alaskan fisherman to building button-making machines in Ecuador," was on board with the idea. Kessler was a popular, messianic figure inside the company. One former employee described him as an "electrifying," "first-in, last-out kind of guy." "He was a nice guy to have a beer and a chat with — how could you not like him?" said another, who was more cynical about Kessler but nevertheless appreciated his impact on the company. Cargomatic became the eighth startup in which Kessler had been involved. His most recent startup was a technology company that aimed to connect smartphones with TV sets before the idea of "second screening" had become the norm. According to Kessler's LinkedIn, Hand Eye Technologies raised money, built a proof-of-concept model, and filed provisional patents but pivoted to become a mobile-app development consultancy, working with customers including Nokia, Intel, and Sephora. Before founding Hand Eye in 2006, he was part of the founding team at the audio and video codecs company Camino Networks. Just eight months after Camino was founded, in 2006, Skype bought its parent company, Sonorit, for $27 million in stock (Skype was then owned by eBay). From 2002 to 2005 he was director of client services at the web search and visualization company Groxis, which shut down in 2009. Having spent years trying to make his mark in Silicon Valley, Kessler believed a move south to "Silicon Beach" to create a disruptive shipping logistics company would be the way he could finally hit the big time. Facebook/Cargomatic Cargomatic begins raising money and expanding outside Venice Kessler and Parker raised an undisclosed seed round from Acequia Capital in April 2013, followed by an official $2.6 million seed round in June 2014. The round included participation from the investors including Canaan Partners, SV Angel, Acequia Capital, Structure Capital, Sherpa Capital, and Winklevoss Capital. That year, with about 20 office employees, Cargomatic claimed to run more than 100 deliveries a day, with the average driver hauling more than 1,000 pounds of freight each time, while the average shipper would pay about $120. Cargomatic made money by charging a fee to both sides — the trucker and the shipper — usually about 20% of the transaction. As the business began picking up customers, at the turn of 2015, Cargomatic announced its series A investment, an $8 million round led by Canaan Partners with involvement from 13 other investors. It brought the company's total funding to $12.1 million, though it never publicly revealed a valuation. Cargomatic would go on to use that investment to expand east, launching its first New York office in the summer of 2015. The company hired Dan Harman from the 3D printing company MakerBot, where he was director of international sales, to lead the New York business. In addition to its California roots, Cargomatic now also handled shipments in Greater New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. In an interview with Crain's magazine announcing the office opening, Harman and Kessler noted the challenges of trucking in New York versus Los Angeles. "'It's logistically quite complex,' Mr. Harman noted. "Trucking lingo also varies by coast. Some terms have entirely different meanings, he said. "Another difference: tolls, which don't exist in Los Angeles. "'We have to deal with water crossings — bridges, tunnels — and massive amounts of traffic,' Mr. Harman said of New York. "'And let’s not forget snow,' Mr. Kessler chimed in. 'We did not have to worry about snow in L.A.' "'Or even rain,' said Mr. Harman." As it turned out, Harman would leave Cargomatic just a year after joining, when the New York office was shut down. Kessler: We are 'a couple of years ahead of rivals' But in 2015, Cargomatic was scaling rapidly. In December the company went on to launch in San Francisco. Asked at the end of 2015 where he saw Cargomatic in five years, Kessler said: "We plan to continue to improve and expand our service in the markets we currently serve, while seeking out opportunities for expansion in other markets in the US and internationally." Kessler became increasingly bombastic in interviews. In an article published this past March with Trucks.com, he dismissed Cargomatic's rivals. First, he was asked about Convoy, a Seattle-based startup that uses tech to connect shippers with truckers. At the time, Convoy had raised $2.5 million in funding from investors including Marc Benioff, Drew Houston, and Bezos Expeditions. Its total equity funding is now at $18.5 million. Of Convoy, Kessler said: "We have more coverage than they do. We're in more places and we've been doing it longer. We know more about the business. We're a couple years ahead of where they are." Kessler added that the rival app Trucker Path was "really just an app for truckers to use to help find truck stops." He called Cargo Chief a "technology-enabled long-haul broker" — Cargomatic didn't compete there because it focused on short-haul shipments. Layoffs hit — half its workers are shown the door A month later, Cargomatic fired half of its staff — about 50 to 60 employees across two rounds of layoffs. Some employees had sensed that something was up when a big recruitment spree — the company was moving so fast on hires that its recruiters could barely keep up — came to a "dead stop" in about February of this year. One former employee told us: "I think everyone had a sense that something was amiss when management implemented a sudden hiring freeze with no explanation. But no one could have expected something of this magnitude. Everyone that was laid off was given no warning whatsoever. They were completely blindsided." When asked for explanations, managers were simply told the company was looking to "do more with less," the source added. In an emailed statement at the time, Kessler told Business Insider: "The Cargomatic marketplace continues to expand and has enjoyed year-over-year growth since our founding in 2013. Key to growing a successful company is knowing where to staff appropriately at different growth phases. Sometimes that means making difficult decisions, and to that end, we recently reduced the size of our marketplace operations and inside sales teams." He added that the reduction in workers had allowed the company to build out its enterprise sales department, pointing to recent hires, and that the company had made additions to its engineering team to "automate tasks that previously had been handled manually." "Cargomatic remains laser-focused on developing world-class technology that provides increased efficiency, transparency, and affordability to the trucking industry," Kessler said. Cargomatic had quietly pivoted away from being an Uber-like app to being a traditional brokerage business Pointing out that Cargomatic had hired enterprise sales staff was telling. Uber doesn't need a sales team. Why would the so-called Uber for truckers? As it turned out, there had been weak demand for Cargomatic's core product. Adoption of the app had been slow, and the challenge of working in the less-than-truckload space is that you need to have density to succeed. Cargomatic instead became a traditional brokerage business, relying on enterprise accounts and calling and taking meetings the old-fashioned way. As DC Velocity pointed out, this saw it enter a crowded segment, and the move "alienated" brokers who had expected to be partners, not competitors, with Cargomatic. In particular, Cargomatic shifted into the "drayage" business — picking up containers from the port. For outside investors, the pivot looked like a success. The average container price was about $550, compared with an average sale of just $40 to $45 on the app. Revenue was growing at a clip. Despite the company's Uber-for-truckers name tag, the majority (sources estimated about 90%) of Cargomatic's business had nothing to do with the app, which now pretty much just functioned as a facade for the underlying brokerage business. It wasn't looking like a tech startup anymore. What's more, while Cargomatic was demonstrating top-line growth, the bottom line was looking seriously unhealthy. One of Cargomatic's clearest flaws was its lack of concern for margins. The sales team could sign up customers at a negative margin yet still receive a bonus, as they were rewarded on billings rather than the actual money brought in for the business, according to former employees. The goal was to take a margin of about 10% from each transaction, but in the desperation to gain and retain customers, those margins were often reduced to the low single digits or fulfilled above cost. One former employee said: "The margins were always negative. You hire me to move freight for you, you pay me $100, but then I need to pay costs that could be $150 to $200. We were actually paying to move freight. That was crazy, in my opinion." At the same time, the sales team was taking bonuses — pushing the negative margins down even further. This kind of behavior — paying for growth to get better penetration and visibility with customers — is reasonable for a large, well-funded startup (like Uber). But there has to be a clear path in which customers can be gradually moved up the price scale, or costs moved down, so that in the long run the extra volume of business the company acquires becomes profitable. There's a clear problem with this strategy in trucking: What if the new business doesn't lead to repeat customers? Lots of Cargomatic's customers were simply businesses that needed to move excess freight. It's a random, rather than cyclical, need that would not guarantee repeat sales. Selling is fun here, Monday inside sales day. #mondayfunday #teamcargomatic A photo posted by Cargomatic (@cargomatic) on May 4, 2015 at 4:41pm PDT on May 4, 2015 at 4:41pm PDT Cargomatic struggles to raise a series B, and Kessler is ousted as CEO Investors took notice. In 2016, Kessler was charged with pitching the company around Silicon Valley with the hope of raising a series B round. "Investors would look at the top line, but they would also look at the profitability of our accounts and saw we were super top-heavy — savvy investors saw that," one former employee said. Kessler was ousted from the CEO role in May, about a month after the layoffs, by the Cargomatic board. The company said he had moved to the position of chief product officer while remaining on the board. Parker, the cofounder and president, sent Business Insider this statement at the time: "It is common in the maturation of a fast-growth technology company to have the visionary founder move to a new role. The change does not affect our continued expansion and our prospects have never been more positive. With the backing of Canaan Partners, the recent addition of seasoned logistics executives and an increased focus on enterprise sales, we are poised for growth in 2016 and beyond." But in reality, the "adventurer" Kessler booked out and traveled the world, as chronicled on his Instagram account. Another amazing part of the world. The S. Tyrol, Merano, Italy. More German than Italian. Great people ridiculously good food and amazing hot spring. Basically a mountain paradise. #whatawonderfulworld A photo posted by Jonathan Kessler (@jkessler178) on Jul 28, 2016 at 7:54am PDT on Jul 28, 2016 at 7:54am PDT Kessler's exit hit many employees hard. When Kessler left, a part of the culture disappeared from the young startup too. Board member Richard Gerstein becomes the de facto CEO In his absence, new leadership came in from the outside. Richard Gerstein, a board member, whose title was executive chairman, became the de facto CEO (though he's not listed on the company's website). Gerstein — who was barely seen in the office and would instead conduct team meetings over video call, as he was often abroad dealing with his other businesses — was not as popular among the majority of staff members, and neither was Parker, whose position now seemed elevated. A former employee described Gerstein as an "old-school guy." He is a president at the venture-capital firm Finca LLC. Before that he had worked at the international rail logistics firm IntelliTrans for 22 years. Sources said he was not particularly interested in the tech side of the business — the part that drew many employees to work there — whether it was the type of product Cargomatic was trying to sell or the kind of tools the company was using. He wasn't happy Cargomatic was using the human-resources software Zenefits, for example, telling employees in one meeting that he would prefer that all employee information be kept in a filing cabinet. One former employee said: "If you watch a movie about the cliché American boss, who just wants to fire everyone, he's that cliché American boss. He's not a leader or an entrepreneur — he's a boss." Brett Parker, Cargomatic cofounder. LinkedIn Former employees described Parker, who at least was in the office every day, unless he was at meetings, and who did have a small group of allies within the company, as an internally competitive salesman whose bonus structure was "legendary." Like the rest of the sales team, he was rewarded based on gross sales rather than profitability. Parker attached himself to some of the largest accounts Cargomatic had on its books. But some former employees criticized his sales technique. One said: "In these meetings he would say: 'This is what we do and how we are trying to change the industry,' but they were more infomercials. Sales don't come from those meetings. We got no sales — we just got business cards." Another said of his style: "He has the tendency of saying a lot and letting everyone get confused and not relaying anything ... he is disorganized, barely understands the tech world. He can't sell to tech-oriented people nor explain it to nontechies." 'We were throwing out everything that made Cargomatic sexy' and 'real-time' data was inputted manually One of Gerstein's first major moves was to fire the company's popular chief operating officer, Sean Whiteley, a tech executive the company had hired in June 2015 from the secure healthcare messaging startup TigerText. It was another decision from the board that didn't go down well with employees. One former employee described Whiteley as "a very good person, a solid guy: honest and trustworthy." Another said: "Sean is really popular around LA. He's really well-known around here and he is an awesome dude, very energetic." Senior workers began leaving in droves. Notable departures included the vice president of operations and the vice president of engineering. Staff members were increasingly unhappy that Cargomatic was moving away from being a tech company and that the senior management, most of whom now had experience only in the old-school logistics industry, were trying to turn it into a traditional logistics setup. "We [were] throwing out everything that made Cargomatic sexy and replacing it into a simple logistics company," one former employee told Business Insider. Catered lunch days be the best days, made better today buy a surprise 🍕 delivery by one of our hardest working drivers! A photo posted by Cargomatic (@cargomatic) on Mar 24, 2016 at 11:57am PDT on Mar 24, 2016 at 11:57am PDT Most freight companies don't use any kind of tech platform — they know when something arrives at the warehouse because the warehouse manager calls them to let them know the delivery has arrived. The dream of Cargomatic would be to offer customers real-time data so they knew exactly where their shipments were. Customers fell in love with the idea that they could see their shipment on the way to its location in real-time. It wasn't the reality. Cargomatic workers would manually input the data each day. Rather than being integrated, shipping data from the Los Angeles port, for example, was grabbed manually and put into the shell of the product. When the warehouse manager made the call, a Cargomatic employee would update the system manually. "Yes. Everything was manual," a source told us. "Our mobile applications were constantly sending the wrong type of data, and the operations team need to fix them all the time inside the system. Our containers system was just a glorified spreadsheet where nothing is automated." Another said: "It was a show-game. Customers thought this process was automated, but we were asking people behind-the-scenes to make it look automated." Rather than develop its own trucker management system, or TMS, for example, which the engineering team had been working on, Cargomatic began licensing a software package called MercuryGate instead. Before he was forced out of the company, Whiteley had advocated that if Cargomatic wasn't going to create its own software, it could at least opt for a better-known platform that more of its customers used instead. But he was overruled by the rest of the board. Gerstein also happens to sit on the board of MercuryGate. There were other operational issues. Customers kept disputing their bills. Cargomatic threw temporary accountants at the issue. Workers even nicknamed them "temporary accountant one," "temporary accountant two," as so many temps flew in and out of the building asking questions. "It was an absolute clusterf---," one former employee said. As Cargomatic's situation became increasingly messy, sources within the company told us customers were left in the dark about the changes. One former employee said: "It's not being communicated at all. Richard told everyone ... that we should never ever talk to the media and never talk to customers about what's happening inside the company." This reporter's name was mentioned specifically as a member of the media whom staff members shouldn't speak with. A source told us that Parker mentioned this so often that employees were increasingly suspicious he had been the source of the leak for Business Insider's initial layoffs story earlier this year. 'You'd sit in a meeting and the lights were out in the room' With the company's popular leader on vacation and other employees heading for the exit of their own volition, the mood within the company was bleak. "Morale is so low that people are coming in mostly to collect their paychecks and wait for the inevitable," an employee told us in July. "We have a private Slack channel in which we circulate possible job positions, ask for referrals, and vent about the lack of management inside the company." A former employee said: "You'd sit in a meeting and the lights were out around the room. They were disengaged — everyone was in their own battle. Some of these people I felt sorry for. They'd take on a job, sign a one-year lease on an apartment in an expensive area, then find out later they were out of a job. It was a tough place to be. It was very difficult on staff to be in an expensive area and at a company that was floundering." At the same time, one customer was kept incredibly well-informed of Cargomatic's operations. CEVA Logistics, a transportation and logistics company with offices in more than 160 countries, became Cargomatic's biggest customer. CEVA operations personnel were often seen inside the Cargomatic offices. Routes for truckers were planned within CEVA's office. The rumor among the staff was that Cargomatic was actively trying to be bought by CEVA — a huge company, but another account that was also being run at a negative margin. "I'm pretty sure Richard will make Cargomatic worth something, even if that means killing the business and getting acquired by CEVA," a former employee told us. A CEVA representative said the company does not comment on its suppliers or speculation. Just 2 months of cash left Cargomatic secured a bridge round of a couple of million dollars at the beginning of the year, plus a $3 million bank loan, according to a source. The company's runway was supposed to last through November. But in August, The Wall Street Journal reported that Seth Klein, the company's interim chief financial officer, had resigned and that Cargomatic had just two months' worth of cash left. Hrach Simonian, general partner at Canaan Partners. Canaan Partners Hrach Simonian, who sits on the Cargomatic board and is a general partner at its biggest investor, Canaan, brushed the matter off. He told The Journal: "The fact that there's two months of cash left is irrelevant. They have [an] indefinite runway … There will absolutely be a new cash infusion in the company in short order." Simonian's other deals at Canaan include the grocery delivery service Instacart, the crowdsourced real-estate data startup Compstak, the real-estate crowdfunding company RealtyMogul.com, and Washio, the Los Angeles-based on-demand laundry service that went out of business earlier this week. Gerstein told The Journal, with an attitude somewhat indicative of his opinion on tech: "There's a perception in Silicon Valley that you can just start with a blank piece of paper and you don't need to know the rules. That might work in some industries, but not in freight transportation. To scale this company, we need people who have knowledge of the traditional technology in manufacturing and distribution." The day the article was published, Gerstein held an all-hands meeting, dialing in from abroad. According to sources, Gerstein berated staff about the Journal article and told them they shouldn't be talking to the media about the company. Gerstein named random people in the room and demanded they repeat back to him what he had just said. "He treated them like children," a source with knowledge of the call told Business Insider. Right now, it's unclear what will happen to Cargomatic. It has no CEO, no CFO, and no COO. Gerstein is only in the office about once a month. Many current employees are planning their exits, and the mood inside the office is increasingly sour, according to sources. There is no sign of a series B. A source estimated that "99%" of Cargomatic's business now comes from CEVA and only CEVA. Parker, Kessler, Gerstein, and Simonian did not respond to Business Insider's repeated requests for comment. Ricardo Salgado, the CEO of the on-demand truckload shipping startup Loadsmart, said he hoped the issues at Cargomatic did not cast a shadow over other companies claiming to be the "Uber for X." He outlined some of the challenges in the area. "The industry is changing rapidly because of new technology, but the adoption curve is slow," Salgado said. "This is not an industry where you have a Snapchat, where you give the app access to your contacts, and have 150 million active users. It's B2B and adoption is lower." "Lots of people describe themselves as the 'Uber for trucking,' but I disagree with that completely because moving people is much easier. With Uber, you just have the rider and the driver — two parties. And one in every 200 times there's an operational issue — the rider left their cell phone in the car and he just writes to support@uber.com and they figure it out. "When you're moving freight, you have six different players touching the cargo. The cargo is worth X, there's insurance, the driver, the dispatcher, pickup at the warehouse, drop-off with the warehouse manager, sometimes there's a broker, a shipper. Things happen all the time — the cargo is not ready, the truck broke down, the driver needs to rest because he drove 12 hours — all that type of stuff makes it more complex than on the consumer side." So what does the future look like for Cargomatic? One former employee predicted: "Cargomatic will shrink a lot. It will focus a lot more on being a logistics brand, using third-party software, or just using whatever they had before, then eventually get sold or fold."

It may sound true theoretically, but somehow, there is a wide gap between the two. Successful teams, enterprises, global networks and organizations that innovate routinely are able to do it only when they snub conventional notions of innovating. Unfortunately, leaders focus more on building innovative cultures to amplify creative agility than pay attention to how people in a group think. While they understand that innovation comes from the diversity of thought and conflict, they fail to leverage on the two. So, how do leaders reconfigure to animate a community where people innovative together? Innovation When Done Right Innovation requires inclusive decision-making that allows all kinds of solutions to be embraced. It comes in many forms for all kinds of purposes. In some organizations, take for example Intel Corp., innovation can become a necessity to survive and thrive. In some cases, it can become a way of organizing, take for example Apple’s recent move of dropping the ‘store’ from ‘Apple’ stores. But, what enables people to withstand conflict and tension in order to reach to inclusive decision-making for the sole purpose of innovation? Leadership, in many ways, is a paradox. On one side, it requires talents and passions, while on the other, it requires harnessing the power of collective effort. It requires leading innovation, encouraging team members to support one another, and at the same time challenge each other through creative abrasion. As a matter of fact, leading innovation requires re-organizing a team’s priorities, values, and collective action. Leaders must understand that at the heart of leading innovation lies three most essential principles: Collaborative Organizations Studies report that innovation is a group effort. It requires more than just an interplay of ideas that occur during group discussions of people from varied backgrounds and experiences and POVs. Creative collaboration is the backbone of every effort focused on driving innovation. Drive Decision-Making Decision-making requires that leaders actively explore every option laid out on the table. This means that sometimes, leaders have to do more than just opposing those options. It is only through collaborative interaction where every leader shares their version of the option, that a team can integrate proper decision-making. Learning-Driven Organizations Innovation requires problem-solving. In order to instill a learning-driven culture into the organization, leaders must not punish people for trying out new things. Rather, a process of trial and error, learning and adapting should be embraced. Now you know why some teams fail and some teams succeed. In the end, everything boils down to great leadership. In order to thrive in today’s competitive environment, leaders must seek followers who’re more than willing to foster experimentation and provoke challenges through continuous learning. But, first of all, leaders must create the kind of an innovative work culture where people want to belong. After all, leaders are the social architect of today’s workplace.

Richard Brian/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @vegasphotograph By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL About 4,000 people and close to 160 exhibitors are expected to attend InterDrone, a conference dedicated to commercial drones. Representatives from Nevada’s drone industry will be there keeping a close eye on the next industry disruptors and potential business opportunities. “The whole field is advancing so fast, everybody keeps leapfrogging each other,” said InterDrone Chairman Ted Bahr. InterDrone, which will run Wednesday through Friday at Paris Las Vegas, is going to be a cascade of new technology announcements in the commercial drone space. It is open to the public for a fee. Leading drone manufacturer Yuneec, will be introducing “the breeze,” a drone made for taking video and images that can be shared via social media through an accompanying app. Intel will be showing the first public demonstration of Aero, Bahr said, which is a ready-to-fly drone sold with a development kit targeting software developers. Drone design company Skye Intelligence will unveil Orbit, marketed as “the world’s first social sharing, autonomous drone that follows you on demand.” Drone-servicing companies will also be unveiling new technologies, including Intelligent Energy, which will be exhibiting a fuel cell hydrogen powered drone prototype. While people are checking out exhibitors there will also be a variety of classes or panels happening at the same time. “We have over 120 classes and panels,” Bahr said. “It’s really a full place of different options that people can choose from. There are eight classes or panels in every time slot.” Thomas Wilczek, the defense aerospace industry representative at the governor’s economic development office will moderate a panel Friday about opportunities for minorities in the commercial drone industry. “We’re very excited that Nevada is going to be there with a booth and moderating a panel,” said Wilczek. “Nevada, Las Vegas, Reno — we’re getting noticed, and we will continue to push the envelope in every way possible to continue to spread that message (that Nevada is a great place for the unmanned aerial system, or UAS, industry).” Wilczek said he is most looking forward to “the opportunity to find more opportunity” in speaking with the shakers and movers in the commercial UAS industry who will be at InterDrone. One of the next big business opportunities for the state is in the emerging field of counter-UAS, which is the commercial drone development of defense systems against UAS threats. “Drones are getting smaller and smaller, and as they get smaller companies have to look at what is the technology to prevent them from moving into spaces that are high security, or critical infrastructure,” said Chris Walach, director of the FAA-designated Nevada Unmanned Aviation Test Site and the director of technical operations for the Nevada Institute of Autonomous Systems. NIAS works with the governor’s economic development office and acts as a clearinghouse for drone-related business opportunities. “We already have cyberattacks on our computers and cyberinfrastructure, and now you’re going to see a higher cybersecurity involvement in drones,” Walach said. “All of the IT (information technology) companies in Nevada — when they hear ‘counter-UAS’ their eyes light up because they know this is the next frontier for their company.” Technology is being developed that will allow drones to disable other drones that pose a threat out of the sky by taking control of their radio frequency signal, Walach said. “Or, there’s certain technology that, when this little drone is flying, they (the defense drone) can shoot it out of the sky, and then it’s toast as well,” he said. Walach said he is also looking forward to seeing new developments in data processing technology from drones. Right now, he said there’s not a great way to transfer data from drones to the cloud, a server, or brick-and-mortar facility in a timely and organized way. “Where the Nevada test site, and where NIAS, is going we feel we will be very much part of disrupting that future technology,” he said. This week’s InterDrone conference is the second-ever. Last year there were 2,797 attendees with nearly 100 exhibiting companies. Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

Linux Kernel 3.18.41 LTS Has ARC and Networking Changes, Updated Drivers GO Users of the Linux 3.18 LTS kernel series must update Sep 5, 2016 21:20 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, September 5, 2016, a new version of the long-term supported Linux 3.18 kernel series arrived as build 3.18.41, bringing various updated drivers and other small improvements. No official announcement has been made at the moment of writing this article, but we've managed to get our hands on the Git changelog to tell you a little bit about the changes implemented in the Linux 3.18.41 LTS release, which updates a total of 47 files, with 254 insertions and 91 deletions. Judging by the statistics mentioned above, Linux kernel 3.18.41 LTS is a relatively small maintenance update that brings multiple improvements to the ARC hardware architectures, as well as a few minor fixes to the PA-RISC and PowerPC (PPC) ones, a bugfix for the UBIFS file system, and an updated networking stack with IPv4 and mac80211 changes. Updated GPU drivers, several internal improvements Linux kernel 3.18.41 LTS also contains multiple updated drivers, in particular for general-purpose input/output (GPIO), Intel i915, AMD Radeon, SCSI, MD, PCI, s390, Xen, USB, and networking (mostly Ethernet) devices, as well as various internal improvements and security patches. If you're using a GNU/Linux operating system powered by a kernel from the Linux 3.18 LTS kernel series, you are urged to update as soon as possible to Linux kernel 3.18.41 LTS. OS vendors and power users can download the Linux kernel 3.18.41 LTS sources right now via our website or directly from kernel.org and compile it themselves. In related news, the Linux 4.1.32 LTS kernel has been released as well, and we invite you to check out the changes implemented in it on our report. In the meantime, please consider keeping your Linux kernel-based operating system up to date with the latest kernel builds and software versions if you want to stay secure at all times. #Linux kernel 3.18.41 LTS#Linux 3.18.41#Linux LTS#Linux kernel#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news VintOS Promises to Be the Chromium OS Fork You've Always Wanted and Needed - Exclusive OpenMW 0.40.0 Open-Source Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Remake Adds New Features Neptune Linux 4.5.2 ISO Adds Kernel 3.18.40, Icedove 45, Updated Graphics Stack Wine 1.9.18 Improves Support for No Man's Sky, Fallout 4 & Microsoft Office 2010 New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Linux kernel 3.18.41 LTS released New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository more on: Ubuntu 17.04 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

VintOS Promises to Be the Chromium OS Fork You've Always Wanted and Needed Exclusive GO The operating system will be compatible with all PCs Sep 5, 2016 21:05 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Dylan Callahan from the Chromium OS for SBCs (Single-Board Computers) project, which unfortunately was discontinued due to lack of interest from users, has informed Softpedia today, September 5, 2016, that he's working on a new Linux-based OS. We have to admit that we're quite surprised to see that developers aren't giving up on their ambitions to create the best fork of a well-known Linux kernel-based operating system, in this case, Chromium OS. While Chromium OS for SBCs was aimed at embedded and IoT devices, the new one is targeted at all PCs. World, meet VintOS! What's VintOS? Well, it's an upcoming open-source fork of Chromium OS, the operating system on which the famous Google Chrome OS is based. To make a name for itself from the get-go, VintOS is named after one of the founding fathers of the Internet, Vinton Cerf, and it's explicitly designed for educational purposes in mind. "VintOS is based on the Chromium OS we all know and love, but it's Chromium OS in a different flavor," says Dylan Callahan exclusively for Softpedia. "Featuring a broad range of support for both Intel and AMD processors, as well as Nvidia graphics, VintOS will offer support for both 64-bit and 32-bit computers." VintOS will offer local sign-in for Google accounts Another interesting feature that will make VintOS special is local sign-in for Google accounts so that you will remain signed into your Google account no matter where you are in the world because we all know that Google doesn't offer all of its services everywhere in the world. Additionally, VintOS will come with a revolutionary installer so that anyone in this world would be able to install the operating system on their personal computers, without having to ask an expert or read a manual. Best of all, VintOS will always be free, as it is sponsored by various students and universities around the US. So that's it for now, keep an eye on our Linux news section for more information about the upcoming VintOS project, as an ISO image will be released in the coming weeks to let you get an early taste of this Chromium OS fork whose goal is to become a globally usable web-based educational Linux-based operating system for anyone. #Chromium OS#VintOS#Linux#operating system#Chrome OS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news OpenMW 0.40.0 Open-Source Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Remake Adds New Features Neptune Linux 4.5.2 ISO Adds Kernel 3.18.40, Icedove 45, Updated Graphics Stack Wine 1.9.18 Improves Support for No Man's Sky, Fallout 4 & Microsoft Office 2010 Development Starts for Tails 2.6 Anonymous Live CD, Now Based on Tor 0.2.8.6 New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    VintOS operating system logo Other Linux Distros Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Netrunner Rolling Edition / Desktop: A special edition of the Netrunner Linux distribution based on Arch Linux and designed as a rolling-release operating system Reader comments Load old comments   Gentoo-Based Calculate Linux 17 Launches with KDE Plasma 5.8.5 LTS and MATE 1.16 more on: Calculate Linux 17 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The watch and leather goods maker crossed over into the tech world with a flurry of smart watches and smart analog watches. Among the three Android Wear smartwatches that Fossil has made so far, there’s one that’s made specifically for the ladies, the Q Wander, and two made for men, the Q Marshal and the Q Founder. Any watchmaker worth his gears will tell you that design is everything with watches. Everything from the angle of the lugs to the shape of the casing and the quality of the materials is incredibly important. While technology companies like Samsung enlist Swiss watch designers to improve smartwatch design, Fossil is already there. Its challenge is technology. Luckily, Fossil has some help from Misfit, a fitness wearable company it bought recently, and Google, which makes the Android Wear operating system available to its partners. We took a look at the ladylike Q Wander and the subtle, masculine Q Marshall, to see how Fossils tech is shaping up. The Q wander: A big, bold, feminine watch Believe it or not, the Fossil Q Wander has a 45mm casing, which is on the large end for women’s watches. It’s also rather thick at 13.5mm. When I first saw it, I was sure it’d be too big and bulky, but when I tried it on, it actually felt comfortable and didn’t overwhelm my wrist. Related: These are the 5 best Android Wear devices right now Fossil has used two classic watchmaking tricks to make the Q Wander look smaller than it really is. The lugs are slim and angled specifically to suit women’s wrists. And instead of having hard edges that would make it look bulky and awkward, it’s curved beautifully. The crown on the side of the watch feels very nice, too, and serves as the power button. Android Wear 2.0 greatly improves the look and feel of the OS. It’s hard to tell in pictures, but the Q Wander looks quite lovely on women’s wrists. It’s a bit similar to the second-generation Moto 360, which also offered a women’s version, though Fossil is larger in size. The rose gold casing and 22mm tan leather strap I tried on added to the air of femininity, and the shiny gold tone made the bulk of the watch disappear. You can use any 22mm strap you want on the Q Wander, which is great for those who change watch straps regularly. Fossil created a number of nice watch faces for the Q Wander, which you can customize with different color schemes. The watch faces mimic Fossil’s analog watches, but there are digital options for those who want something less traditional. You can, of course, use any watch face from the Google Play Store. The colors reproduced on the screen looks sharp and bright, but it is a flat tire display, so the bottom edge is sadly hacked off. The Q Marshal: A subtle, masculine watch The Q Wander goes some way to fix the only major problem with the Q Founder — it wasn’t in any way suitable for skinny wrists. The Wander is distinctly feminine, but there are men who want a more subtle smartwatch too. The new Q Marshal retains a masculine style, without the Founder’s chunkiness. In black, with a textured edge running around the face, it’s a stylish watch. And with the matte black silicone strap, it gains panther-like stealth appeal. Trying it with a brown leather band with stitched black edging gave it more of a classic Fossil look. There’s a single button on the side of the case to activate the settings menu on the device, but it’s otherwise a clean design. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Compared to the Q Founder, the Q Marshal is just a little more subtle, a little more svelte, and the slimmed lugs mean it doesn’t stand out quite so much on smaller wrists. The numbers prove what we can see. The Q Marshal’s case is 2mm smaller, and 1mm thinner than the Q Founder. Also, the twisted design around the screen calms down the style compared to the flat surface on the Q Founder. It’s still primarily a man’s watch, but has lost most of the Q Founder’s “look at me” brashness when paired with anything other than the metal link strap. Android Wear powered by Qualcomm Both watches are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, which promises zippier performance to Android Wear watches, and should assist in prolonging battery life. The Q Founder used an Intel chip, so this is a considerable change for Fossil. In our quick hands on, the processing seemed very fluid, though we’ll have to test it more to be sure. The Q Marshal’s battery capacity is 360mAh, smaller than the Q Founder’s 400mAh cell. Still, Fossil says you’ll still get a day’s worth of use from the watch. The Q Wander has the same battery capacity, which charges up wirelessly via an easy-to-use charger, and should last all day on a charge, according to Fossil. Sadly, there’s no heart rate monitor on either. But you can track your fitness metrics, thanks to the accelerometer and gyroscope on board. Like most Android Wear watches, it connects to your phone via Bluetooth and uses your phone’s GPS. The current version of Android Wear is installed now, and an upgrade to version 2.0 will come in the near future, according to a Fossil representative. Related: Hands on: Android Wear 2.0 Android Wear 2.0 greatly improves the look and feel of the OS, so it can’t come soon enough. The watch was in demo mode and not connected to a phone when we tried it, so it’s impossible to comment fully on the experience. But as Android Wear is almost identical regardless of the watch it’s on, we doubt it’ll be drastically different to the Q Founder. Price and availability The Fossil Q Wander and Q Marshal are available to buy online for $295, or $315 depending on your choice of strap and case color, which is relatively cheap for a smartwatch. Fossil sells watch bands right on its site, too, or you can check out some on Amazon (buyer beware). Buy at Fossil Highs Attractive designs for both men and women You can use any 22mm strap Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 2100 Decent price for a smartwatch Lows No heart rate monitor Not waterproof Share

New commercial drone regulations, titled Part 107, are effective as of today. With the new regulations many expect a massive increase in U.S. commercial drone activity. Among other rule changes, any individual can become commercially licensed by taking an FAA-approved written test. Previously a private pilot’s license was required. “We estimate up to 40% of drone businesses currently use paper and pencil to monitor their organization,” said Emerick Varga, CEO of NVdrones. “In an industry that’s pushing technological limits each and every day, drone management tools lag far behind.” The company’s founders spoke with hundreds of drone pilots before they even wrote a single line of code for the app. During their research they found customizable checklists, real-time airspace and weather information, as well as team and equipment management, are must-have’s for any drone team. Over 500 companies deploying drones have signed up for their beta program, ongoing over the past 3 months. NVdrones separates itself from the competition by also analyzing high-quality equipment performance data. Varga explains they do this by analyzing the drone’s internal “black box” sensor data. “99% of commercial drones record crucial sensor data during every flight but there are insufficient tools to make sense of the data,” Varga said. “Established drone teams already use this data to get ahead of their competitors – now we’re bringing it to the rest of the industry.” The company’s technology also utilizes the AirMap Platform for best-in-class airspace intelligence.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search SlashGear’s Best of IFA 2016! Chris Davies - Sep 5, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit IFA 2016 has come and gone, and with hundreds if not thousands of new smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearable gadgets, and connected gizmos announced in Berlin, Germany. There’s plenty to choose from, but only a few stand-out devices worthy enough to win in SlashGear’s Best of IFA 2016 awards. Whether you’re already working on your holiday gift wishlist, or just need to get up to speed on what’s most exciting from this year’s show, we’ve got you covered. Best Smartphone – Huawei Nova Only a few years ago, most smartphone buyers hadn’t heard of Huawei. Today, it’s the number three smartphone maker in the world, and using that heft to introduce devices that not only compete with rivals on specifications, but generally undercut them on price, too. The Nova is an excellent example, a mix of affordability at 399 EUR, the style of a miniature Nexus 6P, and a features list that wouldn’t embarrass a phone costing several hundred Euros more. So, while the Huawei Nova wins our Best Smartphone of IFA 2016 award by virtue of its bargain status, it’s also an example of how the mid-range is where some of the most exciting movement in mobile is taking place. Best Tablet – ASUS ZenPad 3S 10 Is there still a market for Android tablets? It’s a tough segment, certainly, and it’s forcing some aggressive development by brands that still want to compete with Apple’s iPad. For ASUS, the recipe is a bright, high-resolution display, slimline construction, and affordable price, which about sums up the ZenPad 3S 10. We suspect it will really shine when Android 7.0 Nougat rolls out, at which point Google’s platform will be altogether more successful on large display devices for those with productivity and multitasking needs. Best Smartwatch – Samsung Gear S3 We had our doubts when Samsung struck out alone with Tizen as its smartwatch platform of choice, but solid designs like the new Gear S3 suggest the South Korean firm made the right decision. With an easy, straightforward interface courtesy of the rotating bezel and bright, sizable touchscreen; growing app selection including standalone Spotify streaming to Bluetooth headphones; and option built-in LTE alongside standard WiFi, the Gear S3 isn’t so much a smartphone companion as it is standalone communications device in its own right. In fact, the biggest complaint we have about the Gear S3 is its sheer size: this is a large watch, of not-inconsiderable thickness. If you’re generally found with a chronograph strapped to your wrist then you probably won’t notice, but those with either smaller arms or preferences might want to stick wth the Gear S2, which remains on sale alongside its bigger sibling. Most Innovative – Lenovo Yoga Book With 2-in-1s, detachable hybrids, convertibles, and ultrabooks, you’d think the laptop industry had run out of form-factors, but Lenovo proves that’s really not the case. The Yoga Book brings a new twist to the pen-enabled computing concept, putting its Wacom digitizer not into the display but instead behind the keyboard, and making the latter a TRON-esque sheet of touch-sensitive buttons. Not the machine for touch-typists, then, but for a generation content to hammer out several dozen words a minute on a touchscreen display it should be no great leap. Meanwhile, its possibilities as a mobile artists’ studio are almost overshadowed by its potential as a paper-to-digital notetaking device. It’s clever, and unusual, and certainly the most innovative thing we’ve seen at IFA this year. Best Fitness Wearable – Withings Steel HR Withings’ original fitness tracker remains one of the most beautiful examples of the category ever released, and the new Withings Steel HR continues in that vein. No neon rubber or blaring LEDs, just a harmonious blend of analog style and a compact but functional monochrome display, packaged up with 25 day battery life. Indeed, with the essentials of a smartwatch, you could certainly get away with skipping a more advanced wearable altogether and rely on the Steel HR for all your wrist computer needs. Still, it’s really as a discrete and handsome way to track fitness that it stands head and shoulders above its less stylish competition. Best Laptop – Lenovo Yoga 910 As starting points for refinement go, Lenovo’s Yoga 900 isn’t a bad place to begin. The Yoga 910 then cranks up the premium feel with a body made entirely from CNC aluminum, adds USB-C, a bigger and longer-lasting battery, and Intel’s latest 7th Generation Core processors. Most noticeable, however, is the improved display. Trimming the bezels even further allows for a 13.9-inch, 4K panel to be used, complete with touchscreen functionality. If you’re looking for a Windows 10 powerhouse, this is it. Best Accessory – Tile Slim Those looking for Bluetooth device tracking have no shortage of options, but few are as slender and stealthy as the new Tile Slim. The company has taken its previous tracker and flattened it out, cartoon-style, with a steamroller: the result is a wafer the thickness of two credit cards. Despite the dimensions, the location sharing abilities are undiluted, and so you get individual tracking of your laptop, tablet, suitcase, or anything else from your phone, and the crowdsourced assistance of all Tile users nearby. Most Promising Technology – Acer Star VR The tech world is not short of virtual reality headsets, but Acer distances itself from rivals by virtue of its higher-quality graphics and, perhaps more importantly, its strategy for content. The Acer Star VR‘s 5k resolution is impressive enough, but it’s the huge 210-degree field-of-view that really surprises: rivals like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive manage around 120-degrees in comparison. Meanwhile, a collaboration with IMAX will see Star VR the headset of choice at a growing number of IMAX VR booths around the world, delivering virtual reality content specially filmed with the company’s cameras by big budget directors on blockbuster projects. Will moviegoers pay a premium for 360-degree companion content? That remains to be seen, but it’s hard not to be wowed by just how immersive the Star VR experience can be. Best IoT/Smart Home – Philips Hue Motion Sensor The smartest smart home doesn’t need an app or Alexa or your smartwatch: it just reacts when necessary. On that basis, Philips’ Hue Motion Sensor is arguably a must-have for anybody who has stood on LEGO in the middle of the night or triggered family meltdowns by complaining about leaving the lights on when they’re not needed. Turning Hue’s wirelessly-connected bulbs on and off when you walk into the room is table-stakes, but the integrated ambient light sensing means the Motion Sensor can trigger different scenes depending on the time of day and how bright it is already. Meanwhile, being power-frugal enough to run on a set of batteries should make installation easy. Best Display – Samsung CF791 Curved Display IFA never has a shortage of big displays, but Samsung’s CF791 Curved Display still manages to stand out, despite being a minnow in relation to the company’s vast TVs. Offering the most significant curve of Samsung’s displays so far, not to mention a wide range of inputs and a clean design, the CF791 has the specifications to keep up with everyday gaming, not to mention graphic design and photo editing use. It may not be the cheapest display out there, but few will make such a statement on your desk – or such an impression on your eyes. Best of IFA 2016 – Lenovo Yoga Book At such a wide-ranging show as IFA, it can be difficult to pick just one product which represents the best of today’s technology. Nonetheless, the Lenovo Yoga Book stands out from the crowd by virtue of its premium, lightweight design, its innovative blend of touchscreen, virtual keyboard, and Wacom digitizer, and it’s surprisingly affordable price, kicking off at under $500. Whether you’re a student, a digital artist, or just an avid notetaker, the Yoga Book manages to feel both space-age and, crucially, usable. It’s clearly no mere experiment for Lenovo, either, with this first model only the start of a new family of notebooks that eschew the traditional input paradigms. It’s for all those reasons, and Lenovo’s eagerness to find new niches as the worlds of tablet and laptop combine, that the Yoga Book takes the SlashGear Best of IFA 2016 award.

No one likes a bully. Not even the bullies themselves, in truth. But no one sees a bully coming. At least until it is too late. Behind the flattery and initial friendship, it is hard to see the jealousy and resentment behind their eyes as they sniff out or wait for vulnerabilities. Inevitably, the mask slips, the undermining process begins, and the victim discovers all too late that they are all alone in a crowded room. That’s how Ireland looked to me last week after the EU Commission revealed a landmark ruling that Ireland must collect €13bn tax, plus interest, from Apple. Ireland looked alone and lost and, from a height, the European Commission damned Ireland for allegedly flouting state aid rules. ‘Not to appeal the European Commission’s ruling would be a massive disservice to the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who gave multinationals a return on their investment and then some’ The ruling outlined by Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is as big an existential threat to Ireland’s future as the fallout from Brexit. At the core of the ruling may be jealousy around Ireland’s 12.5pc corporate tax rate and the country’s success at winning foreign direct investment. But it wasn’t presented to the Irish people that way. Instead, a €13bn carrot was dangled in front of the masses and a populist agenda was ignited to claim the windfall. It was as if Ireland had won the lottery. While Apple itself was resolute from the get-go that it would appeal the decision in the European courts, the €13bn carrot caused an already vulnerable cabinet to dither and delay before a decision to appeal was finally reached on Friday. Was this by design? Are Ireland and Apple pawns in a wider game by the larger countries of Europe to achieve tax harmonisation? If this is the case, they are going about it in the wrong way. Aside from the press statement, little is known yet about how, precisely, the European Commission arrived at its €13bn figure. In the same breath as dangling the €13bn carrot, the EU helpfully suggested that other countries in the EU and elsewhere could require the taxes be paid locally. Talk about a contradiction. Picture a carrot dangling in front of a hungry beast of burden. The carrot was a complete misnomer. For now, the €13bn will sit in an escrow account while several years of court battles lie ahead. But the carrot had already been seized by populist politicians who mistakenly thought it was free money to suddenly spend on urgent issues like Ireland’s broken health system, the housing crisis and a lot more. Apple CEO Tim Cook dismissed the ruling as “maddening”, while both Cook and Ireland’s Finance Minister Michael Noonan TD pointed to how the figure made a mockery of sovereign tax laws – which individual states in the EU are entitled to – and agreements by retroactively applying taxes. IDA Ireland chief executive Martin Shanahan insisted Ireland does not do tax deals. For her part, Vestager denied the ruling was political. But from the ground, it looks like it was a week of misinformation following months of misinformation. Irish officials believed that Vestager would not announce the ruling until after the Budget in October. Even though they were told it would be bad, they also believed that that the figure could be as low as €1bn. Noonan stated publicly that the money, if it exceeded €1bn, could only be used to repay the national debt. Oh, actually, that is not so, chimed in EU officials rather helpfully. But it would be good policy to do so, of course. Once again, picture a carrot dangling in front of a donkey. “Nothing happens by accident,” a seasoned civil servant murmured drily on Friday. With friends like these … Let’s be really honest and admit that, in all of this, Ireland has hardly covered itself with glory. Until the previous government reluctantly shut down the so-called Double Irish, it was among a number of well-known tax avoidance schemes used by multinationals, along with others such as the Singapore Sling, the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich, the Bermuda Black Hole, and others. Across the world, it is an acknowledged truth that multinationals do not pay enough taxes on their profits. This is an issue that the United States government, and not only Europe, is keen to address. And this is why Ireland appealing the European Commission’s €13bn ruling against Ireland is so critical. It is about integrity. If Ireland is to defend its 12.5pc corporate tax rate in the face of manoeuvering to harmonise corporate taxes across Europe, it must demonstrate how this is now above board and completely legal. The 12.5pc tax rate is one of the few levers Ireland has to compete in the fast-moving world of foreign direct investment. Yes, we have brilliant, highly-educated people. Yes, Ireland is a wonderful place to do business. Yes, there are strong cultural ties with North America. And, yes, with Britain about to Brexit the EU, our stance as the only English-speaking economy in the union and the Eurozone is pivotal. It’s like a win-win, and that is also why the bigger countries of Europe are coming after us. When the UK voted to leave the EU, we Irish were astonished. That’s because we appreciate the value of what Europe has done for us: the ability to travel freely across borders, vital science and technology investments through Horizon 2020, and a hell of a lot more. And, yet, our loyalty to the European Experiment is being cynically tested. In the years before Ireland joined the EU, it was an economic backwater dependent on agriculture and trade with the UK. In the 1960s, fed up with never-ending emigration and a struggling economy, Taoiseach Seán Lemass and, later, Jack Lynch along with senior public servants like TK Whitaker decided to shake things up. They embarked on making Ireland an open, global economy and made education free for everyone. In 1973, approximately five decades after gaining independence from the UK, Ireland became a member of the EU – believe it or not, with the help of the UK. The most ardent opponent of Ireland joining the EU was Charles de Gaulle, president of France. It appears this haughty attitude of bigger countries over smaller countries has never left the EU and, if anything, it appears to be getting worse. I will never forget reading of the lonely feeling former finance minister, the late Brian Lenihan, described as he watched his airplane taxi to the gates at Brussels Airport in 2010 as snow fluttered outside the window. He was returning to Ireland having negotiated the terms of Ireland’s financial bailout and his back was to the wall. It was his job to tell the people the next day. The contentious terms were that Ireland would shoulder an incongrous 42pc of Europe’s entire banking debt. Children not even born today in Ireland will still be paying for this, decades from now. That was the price Ireland paid for not burning the bankers or bondholders. Iceland, which did so, is in rude economic health today. Other small countries were punished for their temerity in trying to stand up to the EU – Cyprus had its banking system shuttered and chaos ensued. The Greek tragedy is still being played out and Greece is bearing the brunt of the human tragedy of the migration of Syrian refugees from their war-torn country. Ironically, larger countries like Spain were able to negotiate a €100bn bailout on reasonable terms, while Italy is currently dealing with its financial crisis by subsidising its own banks from taxpayers’ money, which is against EU rules. Accepting the unfair decision to shoulder 42pc of Europe’s banking debt, Ireland was widely lauded – even by multinatinals – for taking its medicine and the country is only now slowly returning to a growing economy. US multinational investment overseas is at its peak. Europe is the go-to location because of its relative stability, and Ireland is capturing the lion’s share of this. No wonder the European overlords still aren’t happy. Another Greek tragedy in the making? In 1980, Ireland’s people were among the lowest paid in Europe, emigration was still rife and the country had a massive inferiority complex. Around that time, a four-year-old US tech company called Apple took a chance on Ireland, locating its first overseas manufacturing site in Cork. 37 years later, some of the first employees of the company still work there and some 5,000 people (soon to grow to 6,000) work at Apple across Ireland. In 1985, one of Apple’s biggest rivals, Microsoft, came a-callin’ to Dublin to manufacture software. It is still there, with over 1,200 people on book, and a new hi-tech campus being built in south Dublin. In 1989, Intel came to Ireland to make chips to fuel the PC revolution of the 1990s. Intel is still in Leixlip, with over 4,000 people moving to the latest chip building processes. In 2002, Google came to Dublin to create 80 jobs. Today it is Dublin’s biggest employer, with 6,000 people at work in the city. In the years since Apple, thousands of US companies, as well as companies from Europe and Japan, have taken a chance on Ireland, and Ireland – thanks to the volume of big name tech companies based here – can rightly claim the title of Silicon Valley of Europe. The truth is that every European capital would like to have Facebook headquarters. Dublin has already succeeded. In the years that followed Apple, hundreds of thousands of Irish people have worked in multinationals, and many can be discovered in senior positions in Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York and elsewhere, thanks to their start achieving a highly prized job with a US multinational. When I first started writing about technology in the 1990s, the plethora of jobs announcements laid the groundwork for the Tiger economy. This was great until people lost their heads on property. Back then, these investments weren’t known as foreign direct investment, but mobile investment. They were called mobile investments because there was the inherent understanding that these investments could move if a more advantageous location presented itself, or if the business environment changed. In recent weeks, eBay revealed it was closing its Dundalk operations with the loss of 150 jobs. And this is why Ireland’s decision to appeal the European Commission ruling is so important. Investment is in constant movement. Organisations like the IDA need to keep bringing in new investors, and local arms of global giants need to evolve to stay alive. There are currently 187,000 people at work in multinationals in Ireland today. For every one of these, there are at least two to three more people at work in the local economy because of the money the multinationals spend on everything from taxis and trucks, to loaves of bread or cartons of milk in the local supermarket. By this logic, a considerable share of up to 1m people in Ireland depend on, or are some way supported, by multinationals. The longevity of investments like those of Apple or Microsoft or Google or Intel in Ireland are not solely down to convenient tax arrangements. They are down to the hard work of local people and local management competing aggressively to win new responsibilities and evolve. Apple is no longer just manufacturing in Cork, it is the hub and spokes of a global wheel accounting for everything from legal, HR and finance to e-commerce, supply chain and, soon, data centres. Every single one if its highly-paid staff pay their taxes in Ireland. Why we must appeal Not to appeal the Commission’s ruling would be a massive disservice to the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who gave multinationals a return on their investment and then some. Not to appeal the Commission’s ruling would be a betrayal of companies that took a chance on Ireland when we had very few friends willing to help. Not to appeal the Commission’s ruling would be surrendering a corporate tax rate that is key to one of the few, unique things a country that missed out on the first industrial revolution had managed to create for itself in adverse circumstances. Thanks to our so-called friends in Europe,, Ireland has shouldered 42pc of Europe’s banking debt. We have signed away the rights to fishing. We have signed away the rights to oil and gas. We have even signed away the rights of people to cut turf. Failure to appeal this one last unique thing would have meant resetting the clock back to 1973. Ireland was correct to ignore the €13bn carrot mischievously presented last week. But with a Budget looming and a Government on fragile ground, the damage may already have been done. As a two-speed Europe emerges between big countries and small, it is time to bring the fight to Europe and show we will not be bullied any longer. At the very least, an appeal will get the facts out in the open.

... Kids on Computers and Unleash Kids at LinuxCon North America! Kids on Computers is a non-profit organization made up of volunteers — adults and kids. Founded in 2009, KOC sets up computer labs in locations worldwide, providing access to educational content which they otherwise would not be able to access. The computers have FOSS installed on them. Unleash Kids helps volunteer groups who work with kids by providing Internet in a Box (IIAB) community kits. This brings much of the online-educational content (such as offline Wikipedia, Khan academy, e-books and world-wide maps) to children in areas where there is no access to the internet. Earlier this year, Linux Foundation partnered with Kids on Computers which allowed KOC to have a booth at this year’s LinuxCon North America, as well as hold a workshop for children ages 7-15 on Kids Day. This was KOC’s first conference-based workshop. The kids worked on HP EliteBook laptops which were donated by the Linux Foundation, as well as 2 other laptops which KOC had from previous donations. In total, we had 15 computers for 19 children, so some had to pair up with a sibling or a buddy. We were that popular! The kids did their first Linux install by installing Ubermix from a flash drive. We had 20 USB flash drives, so each child was able to take one home! Once the system was installed, an introduction to Scratch programming took place for beginners, and an activity where they wrote a program to write their own name, for those who already had some exposure to Scratch. Tim Moody of Unleash Kids demonstrated how networking worked using an Intel NUC with IIAB. The kids connected to the IIAB access point, accessed content and then used the local network to ping each other, SSH into each other’s machines and transfer files using SCP. Additionally, in order to get ready for the afternoon workshop run by a local group called MakerKids, the children had to install the Arduino IDE (using Synaptic) and then download Ardublock. Graham Steele of MakerKids did an amazing job teaching about Arduino, LED’s, buzzers, batteries and everything Arduino! You could feel the excitement and positive energy in the room as lights lit up and buzzers buzzed! Many thanks to Linux Foundation, as the day would not have happened without them. A personal thank-you to Stormy Peters for connecting me with KOC! I cannot thank you enough. It was a great experience meeting and working with Avni Khatri, Adam Holt, Gustavo Silva, and Tim Moody! An incredible team through and through. A big thank-you to Miriam for allowing the team to hack at the rooftop pool overlooking mid-town, and opening up your home to us. Also, I would like to thank Ethan (7) and Chase (6) for volunteering to beta test our workshop by performing an Ubermix install and allowing us to introduce them to Tux and Scratch the night before the Kids Day workshop! They have been running Ubermix ever since! I would also like to thank Tim and Doina for hosting a lovely dinner party for the group in their home. Awesome food, company and chats. The work of KOC is made possible entirely by volunteer effort and donations. We also have KOC stickers available here.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict HP's slick ProBook 455 G3 is a weighty entrant into the mid-range laptop world, but don't expect blazing performance out of its AMD APU and meager 4GB of RAM. For Great build quality Stylish design Passable battery life Against Low-resolution display Heavy Not great value With the ProBook 455 G3, HP is hoping to lure business users looking for a relatively affordable laptop with a premium feel. In terms of design, it's an upgrade on HP's 255 G3 model and even moreso on the value-focused 250 G4. The 455 G3 feels more grown-up, and expensive, than both - but not necessarily more capable; surprisingly. At £504 (around US$666 or AUS$874), part of its price tag is down to the 455 G3's premium materials which include a brushed aluminum pattern on the keyboard base. Build quality is robust; the space on each side of the wrist rest is rock solid and resists flex well. At 2.1kg (4.6 pounds) this is a heavy 15-inch laptop and not the most backpack-friendly option out there. The ProBook 455 G3's dark grey plastic lid positions a reflective HP logo in the centre, lending the unit a moody and professional appearance. Opening it up reveals a combination of plastic and metal materials, with a stylish mesh speaker grille, silver trackpad and matte-black keyboard base. The rear of the lid features an eye-catching strip of metal that helps break up the seat of black plastic. Combined with the metal sides of the body underneath, it looks great. HP has made the sensible choice of keeping the base free of stickers, adding to its minimal allure. The 455 G3's shape is consistent with budget laptop lines, featuring rounded corners and a flimsy lid that contorts under little pressure. The unit's keyboard isn't anything special but it's functional enough, with a crisp and sharp low travel action thanks to its chiclet-spaced keys. Our review unit came equipped with an AMD A10-8700P Radeon R6 APU, which features 10 compute cores. The 455 G3 can be configured with a number of enterprise options including a TPM that helps protect the machine from BIOS-level attacks from viruses and malware; a spill-resistant backlit keyboard and HP's security policy software courtesy of an HP Touchpoint Manager app. Other software includes HP's Drive Encryption app, Security Manager, Microsoft Security Essentials, Microsoft Defender, Validity Fingerernt Driver, HP SoftPaq Download Manager, CyberLink Power2Go, PowerDVD and YouCam, along with HP Connection Manager, 3D Driveguard, Recovery Manager and Support Assistant. Performance is nippy enough on the desktop and the merger 4GB of RAM isn't too much of a problem, save for the occasional hitch if you're opening multiple browser windows and tabs. The biggest offender on this machine is its lowly 1,366 x 768 pixel-resolution display, which far from impresses with average contrast and color saturation. Even on full brightness it's difficult to see what you're doing outdoors, which isn't helped by the display's average horizontal and vertical viewing angles. The unit's ports situation is a little better - there's two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0, a headphone/microphone combo jack, Ethernet, and HDMI/VGA connections for hooking up the 455 G3 to an external displa. Benchmarks Cinebench R15: OpenGL: 23.13 fps; CPU: 200 points Geekbench (Single-Core): 2,076 points; (Multi-Core) 4,831 points Battery test (1080p looped video streamed over Wi-Fi in Edge, 50% brightness): 5 hours 31 minutes Laptops powered by AMD's APUs can often prove a savvy alternative to Intel-based ones with integrated graphics, as they can be capable of bringing superior graphics performance at as similar price. The ProBook 455 G3 unfortunately doesn't excel in this area, scoring a lower OpenGL score compared to the much more affordable HP 250 G4 that houses an Intel Core i3-5005U with integrated Iris graphics (23.13 fps, versus the 250's 24.6 fps). Battery runtimes were better than what the HP 250 G4 achieved, however; the HP ProBook G3's 4-cell 44 Whr Li-ion battery lasted for 5 hours and 31 minutes before giving up the ghost. Early verdict There are clear advantages here for business users thinking of stumping up cash for the ProBook 455 G3; Its build quality is excellent, there's a healthy selection of ports and it can reach up to around two hours more of battery life on a single charge compared to the more affordable HP 250 G4. That said, the AMD APU inside isn't much more impressive than the Intel Core chip in that cheaper model and even lost out in our graphics benchmark. For the price, though, the biggest offender is the ProBook 455 G3's low pixel-resolution display which is dull and simply does not have huge appeal stretched across 15 inches. What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

But first, it needs to come up with a useful product. Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 3, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Flickr/Creative Commons. Glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, wrist computers that read diagnostic nanoparticles injected in the blood stream, implantable devices that modify electrical signals that pass along nerves, medication robots, human augmentation, human brain simulation -- the list goes on. That's not an inventory of improbable CGI effects from the latest sci-fi movie, it's a list of initiatives being tackled by Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Life Sciences research unit, recently rebranded Verily. For those who appreciate The Motley Fool's affection for William Shakespeare, "verily" is Shakespearean-era word that means "truly," or "confidently." As in: "I verily believe that sweater is the ugliest one I have ever seen." Confidence certainly exemplifies Google. Verily was hatched from Google X, the company's secretive lab for oft-nutty projects, such as space elevators, teleportation, and hoverboards. Google X also launched Google Glass, which was undoubtedly a super-cool device, but wasn't received well by its intended market, to put it mildly.    With that kind of background, what are the chances Verily will unleash something that will change healthcare? Are good things about to flow? Or -- courtesy of the Bard of Avon -- is Verily merely a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing? Let's look at Verily's current financial situation and then check out the prospect of a marketable product that could move Google's needle. A pound of flesh, but no blood   Like the moneylender in the Merchant of Venice, Verily demands a pound of flesh from its parent each quarter. Alphabet, Google's newfangled conglomerate, doesn't break out the performance of subsidiaries, but last quarter's earnings report offered a view into costs and output. Verily is a subsidiary lumped under Other Bets with Google's broadband business and smart home company. Revenue from Other Bets doubled to $185 million from $74 million in the year-earlier period, and rose 11% sequentially. Costs also increased: Operating losses widened to $859 million from $660 million a year ago and moved up 7% from the previous quarter. Despite the costs incurred, it's certainly not bleeding its parent dry. After all, Google has an almost endless supporting budget, and if any of Verily's projects pan out, what's being expended now will look like pocket change. In addition, while some Verily ventures may seem frankly nuts, they might have actual potential. A recent joint venture with U.K. drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) will use implants that create electrical pulses to help the body heal itself. The collaborators have agreed to spend up to $716 million over seven years, with GSK holding 55% of the joint venture and Verily 45%. It's a new field, called bioelectronic medicine. Despite the quasi-scientific sound of this endeavor, early studies reported in peer-reviewed journals have shown positive results in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Sanofi, AbbVie, and Biogen  have also teamed up with Verily over the past few years. Big pharma hopes to tap into Google's data analysis tools, as well as license Verily's miniaturized medical devices (after they are developed), to tackle various disease targets. In a slightly different kind of venture, Johnson & Johnson has inked a deal with Verily to develop medical robots. The less you speak of your greatness, the more shall I think of it   None of these ventures have led to a useful product yet. Meanwhile, Verily has been skewered by multiple scientists for not critically assessing the actual potential behind its various moonshots. "One needs to balance how much these toys are used mostly for marketing and giving a sense of a company really working on something impressive -- the brave new world -- or if we're talking about something that will have clear and immediate clinical impact. The latter is very hard to imagine," said Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of disease prevention at Stanford University, commenting on Verily's projects.  In the blink of an eye In light of that, what about one of Verily's oldest initiatives? Looking back to 2012, the life sciences unit was originally developed to create "smart" contact lenses whose super-cool images were appearing all over the internet a scant two years ago. Designed to measure blood glucose levels, the lenses featured sensors and chips the size of flecks of glitter and a wireless antenna thinner than a human hair. On the face of it, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) lens seems to meet Ioannidis' criteria of having a "clear clinical impact." Better yet: it has an investable thesis. Verily and its big pharma partner Novartis (NYSE:NVS) are aiming straight at the $10 billion diabetes monitoring market. With this kind of market, the project was clearly capable of becoming a needle-moving revenue generator. Look a little deeper, though, and the view is cloudier. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) Executive VP Steve Pacelli pointed out, "Lots of companies have tried and failed noninvasively to sense glucose in tears. You can measure glucose in tears, but the concentration is a lot lower, there's going to be huge time lag issues; the consistency of measurement is going to be a challenge." There's a bigger problem. Both Dexcom and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) have continuous glucose monitors on the market, but both face a major hurdle. The FDA does not consider continuous glucose monitoring -- from any device -- accurate enough to prescribe insulin dosing by itself. While CGM devices are being used, their market is very limited, since they are only allowed to be used as supplemental devices. Google's CGM lens will face the same FDA hurdle -- assuming this product comes out of the lab. The long and short of it Apple, Microsoft, Intel -- virtually all the tech titans, in fact -- are now pursuing major initiatives in healthcare. A confluence of factors, such as digitization of records, machine intelligence, genetic engineering, and rapid advances in medical equipment, have made the field ripe for disruption from data-enabled, mobile-based, and miniaturized devices. Even more enticing are the opportunities to massively grow revenue. The tech giants are billion-dollar companies, but healthcare spending is approaching $3 trillion annually in the U.S. alone. Looking globally, the World Health Organization estimates the annual expenditure at $6.5 trillion. Bottom line: Despite the big carrot enticing it, Google has yet to come up with anything that can lay claim to changing healthcare. Although Alphabet could be a potentially interesting addition to your healthcare portfolio, it should be added with the understanding that there are many other pure-play companies with a much clearer path and investing thesis than Verily. Still, let's allow Shakespeare to have the final word. While the bard makes an unlikely investment guru, he had plenty of useful things to say that have lasted through centuries, including: "Though this be madness, yet there is method to it." In other words, it may be that hidden within Google's craziness lies the seed of something that could still astonish us. And no matter what, we can be sure of one thing: The ultimate search engine will keep grabbing headlines with its latest moonshots. After all, we're talking about Google.

So good luck with that HDMI Licensing says it's made the decision to hook up with USB-C because gazillions of devices will use it any month now, so it makes sense to give the people what they want and just let their new kit plug straight into tellies and monitors rather than making them pfaff about with dongles. The new cables will support HDMI 1.4b features such as resolutions up to 4K, Audio Return Channel, 3D, HDMI Ethernet Channel, and Consumer Electronic Control. All of which is good news for punters and handy for business device-buyers who can now plan on HDMI as a pretty sensible display standard. The news may be less well-received by Intel, which jumped through a lot of hoops to make its own Thunderbolt standard USB-C compatible but kept its own distinctive connector. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 70 Comments More from The Register Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Intel taps baton, tells the IoT orchestra to tune up Chipzilla updates dev environment for Thing connectivity We wanna give IoT folk kilobit data rates, beam NB-IoT telcos MBBF2016 Um.

Cyber security startup Cronus Cyber has raised $3.5 million. According to figures from the IVC database, the company has raised $6.2 million since it was founded, including the current round. CEO Doron Sivan and CTO Matan Azugi founded Cronus in 2014 and the company's announcement described Azugi as one of the world's leading hackers. Cronus's product uses an algorithm to try to imitate a human hacker's way of thinking. Former Israeli Air Force chief Eitan Ben Eliyahu is the company's chairman. RELATED ARTICLES Cyber security co Cronus raises $2.2m Cronus's financing round included US fund Janvest Capital Partners, a European investor, and a strategic investor from Hong Kong. The company previously received funding from the Ministry of the Economy and Industry Chief Scientist. The company's headquarters are in Haifa, and it also does business in the UK, Germany and Hong Kong. The money raised is expected to enable Cronus to expand its business to the US. Cronus is also active in the local market, and notes that its product is currently installed at a series of financial concerns, including First International Bank of Israel (TASE: FTIN). The company adds that its solution is also installed at large organizations, including some appearing on the Fortune 1000. Sivan said today "We're proud of our new investor. His investment will enable us to emphasize Far Eastern markets, which according to the Gartner report will soon be leading the world." He added, "We're also proud of the trust that the existing investors have shown by again investing in us." Cronus director and Janvest managing director and venture partner Sinai Bareket, a former Intel Israel marketing and sales manager, said, "The experience, know-how, and sophistication of the Cronus entrepreneurs and team have been channeled for the purpose of establishing a unique platform, and we believe in its business potential in the US and in the rest of the world."

This year, at the three-day Huawei Connect event held in a giant arena on the banks of Shanghai’s Huangpu River, the company outlined a plan for getting there. In a keynote speech, Ken Hu, one of Huawei’s three rotating CEOs, said the company aims to position itself as the enabler and driver of an intelligent world. Over the next three days the meaning of these words became clear: Huawei will sell the hardware and software other companies need to build their own clouds. Ambitious Becoming the leading IT company was, and remains, an ambitious goal. It means taking on the likes of HP, Cisco and IBM. These US technology giants are long-established, well-known global brands. They have long-standing customers and deep relationships. Every technology company likes to talk about disruption as if they invented the term. For some of the dinosaurs it is just an idea they pay lip-service to. At Huawei, disruption is a way of life. Over the last decade and a half Huawei pulled off an audacious, disruptive take-over of the telecommunications equipment sector. A decade earlier that industry was dominated by its own set of secure, long-established western giants. Now most of those names have disappeared. Phone disruption More recently Huawei disrupted the mobile phone market. Its first handsets were low-cost models. Huawei sold then to telecommunications carriers who in turn sold the phones to customers using their own brands. Huawei realised these devices were good enough to sell in their own right. Today Huawei is the third biggest phone maker behind Samsung and Apple. Now it’s the turn of the information technology incumbents to face disruptive Huawei. These are already difficult times for traditional information technology companies. For year they sold high margin products and services to a world hungry for computers and software. Those high margins were under pressure for a generation, but that was nothing compared to the threat from cloud computing. Infrastructure-as-a-service Many organisations have stopped or slowed down their IT capital expenditure purchases. Instead they spend operational expenditure money buying infrastructure-as-a-service cloud services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Where they once installed expensive and complex applications, they now buy software-as-a-service from the likes of Salesforce, Netsuite and SAP by design. This shift in spending, from traditional IT equipment to cloud services is the key to Huawei’s ambition. Extend the brand In some ways it is a classic brand extension exercise. Huawei’s most important customers have always been the telecommunications carriers. Huawei sells them wireless and fixed line network equipment. In New Zealand it does business with Spark, Vodafone, 2degrees and Chorus. Now many of these companies are embracing cloud computing. Spark New Zealand has made huge cloud investments. It is one of the largest local cloud service providers. Many other telecommunication service providers in countries like China and Germany are starting their own cloud offerings. Huawei already has the relationships in place with these telecommunications firms. It also has a track record of delivering. So it makes perfect sense for telecommunications companies to buy the hardware they need to operate cloud services from the same company that sells them network equipment. And that’s the key to Huawei’s strategy. Another of the company’s three rotating CEOs, Eric Xu, says the company isn’t going after Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, at least not on a global scale and not at this stage. No public clouds...yet He says Huawei will work with service providers for public clouds; “We don’t plan to provide public clouds outside of China.” In the rest of the world Huawei provides the infrastructure other companies need to build their clouds. Huawei also says it doesn’t plan to operate at the higher levels of, say, software-as-a-service, it wants to build the pipes, although it stresses these are intelligent pipes. Telecommunications carriers building cloud projects are the low-hanging fruit for Huawei, but they are just the start, the company intends to sell its cloud products to every company. Xu says there are plans to help organisations in sectors such as finance build clouds, but there’s an even bigger opportunity with manufacturing and industrial companies. He sees room for thousands of new specialist industry-specific clouds. Product firehose There are a lot of cloud products. At Huawei Connect the company announced a slew including 31 FusionCloud Services, FusionStorage 6.0 and the FusionStage PaaS Platform. There are faster switches and faster processors. To get this moving Huawei is looking to forming partnerships and to stick with open source software. Partners were visible at Huawei Connect, executives from Infosys, SAP, Intel and China Telecom among others gave keynote presentations. In a cavernous building next door, expo space was given over to others including Toshiba and SuSE. Outside the Huawei Connect arena, massive industrial barges chug slowly up the river under yellow, smoggy clouds. There’s a powerful metaphor in the contrast between the old face of Chinese industry and the new one. Huawei has a proven track record and a willingness to do the hard work needed to make ambitious plans succeed. It knows how to deliver customer value. There’s every reason to believe it can disrupt the information technology business.
