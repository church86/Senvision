According to the report, the new Mac chip may be used for low-power tasks that currently rely on Intel’s chip to process. The report does not detail a full switch to ARM chips for the Mac, however, noting that Macs will still rely on Intel processors unlike iPhones and iPads which are totally ARM-based. Issues with Intel preparing new chips in time to be used with Macs has fueled speculation that Apple could eventually switch to ARM-based chips in the future. For now, the new ARM chip would potentially be used for dedicated tasks like maintaining background app activity which could preserve battery life. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. […] Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. The report specifies that Apple may be planning to introduce the new chip in updated MacBook Pros as soon as this year. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Relying on a dedicated chip for specific tasks could be a benefit to battery life which has been an issue with Apple’s latest MacBooks Pro models. iPhone, for example, features a dedicated co-processor that focuses on step tracking and listening for the ‘Hey Siri’ voice prompt. Apple already includes a custom ARM chip called the T1 with its latest MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Separately, new models of the MacBook Pro are expected to take advantage of Intel’s new Kaby Lake generation chips and and step up to 32 GB of RAM on notebooks which has not yet been an option. Apple is also expected to be preparing new iMacs with updated specs including USB-C after the last refresh occurred over a year ago.

So I tried to download the latest update from the Intel website, but because of how Acer modified my graphics card, the Intel update refuses to proceed. They told me to contact my manufacturer but my warranty is expired and Acer refuses to answer my calls. Acer does not have any graphics card updates for my Aspire E5-571. I'd like to get the generic Intel driver rather than this outdated Acer driver. Can anyone help me with that? If you need me to provide any more specifications, just ask and I'll update the post! I have my DxDiag and MSinfo on a text file too if that's necessary (I don't know much about computer support but if I forgot anything, I'll add it!)

Kontron has stepped up to Intel’s “Kaby Lake” generation by launching three COM Express Type 6 modules supporting the latest 7th Generation Intel Core and Xeon processors. The 95 x 95mm Compact form factor COMe-cKL6 and the 125 x 95mm Basic COMe-bKL6 are both available in 0 C to 60°C and -25 to 75°C versions. The bKL6R E2S, which is otherwise almost identical to the COMe-bKL6, comes standard with industrial -40 to 85°C support. COMe-cKL6 (left) and COMe-bKL6 (and COMe-bKL6R E2S) (click images to enlarge) Like Kontron’s 6th Gen “Skylake” based COMe-cSL6 Type 6 Compact and COMe-bSL6 and bSL6R E2S Type 6 Basic modules, the Kaby Lake models support Linux, and offer the new Kontron Security Solution. The latter comprises a security chip, Kontron’s Approtect software framework, and optional services. (For more information, see our COMe-bSL6 and bSL6R E2S coverage.) The new COMs follow many other Kaby Lake Com Express modules announced over the last few months. However, most of these are only becoming available this quarter, so the now shipping Kontron modules aren’t really that behind after all. The most recently announced Kaby Lake Com Express was Congatec’s Conga-TS175 Type 6 Basic module. Like the Conga-TS175, but not many others, Kontron’s new modules come with promised support for Intel Optane non-volatile memory technology. Intel Optane, which will ship in a few months, and is supported on associated carrier boards, but not the module itself, “works up to 1,000 times faster than a NAND flash memory and massively reduces latencies,” says Germany based Kontron. Like other Compact Kaby Lake offerings, the COMe-cKL6 taps Intel’s dual-core, 15W TDP U-Series in Core i7, i5, i3, and Celeron 3965U flavors up to a 2.8GHz Core i7-7600U. These dual-core models offer integrated I/O control functions rather than the discrete controller chipsets found on the models supported by the two Basic models The COMe-bKL6 and bKL6R E2S instead follow other Basic Kaby Lake modules in supporting faster, but less power efficient Kaby Lake chips. The COMe-bKL6 provides quad-core Core i7 and i5 EQ models, ranging from 2.1/2.9GHz (25W) for the Core i5-7442EQ to 3.0/3.7GHz (45W/35W) for the Core i7-7820EQ. The COMe-bKL6 can also run dual-core Core i3-E models at 2.1GHz (25W) and 2.9GHz (35W) as well as a pair of server class, quad-core Xeon-E3 models. The COMe-bKL6 offers an Intel Mobile CM238 or QM175 I/O chipset depending on the processor model. The industrial temperature bKL6R E2S, meanwhile, supports only the i3-E and Xeon-E3 parts mentioned above, not the i5 and i7 chips. The E2S module ships with an Intel Mobile CM238 chipset. The Compact COMe-cKL6 offers Intel Graphics 620 except for on the Celeron, which has Intel Graphics 610. The Basic COMs furnish Intel HD Graphics 630 for the Core chips and Graphics P630 for the Xeons. All these graphics offerings offer slight improvements over Skylake graphics. Aside from Intel chip support and the temperature range, the only difference between the two Basic modules is that the COMe-bKL6 has wide-range 8.5-20W supply while the rugged bKL6R E2S offers a choice of standard ATX or single-supply power inputs. The Compact COMe-cKL6 also offers an 8.5-20W supply. COMe-bKL6 block diagram (click image to enlarge) The Compact COMe-cKL6 module supports up to 24GB DDR4 by way of 8GB memory down and a 16GB SODIMM. By contrast, the COMe-bKL6 and bKL6R E2S give you up to the full 32GB DDR4-2400 via dual SODIMMs. On the other hand, the COMe-cKL6 is the only model to offer an option for up to 64GB of SLC eMMC 5.0 onboard flash. COMe-bKL6 (left) and COMe-bKL6R E2S block diagrams (click images to enlarge) Other major differences appear in SATA and PCIe support. The COMe-cKL6 has 2x SATA 3.0 interfaces vs. 4x on the Basic modules. The Compact model provides 5x PCIE 3.0 on PCIe lanes 0-4 and 4x PCIe 3.0 on PEG lanes 0-3, while the COMe-bKL6 and bKL6R E2S each offers 8x PCIe x1 and 1x PEG x16 interfaces. However, the Compact COMe-cKL6 gives you an option for swapping out other features for an additional PCIe x1 interface. Standard features on all three COMs include an Intel I219LM GbE controller, support for 4x USB 3.0 and 4x USB 2.0 ports, dual serial interfaces, and HD audio. They all have triple display support, with individual displays up to 4k@60Hz resolution. You get dual DP++ interfaces and what appears to be a choice of VGA, dual-channel, 18/24-bit LVDS, or eDP. Other common features include SPI, LPC, SMB, Fast I2C, staged watchdog, RTC, TPM 2.0, ACPI 4.0, and optional VPro. They all support Linux, Windows 10, or VxWorks. Common options include various heatspreader and other cooling solutions. COMe Ref.Carrier T6 (left) and COMe Eval Carrier T6 detail views (click images to enlarge) All three modules give you a choice of two optional carrier boards: a 170 x 170mm Mini-ITX COMe Ref.Carrier T6 and a more feature rich, 305 x 244mm COMe Eval Carrier T6 ATX board. The Ref.Carrier model stands out with its SIM Card slot while the Eval Carrier provides more I/O, including additional USB 3.0, DisplayPort, and PCIe interfaces.

Many top blue-chip companies offer income streams of between 3 and 6 per cent a year to reward investors for holding their stock, a far higher return than you will get from any savings account. Dividends also offer the prospect of a rising income stream, as most companies aim to increase the size of their payouts year after year. Yet too many investors fixate on share price growth when deciding which stocks to buy, and ignore the income on offer. Over the longer run, dividend payments can account for three-quarters of your total return from stocks and shares, provided you automatically reinvest them back into the stock for future growth. After you have retired, the dividends can top-up your pension. While investing in stocks and shares will always be riskier than leaving your money in the bank, it may be more rewarding in the longer run. You can reduce the dangers by holding for the long term, at least five years and preferably 10 years or longer and further limit your risk by picking a diversified range of stocks covering different markets, sectors and geographical regions. Dividend income is not guaranteed: companies may cut their payouts if, say, profits fall, although management is reluctant to do so as this sends out negative signals and punishes the share price. Dividend income is also potentially exposed to taxes. Here, the experts select 10 global companies that could help you come out on top. newslide US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) Tom Anderson, investment manager at UK-based Killik & Co, which has clients in the UAE, rates Bancorp as a top income stock. Mr Anderson says the US banking sector looks attractive right now, with the US Federal Reserve the only central bank in the world that is actually looking to increase interest rates. Higher rates will benefit US banks because they give them an opportunity to increase their margins on the money they lend to personal and business customers, he says. “Bancorp is a high-quality play on domestic US banking and looks set to continue generating healthy cash returns.” Bancorp currently trades at a 15 per cent premium to larger rival US banks, Mr Anderson notes. “We believe this premium is justified given the group’s industry leading returns and lower risk profile. It also offers high returns on tangible equity, which are now close to 20 per cent.” The prospective dividend yield is relatively low at 2.3 per cent but Anderson expects this to rise at a rapid rate, between, say, 7 and 9 per cent a year, giving investors a rising income stream. “Bancorp is a high quality play on the US banking sector under a Donald Trump presidency, offering a combination of both income and share price growth.” Income yield: 2.3 per cent newslide Novo Nordisk (OMX: NOVO.B) Mr Anderson also picks the global health care company, Novo Nordisk, as one of his top global income plays. The company, headquartered in Denmark, employs approximately 42,600 people in 75 countries and markets its products in more than 180 countries. “It is one of the world’s largest health care companies, with an industry-leading position in treatment of diabetes, one of the world’s fastest-growing health threats.” The rising cost of prescription drugs is a major concern and Trump threatened on the campaign trail to squeeze prices, which knocked its share price, although it is still up 80 per cent over the past five years. Mr Anderson says recent slippage could be a good buying opportunity. “The company now trades at the lowest valuation in 10 years, putting it in line with its peers. Yet we believe the shares deserve to trade at a premium given the long-term growth opportunity in diabetes.” Novo Nordisk also has a strong track record of generating cash and returning this to shareholders. “As well as a progressive dividend, with a current yield of 2.5 per cent, the company uses 95 per cent of free cash flow after dividends for share buy-backs, further boosting shareholder returns.” Income yield: 2.5 per cent newslide Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Chipmaker Intel Corporation was a key figure in computing until recently, dominating the PC sector along with Microsoft. However, it has been hit by the slowdown in global shipments of desktops and laptops, failing to cash in on the surge in tablet and smartphone sales. Intel’s PC chip business is still profitable, making up around half of company revenues, but management is now looking elsewhere for growth. Profits fell sharply last year but Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at online trading platform IG, which recently opened offices in Dubai, says Intel is now putting recent troubles behind it and is looking to complete the shift from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. “Intel has re-energised its performance with a focus on chips for data centres and on automation technologies that are a key part of the shift to the Internet of Things and cloud computing,” he says. The share price is up 40 per cent over the past five years. Mr Beauchamp adds: “The current yield of 2.85 per cent is lower than in previous years, but this is a sign of increasing investor confidence, which has pushed the stock price higher with hopes of more to come.” Income yield 2.85 per cent newslide ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) It is has been a tough few years for the oil industry, with the price of a barrel of crude plunging below $30 in January last year. Brent crude has since recovered to trade above $55 a barrel and this has helped oil stocks away from their recent lows. Mr Beauchamp picks ExxonMobil as one of his favourite global income plays. The US oil giant has inevitably been hit by the slump in oil prices, with its share price up just 13 per cent over the past five years. However, it has just posted healthy full-year earnings of $7.8 billion and fourth-quarter earnings of $1.7bn, while cash flow more than covered the company’s dividends and net investments. Quarterly earnings actually fell due to a one-off $2 billion impairment charge but Mr Beauchamp says the outlook for ExxonMobil should continue to improve. “Production costs have fallen over the past year, while there are signs that emerging market demand is picking up. With a current yield of around 3.60 per cent and an oil market that is far healthier than it was a year ago, ExxonMobil seems to be reclaiming its place as one of the key income stocks.” Income yield: 3.60 per cent newslide Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) Another health care stock selected by Mr Anderson is Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. The company is split into three divisions covering pharmaceuticals, medical devices such as surgical instruments, and consumer health care and beauty products. “Diversification is strength because the company is not dependent on the success of a small number of products.” J&J, as it is known, is one of only two US companies to be rated “AAA” by all three major ratings agencies, Fitch Group, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Microsoft is the other. “Income seekers have benefited from rising cash flows and a shareholder-friendly approach, with dividends and share buy-back payouts totalling over $57 billion in the last five years, equating to over 80 per cent of free cash flow.” The company’s share price is up nearly 75 per cent over the past five years, it has just reported a steady 1.7 per cent rise in sales during the final quarter of last year and it yields 3 per cent – something Mr Anderson expects to grow as the company’s earnings should continue to rise. Income yield: 3 per cent newslide Nestlé (VTX: NESN) Swiss-based international Nestlé is the world’s largest food company, measured by revenues, offering everything from baby food to bottled water, breakfast cereals, coffee and tea, ice cream, frozen food and snacks. Top brands include Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Maggi, Carnation, Vittel, Häagen-Dazs and Mövenpick. The share price has performed solidly, rising 36 per cent over the past five years, and Mr Beauchamp describes the company as a steady income play. “Consumer staples never go out of vogue, and Nestlé’s broad suite of products means it is relatively immune to changing fashions,” he says. He warns that Nestlé may not grow as rapidly as some companies, but investors will enjoy the taste of its progressive income stream, with a current yield of 3.2 per cent a year. Income yield: 3.2 per cent newslide National Grid (LSE: NG) Publicly-quoted utility companies are considered one of the steadiest income sources of all, offering a basic service to millions of customers. London-listed National Grid is a twist on this theme because it doesn’t actually supply gas and electricity. Instead, its job is to operate essential infrastructure that keeps the energy flowing in both the UK and north-eastern US. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at UK stockbrokers The Share Centre, says it manages an everyday necessity for which there is constant demand. “This gives it relatively steady earnings and cash flow streams. In effect, National Grid is a natural monopoly.” National Grid currently yields a steady income of 4.67 per cent, and aims to increase this each year in line with the UK’s retail price index (RPI), which stood at 2.5 per cent in December. Mr Miah says the company recently announced plans to sell a majority stake in its gas distribution business and return £4 billion from the sale to shareholders, probably in the form of a special dividend. Recent share price performance has disappointed but National Grid continues to benefit from recent weakness in sterling, which boosts the value of its US dollar earnings. Income yield: 4.67 per cent newslide HSBC (LSE: HSBA) HSBC bank may be listed in London but China and Asia are its primary focus, making it a truly global bank. It survived the financial crisis in better shape than many banks but performance has been hit by the slowdown in China, and fears over the country’s credit and property bubble. However, its share price has rallied lately, up nearly 40 per cent in the last six months alone, and it currently offers a strong income stream of 5.06 per cent. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at UK stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says the bank has been through a major restructuring process and remains a work in progress. “It aims to become much more focused on its Asian roots, and far less exposed to volatile investment banking activities.” Income yield: 5.06 per cent newslide Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB) Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is another beneficiary of the recent rally in oil prices, its share price rising almost 50 per cent over the last 12 months. Shell hasn’t cut its dividend since the second world war and Mr Miah says that proud record should continue. “Shell’s dividend now looks more secure as oil stabilises, making it a suitable stock for medium-risk investors seeking income.” Royal Dutch Shell is the largest listed company in the UK, an oil explorer, producer and refiner that also owns and operates filling stations worldwide, he adds. “It is completing major capital investment programmes which should boost efficiency, increase production capacity and create higher cash flows.” Shell’s refining business is performing well and mitigating some of the earnings lost due to cheaper crude. “It is the ideal company for investors looking to benefit from a longer-term recovery in the oil price.” Income yield: 5.54 per cent newslide SSE (LSE: SSE) London-listed utility company SSE has increased its dividend every single year since 1992, which is an incredible record. Better still, it has increased its payout at a compound annual rate of almost 10 per cent a year. Currently, the stock yields 5.96 per cent, and management is aiming to increase that in line with inflation going forward, as measured by the UK retail prices index. Mr Khalaf says SSE has invested more than £9 billion over the last six years but has made a disappointing return on this money. The dividend has been propped up by proceeds from asset disposals, debt, and share issuance and could be reduced unless cash flow improves. “The big question is whether SSE’s long-term investments will produce the cash required to sustain the generous dividend,” Mr Khalaf adds. Income yield: 5.96 per cent David Paul Morris / Bloomberg Jean-Francois Monier / AFP Mauritz Antin / EPA Matthew Brown / AP Photo Mike Blake / Reuters Fabrice Coffrini / AFP Simon Dawson / Bloomberg Matt Cardy / Getty Images Adrian Dennis / AFP Oli Scarff / AFP A high-dividend income is a thing of beauty in today’s low-interest rate world.

Profits fell sharply last year but Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at online trading platform IG, which recently opened offices in Dubai, says Intel is now putting recent troubles behind it and is looking to complete the shift from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. “Intel has re-energised its performance with a focus on chips for data centres and on automation technologies that are a key part of the shift to the Internet of Things and cloud computing,” he says. The share price is up 40 per cent over the past five years. Mr Beauchamp adds: “The current yield of 2.85 per cent is lower than in previous years, but this is a sign of increasing investor confidence, which has pushed the stock price higher with hopes of more to come.” Income yield 2.85 per cent newslide ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) It is has been a tough few years for the oil industry, with the price of a barrel of crude plunging below $30 in January last year. Brent crude has since recovered to trade above $55 a barrel and this has helped oil stocks away from their recent lows. Mr Beauchamp picks ExxonMobil as one of his favourite global income plays. The US oil giant has inevitably been hit by the slump in oil prices, with its share price up just 13 per cent over the past five years. However, it has just posted healthy full-year earnings of $7.8 billion and fourth-quarter earnings of $1.7bn, while cash flow more than covered the company’s dividends and net investments. Quarterly earnings actually fell due to a one-off $2 billion impairment charge but Mr Beauchamp says the outlook for ExxonMobil should continue to improve. “Production costs have fallen over the past year, while there are signs that emerging market demand is picking up. With a current yield of around 3.60 per cent and an oil market that is far healthier than it was a year ago, ExxonMobil seems to be reclaiming its place as one of the key income stocks.” Income yield: 3.60 per cent newslide Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) Another health care stock selected by Mr Anderson is Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest and most diversified health care companies in the world. The company is split into three divisions covering pharmaceuticals, medical devices such as surgical instruments, and consumer health care and beauty products. “Diversification is strength because the company is not dependent on the success of a small number of products.” J&J, as it is known, is one of only two US companies to be rated “AAA” by all three major ratings agencies, Fitch Group, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Microsoft is the other. “Income seekers have benefited from rising cash flows and a shareholder-friendly approach, with dividends and share buy-back payouts totalling over $57 billion in the last five years, equating to over 80 per cent of free cash flow.” The company’s share price is up nearly 75 per cent over the past five years, it has just reported a steady 1.7 per cent rise in sales during the final quarter of last year and it yields 3 per cent – something Mr Anderson expects to grow as the company’s earnings should continue to rise. Income yield: 3 per cent newslide Nestlé (VTX: NESN) Swiss-based international Nestlé is the world’s largest food company, measured by revenues, offering everything from baby food to bottled water, breakfast cereals, coffee and tea, ice cream, frozen food and snacks. Top brands include Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Maggi, Carnation, Vittel, Häagen-Dazs and Mövenpick. The share price has performed solidly, rising 36 per cent over the past five years, and Mr Beauchamp describes the company as a steady income play. “Consumer staples never go out of vogue, and Nestlé’s broad suite of products means it is relatively immune to changing fashions,” he says. He warns that Nestlé may not grow as rapidly as some companies, but investors will enjoy the taste of its progressive income stream, with a current yield of 3.2 per cent a year. Income yield: 3.2 per cent newslide National Grid (LSE: NG) Publicly-quoted utility companies are considered one of the steadiest income sources of all, offering a basic service to millions of customers. London-listed National Grid is a twist on this theme because it doesn’t actually supply gas and electricity. Instead, its job is to operate essential infrastructure that keeps the energy flowing in both the UK and north-eastern US. Helal Miah, investment research analyst at UK stockbrokers The Share Centre, says it manages an everyday necessity for which there is constant demand. “This gives it relatively steady earnings and cash flow streams. In effect, National Grid is a natural monopoly.” National Grid currently yields a steady income of 4.67 per cent, and aims to increase this each year in line with the UK’s retail price index (RPI), which stood at 2.5 per cent in December. Mr Miah says the company recently announced plans to sell a majority stake in its gas distribution business and return £4 billion from the sale to shareholders, probably in the form of a special dividend. Recent share price performance has disappointed but National Grid continues to benefit from recent weakness in sterling, which boosts the value of its US dollar earnings. Income yield: 4.67 per cent newslide HSBC (LSE: HSBA) HSBC bank may be listed in London but China and Asia are its primary focus, making it a truly global bank. It survived the financial crisis in better shape than many banks but performance has been hit by the slowdown in China, and fears over the country’s credit and property bubble. However, its share price has rallied lately, up nearly 40 per cent in the last six months alone, and it currently offers a strong income stream of 5.06 per cent. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at UK stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says the bank has been through a major restructuring process and remains a work in progress. “It aims to become much more focused on its Asian roots, and far less exposed to volatile investment banking activities.” Income yield: 5.06 per cent newslide Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB) Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is another beneficiary of the recent rally in oil prices, its share price rising almost 50 per cent over the last 12 months. Shell hasn’t cut its dividend since the second world war and Mr Miah says that proud record should continue. “Shell’s dividend now looks more secure as oil stabilises, making it a suitable stock for medium-risk investors seeking income.” Royal Dutch Shell is the largest listed company in the UK, an oil explorer, producer and refiner that also owns and operates filling stations worldwide, he adds. “It is completing major capital investment programmes which should boost efficiency, increase production capacity and create higher cash flows.” Shell’s refining business is performing well and mitigating some of the earnings lost due to cheaper crude. “It is the ideal company for investors looking to benefit from a longer-term recovery in the oil price.” Income yield: 5.54 per cent newslide SSE (LSE: SSE) London-listed utility company SSE has increased its dividend every single year since 1992, which is an incredible record. Better still, it has increased its payout at a compound annual rate of almost 10 per cent a year. Currently, the stock yields 5.96 per cent, and management is aiming to increase that in line with inflation going forward, as measured by the UK retail prices index. Mr Khalaf says SSE has invested more than £9 billion over the last six years but has made a disappointing return on this money. The dividend has been propped up by proceeds from asset disposals, debt, and share issuance and could be reduced unless cash flow improves. “The big question is whether SSE’s long-term investments will produce the cash required to sustain the generous dividend,” Mr Khalaf adds.

At its core, initiating a transformation starts with taking the time to understand the nature and scope of the changes that have remodelled the competitive landscape. In a nutshell, all e-disruptions have one thing in common —they profoundly reduce information asymmetry between different actors within a market (for instance, an apartment owner and a traveller), by making information immediately accessible. At a strategic level, this new world reduces power asymmetries between leaders and followers, makes it easier for new entrants to quickly penetrate a market or gain influence (for example, a new product or a rising star savvy with social media). With search engines processing a staggering 3.5 billion requests a day and massive quantities of content available through social media, digital data represents the richest resource of insights available to companies At an operational level, the enormous corpus of digital data becomes the new lifeblood that flows within and outside of key stakeholders including consumers, competitors and collaborators. To tackle the challenge of digital data, building agility and responsiveness around data becomes the new criteria that distinguish front-runners from the rest of the pack. Successfully driving the digital transformation typically means conducting concurrent changes in three areas where digital technologies and data profoundly change the face of business. The first area is intelligence and requires seeing digital data as a source of insight and using this data in knowledge-creation processes to create competitive advantages. With search engines processing a staggering 3.5 billion requests a day and massive quantities of content available through social media, digital data represents the richest resource of insights available to companies. Building intelligence capabilities based on this data starts with listening to social chatter and engaging in conversations about topics that speak to customers or relevant stakeholders. For instance, Intel in Asia Pacific has been particularly effective at building such capabilities, giving the organisation the means to listen to online chatters relevant to the brand and to engage in interaction with the online community to strengthen Intel’s core values. In one case, when sexist comments on women engineers that were contrary to Intel’s values appeared online in 2016, it only took a few minutes for Intel to capture this information. Next, the brand decided to engage in the conversation and highlight its own views regarding diversity and inclusion. In a matter of hours, the company pushed back by filming and sharing a couple of aspirational interviews of female engineers working at Intel. The quick response successfully grasped the attention of key audiences for Intel, from customers to applicants and business partners and contributed to showcasing Intel as a leader in this regard, further strengthening its brand positioning. Moving beyond conversations, an increasing number of companies are starting to integrate insights from social media and online searches to generate short-term insights and optimise operational decision-making. For instance, l’Oréal Paris actively tracks online chatters regarding hairstyles or skincare and integrates such insights into key operational decisions before it launches new brands and products. In an increasingly fast-paced, fast-changing competitive landscape, embracing the digital transformation can mean the difference between retaining leadership, losing ground and eventually being pushed out of the game In one case, the company even named a new brand after a very popular term that consumers were using when searching and discussing a hairstyle online (“Ombre”). At a highest level, the combined sum of insights from consumers, competitors and the media often reveals fresh new insights about a brand – the “unknowns-unknowns” that matter for strategy building: which markets to enter, which positioning to favour, what potential risks might emerge? For example, Tsquared, a pioneer in search analytics, works with several Asian brands from energy to FMCG and pharmaceuticals to help them understand their digital footprint and better leverage their brand by mapping relevant search behaviours and trends. Band requires leveraging digital channels to transform organisational processes and create agility. While the C-suite often recognises the importance of digital for companies, too many still decide to outsource the design and implementation of digital initiatives to agencies or consultancies. Outsourcing is not without any risks as companies deprive access to prime knowledge (insights) and become less familiar with digital technologies. In addition, they may end up losing touch with relevant digital data. By keeping the task in-house, firms advance organisational learning and ultimately increase company performance. To this end, AccorHotels recently acquired an Australian geolocalisation solution company which can identify pictures posted on social media anytime they have been taken from an AccorHotels’ location. This enables hotels to collect strategic information from social media and online channels, allowing them to become more customer-centric by following its customers along each step of their journeys. Successful integration first involves the creation of a common repository on successful and less successful initiatives accessible across the company’s different divisions to keep track of online and offline initiatives – a sort of digital memory. Such memory can take various forms from simple spreadsheets to more complex data sharing platforms. This toolkit can provide a useful benchmark to learn from past mistakes, build best practises and stay ahead of the competitive. Integration also requires gaining the ability to implement a continuous flow of digital data between the departments and division to make sure that everyone in the organisation is aware of external perceptions about the brand and its products or services. In the hospitality industry, many hotels routinely communicate dashboards to hotels’ staff and even integrate e-reputation performance scores (for example, positive or negative changes in the hotel’s online reputation based on positive and negative feedback). AccorHotels uses digital listening capabilities such as TrustYou worldwide which tracks online chatters on key dimensions of the services provided, from food to cleanliness, and has even integrated these new metrics into the staff incentive structure. Some companies have fully absorbed the pace of digital disruptions by implementing new initiatives using IoT to create new sources of value. With the ability to collect novel data (for instance, a B2B manufacturer able to track where its products go worldwide), a company can become more knowledgeable and rapidly improve quality and learning across the organisation. Recently, Rolls-Royce with the help of Microsoft started to insert trackers in their aircraft engines to monitor potential defects as well as the engine’s resistance and performance to different weather conditions. By increasing its knowledge, Rolls-Royce was able to extend its services to become a data provider for airline companies such as Singapore Airlines to help them better programme flight efficiency. The third and final area is impact and requires rethinking how digital dynamics can improve a company’s value proposition. This often means connecting firms with their audience online – customers, collaborators and the media – to increase brand awareness. Brands can also foster digital and non-digital interactions with customers to increase value. An increasingly widespread strategy entails ‘seeding’ products to key influencers to facilitate and speed up product adoption. Ultimately, taking the lead of disruption will entail using digital technologies through the lens of the customers to create a continuous flow of self-generated innovations. In an increasingly fast-paced, fast-changing competitive landscape, embracing the digital transformation can mean the difference between retaining leadership, losing ground and eventually being pushed out of the game. Rethinking intelligence, integration and impact will be the first step to winning this vital challenge.

The Apple-designed chip will handle low power functions such as Power Nap, and could be a step towards abandoning Intel at some point in the future. Apple wants to put more of its own chips in the Mac Apple has been working on the new chip code named T310 since last year, according to insider sources speaking with Bloomberg. Those sources said the T310 chip will supplement Intel’s chips, but won’t replace them. The T310 will handle tasks like Power Nap mode which lets Macs check for and install updates, sync calendars, and check email when they otherwise appear to be in sleep mode. Apple’s Custom Processors This isn’t Apple’s first foray into custom chip design. The company has used its own custom ARM-based processors in the iPhone and iPad for years, and Apple Watch runs on an Apple-designed processor, too. Apple is already using a custom processor for the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar called T1, as well, so using more in-house designed chips for system tasks isn’t a stretch. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Steve Jobs before him have pushed for less reliance on third party companies for key device components, and designing task-specific chips is part of that philosophy. It’s also another step down the path towards completely custom processors for Apple’s computers. The company has years of experience with running devices on its own processors thanks to the iPhone and iPad. That’s useful information as the company pushes forward with its custom Mac chips. Apple Chips Versus Developers Creating the T1 and T310 aren’t, however, signs that Apple is ready to abandon Intel’s processors. Intel’s chips handle more intensive operations and that isn’t likely to change any time soon. Convincing big name developers, like Adobe and Microsoft, to rewrite their products for a whole new processor platform could be a problem, too. They slowly transitioned away from PowerPC processors to Intel when Apple made that change, but convincing them to do it again may not be so easy. For now, Apple can leave power and processor-intensive tasks to Intel’s chips and tasks that can benefit from the power saving features of custom designed T-series chips can help extend battery life and work more efficiently with software. That’ll help make Apple’s computers more efficient, but it won’t overcome Intel’s processor refresh cycle which doesn’t seem to be in line with its own computer upgrade schedule. The MacBook Pro, for example, stagnated for years waiting fort significantly improved processors and in the end Apple released the Touch Bar MacBook Pro with the Skylake chipset even though the newer Kaby Lake chipset was in production. For Apple, waiting any longer to refresh the MacBook Pro wasn’t an option. The company chose to use the year-old Skylake technology in the new models because Kaby Lake chipsets weren’t shipping in the quantities it needed. Rumors claim Apple plans to release a Kaby Lake-based version of the MacBook Pro in the coming months, which will overcome power and RAM limitations that come along with Skylake. Apple can’t walk away from Intel’s laptop and desktop chipsets, but it can supplement them with its own designes to improve performance and battery life. It looks like that’s Apple’s plan for now, but Intel is no doubt watching closely to see if future Macs can run on chips it doesn’t make.

Credit: Apple More like this Apple’s iPhone: 10 years old and only getting started Is MacBook Pro the future of the Apple desktop? What to expect from Apple’s new Mac 'hello' Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple is not an imitation. It plans its own future and while it takes inspiration from everywhere, it remains resolutely committed to adapting new ideas within its own unique expression. That’s what Steve Jobs meant when he said “Great artists steal”. Macs are moving to ARM A Bloomberg report suggests Apple plans to give more responsibility to ARM processors inside future Macs. The Apple Touch ID unit used inside the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is already powered by its own ARM-based chip, which runs independent of the Intel processor. The report tells us Apple plans to put an ARM chip inside future Macs that will be responsible for handling “low-power tasks”, such as background app activity, Power Nap mode and so on. Better battery This should help improve Mac battery life, the report explains. It specifically suggests that Macs will be more able to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. This is what Power Nap already does, though by default it only does so when your Mac is connected to a power supply. (You can override this in System Preferences, but you are likely to see an impact on battery life). The report claims Apple intends popping the new processor inside MacBook Pro models later this year. These are expected to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chips as their main processor. It has previously been suggested they will appear in Q2. Inevitability and gradualness I don’t think it’s all about power, even though better power management as a slogan seems to echo beyond the technology industry these days. I imagine it also means you’ll see another level of iOS-like performance on your Mac. Your apps will be on without lag, data will sync between Apple platforms, and you will also see the kind of tight storage management and retrieval you may have become used to on iOS devices. Chips with vroom We first began to hear speculation Apple may migrate the Mac to ARM back in 2011. That's when reports claimed Apple would need to develop 64-bit iOS chips in order to enable this transition. Apple’s A-series processors have been 64-bit since the iPhone 5s. They have been through multiple iterations since and the current model is the fastest mobile processor money can buy. It will be until Apple improves it again later this year in the new iPad Pro. The company has poured resources into processor development and the next iPad refresh in calendar Q2 will offer an A-series chip capable of PC-type performance. PCs will be trucks, but it takes time. What next? This isn’t about Intel. There is no doubt that the ability to run Windows on Macs has helped Apple build Mac market share since the Intel transition took place. Apple doesn’t need to sacrifice that advantage. Windows 10 already runs on ARM-based processors, and Intel has already reached a deal to make ARM-based chips. Apple can migrate without losing key partnerships – but it is not time… yet. Mobile technology is pervading every part of life. Connected everything means mobile processors will be everywhere, so it makes sense to ensure our PCs are deeply compatible with these things. Bloomberg’s warning that Apple is giving ARM chips more responsibilities within future Macs reflects a wider move, one in which the computer is everywhere and inside everything. Apple has no intention of being at any disadvantage on this emerging battlefield. It is equipped for the critical everything everywhere platform war, with the future of the world at stake. Google+?

Elyse Betters3 February 2017Laptops Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple seems to be actively lessening its reliance on Intel chips. According to Bloomberg, Apple is designing its own A-series ARM-based chips, even though Intel processors have powered Apple's Mac lineup for more than a decade. The company isn't going to dump Intel chips right away, but by all indications, it at least wants to dip its toes into the water by developing its own silicon for MacBooks and iMacs. For now, this ARM-based chip is being built with one idea in mind. In an attempt to save battery life, Apple reportedly wants to offload the Mac's "Power Nap" feature from the main Intel processor. Power Nap lets Macs run software updates, sync to iCloud, and more -- all while the computer sleeps. Some of these features require the Mac to be charging, however, but with a chip that requires less energy, Power Nap's features could maybe one day work with just the Mac's battery. Which MacBook is best for you? MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro? It's worth stressing Apple might want to ditch Intel altogether, too. Industry insiders have claimed that Apple wasn't happy when Intel didn't have Kaby Lake processors ready for the new MacBook Pro. Apple was forced to launch the machines running old microarchitecture. Also, maybe now, by developing its own silicon, it's ready to better coordinate macOS and Mac releases like it does with iPhone/iOS. Also, Apple has been investing a lot into its own series of chips for the last seven years, and it even designed an ARM-based chip - the T1 - for the MacBook Pro last autumn. (It controls the Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor.) Experimenting with ARM inside Macs seems like an obvious sign that Apple either wants to take more tasks away from the main Intel processor, or maybe even more closely combine iOS and MacOS. We'll know more this autumn, when Apple updates the MacBook Pro.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > New Dell XPS 13 and 15 now available with… New Dell XPS 13 and 15 now available with fingerprint scanner, Windows Hello By Mark Coppock — February 2, 2017 4:06 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you If you want Windows 10 Hello support on your new Dell XPS 15, then you'll want to place your order soon, and add the fingerprint option. CES 2017 brought a number of new and updated notebooks, with Intel’s seventh-generation CPUs and Nvidia’s Pascal graphics architecture making their way into the mainstream. One of the most anticipated machines is the update to Dell’s XPS 15 workstation, which was officially announced after a brief unintentional outing on Dell’s website. The new Dell XPS 15 features up to Intel’s quad-core Core i7-7700HQ CPU, Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 GPU, and up to 32GB RAM, making it a powerful mobile workstation. There’s been some confusion, however, as to whether Dell was jumping on the Windows Hello password-less login bandwagon, and that’s now been clarified, as Windows Central reports. More: Updated XPS 15 and new XPS 27 AIO headline Dell’s XPS line update for 2017 Many new notebooks feature Windows Hello, which allows users to securely log into their Windows 10 PCs with one form of biometric sensor or another. One of the more popular options is facial-recognition scanners, which use infrared scanners to make sure the person who’s looking at the screen is an authorized user. Another is the time-tested fingerprint scanner, which allows a user to swipe a finger and log in via Windows Hello. When news of Dell’s updated XPS 15 first broke, it appeared that it would include a fingerprint scanner supporting Windows Hello. Looking at the initial product listings on Dell’s website, however, which showed models shipping in early February 2017, a fingerprint scanner couldn’t be found anywhere. Apparently, the reason is relatively simple: A fingerprint scanner option was coming but wasn’t made available on the earliest configurable systems. According to Dell, “Folks should see configurations for XPS 15 on Dell.com get updated to include the fingerprint reader option during the first week of February.” As Windows Central reports, the fingerprint scanner option is now available for the new XPS 15 at Dell.com. There’s even more good news: the newest XPS 13 notebook also now offers the same fingerprint option, which for all applicable models is selectable as the “Backlit keyboard, with fingerprint scanner” option for the reasonable additional cost of $24.50. If you want an XPS 13 or 15 with Windows Hello support, then you’ll want to make sure to select the appropriate configuration. If you’ve already pre-ordered a new XPS 15 without the fingerprint scanner, then you’ll want to contact Dell and switch out your order. Story originally published in January 2017. Updated on 2-2-2017 by Mark Coppock: Added information that the fingerprint scanner option is now available for purchase.

The lifestyle brand is finally ready to roll out the RunIQ smartwatch that runs Android Wear and is powered by Intel Atom inside. It looks more like a health and fitness watch. Well, there’s the fact that it was developed by New Balance plus its features focused on analyzing workouts and heart rate. The smartwatch comes equipped with GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, sync with STRAVA for the sharing, and Google Play Music support. Official specs include a 1.39-inch AMOLED display screen, gyroscope, accelerometer, 512MB DRAM, and 4GB onboard storage among others. It’s powered by Android Wear and can operate in different languages from English to Japanese, Korean, German, Italian, and French. The optical heart rate monitoring is located near the back of the watch for obvious reasons. It is close to your wrist for monitoring heart rate, locating via GPS, and location tracking when necessary. The New Balance watch’s battery can last the whole day. There’s a “one-tap LAP” button for easier access in the future. This device is ready for health tracking for whatever physical activity you are doing whether running, lifting weights, HIIT, playing tennis, or just about any other sports you love to do.

Introduction and design 2. Value, performance and verdict Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Acer’s first go at crafting the thinnest convertible in the world is held back by the world’s most antiquated trackpad and charger, but it makes up for it with a satisfying keyboard, the ideal amount of USB-C ports and a subtle design that works in its favor. For Cozy keyboard Classy design Two USB-C ports Against Trackpad requires too much force Poor speaker placement Goofy power brick Somewhat short battery life If nothing else, the first of Acer’s “Spin” convertible lineup was a feat to pull off. Though it just so happens to be the world’s scrawniest hybrid notebook, it still fails to beat Acer’s own Acer Swift 7 of this year in terms of thinness alone.  Despite being sleek and versatile, boasting four different modes to put its 14-inch screen on display, the Spin 7 succeeds in more than just appearances. The rebranded Intel Y-series processors show up in the form of the 7th-generation Kaby Lake Intel i7-7Y75 processor, complete with the fanless designs of the former Core M-series chips.  While you shan’t expect it to fly nearly as fast as the full-on i7-7500U featured in the likes of the Dell XPS 13, you should have your battery to thank you for it. Unfortunately, we find the Spin 7’s longevity to be middling, but it offers a gorgeous 2-in-1 experience all the same. Price and availability The cost of the Acer Spin 7 – $1,249, £1,099 or AU$1,999 – lands about where it should for a notebook of its stature. Seeing as there’s only one configuration to choose from, bearing a 7th-gen Core i7 processor and stunning appearance, it seems appropriately priced. That is, of course, until you dive into some details in the nitty gritty. Keep in mind, the Acer Spin 7 is available across the US, UK and Australia at the aforementioned respective price tags and comes exclusively furnished in a black all-metal finish. It can be purchased directly from Acer’s website, on Amazon or practically anywhere else laptops are sold. Spec Sheet Here is the Acer Spin 7 configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 1.3GHz Intel Core i7-7Y75 (dual-core, 4MB cache, up to 3.6GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 615 RAM: 8GB LPDDR3  Screen: 14-inch, 1920 x 1,080 FHD IPS Storage: 256GB SSD (SATA) Ports: 2 x USB 3.1 Type-C ports,  Headphone/mic jack Connectivity: Gigabit 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 720p HDR webcam Weight: 2.65 pounds (1.20kg) Size: 12.8 x 9 x 0.4 inches (32.5 x 22.8 x 1.01cm; W x D x H)  Design In addition to the obvious convertible design aspects, the Acer Spin 7 is graced with an all-metal chassis, a lean, albeit comfy keyboard and even a wide-angle glass trackpad embellished with decorative chamfered edges. Acer even went as far as to match the border of the trackpad with its pair of silvery hinges. The keyboard exhibits travel that’s far superior to the MacBook’s infamous butterfly switches. Instead, it feels like a normal chiclet keyboard you would use for a work desktop in 2017. Even so, it’s not without its faults. The absence of LED backlighting could be read as an oversight for a laptop in this price range. Unfortunately, regardless of whether you decide to use the Acer Spin 7 as a traditional laptop, a tablet or a multimedia tent, you’ll be disappointed to discover that the speakers are placed on the device’s underside. This makes for a rather inconvenient way to listen to music or watch videos considering they’ll pretty much always be in contact with another surface.  Trackpad ennui Though we’re blessed to have a keyboard that is this damn pleasing on the fingers, the same cannot be said of the Acer Spin 7’s trackpad. As much as we wanted to love it for its sheer latitude, we suppose it couldn’t be helped that, when moving from this to a MacBook, performing clicks made the 2-in-1’s touchpad feel like a chore in comparison.  It’s nice to have a wide-angle touchpad, but it’s definitely a burden to fully press down on every time you need to click on or highlight something, and it doesn’t help that it’s distractingly loud  when you do so. At least, at the same time, there’s a touchscreen in place to emulate the trackpad functionality more quietly. 1 2 Current page: Introduction and design Next Page Value, performance and verdict ABOUT THE AUTHOR Gabe Carey Gabe has been writing about video games and technology since he was 16 years old.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team.

Hashtag: #brantina, #mozSS February 25, 2016: Building Product with Partners - Interview with April Underwood, Slack Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, February 25 @ Mozilla SF - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Building Products with Partners: Interview with Slack's April Underwood Building products is complex. Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use. Host: Bertrand Neveux Questions: Submit questions for April during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

Hashtag: #brantina December 3, 2015: Optimizing for Uncertainty with Mike Arauz, August Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, December 3 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Optimizing for Uncertainty: Deciding and Moving Quickly The web is increasingly complex and dynamic. How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement. Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. August 13, 2015: Build, Measure, Learn: Being a Growth Organization with Hiten Shah, KISSMetrics Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, August 13 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Hiten Shah will share his ideas and experience with growth hacking, a scrappy marketing technique developed by technology startups, and how it specifically applies to Mozilla. Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here. Submitting a Speaker Idea We will give special consideration to speaker ideas submitted by Mozillians! Criteria for speakers is outlined above. Tell us how and why your speaker will appeal to a broad set of Mozillians here or even better, just send Diane a note.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES!

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

By Rob Thubron on Feb 2, 2017, 8:00 AM TechSpot Talk of Apple replacing Intel’s chips in favor of ARM-based processors in its computers has been around for years, and while that scenario is still a long way off – assuming it ever does happen – Bloomberg reports that the Cupertino company has taken its first steps down the path toward independence from Intel. Citing people familiar with the matter, the publication said that Apple is designing a new chip for future MacBooks that “would take on more of the functionality currently handled by Intel." The ARM-based processor, codenamed T310, wouldn’t take the place of Intel’s technology, but is designed to sit alongside it and be primarily used during the laptop’s low-power mode. The MacBook’s “Power Nap” setting allows the computer to perform activities while it’s asleep, such as receive emails, update calendars, and download software updates. While the current Intel chips use only tiny amounts of power during this mode, a super-efficient ARM chip could use even less and theoretically boost the laptop’s battery life. It would also be used for other systems, including storage and wireless components. Apple already uses ARM chips in its latest line of MacBook Pros. The firm’s T1 chip handles the new Touch Bars and houses a secure enclave for the Touch ID scanners. While Bloomberg notes that Apple has "no near-term plans to completely abandon Intel chips," the T310 could set the long-term plan in motion, and ultimately lead to Apple using its own A-series chips in MacBooks, like it has done with iPhones and iPads since 2010. The T130 chip will reportedly arrive as part of the MacBook Pro refresh later this year. The market has already reacted to the news, with Intel shares falling one percent while Apple’s rose 6.1 percent.

The "Intel" spot with Tom Brady showcases Intel's 360-degree replay technology, which will be on display during the game. It can make any moment an epic moment. It's really cool technology that will be at work during the game, shown through a cool ball player who'll be playing in the game. It's yet to be seen whether people will connect on the level they're hoping they will. Snickers announced it will do the big game's first LIVE commercial, so we really don't know what it will be yet. They've built a website around streaming content from the 'set' where the spot will be filmed, and they've planned social media components. Snickers is counting on this concept generating LOTS of chatter. Buick created a cute spot with Cam Newton and Miranda Kerr. This brand's putting an NFL superstar and a supermodel to work to mock outdated perceptions of their product. This will connect with viewers because of adorable children playing football, the surprise element and the aforementioned supermodel and NFL superstar. Fiji Water's short spot is over-the-top on production and it already ran in 2016. In this bunch of superstar ads, it's not that memorable. Mr. Clean's ad is absolutely the most memorable one we have seen so far. It's a mix of animation and live action, and it gets the message across - use Mr. Clean, make it fun and who knows what might happen!

We round up the rumours about new iMacs, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready. by Ashleigh Macro | 02 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? How much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost? The last update Apple gave to its iMac line was in October of 2015, when it introduced a Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipped the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. That's why we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - what we hope will be an early-2017 iMac update. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Early in 2017, we hope, but we had been confidently expecting an iMac update in late 2016 and that came to nothing. The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place in June next year) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. In early January, Intel used CES 2017 in Las Vegas to introduce its Kaby Lake processors officially, after announcing low power versions of Kaby Lake processors in August of 2016. The chips shown off in January are powerful enough to be used in Apple's Macs, suggesting that updates are imminent. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might hack off the early buyers. Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. With the new AMD Zen processor, we hope to see the CPU make an appearance in a lot of high-end machines, given its tremendous processing power. The new processor boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Read next: Best external SSD flash drives for Mac New iMac 2017 rumours: Could the iMac replace the Mac Pro? In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

Apple could be working on ARM-based Mac chips to make Mac laptops more efficient Posted 16 hours ago by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Ransomware completely shuts down Ohio town government Apple is already using an ARM-based chip in the latest MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor. According to a new report from Bloomberg, the company could go one step further and use the co-processor to offload some tasks. But first, let’s talk about the co-processor in the MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and how it currently works. Called the T1, the chip was designed by Apple and is not that powerful. In fact, the T1 is the same chip as the one in the Apple Watch Series 2. The Touch Bar runs a flavor of watchOS customized for very specific features. The T1 runs the Secure Enclave so you can store personal information, such as your fingerprints and your keychain, and your computer won’t ever see this information. So when you’re using your Mac, it’s like there are two computers running and talking to each other. The main Intel processor does the heavy lifting, and the T1 handles very specific features. But the T1 and the Intel Core i5 or i7 in your MacBook run two very different operating systems. The T1 is an ARM-based chip and can only run code that was compiled for ARM chips. The Intel chip runs x86 code. Just like on your iPhone, you can’t simply run iTunes on the T1 — it needs to be optimized for ARM processors. According to Bloomberg’s report, Apple is thinking about expanding the tasks of the T1 with a new, more powerful chip. The updated chip could be codenamed the T310 and it won’t replace the Intel chip — it’s going to be another co-processor, but with more responsibilities. For instance, Bloomberg says that your Mac would only use the T310 for Power Nap. Apple introduced Power Nap in 2012. This feature silently wakes your computer when it’s sleeping to sync your iCloud data, fetch your emails and calendar events, upload photos to iCloud and even perform small Time Machine backups. This way, when you use your laptop again, your computer isn’t playing catch-up. It would take quite a lot of work to offload Power Nap to the T310. The T310 would need to connect to your Wi-Fi network thanks to an ARM-based Wi-Fi driver, load macOS services, such as iCloud syncing services and more. Many drivers and basic OS features would need to be compiled for both the Intel chip and the ARM chip. But the good news is that Apple has already done a lot of this work for iOS. iPhones and iPads can already perform many of these tasks, and sometimes better than macOS. For instance, in my experience, the Wi-Fi stack works much better on iOS compared to macOS. You are able to connect to a spotty Wi-Fi network and get much better performance on your iPad. In addition to that, ARM-based chips are much more power efficient than Intel chips. By offloading some tasks to the T310, Apple would be able to get much better battery life. But does it mean that the T310 will be able to communicate directly with the Wi-Fi module in your Mac? Does it mean that all the networking will be done by the T310 even when you’re using your Mac? That would mean that the line between the ARM-based chip and the Intel chip would get blurry, and this is when it could get interesting. I don’t see Apple ditching Intel any time soon. Using Intel chips still makes a lot of sense. But it seems likely that all the research and development that went into creating Apple’s chips for iOS devices is going to get reused in future MacBooks. While the Touch Bar is an interesting input device, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. Behind the scene, Apple could be preparing some major changes for the MacBook product line. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Related Media Microsoft, Intel, Alphabet Results Buoyed by Cloud Boom Salesforce to Partners: Nothing Fake About Artificial Intelligence Opportunity Intel: New, Smarter Tools Will Help Data Centers (and the Cloud) Run More Efficiently Advertisement When we talk about the next big thing in tech, it’s easy to overlook the fact that many of it relies on ideas that have existed for decades. Take for example artificial intelligence (AI), which was formally founded in 1956 at a conference in Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH; or the Internet of Things (IoT), which was born in the 1990s. These technologies have spurred billions of dollars of investment and the creation of hundreds of companies. But one of the companies poised for significant growth in these areas is more than 50-years-old itself. Intel, the microprocessor company founded in 1968, is seeing tremendous opportunity in these emerging technology areas as demand for PCs and chips for traditional data centers soften. Intel’s IoT business was its fastest growing business segment of 2016, with 15 percent growth year over year, while its fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent year over year. Partnerships with cloud service providers, the biggest public cloud firms in the world, are helping drive demand for Intel products, Raejeanne Skillern, VP of Intel’s Data Center Group and general manager of its Cloud Service Provider Group says. “They can consume technology as fast as we can deliver it,” Skillern says about Intel’s cloud service provider customers, which include Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft. It’s a different pace from 8 or 9 years ago when she first joined the data center group. At that time, “Amazon was just coming on board, Google was growing in search, and Intel’s position was very small, we had about 35 percent market share because AMD was largely winning in that space,” she says. Intel calls its largest cloud service provider customers ‘Super 7’ – AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook in the U.S., and in China, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu. “Our strategy is fundamentally based on having deep and first-hand knowledge and collaboration with our largest customers,” Skillern says. “They’re kind of unique in the way they grow. We’ve been fortunate enough that they’ve allowed us to go in and have these very direct engagements; I think that’s kind of surprising to some because we’re a silicon ingredient supplier of an infrastructure system - why would Intel as one component have these direct relationships? But it’s because of the deep customization that we do.” The results of this customization include Amazon’s C5 instances which are set to launch in early 2017 and are based on Intel’s next-generation Xeon cloud processors, code-named Skylake. Amazon says the C5 instances are “ideal for compute-intensive workloads like ad serving, scientific modeling, 3D rendering, cluster computing, machine learning inference, and distributed analytics.”  “For us as we bring the Skylake platform to market obviously getting our best technology into the service provider segment is going to be critical throughout the year,” Skillern says. Part of this focus is the early ship program where cloud providers can get a hold of Intel technology a couple months ahead of the market. “This is because they’re not as constrained by the OEM ecosystem and the validation schedules that apply to enterprise,” she says. Over the next 12 months Skillern and her team will focus on driving faster adoption in the cloud service provider segment and helping these customers grow through different services that use Intel technology, including high performance compute as a service, AI as a service, big data analytics as a service and security as a service. “A lot of people know us as a compute provider but a lot of these challenges are happening at their platform level and software level. When they create solutions they think of the entire stack not a bunch of little, individual ingredient parts.” “A lot of what we do is we match our engineering teams with theirs to meet at the level that they’re at; whether its platform, hardware, OS,” she says. “As they design their next generation systems we help co-design a lot of the boards and systems with them.” Aside from Skylake, Intel also plans to launch the next processor in the Xeon Phi family, code-named Knights Mill, to power artificial intelligence. “Artificial intelligence has been around for decades,” Skillern says. “We’re seeing it becoming very pervasive; talk-to-text, photo recognition and tools, ad matching, all of those analytics capabilities and tools come together to provide better services and answers to important questions.” Intel set a lot of groundwork in 2016 for its AI strategy, making several key acquisitions, including a company called Nervana, which has a software and hardware stack for deep learning. In November Intel said it plans to integrate Nervana’s technology into a new product code-named Knights Crest, and the formation of the Intel Nervana AI board to further AI research and strategy. Its partnership with Google will also help to drive its AI efforts, including a focus on optimization of the open source TensorFlow library to provide software developers a machine learning library to drive the next wave of AI innovation, Skillern wrote in a blog post last year. “Artificial intelligence can bring amazing outcomes in medical science, retail, and business operational efficiency. I also get excited working with it because you’re bringing together such amazing minds. The company we acquired, Nervana, is a talented group of about 50 people who are some of the smartest you’ll meet in the industry,” Skillern says. “It’s just really fun when there’s something new, and you get to learn it and see the possibilities and impact,” she says.  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 0 Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your Talkin' Cloud ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles PayScale Wins $100M Investment from Warburg Pincus Layered Tech’s Compliant Cloud Gets Nod from We Pay How to Win Big-Ticket Business Google Apps Wins 76K Email Migrations from City of Boston How HP Cloud Will Differentiate from Amazon, Rackspace Upcoming Webcasts & Training February 23: 6 Steps to Be an MSP Business Master February 28: Cyber Threats to Watch in 2017 February 28: Navigating the Capital Raise Pathway in a Complex IT Landscape Enroll Now & Save 20% Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Recent Comments Most Commented hello I really like this post thank you very much for sharing us.

Thursday, 2nd February, 2017 3:26pm Story by Noelle Finegan Jump to comments Sinead O'Dowd a finalist in the Intel Mini-Scientist competition Sinead O'Dowd a finalist in the Intel Mini-Scientist competition If you’ve ever wondered what bacteria horrors could be lurking in your make-up bag, that is exactly what 11-year-old Sinead O’Dowd investigated for her project which has reached the national final of the Intel Mini Scientist Competition, taking place in the Helix, Dublin, tomorrow. Sinead, a fifth class pupil in Scoil Bhríde, Cannistown, came up with the idea of testing what bacteria is in make-up. Her project ‘What’s growing in Make-up?’ was chosen by Intel employees as the winning project in her school to go forward to the regional final, and Sinead’s was one of 18 projects to make it to the national final of the competition. Two other Meath projects have also made it to the final - ‘Plant Power’ from St Nicholas PS, Longwood, and ‘Fantastic Fudge’ from Scoil Mhuire, Moynalvey. Sinead tested blusher, mascara, lipstick, lip gloss and foundation and found that mascara contained the most bacteria and blusher had the least. She also tested products that were in date and out-of-date and explained there was a lot more bacteria in out-of-date products. “Mascara that was in date had 22 colonies and the out-of-date one had 238,” said Sinead. She also looked at the PAO (period after opening) and did a survey on how many people were aware of it. That’s the little symbol -a jar with open lid- which has a number of months beside it. One company, Oriflame, a Swedish company with a facility in Bray, invited Sinead to spend a day with their microbiologists. “We did tests where they put some bacteria into the products to test them and if the preservatives are working. I also got to make some lipstick and soap. It was an amazing experience. I spent the whole day there, it was very nice of them.” Sinead is very excited to attend the final tomorrow and will be accompanied by her parents Pat and Rita, sister Ciara, friend Kate and her principal Maura Durkin who said they were “absolutely delighted” with how well Sinead had done. She explained they had only got involved in the competition two years ago and that all pupils in fourth, fifth and sixth classes prepared projects for the competition.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     Apple Tipped To Be Working On It's Own Processor For Macs Posted: Feb 2 2017, 6:25am CST | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     Apple reportedly has no plans to abandon Intel chips at this time Right now if you buy a MacBook laptop you get one with an Intel chip inside. That could change in the future with word that Apple is at work on its own chip to lessen its dependence on Intel. The tip comes from unnamed sources that Bloomberg says are familiar with the matter. Don't Miss: Super Bowl 2017 Commercials & Advertisers Development on the new Apple chip was said to have started last year and is similar to the chip used in the latest MacBook Pro notebooks to power the Touch Bar. Apple reportedly calls the chip by codename T310. The T310 would be used to handle some of the low power mode functions according to the sources. Apple is using ARM to build the chip and it is said that the chip will work alongside the Intel processor. Apple is by the numbers a rather small player in the global computer market with a 7.5% global market share. However, the company is a trend setter and often things it integrates into its computers are mimicked by other compteur makers. Apple uses its own processors inside the iPhone and iPad, something it has done since 2010. Before that move, the company used processors made by other companies in its iOS offerings. The same transition is likely to happen for MacBook notebooks in the future. The current ARM chip inside the MacBook is called the T1, and powers the Touch Bar. The low power mode operation for current MacBooks is known as Power Nap and word is Apple engineers plan to offload the feature to the ARM chip in development. Power Nap allows Mac users to get email, install software updates, and sync calendars all with the display shut and not in use to save battery power. The Intel chip currently handles this feature, but a lower power ARM chip could consume even less power. The source claims that Apple has no current plans to completely abandon Intel chips.

The chip, which went into development last year, is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard’s Touch Bar feature, the people said. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private product development. It’s built using ARM Holdings Plc. technology and will work alongside an Intel processor. Although Apple only accounted for 7.5 percent of worldwide computer shipments in the fourth quarter, according to data from IDC, the Mac line has long set the standard for design and component improvements. Its feature additions often start new technology trends that other manufacturers rush to follow. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The development of a more advanced Apple-designed chipset for use within Mac laptops is another step in the company’s long-term exploration of becoming independent of Intel for its Mac processors. Apple has used its own A-Series processors inside iPhones and iPads since 2010, and its chip business has become one of the Cupertino, California-based company’s most critical long-term investments. Apple’s first ARM-based Mac chip, known as T1, was introduced as part of the MacBook Pro update last October. This chip powers the Touch Bar -- a screen built into the keyboard that lets users access app shortcuts, system settings and emojis -- and some security features such as the enclave that stores payment and biometric data tied to the computer’s fingerprint reader. Power Nap Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as "Power Nap," to the next-generation ARM-based chip. This function allows Mac laptops to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. The feature currently uses little battery life while run on the Intel chip, but the move to ARM would conserve even more power, according to one of the people. The current ARM-based chip for Macs is independent from the computer’s other components, focusing on the Touch Bar’s functionality itself. The new version in development would go further by connecting to other parts of a Mac’s system, including storage and wireless components, in order to take on the additional responsibilities. Given that a low-power mode already exists, Apple may choose to not highlight the advancement, much like it has not marketed the significance of its current Mac chip, one of the people said. Building its own chips allows Apple to more tightly integrate its hardware and software functions. It also, crucially, allows it more of a say in the cost of components for its devices. However, Apple has no near-term plans to completely abandon Intel chips for use in its laptops and desktops, the people said. Intel dipped on the news and ended the day down 0.8 percent at $36.52. Apple rose 6.1 percent to $128.75 in New York. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Intel’s designs and production technology have created processors that rivals and contract manufacturers haven’t been able match. If companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. continue to narrow the gap with what Intel’s factories can make, Apple may have more scope to design its own parts. ARM-based processors dominate the smartphone and tablet markets in part because of their power-efficiency. Apple started exploring a shift away from Intel processors five years ago partly to improve laptop power efficiency, Bloomberg News has reported. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Apple is also working on a faster version of the 12-inch MacBook and a new iMac with multi-functional USB-C connectivity for this year, Bloomberg News reported in December.

The massive towers of yesteryear are fading into memory, software has been streamlined, and both manufacturers and system integrators are starting to turn a blind eye to costly technologies that appeal only to niche audiences willing to spend big for minimal gains. It's a trend that makes sense for a lot of gamers wanting to taste the power of the PC without spending absurd amounts, and Scan Computers reckons it has a new Intel Kaby Lake rig that fits the bill. It's called the 3XS Gamer Aura and, in contrast to what we usually see from the Bolton-based outfit, there's no CPU overclock, only a single GPU, and power is sourced from a mere 450W supply. Pricing starts at around £1,100 for a GeForce GTX 1060-based build, though our GTX 1070-equipped review sample fetches £1,300 and is designed, in part, to flaunt Asus's Aura lighting effects. With illumination very much in mind, the chosen NZXT S340 chassis has a good-sized window and serves as a sensible choice for a machine of this ilk. Scan tells us "the Gamer Aura has been designed to deliver maximum frames per second at a much more affordable price point," and the internal components have thus been selected accordingly. At the heart of the rig is a Core i5-7500 processor - a solid mid-range choice from Intel's latest-generation stable - sat atop an Asus RoG Strix B250F Gaming motherboard. Both the CPU and chipset fit the bill, though it's curious that Scan chose to install 16GB of DDR4-3000 memory as standard. The memory will only run at 2,400MHz due to a chipset limitation, but we suspect the price difference is negligible to the extent that faster RAM offers an element of future proofing at no additional cost. One of the best things about a relatively simple build is that the hardware can be kept neat and tidy. The NZXT chassis hides the Corsair CX450M power supply and secondary 1TB WD hard disk, while the primary storage device - a 256GB Intel 600p Series SSD - is stowed in the motherboard's available M.2 slot. It's a good-looking setup, though the default CPU cooler could be deemed a missed opportunity. Arctic's Freezer 11 LP will do the job, but it doesn't look particularly impressive and we'd be tempted to upgrade to the more imposing be quiet! Pure Rock for an additional £16. What's perhaps more surprising is the somewhat minimal use of lighting. The motherboard and graphics card - an Asus GeForce GTX 1070 Strix Gaming 8GB - are the only two parts offering synchronised Aura effects, and neither offers a great deal of illumination. Case lights aren't high on my own list of priorities, yet if I were to purchase a rig designed to showcase Aura effects, the 3XS Gamer Aura would leave me wanting more. At the very least, something needs to be added to the motherboard's available RGB header to give the interior a little more jazz. Modifications are kept to a minimum, though there is an interesting tweak in the fan configuration. Given the stock-clocked CPU, Scan has opted to remove the chassis' top 120mm fan in order to reduce noise output. This change leaves the S340 enclosure with only a single 120mm fan serving as a rear exhaust. We don't imagine cooling will be a problem, but if reducing noise is the goal, we'd be inclined to upgrade from the NZXT S340 to a Fractal Design Define C. There's a £15 cost but in return you'll get sound-dampened panels and there shouldn't be any need to remove supplied fans. Cable management, as you'd expect on a straightforward build, is excellent throughout, and though you could build a similar PC for, say, £150 less using off-the-shelf components, Scan's turnkey solution comes with the benefit of a three-year warranty as standard. The 3XS Gamer Aura is a competent, streamlined-looking piece of kit, but £1,300 isn't pocket change so it needs to excel at high-quality gaming. Let's load-up the benchmarks.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple to incorporate next-gen ARM-based processor into future Macs to handle low-power functions Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, February 2nd, 2017, 05:46 Category: Hardware, MacBook Pro, Processors, Rumor, Touch Bar, Touch ID This is pretty nifty. Apple is apparently developing an ARM-based chip for its Mac products that would “take on more of the functionality” handled by Intel processors. In development since last year, the chip, codenamed T310, is said to be similar to the chip used to power the Touch Bar in the new 2016 Macbook Pro. It’s built using ARM technology and will work with the standard Intel processor, handling “Power Nap” low-power mode functionality. The processors are intended to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, entitled “Power Nap”, to the ARM-based chip. This function currently allows Apple’s notebooks to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. The feature currently uses little battery life while run on the Intel chip, but the move to ARM would conserve even more power, according to one of the sources. As of now, the 2016 MacBook Pro uses an independent ARM-based chip called the “T1” to drive the Touch Bar, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Touch Bar, and the secure enclave that stores payment and biometric data. It’s thought that the next generation of the ARM chip will “go further,” allowing the hardware to connect to storage and wireless components to handle additional power management functions. later this year, but it could be introduced as a quiet update with little fanfare as the chip that powers the Touch Bar was not promoted by Apple. Despite Apple’s plans to offload some tasks to a new ARM chip, Apple is said to have no intention of abandoning Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

This CPU is likely to be an ARM-based design that will reside alongside an Intel CPU. Apple’s MacBooks have featured Intel CPUs for many years now, and one can see why. Intel offers a combination of relatively low power consumption and high CPU performance that’s hard to match by rival AMD. However, an Intel CPU is no match for an ARM CPU when it comes to power consumption. ARM CPUs are used in mobile devices for this very reason. They sip power and they’re incredibly efficient. The only problem is that they’re not powerful enough to compete with Intel in the desktop space. Apple already uses an ARM chip in its 2016 MacBook Pros. This chip handles the TouchBar and TouchID sensor of the MacBook Pros. The iPhone maker apparently wants to design some new ARM chips that it can use alongside Intel CPUs. These chips are intended to handle Apple’s PowerNap feature, reports Bloomberg. PowerNap is a feature that lets MacBooks receive software updates, email, etc. even when your MacBook’s lid is closed. This is a very low power state that’s intended to keep your device up-to-date in the background. Traditionally, the Intel chip was used for this. Replacing this with an ARM CPU makes a lot of sense because the tasks to be performed are very specific and routine. Of course, the ultra-low power consumption of ARM chips will also help. Given Apple’s tight hardware and software integration, we doubt that Microsoft will do something similar any time soon. There has been speculation that ARM will eventually overtake Intel, particularly in the server space. That might eventually happen, but right now, ARM has nothing that can compete with the raw performance of an Intel platform. Maybe AMD’s Ryzen will have something to say about it come March.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Apple working on custom Mac chips for future laptop models February 2, 2017 - 12:50 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Intel processors have powered Apple's Mac computers for over a decade now, but Apple has also found success designing its own A-series ARM-based chips for the iPhone and iPad. While the company isn't going to dump Intel chips in the Mac any time soon, a report from Bloomberg indicates that Apple at least intends to put its foot in the water and test out designing its own silicon for the Mac, Engadget said. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Ian King, Apple is building an ARM-based chip that'll offload the Mac's "Power Nap" features from the standard Intel processor as a way to save battery life. Power Nap currently lets the Mac run software updates, download email and calendar updates, sync to iCloud, back up to Time Machine drives and a number of other features while the computer is asleep. Some of these features only work when plugged in, though -- perhaps with a chip that consumers less energy, Power Nap's capabilities could be expanded. This could also be a first step towards a move away from Intel processors entirely, although Bloomberg says such a move would not happen in the immediate future. But Apple has invested a lot of money in its own series of chips since 2010 and could have more freedom to update the Mac without having to rely on Intel's schedule. It's worth noting that this rumored Power Nap chip wouldn't be the first Apple-designed chip to make it into a Mac. That honor would go to the T1, an ARM-based chip that showed up in the new MacBook Pro last fall. That chip controls the laptop's Touch Bar and the Touch ID sensor but otherwise doesn't have to do any heavy lifting. Apple has been pretty quiet about the chip, but it seems that the next MacBook Pro could have another ARM chip -- maybe the T2? -- that takes more tasks away from the main Intel processor. If that's the case, we probably won't know for a while, as Apple probably won't update the MacBook Pro lineup again until this fall, Engadget said. Related links: Engadget.

The processors, codenamed T310, will thus take over some of the processing which the machine's Intel CPU would have previously been taxed with. Apple computers have been using Intel CPUs for over a decade and there has recently been increased chitter-chatter about it moving to ARM-based processors, like it has used in its popular iPhones and iPads for the past 7 years. Bloomberg reminds us that Apple's first ARM-based Mac chip, known as T1, was introduced as part of the MacBook Pro update last October. It is used to power the Touch Bar plus process some security and biometric data. The new T310 processor will facilitate a more efficient 'Power Nap' mode than the Intel CPU can provide. In this connected sleep mode the Mac retrieves e-mails, installs software updates, and synchronizes calendar appointments, while it is otherwise 'off'. Thus the ARM-based T310 will have to connect to computer storage and wireless components to get its tasks done. Computers often spend a long time napping, between usage sessions, so any savings in efficiency in this mode are welcome. Apple accounts for 7.5 per cent of the worldwide computer market, according to latest quarterly figures from IDC. Bloomberg notes that Intel shares were down slightly and Apple shares rose over 6 per cent yesterday in the wake of the above ARM T310 chip news. However, Apple's shares could be just continuing the rally following its better than expected results two days ago. It will be interesting to watch the speed of Apple's progress in shifting away from Intel processors in its computers. By summer we will likely see quite a few examples of Microsoft's Qualcomm-powered 'Cellular PCs', which might point the way for Apple.

Both have low-power ARM chips (with a whole discrete OS!) that run low-power tasks (downloads and updates while sleeping, that kind of thing). At least with the PS4, this chip serves double duty as the soutbridge, lending most of its I/O to the main SoC. Wonder if Apple will have to do something similar - if they want the chip to have access to WiFi, storage and the like, I don't know how else this could be done.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on February 2 2017 08:58 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email It has been many years since Apple made the switch to Intel processors in its desktop and laptop products. This was a big deal back then because Macs predominantly run on Motorola G processors since 1998. And now, a new report suggests that the tech giant could be making another switch, this time to ARM, pretty soon. According to the latest report from Bloomberg, Apple is currently developing its own ARM chip to power the next generation Mac products. It is also said that the development of the said chip has started last year. ARM for background apps At the moment, the MacBook Pro has experienced some major issues in battery life. This is mainly because it has been dependent on the processors that are being provided to Apple by Intel. Since the chip is practically third-party, Apple is not able to inject its own techniques in improving power efficiency. This is where the ARM-based chip comes in. Various Mac products (via apple.com) The said ARM chip will be specifically tailored to perform background tasks for the future Macs. Tasks, like the “Power Nap”, could take advantage of an ARM processor’s low energy requirements thereby saving more on the battery. By making its own chip for the Mac, hardware and software can be highly coupled with each other. Much like the current iPhone 7. The report also mentioned that Apple does not have immediately plans to ditch Intel chips from Mac products altogether. For now, Apple’s main intention is to do the same technique it has done for the Touch Bar of the current MacBook Pro. That is, to have other parts of the Mac handled by more power efficient chips like an ARM-based processor. Future of Intel with Apple Although Apple will not be replacing Intel processors with ARM anytime soon, it still is possible that this new feature may come as early as this year. The company intends to roll out the new system on the MacBook Pro refresh this year. In addition to the MacBook Pro, other products like the iMac and the MacBook, may also have the same feature. However, the main focus now is the MacBook Pro. Apple making a big hardware decision is not really new. The company has done this back in 2006 when it switch from Motorola-made G processor to Intel processors. Perhaps, in the near future, consumers could be looking at purely ARM powered laptops from Apple. For more updates on the MacBook Pro, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

By Sarmistha Acharya February 2, 2017 08:56 GMT Apple working on new chip for Mac laptops Getty Images/Josh Edelson Apple is reportedly designing a new chip for use in upcoming Mac laptops that would lessen the workload of the Intel processor. The development of the chip, which is similar to the one used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard's touch bar, is said to have started last year. Codenamed T30, the chip would handle low power mode functionality of the computer. The chip is based on ARM technology and would work alongside an Intel processor, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The new chip is expected to be available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro, which is likely later this year, the report states. Apple is planning to offload Mac's low-power mode to the new ARM-based chip. The low-power mode function known as Power Nap allows retrieving e-mails, installing software updates and synchronising calendar appointments when the display is shut. While this feature uses very little battery, the upcoming ARM chip would be better and save more power. Additionally, the new chip would connect to the other parts of the Mac including storage and wireless components, as opposed to the current chips for Mac, which are independent from the other components of the computer. Developing its own chip would provide Apple with the flexibility to integrate hardware and software functions. Apple does not seem to have plans to completely abandon Intel chips. Apple's first ARM-based Mac chip known as T1 was introduced as part of the MacBook Pro update last October. This chip powers the Touch bar, a screen built into the keyboard that lets users access app shortcuts, system settings and emojis and security features. Despite Apple only accounting for about 7.5% of worldwide computer shipments in the fourth quarter, the Mac line has set a standard for design and component improvements.

The chip, internally codenamed T310, reportedly went into development last year and we may see the first batch of laptops based on it as early as this year. Apple may not be looking to push Intel completely out of the picture, however, and its new MacBook (Pro) may (still) be powered by Intel's new Kaby Lake generation chips. It may eventually, but not for now. For now, Apple's custom chip will reportedly be used for dedicated tasks like maintaining background app activity which could preserve battery life. "Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac's low-power mode, a feature marketed as "Power Nap," to the next-generation ARM-based chip," according to a Bloomberg report. "The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year," it adds. The MacBook isn't new to ARM chips. The latest MacBook Pro has one, but, here the chips's sole purpose is powering the Touch Bar and to an extent, the Touch ID. Apple's new chip will allow for some more. Note that Apple's iPhones and iPads already use the Cupertino major's in-house A-chips. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are both powered by Apple's next-generation quad-core A10 Fusion processor. "The A10 Fusion's CPU integrates two high-performance cores that run up to two times faster than iPhone 6, and two high-efficiency cores that are capable of running at just one-fifth the power of the high-performance cores. Graphics performance is also more powerful, running up to three times faster than iPhone 6 at as little as half the power," according to Apple.

The company currently uses Intel processors for its MacBook models, but is supposedly looking to reduce reliance on the chipmaker, starting with supplementing Intel processors with an ARM chip for low-power tasks. Bloomberg reports that Apple-built ARM chips will be integrated partially in MacBook Pro models scheduled to be unveiled this year. The new chips built for Mac will be used for low power tasks, and leave the Intel chip to take care of the heavy-duty processing. The new chip could presumably handle basic things like maintaining background app activity. "The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer's low-power mode functionality. Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac's low-power mode, a feature marketed as Power Nap, to the next-generation ARM-based chip," the report claims, citing people familiar with the matter. While these new chips are expected to be integrated in the refreshed MacBook Pro models scheduled for later this year, eventually, the company is supposedly looking to completely switch to ARM-based chips and reduce reliance on Intel's processors. Apple's iPhone and iPad lineup are powered fully by in-house ARM chips, and the Cupertino giant is reportedly aiming to to transition its Mac lineup in the same direction. However, the company has no "near-term plans" to ditch Intel processors for its laptops and desktops, the report claims, though it started exploring this direction five years ago in a bid to improve power-efficiency. There are several reasons why Apple would look to do away with Intel processors on its Mac lineup. The first, is greater control over hardware and software integration, while another would be greater say on the cost of Mac components. Integrating two chips into the MacBook Pro will help in improving overall battery life optimisation, given this year's complaints about overall usage time. The report claims that the role of the new ARM chip in the Power Nap feature would not be highlighted by the company, much in the same way the company didn't highlight the use of the T1 ARM chip utilised in current MacBook Pro models to power the Touch Bar. This year's MacBook Pro models will integrate Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, and are expected to upgrade up to 32GB RAM. Thursday's Bloomberg report also reiterates the publication's previous claim that Apple is set to release a faster version of its 12-inch MacBook this year, and a new iMac with multi-functional USB Type-C functionality. Notably, ARM Holdings, which was recently acquired by SoftBank, does not manufacture its own processors - it only providers processor and GPU designs that are used by chipmakers like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung, who usually further customise the designs for their own implementations, and manufactured by fabs like TSMC and Samsung. The ARM-based chips are widely used in smartphones and tablets the world over, and are heralded for their power-efficiency compared to Intel and AMD's x86 counterparts. Intel recently seemingly acknowledged this failing in its own processors by signing a licensing deal with ARM to produce 10nm ARM-based chips for mobile devices. The chipmaker had introduced its own line of x86 mobile and tablet chips under its Atom brand, but couldn't shake ARM or Qualcomm's grip on the market. Apple's reported move is in a similar direction to what Microsoft recently announced - the maker of the leading PC operating system in December said it would bring ARM chipset support to Windows 10 in partnership with Qualcomm, for the purpose of producing always-connected PCs with lower-power consumption and cellular connectivity. Qualcomm, apart from making ARM-based processors, is also one of the leading manufacturers of cellular modems. The first ARM-powered Windows 10 PCs are expected to launch by year-end.

The tech giant is expected to make a huge comeback during 2017 with its Ryzen series. In fact, AMD already bragged about some impressive benchmarks. These benchmarks have been compared with the ones provided by Intel which is AMD’s biggest competitor. Even though the internet is filled with rumors surrounding AMD, there aren’t that many liable ones. What we can know for sure is that AMD has slated SR3, SR5 and SR7 to be launched throughout 2017. Tech experts believe that one of the products is either 4-core or 8-core. The reason why this is important is because it means that there won’t be any 6-core processors from AMD. This came quite as a surprise because Intel has been generating huge profits as a result of its successful 6-core chipset. Intel’s Core i7-6800K and Core i7-6860K are the most popular chipsets available on the market right now. This is the result of using two additional cores in comparison its more mid-ranged oriented CPUs. For example think Intel’s i7-7700K. This CPU has been designed especially for tasks such as video rendering and editing instead of high performance. Taking in consideration the fact that AMD is going to head to head with Intel, we can expect that the Ryzen products will be cheaper. Rumor has it that all of AMD’s upcoming products will be priced around $400. This will certainly give AMD a huge advantage of Intel, making its hardware parts more appealing towards customers. Tech experts are speculating that AMD is set on not offering 6-core CPUs because they don’t even come close to the hardware performance 4-core or 8-core ones have. This year will definitely increase the competition between AMD and Intel. This is great news for customers since this competition will push the two companies to reduce their prices. Even more, both AMD and Intel will be forced to work harder on creating higher performing CPUs. Also worth mentioning is that Intel has been rumored to have another 6-core processor ready for 2017. This processor is expected to be included in Intel’s “Coffe Lake” micro architecture.

Future MacBooks could be powered by a combination of Intel processors and chips that Apple makes itself, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The new processor arrangement would use Apple's chips to handle basic functions requiring little power, such as apps that take advantage of the Mac's "App Nap" feature for background updates while the computer is in sleep mode. Intel would still supply the computer's main processor. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the Apple chip would be a variant of the one that powers the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro (pictured above). That chip, called the Apple T1, has built-in security features like fast user switching and biometric authentication for online purchases. Related Taking the Bar Exam? MacBook Pro With Touch Bar May Not Be Welcome Taking the Bar Exam? MacBook Pro With Touch Bar May Not Be Welcome Those capabilities are thanks to technology from ARM, whose chip designs are found in a vast array of electronic devices, from Blu-ray players to smartphones. Using an ARM-based chip to power the main functions of a laptop or desktop would be a first for Apple, though the company has been making its own processors for iPhones and iPads for several years. As Bloomberg points out, if Apple does introduce its own processors for the Mac's low-power mode it will likely be with little fanfare, since they would be improving the battery saving capabilities of a feature that is already designed to improve battery life, not powering a major new addition like the Touch Bar. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. Intel is working on its own ARM-based chips too, and rumors surfaced last year that Apple and Intel were in talks to include them in Apple products.

I guess as my follow-up, you talked about the ASPs in answering a prior question. I wondered about the competitive intensity in the PC market. You're taking a more conservative tack than the third-party vendors are forecasting, but your primary x86 competitor is coming out with a new architecture for the first time in many, many years. So, I wonder whether it's on the ASP or the unit or the market share side how you're factoring that into your forecast for the year".   Krzanich replied with: "Sure. I would tell you that we always look at this environment and say there's going to be a competitive risk in the environment. And we're always focused on really, our own product roadmap and making sure that we have the highest performance product. So, when we look at 2017, we still believe that our product roadmap is truly the best ever it's been".   But he continued, touching on the just-launched Kaby Lake architecture and how it will ramp up through 2017, and that there will be "many more SKUs and higher-performance products as we go into 2017". He continued: "And then we showed at CES the first working 10-nanometer Cannonlake product, which we're still planning to ship by the end of this year and really ramp into 2018. We still believe that our roadmap and our leadership will continue to give us the performance the customers want and desire. And so that didn't necessarily factor into that more cautious forecast. That forecast was really much more a function of where we think the PC market really is overall".   My take away from this is that Intel are scared, and Kaby Lake isn't the answer - personally, Intel is boring now. AMD have SenseMI technology inside of Ryzen, a truly exciting new piece of technology that will enhance the CPU for specific uses and consumers.   Intel are just plotting along, with a new processor architecture - teasing Cannonlake, because you know - the damn Kaby Lake architecture that launched less than 30 days ago isn't exciting enough. Intel has lost sight of the market, enjoying those easy profits for far too long. AMD is coming along now and is entering the party with something truly revolutionary, something we haven't seen in a very long time.

As the company that introduced the very first commercial microprocessor, Intel has one of the most advanced foundries in the world. However, in the recent years, the company lagged behind as more of its Asian counterparts pushed for chip manufacturing improvements. Nevertheless, it seems like Intel is once again preparing to take back the crown. According to ComputerWorld, Intel will start transitioning to the 7nm process technology later this year. This decision is a big step ahead of completion like Samsung and other foundries. Before the end of 2016, many Asian foundries announced that they will be starting trials for the said process technology in 2018. This year, their efforts will be put into perfecting the 10nm chip processing that is being used by after-market mobile processors. Intel’s current process technology Intel’s planned foray into the future of microprocessors is expected to only generate marginal yield rates. The company is expecting to produce a tiny number of samples only. This is done in order to understand the underlying difficulties of the process. Furthermore, Intel does not plan on releasing the products made under the 7nm process technology at least for the next three years. Silicon wafer (via wisegeek.com) At the moment, the Intel Kaby Lake processor is made under the 14nm process technology. The next processor in line, the Cannon Lake, is said to be made with 10nm will be released later this year. The jump from 14nm to 7nm is quite a feat to accomplish mainly because it becomes very difficult to produce transistors as they shrink in size. Moore’s Law For decades, the semiconductor industry was governed by one simple law postulated by one of Intel’s founders, Gordon Moore. According to Moore, the number of transistors on a single chip will double in number every 18 months. This statement has been known to many as the Moore’s Law. Unfortunately, when Intel introduced the 14nm process technology, the company discovered that the law could not be applied anymore. Now, it seems that the famous law will be used in a slightly different interpretation. Intel’s 7nm process technology is still in its early stages. The discoveries gathered from the making of the first few chips will be used to improve yield rates. Furthermore, improvements will enable Intel to invest more on facilities and machinery for the new chip processing technology.

Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $0.74 per share on $14.9 billion in revenue, which were flat and up 1%, respectively, from the previous year. Analysts expected Intel to post earnings of $0.63 per share on $14.8 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.75% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $42, while the Wall Street consensus target is $40.09. The stock closed Friday at $37.98 per share. Microsoft This top old-school technology stock is top pick for the year ahead at Merrill Lynch, and it has a massive $136.79 billion sitting on the balance sheet. Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) continues to find an increasing amount of support from portfolio managers, who have added the software giant to their holdings at an increasingly faster pace all of this year and last. Numerous Wall Street analysts feel that Microsoft has become a clear number two in the public or hyper-scale cloud infrastructure market with Azure, which is the company’s cloud computing platform offering. Some have flagged Azure as a solid rival to Amazon’s AWS service. Analysts also maintain that Microsoft is discounting Azure for large enterprises, such that Azure may be cheaper than AWS for larger users. The top analysts believe the company continues to make steady progress with its cloud transition and expect Office 365 and Azure to be solid contributors to top and bottom line for the next several years. While not likely to snag the top slot from Amazon, it could add huge incremental revenue for years to come, especially when you factor in the huge revenue potential from the banks, insurance companies and the financial services industry. Microsoft has reported quarterly earnings and revenue that easily topped analysts’ expectations, as its key cloud product, Azure, saw revenue grow 102%. Fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $0.69 on revenue of $22.64 billion compare to a year-earlier profit of $0.62 a share and revenue of $22.18 billion. Analysts expected $0.58 in EPS and $22.15 billion in revenue, according to the consensus estimate. Microsoft shareholders currently receive a 2.37% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $75 price target on the stock, and the consensus price objective for the software giant is posted at $66.14. The shares close most recently at $65.78 apiece.

The report coming from Bloomberg, instead, highlights the addition of an ARM processor working alongside an Intel one. This ARM chip, however, will only kick in when the MacBook goes into low-power mode, thereby prolonging the laptop’s battery life. And while Apple may not have any short-term plans to ditch Intel’s chips, it still doesn’t bode well for Intel’s image in the power efficiency department. New MacBook Pro owners and those following recent events in Apple land might see this insider tip as a continuation of Apple’s struggles in maintaining the MacBook’s image of an energy-efficient portable computer. It has recently taken a lot of flak, justified or not, over the battery life of the late 2016 models. While this development might not significantly improve the MacBook’s life while in use, it could at least increase longevity when on standby. ARM chips are quite popular for their energy efficiency, in contrast to Intel’s more powerful, but also more power-hungry, equivalents. But for performance and technical reasons, Apple won’t be able to easily create an ARM-based MacBook. What it will be doing instead is have a second processor that takes over functionality when the MacBook is in low-power mode. That means it will still be able to check e-mail, sync calendar, etc. even while the display is turned off. Actually, there is already an ARM chip inside the latest MacBook Pro model, specifically the one with a Touch Bar. That chip’s sole purpose is to manage that new functionality and nothing more. Apple’s experience with ARM and its ties with ARM Holdings could help it expand the chip’s role and give it access to more system functionality. Just like with the ARM T1 chip for the Touch Bar, Apple is unlikely to explicitly advertise this “Power Nap” feature as being ARM-powered. While the company has been reported to be mulling over moving away from Intel chips, but that has never come to pass. Like it or not, Intel, or the x86/x64 computer architecture in general, is still the go to for most computers. They just aren’t always as power smart as Apple would like them to be.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 02.01.17 in Personal Computing Comments 1051 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Intel processors have powered Apple's Mac computers for over a decade now, but Apple has also found success designing its own A-series ARM-based chips for the iPhone and iPad. While the company isn't going to dump Intel chips in the Mac any time soon, a report from Bloomberg indicates that Apple at least intends to put its foot in the water and test out designing its own silicon for the Mac. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Ian King, Apple is building an ARM-based chip that'll offload the Mac's "Power Nap" features from the standard Intel processor as a way to save battery life. Power Nap currently lets the Mac run software updates, download email and calendar updates, sync to iCloud, back up to Time Machine drives and a number of other features while the computer is asleep. Some of these features only work when plugged in, though -- perhaps with a chip that consumers less energy, Power Nap's capabilities could be expanded. This could also be a first step towards a move away from Intel processors entirely, although Bloomberg says such a move would not happen in the immediate future. But Apple has invested a lot of money in its own series of chips since 2010 and could have more freedom to update the Mac without having to rely on Intel's schedule. It's worth noting that this rumored Power Nap chip wouldn't be the first Apple-designed chip to make it into a Mac. That honor would go to the T1, an ARM-based chip that showed up in the new MacBook Pro last fall. That chip controls the laptop's Touch Bar and the Touch ID sensor but otherwise doesn't have to do any heavy lifting. Apple has been pretty quiet about the chip, but it seems that the next MacBook Pro could have another ARM chip -- maybe the T2? -- that takes more tasks away from the main Intel processor. If that's the case, we probably won't know for a while, as Apple probably won't update the MacBook Pro lineup again until this fall.

The report states that the new chip will be handling lower-power tasks alongside Intel chips. A full switch to ARM chips on Macs is highly unlikely, as this ARM-based chip would be working alongside Intel’s main processor. Issues with Intel’s chip release cycles has fueled some speculation that Apple could one day move to ARM chips completely. However, for now, it seems like Apple wants the ARM chips to focus on low-power tasks. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. […] Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. The new chip could be coming to an updated MacBook Pro later this year. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Having a dedicated chip to handle lower-power tasks could help aid battery life, which is a huge issue with the latest generation MacBook Pros. The iPhone, for example, has a low-power co-processor that handles raise to wake and the ‘Hey Siri’ command.

What would an ARM-Intel hybrid Mac look like? Would whole segments of the operating system run on the ARM processor, allowing the more power-hungry Intel chip to be put to sleep except when it was absolutely needed? There are a bunch of big questions here, most notably the identity of the code that would run on the ARM processor and where it came from. Would Mac apps include extensions or plug-ins that would be designated to run on ARM? Would Mac apps provide two separate sets of program binaries so that the system could switch them between processor architectures at will? PowerPC to Intel was clean and fast; this sounds anything but. Post navigation ← Previous Post RSS Sponsorship: The best way to advertise on 512 Pixels is via the RSS feed.

Demands on IT have necessitated a change to on-demand services, self-service models, and increasing focus on time-to-value for IT projects. Research firm Gartner agrees that the use of cloud computing is growing, and says that in 2016 this growth will increase to become the bulk of new IT spend. “Overall, there are very real trends toward cloud platforms, and also toward massively scalable processing. Virtualization, service orientation and the internet have converged to sponsor a phenomenon that enables individuals and businesses to choose how they’ll acquire or deliver IT services, with reduced emphasis on the constraints of traditional software and hardware licensing models,” said Chris Howard, research vice president at Gartner. “Services delivered through the cloud will foster an economy based on delivery and consumption of everything from storage to computation to video to finance deduction management.” With all of this in mind, it’s no wonder that new types of data center models have directly impacted growth in virtualization technologies – specifically application delivery and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). In fact, we’ve been seeing a steady increase in spending when it comes to converged systems. More industries and verticals are redesigning their data center to better support efficiency, scalability, and improved user productivity. According to IDC, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Integrated Systems (CI) market generated more than $2.0 billion in revenue, a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. These systems are pre-integrated and vendor-certified, containing server hardware, disk storage systems, networking equipment, and basic element/systems management software. A recent Dell EMC | Intel Data Center Trends Survey points out that one if five respondents have deployed a converged infrastructure (CI) solution. An additional 25% plan on doing so over the next 12 months. Their top two business drivers are: Improve density for virtualization – 58% of respondents Enable a virtualization initiative (VDI, applications) – 53% of respondents. In this context, converged infrastructure can be a perfect use-case for virtualization, application delivery, and VDI: CI Creates Next-Generation Density. Intelligent converged infrastructure solutions allow you to create greater levels of density while deploying fewer pieces of hardware. Not only are you creating better multi-tenant ecosystems with converged solutions, you’re also doing this very cost effectively. Remember, convergence and consolidation also help save on data center real estate, cooling and power consumption, and even management costs. Most of all, consolidation can also help with density. Converged systems help you remove legacy data center components while still catering to a digital user. This means more apps, more virtual desktops, and more capabilities around mobility. There are numerous benefits to the user, the business, and the data center when converged infrastructure helps consolidate critical technologies. Optimizing User Experiences and Controlling Critical Resources. There’s been a major resurgence behind a number of virtualization technologies, including VDI, application delivery, and user management. Because of this, resource management has been a critical initiative for a number of organizations. The challenge revolves around resources that are isolated, hard to get to, or not properly utilized. This is where converged infrastructure comes in. Remember, this spans logical and physical deployments of convergence. Converged infrastructure solutions act as central points for resource control; it’s as simple as that. Data center and cloud administrators have fewer management points and greater levels of control over their critical (and expensive) resources. Moving forward, there will be more virtual technologies and even more integration with cloud. Changing Business and Data Center Economics. You’re not just deploying a new piece of technology into your data center. You’re deploying a business tool designed to help the organization grow and introduce more efficiency. Converged infrastructure is a means to replace old hardware, consolidate resources, and reduce the entire data center footprint. Many pushes into the cloud require better economics to support more users and applications. Older server, network, and compute technologies – sitting fragmented – could never achieve the level of scale that converged infrastructure can provide. So, by reducing data center footprints with convergence, we’re not only unifying critical resources, we’re also potentially reducing operating costs. Moving forward, organizations will continue to create greater levels of efficiency for their critical data center systems. This means deploying architecture that can support new business initiatives, while still empowering users to be extremely productive. Many organizations (across many verticals and industries) are looking to CI as a way to revolutionize their data center architecture. If you’re working with virtualization today, look to converged infrastructure systems to help you align with your business and future market demands.

Coren Obsession "America First" February 02, 2017 A sign of the past? (Monica Almeida / Reuters) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession "America First" February 02, 2017 For skilled immigrants around the world, California’s Silicon Valley is the promised land. Over the last few decades, San Jose and San Francisco have become home to tens of thousands of people from around the world with degrees in science, engineering, and math. Many have built crucial new technologies at Facebook, Microsoft, and other companies. Some founded multi-billion-dollar companies, including Google, Uber, Intel, and Tesla. Historically, US immigration policy invited the world’s smartest and most innovative minds to come, learn, and do business in the country. US president Donald Trump is preparing to revoke that invitation. His draft proposals, along with an executive order on Jan. 27 halting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending the country’s entire refugee program, promise to remake America’s immigration rules, including those covering H-1B work visas. The rules as drafted would likely tighten quotas, impose heavy limitations on foreign students, eliminate spouses’ ability to apply for work, and enact measures curtailing the tech industry’s options to attract and keep talent. Protestors against Trump’s executive order on immigration gather outside Terminal 4 at JFK airport on Jan. 28. (Reuters/Joe Penney) Jon Zieger, general counsel at San Francisco-based payments company Stripe, which was started by two Irish immigrant brothers, warned the measures will shut out the world’s best students and engineers from studying at US schools, who might then join or start US companies. “The restrictions on immigration are going to hurt the tech sector and hurt the US economy more broadly,” he said in an interview. “Immigration is fundamental to every industry that requires high-skilled and technical labor.” A fight over H-1B visas Silicon Valley’s anxiety is, in part, a question of supply and demand. Three times more people apply for H-1B visas than is allowed under the annual quota of 85,000 (about half of which go to tech). Even rumors of curtailment of the visa have tanked the stocks of outsourcing firms in India, where most contract workers originate. While the program is criticized for permitting some foreign software developers willing to work for less than US workers, University of California Davis researchers say H-1B workers across all professions generated 10% to 20% in annual productivity growth, adding $615 billion to the US economy between 1990 and 2010. But tech’s reaction is also deeply personal. People born outside the country have founded more than half of America’s private start-ups valued at $1 billion dollars or more, according to a report by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) (pdf), a non-partisan think tank. Once companies with immigrants in key management or product roles are included, the share grows to 70% of so-called unicorns as of 2016. Not coincidentally, the US has awarded more patents to immigrants in the last decade than any other country. “This Administration wants to gut American immigration history and this starts with potential company founders in Silicon Valley,” said Matthew La Corte, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian think-tank Niskanen Center in Washington, DC. “What we should be doing is spread the H-1B to as many companies as possible to spread the benefits…Why not rely on entrepreneurs who have already proven they can start companies and who can come create jobs.” An expansion the H-1B program looks unlikely to say the least. GOP legislation proposed by senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Alabama senator and prospective US attorney general Jeff Sessions would essentially end the H-1B program by requiring all applicants to have a PhD, at least ten years of experience, and to receive a minimum salary of $110,000 up from the current $60,000. “Few if any of the billion dollar startup companies with an immigrant founder would have been started in the United States,” if this law had been in place, reports the NFAP (pdf). But legislators in both parties are eagerly introducing reform bills (some far more supportive of H-1B). All remain stalled without White House guidance. But if Trump’s campaign rhetoric and leaked documents send a message to immigrants, that message is clear: Leave. The latest draft executive orders from the White House sketch out a broad reframing of the nation’s approach to immigration. While few rules have been formulated, agencies from the State Department to the Department of Homeland Security would be asked to study all costs from immigrants for public services, the potential cost savings and rule changes in the “public interest.” Tech against the president Silicon Valley companies have already gone to war against Trump’s executive orders. “The tech community is powerful,” wrote Sam Altman, president of the seed fund Y Combinator, on his blog on Jan 29. “We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally.” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, and Expedia are filing statements supporting the suit by Washington state’s attorney general against Trump’s executive order banning refugees. Apple CEO Tim Cook also said he’s lobbying “very, very senior people in the White House” to roll back the order in an interview (paywall) with the Wall Street Journal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk of Tesla and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, members of Trump’s Strategic & Policy Forum, have vowed on Twitter to take proposals backing immigration to the President. Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green pledged $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union on the company’s blog on Jan 29. Airbnb is offering free housing and Uber created a $3 million legal defense fund for drivers with immigration issues. A host of others including Box, Dropbox, Google, Postmates, Salesforce, Amazon, Apple, Autodesk, and Intel took to Twitter to express their opposition.

Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but, doesn't matter: do the right thing because it's right. — Stewart Butterfield (@stewart) January 28, 2017 But critics, including Trump, charge technology executives are less interested in American ideals than in their ability to make outsized returns for themselves and their investors. By importing cheaper labor, companies can depress US wages and reap the profits. “The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: These are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,” Trump said in March 2016 statement. “I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse.” Indeed, several companies including Siemens and Disney have been accused of doing exactly that (despite companies that use it for the intended purpose of recruiting exceptional and hard-to-find workers from doctors to engineers). An investigation by the The Center for Investigative Reporting revealed several cases where cheap, overseas contractors with H-1B visas were used to replace American workers. In a few galling cases, Americans were even asked to train their low-paid replacements from Indian outsourcing firms that now account for the majority of the H-1B visas issued, reports Bloomberg. The startup visa That association may doom a second policy welcomed by Silicon Valley, the Obama-era International Entrepreneur Rule, also called the “startup visa.” Although scheduled to go into effect this summer, Trump froze its implementation on his first day in office. The rule gives the Department of Homeland Security “parole” authority, typically used for humanitarian relief, to let non-citizens work on their companies in the US for two years and apply for a three-year extension to remain if they can show “potential for rapid business growth and job creation” and secure funding from investors or government entities. While Trump’s draft orders do not single out the Entrepreneur Rule, they would eliminate any use of parole that “circumvents statutory immigration policy,” essentially killing it. Other countries are moving in the opposite direction: 13 countries now offer some sort of startup visa, and Canada’s tech community is lobbying Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to craft a visa to scoop up talent that the US rejects. Trump signs an executive action on extreme vetting for immigrants at the Pentagon in Washington on Jan. 27, 2017. (Susan Walsh / AP Photo) Trump’s immigration proposals are only partially achievable by executive order. Congress must cooperate to make any major changes in the H-1B visa program. But if Trump’s campaign promises are implemented, the US may ultimately see its economy sputter. Non-partisan, independent scholars who have studied the immigration question for decades have an unequivocal answer: Immigrants are a net win for the US economy, jobs, and wages. Five hundred economists (including five Nobel laureates) wrote former US President George W. Bush in 2005 that “vastly more Americans benefit from the contributions that immigrants make to our economy, including lower consumer prices,” despite a small drop in wages for native-born Americans working low-skilled jobs. While Trump himself is the son of an immigrant (his mother came from Scotland) and two of his three wives were immigrants, Niskanen’s La Corte is doubtful that the administration’s review of the data will reach a similar conclusion. “We’ve seen if you want to work for this President, if you don’t provide the expected answers, you’re out of the job,” he said. Even if the data is on Silicon Valley’s side, the populist revolt Trump is leading may sink all immigration, beneficial or not. At its heart, writes David Frum at The Atlantic, immigration is a class dispute. Focusing on the benefits to the “average American” ignores real (if small) harms to some low-skilled Americans and overlooks the fact that the US currently enjoys the lowest workforce participation of working-age American men in recorded history. While America has always been a nation of immigrants, its share of foreign-born citizens in the US stands at the near-record high of 14%, up from the 5% in 1965, says Pew. It’s not surprising that voters who elected Trump appear ready to sweep away the relatively welcoming immigration consensus that has prevailed since 1965. The Valley itself is a poster child for the class divide. The digital economy has built a rapidly stratifying society. Winners (urban, educated and white-collar) are pulling ahead while those outside the radius of America’s technological prosperity have seen their prospects and cultural influence fade. Citizens excluded from Silicon Valley’s glittering promise may decide that when it comes to immigration, no one deserves those benefits after all.

Oh, the excitement! Oh, the household names! No, I’m not talking about football, I’m talking about the commercials that are sprinkled throughout the football. Whether you are into the actual game taking place on the field on Super Bowl Sunday, or whether you are more into the Puppy Bowl, everybody loves a good Super Bowl commercial–which are often filled with surprises, new products, and delightful cameos. At a sticker-shocking price tag of $5.02 million per 30-second spot, they better be good. While some companies save their Super Bowl ads for the big game, others release their commercials early. Below, we’ve collected some of the most exciting spots released so far. More: 12 of the Most Sexist Super Bowl Commercials Ever Budweiser “Born the Hard Way”  If you had told me that I might get a little teary-eyed at the new Budweiser commercial, I would have assumed that you had had one too many. But here we are approaching Super Bowl LI, and the domestic brew king has put aside the Clydesdales and hit a home run with a timely, touching one-minute ad that follows the immigration story of founder Adolphus Busch. It puts a lot of things in perspective and leaves you a little thirsty. Skittles “Romance”  Skittles’ super-successful advertising year is rolling into 2017 with a cute and funny 30-second spot featuring, among other things, a slightly inept Romeo, a girl named Katie, Katie’s grandmother, and what I think might be a beaver? The ad has only been posted on YouTube for a week, and it already has 4.5 million views. Mercedes-Benz “Easy Driver”  You know you are pulling out all of the stops when you hire the Cohen Brothers to direct your one-minute Super Bowl ad. The legendary film-making duo does not disappoint in this spot for the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster, which stars Peter Fonda and takes place at a very intimidating biker bar. Squarespace “John Malcovich”  John Malcovich is a delight, even when he is being weird and angry. Maybe especially when he is being weird and angry. Web design and domain hosting company Sqaurespace took full advantage in their one-minute ad spot, which depicts the actor finding out that another John Malcovich has already claimed his domain name. I dare you not to laugh when he shouts, “Get out of my name!”  Intel “Brady Everyday”  Intel took a gamble and won by casting Super Bowl LI starting quarterback Tom Brady in their commercial for Intel 360° Technology. The spot dramatizes the Patriots star’s morning routine, which might be fun for fans but lacks much interest for others. More: Epic Super Bowl Bites Lexus “Man and Machine”  Luxury car maker Lexus shows off its brand new 2018 LC 500 performance coupe in this extended spot that compares the sleek new car with the some equally sleek dance moves. Add Sia’s “Move Your Body” as a soundtrack, and I call this one a winner. Turbo Tax “Humpty Fall”  Sadly, football season is followed closely by the significantly-less-fun tax season. To help us get through these tough times, Turbo Tax has created a 45-second Super Bowl ad that takes a perfectly dark and funny look at what it might be like if Humpty Dumpty used the Turbo Tax mobile app to file his taxes. Wix “Big Game First Spot with Jason Statham & Gal Gadot” Web development platform Wix.com is throwing its hat into the Super Bowl ad ring this year with an high-speed spot starring action stars Jason Statham and Gal Gadot. Funny and fun, the commercial shows the duo destroying a restaurant during hand-to-hand combat while the owner is busy creating the perfect website. Mr. Clean “Cleaner of Your Dreams”  Have you ever had a thing for Mr. Clean? No, me neither. But in Proctor & Gamble’s first ever Super Bowl spot staring the bald mopper, he is looking a little more desirable, if only because he is tackling shower scum. Two thumbs up, both for creativity and for breaking the tired cleaning commercial trope that janitorial duties are primarily for women. More: Super Bowl commercials that remind you how awesome families are Ford “Go Further”  Besides Budweiser's pro-immigration ad, he big Super Bowl commercial winner for me so far is Ford’s 90-second spot that focuses on new innovations and concepts like self-driving cars, ride sharing, bike sharing, and electric cars. The ad is beautifully shot, filled with everyday moments and totally tapped in to some real, human emotions, all with Nina Simone singing in the background and Bryan Cranston’s voiceover. T-Mobile "#UnilmitedMoves" Justin Bieber, Rob Gronkowski, and Terrell Owens team up for T-Mobile's Super Bowl ad, which explores the history of the celebration dance and introduces T-Mobile One, a flat-rate cell plan that includes unlimited data and calls. Come for the attractive superstars, stay for the dance moves. Tiffany & Co. "Legendary Style" Lady Gaga is scheduled to rock the Super Bowl's Half-Time Show, but that's not the only time you'll see her face on Sunday. The pop star is also the focus of Tiffany's first-ever game day spot, where she will talk intimately about her creative process as part of the jewelry company's Legendary Style campaign. You'll have to wait until February 5 for the full one-minute take, but we have a short preview below. Часы & Караты: Леди Гага стала лицом кампании Legendary Style от Tiffany & Co. from POST@-Magazine on Vimeo. Buick "Not So Pee Wee Football" Buick's new Super Bowl ad asks us to imagine what it would be like if Cam Newton played on your kid's pee wee football team (and also what it would be like if your kid's pee wee football coach was Miranda Kerr). The result is cute, light 60-second commercial that also highlights two newly-designed Buicks, the Cascada convertible and Encore compact luxury SUV. Kia "Holding Out for a Hero" I love everything Melissa McCarthy touches, and this year for Kia's big game day ad, she is getting into a bunch of hilarious messes while trying to save the world. The one-minute Super Bowl commercial leans hard on physical comedy, but it's a light and fun romp from the icebergs of Antarctica to the plains of Africa. The environmentally-friendly product is also worth the watch: Kia is unveiling its redesigned hybrid SUV crossover, the Niro. Which commercial is your favorite so far?

You’ve gone from buying off-the-shelf computers that anyone can get, to creating your own customized machine. It’s very gratifying . . . as well as intimidating. But the process itself is actually quite simple. We’ll walk you through everything you need to know. Some Quick Notes The order in which I assembled my own computer might not be the best order for you. For example, I put the motherboard in first, then added the CPU, RAM, and everything else What's Inside Your Computer: The Story Of Every Component You Need To Know What's Inside Your Computer: The Story Of Every Component You Need To Know Whether you're buying a new computer or building your own, you're going to be subjected to a lot of acronyms and random numbers. Read More . However, it might be easier to install your processor and RAM before inserting the motherboard. You may want to put your PSU in first as well, if there’s not going to be much room between it and your motherboard. Different walkthroughs recommend different things. But the best way to go is to look at your case and your components and make a decision from there. If you do things in an inconvenient order, though, all is not lost. You may have to loosen a few screws or use a needle-nose pliers to attach some cables in a tight spot, but it shouldn’t be too hard to make it work. Also, a cleanly cabled computer will be quieter, cooler, and look nicer. It’s not a requirement to spend time making sure your cables are routed cleanly, but it’s a good idea. Most cables should be routed behind the motherboard tray (where the motherboard sits) and then back to the front of the board. Not only does it look nicer, but it encourages better airflow around the heat-generating parts of your PC. Use velcro straps or twist ties to keep them secured, too. You can use zip ties, but if you ever have to cut them, be extremely careful not to cut the cable. 1. Eliminate Static Risk Static electricity can destroy the sensitive components you’ll be using to build your computer. Even a tiny shock can fry a motherboard or processor. So you’ll want to take specific steps to make sure that you’re not going to build up and release static electricity. One common way to do this is to wear an anti-static wristband. You can grab one of these for about five bucks, and it’ll keep you grounded, preventing damage from static. It’s an easy way to be safe. Rosewill ESD Anti-Static Wrist Strap Components RTK-002, Black/Yellow Rosewill ESD Anti-Static Wrist Strap Components RTK-002, Black/Yellow Resistance: < 10K Ohm (Wrist Strap) Buy Now At Amazon $5.09 If you don’t have one, you can take other precautions. Stand on a bare floor instead of on carpet while you’re building. Don’t wear wool socks or a big sweater. Try to minimize the amount of clothing you’re wearing; jeans and a t-shirt are good. Touch a grounded piece of bare metal often during the build, and always before you pick up a component (the metal of your computer case is a good option). Try not to move around a lot while you’re putting your computer together. All of these things will help reduce the amount of static you build up. On a related note, be careful when handling your components. They’re very sensitive, and bending a tiny pin or getting oil from your skin on one of the contacts could affect how they work. So be especially careful not to touch the contact points. Hold components by the edges. In general, just be careful when handling this stuff, and you’ll be fine. 2. Get Everything Together The first thing you’re going to want to do is gather all of your supplies. Get your case, all of your components, and all of the manuals together. Grab a small screwdriver, a small needle-nose pliers, thermal paste (if your CPU didn’t come with a stock cooler), and a scissors or knife for opening packages. You can take everything out of the boxes now, if you’d like. Leave components in the anti-static packaging, though. Getting all of those boxes out of the way will give you more room to work, but it also makes everything a little less protected. So it’s up to you. I would recommend having all of the manuals set aside, though, as there’s a good chance you’ll need to reference them a few times. Here are the components that I used for my own build: Case: Corsair Carbide Series 100R Motherboard: Asus ATX DDR4 H170-PRO/CSM CPU: Intel Core i5-6500 3.2GHz Quad Core Skylake RAM: Corsair Vengenace LPX 8GB DDR4 2400MHz Graphics card: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 WINDFORCE 6G SSD: SanDisk SSD Plus 240GB HDD: WD Blue 1TB 7200 RPM Power supply: Rosewill Capstone G550 These instructions will apply to pretty much any set of components, but skim through your manuals to make sure you’re not missing anything particular to your specific machine. 3. Install The Motherboard’s I/O Shield First, take the side panels off of your case. They’re probably held on by a couple screws; remove those, then slide the side panels out. Every motherboard comes with an I/O shield that snaps into the back of your case from the inside. It should be clear which orientation to use (any labels on the shield will be right-side-up), but if it’s not, look at how your motherboard will be oriented in the case. The ports on the board should match up with the ports on the shield. You might have to give the shield a solid push to get it to snap into the back of the case. 4. Install The Motherboard If the processor is the heart of your computer, the motherboard is the nervous system. It coordinates the activities of various components. Your computer case will have a number of screws that keep the motherboard in place, so make sure you have those and a small screwdriver handy. It should be obvious where your motherboard goes; the ports will line up with the I/O shield. There will also be a number of standoffs — small posts that keep your motherboard from touching the side of the case. Line up the holes in your motherboard with the slots for the screws, and set the motherboard down. Getting the board to sit properly can be a bit of a challenge, especially with the I/O shield. You may have to move it around a bit or very slightly bend back the metal pieces on the backside of the shield. Be very careful while you’re doing this, and make sure not to touch any of the contacts on the board. Once the motherboard is properly seated, loosely put in the screws, then tighten them one at a time. Don’t go crazy; they don’t need to be super tight, just snug, and you can damage the board if you over-tighten them. Just put enough pressure on to be sure that the board isn’t going to move around. Make sure to insert a screw into every hole in the motherboard. There are a number of cables coming from your case that can now be connected to your motherboard. These are very small connectors that will be labeled “LED+,” “LED-“, “HDD+,” “Reset,” and so on, and they need to connect to the corresponding pins on your motherboard. Every case is going to be different, so consult the manuals of your motherboard and case. You can also connect the built-in case fan as well. My motherboard’s fan pins are labeled CHA FAN1 (as in “chassis”); look for something similar on your board. 5. Install The Processor The port for the processor will be obvious on any motherboard; it’s a prominent square panel. To open the panel, push down on the arm and move it sideways to get it out from under the metal retaining piece that secures it. Lift up on the arm to expose the contacts for the processor. Holding your processor by the edges, gently set it onto the port. If you have an Intel processor, there will be two notches that align if you have it in the correct orientation. AMD processors have a gold triangle in one corner, and that aligns with a triangle in the CPU socket. (There’s also a very good chance that the text printed on the CPU will face the same direction as the text printed on the motherboard.) Once you’ve set the CPU in the socket, use the arm to lower the panel cover. Push down on the arm — it takes some pressure, so you’ll need to press firmly — and slide it back under the metal retainer. 6. Install The CPU Fan Your CPU is going to be doing a lot of hard work, which means it’s going to be generating quite a bit of heat. The CPU fan (or another type of cooler, if you’re going for a third-party option) helps keep it cool, prolonging the life of your processor. If your CPU came with a cooling fan, the fan almost certainly already has thermal paste on the bottom of it. Look for the silver stripes on the metal heatsink. If you bought a a cooler and it doesn’t have thermal paste on it already, you’re going to have to apply some. There are various schools of thought on the best way to pattern the paste you apply, but it all comes down to the same thing: a little bit goes a long way. You really don’t need very much. Some sources recommend a dot the size of a grain of rice. Other recommend two parallel lines. Each manufacturer will also provide some guidance on how to apply the paste. Read the instructions that come with your paste. After that, you’re ready to install the cooler. The fan that came with my Intel CPU simply requires that you push the four corner pins until they click. Other coolers may require that you do something else to secure them to the board; again, read the instructions. The CPU cooler also needs to be connected to your motherboard; you’ll see a set of pins labeled “CPU fan” or something similar. Connect the CPU cooler in the same way you connected the case fan. 7. Install RAM Your motherboard should have a very obvious place to place RAM (it may have “DIMM” printed on the board). There are often four slots for RAM sticks. Check the instructions on your motherboard for instructions on which slots you should use for the number of sticks you have. Mine, for example, says to put one in the second slot if you’re using one; the second and fourth slots if you’re using two; the first, second, and fourth for three; or all four. RAM slots have a small lever that you’ll need to push down before inserting the RAM. Once you’ve done that, push the RAM into the slot until you hear it click. It may take more force than you expect (but start gently and slowly increase the pressure). When I first installed my RAM, it only clicked on one side, and it wasn’t fully engaged. Make sure yours is all the way in. If you have an SO-DIMM (shorter) RAM stick A Quick & Dirty Guide to RAM: What You Need to Know A Quick & Dirty Guide to RAM: What You Need to Know RAM is a crucial component of every computer, but it can be confusing to understand if you aren't a tech guru. In this post, we break it down in easy-to-grasp terms. Read More , don’t put it in a DIMM (longer) slot. It won’t work. You’ll need a motherboard that supports SO-DIMM RAM or a standard DIMM stick. 8. Install The Graphics Card If you’re building a gaming PC, this is the real muscle of your machine 5 Things You Have to Know Before Buying a Graphics Card 5 Things You Have to Know Before Buying a Graphics Card Here are five key points to keep in mind before you buy your next graphics card, otherwise you may regret your purchase. Read More . Hopefully you already checked to make sure that your card will fit in your case – modern graphics cards can be quite large. If not, you’re going to need a new case or a new card. To start, find the PCIe port nearest to the heat sink on your motherboard. Your motherboard will likely have multiple PCIe ports, but not all of them are the same length. Many graphics cards use the PCIe x16 port, which is longer than the PCIe x4 ports you might also see. Once you’ve found the right port for your card, remove the corresponding vent cover(s) from the back of your computer. The covers can be removed with a small screwdriver. On my case, the rear vent covers were also secured by an L-shaped piece. If you see anything like this, remove it; it will make inserting the card much easier. Now, insert the video card into the uppermost PCIe slot. If you have two similar slots, always use the one closest to the CPU; the furthest one is used for a second video card running in Crossfire or SLI mode What Is SLI & How Can It Improve Gaming Performance? What Is SLI & How Can It Improve Gaming Performance? Sometimes a niche term is taken for granted. We have some such terms in the world of computing hardware, and one of them is SLI. It’s been around for so long that geeks take it... Read More . Make sure the plastic retaining lever is down, then push the card into the slot and secure it with the lever, much like you did with your RAM. As with RAM, it might take a bit of pressure. Once you’ve got the card in and the securing lever back in place, make sure the bracket on the back side of the card matches up with the vent cover ledge. Put the screws that were holding the small vent covers back in to secure the back of your card to the case. Put those covers in a safe place in case you need them again. Then replace the L-shaped piece as well. 9. Install Other Expansion Cards If you have other expansion cards, like Bluetooth, networking, or RAID cards, use the same process for installing them as you did the video card. Find the correctly sized PCIe port that’s closest to the motherboard’s heat sink and install the card, making sure the retaining lever is in place. Then attach the card — if required — to the back of the case. 10. Install Storage Drives First, find the storage drive bays in your case. Depending on the case, there may be removable brackets to hold your drives, or there may just be a sort of scaffold where you can secure the drives. In the picture below, you can see the removable brackets that hold my drives. If you have these brackets, secure your drives to them with the small screws that came with your case. If your case offers tool-free installation, you don’t have to worry about this step. Once the drives are secure, reinsert the brackets back into the case. Whether you use these brackets or not, orient the drives so that the SATA ports are facing toward the motherboard (or the motherboard side of the case). If your case doesn’t have these removable brackets, you’ll just need to find the screw slots that match up with the small holes on your drives and screw them in. As with other pieces, don’t over-tighten the screws; just make sure they’re tight enough to keep your drives from moving around or falling out. To connect the drives to your motherboard, find the SATA cables that came with your board. Insert one end in the SATA port on your drive, and another into the SATA port on your motherboard. If you have both SATA2 and SATA3 ports, use the SATA3 ports for your drive, as it will benefit from faster speeds. That’s all there is to it. If you’ve opted for a PCI SSD PCIe vs. SATA: Which Type of SSD Is Best for You? PCIe vs. SATA: Which Type of SSD Is Best for You? When buying a new SSD, you have a choice between SATA and PCIe. But what's the difference? Just because one is "better" doesn't mean it's the right one for you. Read More , you won’t need to worry about all this. Just plug it into a PCI port and you’re good to go. 11. Install Optical Drives While many people will opt to build their computers without optical drives (as I did), you may still want one. To insert an optical drive, remove the cover from the front of your computer case and slide the drive into one of the available optical drive bays. You should see two screw holes on each side of the drive align with holes in the drive bay. Secure it with screws. Then, just as you did with your storage drives, connect SATA cables. Optical drives should be plugged into SATA2 ports, if they’re available. 12. Install The PSU The power supply unit 6 Things to Know When Buying a Power Supply Unit (PSU) 6 Things to Know When Buying a Power Supply Unit (PSU) Power supply units aren't as glamorous as processors and graphics cards, but they're a critical PC component that you absolutely cannot overlook. Here's what to know when buying one. Read More is a rather hefty piece of gear that distributes power to your entire machine. Before anything else, make sure it’s off, and unplug the cord that goes into the wall. This is not a piece of equipment to be trifled with. There will be an obvious place at the bottom of the case for it, near the back, as well as a large space in the back of the case for the PSU’s vent. Slot the PSU in the space and line up the slots for screws on the back of the case. Once you’ve made sure the PSU is oriented correctly (the port for the power cord, as well as the power switch, face out the back of the case), secure the PSU with the screws from your case. Make sure you can get to the ports on the back of the PSU. 13. Connect The PSU Everything in your computer needs power, so it’s time to get the PSU hooked up. If it’s a modular PSU, there will be one large bundle of cables coming out of the back of the unit with a 20-, 20+4-, or 24-pin connector. That’s the main power supply for your motherboard. Find the large socket for this connector, make sure it has the same number of pins, and connect the PSU. If you have a 20-pin motherboard, the 20- and 20+4-pin PSU connectors will work. A 20+4- or 24-pin connector will work on a 24-pin motherboard. You’ll also need to attach a PSU cable to power your CPU; this port should be near the processor (as you can see below, it’ll also likely be labeled “EATX12V”). It’ll be either a 4- or 8-pin socket. Connect your PSU to this socket using the appropriate cable. The back of your PSU will be labeled to indicate which port to use. Next, connect your PSU to your graphics card and any other expansion card that needs its own power supply. These are usually 6- or 8-pin sockets, and your PSU should have cables to match. Again, check the back of your power supply to determine where to plug those cables in. Your storage and optical drives will need power from SATA connectors as well. You might not be able to tell in the image below, but some of the PSU’s cables have multiple connectors, so I used a single cable to connect both the HDD and SSD to the power supply. Take a look around your case to make sure everything has a power socket has been connected to your PSU. If you miss something, it’s not going to work. 14. Install Case Fans Most cases include a single case fan, but if you’re going to install additional fans, it’s time to connect them. Find an unused fan location and use the four included screws to attach the fan to the inside of the case. Attach the cable from the fan to your motherboard. If you’re using a very high-powered CPU, graphics card, or a whole lot of RAM, consider installing additional cooling mechanisms How to Prevent Computer Overheating & Keep Your PC Cool How to Prevent Computer Overheating & Keep Your PC Cool Overheating computers may lead to unexpected shutdowns, lost data, and hardware damage. We'll show you how to read computer temperatures and simple ways to keep your PC cool. Read More . Extra fans are cheap, easy to install, and will keep your computer functioning longer. 15. Double-Check Everything Now that everything’s been installed, take a moment to double-check that everything’s connected how it should be. Make sure your RAM and graphics card are seated properly. Check that your drives are plugged into your motherboard. Ensure that all of the PSU cables are secure. Check for anything you forgot to put into your computer. If something hasn’t been assembled properly, there’s a good chance that your computer won’t boot up. If it all looks good, put the side panels back on your case and secure them with the included screws. 16. Boot It Up The moment of truth! Attach the power cable to your PSU, plug it into the wall, and flip the power switch. Plug in your monitor. Then, hit the power button on your case. If it boots up, congratulations! You’ve successfully built your first PC. If it doesn’t boot up — which is probably more likely — you’re going to have to go back into the case and check everything again. When I first fired up my machine, the case fan started up, but nothing appeared on my monitor. I knew the motherboard was getting power, so I checked everything else. I discovered that my RAM wasn’t fully in the socket. A couple of the PSU cables seemed a little bit loose, too, so I made sure they were all the way in. I had to open up the case and check everything again a couple times. Eventually, though, hitting the power button resulted in a reassuring whir and the UEFI BIOS Discover Your BIOS & Learn How to Make the Most of It Discover Your BIOS & Learn How to Make the Most of It What the heck is the BIOS, anyway? Is it really that important to know? We think so and fortunately it's pretty easy. Let us introduce you. Read More appearing. 17. Install the Operating System Installing an operating system on a computer without one should be fairly easy; just insert the bootable CD or USB drive, and tell your BIOS to boot from that media (how you do that depends on the BIOS on your motherboard). If it doesn’t install right away, you’re going to have to do some troubleshooting. Depending on your components and the operating system you’re using, you’ll use different strategies, and your best bet is probably to run a search online. Once you’ve done that, you’re good to go!

Bloomberg reports from sources within Apple that a new in-house chip will take over some ancillary functions from the main processor. The new chip is codenamed T310 and said to be related to the T1 chip that powers the graphical Touch Bar on high-end MacBook Pro laptops. In addition to its Touch Bar duties, the existing T1 chip takes care of security authentication and stores biometric and payment data from the machine's fingerprint reader. Bloomberg speculates that the T310 will take over those tasks, and manage activities that take place in Apple's "Power Nap" sleep state. Existing devices rely on the Intel CPU to perform jobs like checking email, installing software updates, and synchronizing schedule information while the computer is asleep. Shifting these jobs away from a general purpose CPU to a more specialized piece of hardware could potentially save power and extend stand-by times. The Touch Bar's T1 and the rumored T310 are certainly not Apple's first foray into chip design. The company has been using in-house silicon designs in iOS devices since the 2010 introduction of the company's A4 SoC. Bloomberg's sources said the new chips could start appearing in refreshed MacBook Pro machines later this year.   Tags: Chipsets Mobile computing Mac User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe by Tim Allen, Intel’s Global SAP Marketing Alliance Manager Machine learning will come of age this year, moving from the research labs and proof-of-concept implementations to cutting-edge business solutions. Along the way, it will help power innovations, such as autonomous vehicles, precision farming, therapeutic drug discovery and advanced fraud detection for financial institutions. Machine learning intersects with statistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, focusing on the development of fast and efficient algorithms to enable real-time data processing. Rather than just follow explicitly programmed instructions, these machine learning algorithms learn from experience, making them a key component of artificial intelligence platforms. Machine Learning Helps Tackle IoT Data Flows Machine learning may also help us with a challenge from one of last year’s most buzzed about technology developments: the Internet of Things. The first generation of big data analytics grew up around the flow of information generated by social media, online shopping, online videos, Web surfing and other user-generated online behaviors, according to Vin Sharma, the director of machine learning solutions in Intel’s Data Center Group. Analyzing these massive datasets required new technologies, flexible cloud computing and virtualization, software such as Apache Hadoop and Spark. It also needed more powerful, high-performance processors that provided the tools to uncover the insights in big data. And today’s IoT connected networks dwarf the data volume from this first era of big data. As devices and sensors continue proliferating, so will the volume of data they create. For example, a single autonomous car will generate 4,000 GB of data per day. The new Airbus A380-1000 is equipped with 10,000 sensors in each wing. Legacy big data technology won’t be able to handle the data created by connected appliances in smart homes, traffic sensors in smart cities and robotic systems in smart factories. New and Exciting System Requirements Machine learning is key to analyzing the enormous, repetitious volumes of data flowing from vast, always-on IoT networks. While machine learning may seem like science fiction to many, it is already in use and familiar to users of social media and online shopping (Facebook’s news feed relies on machine learning algorithms, and Amazon’s recommendation engine uses machine learning to suggest what book or movie you should enjoy next). Machine learning systems recognize the normal flow patterns of data present on IoT networks and focus on the anomalies or patterns outside the norm. So, from billions of data points, machine learning can separate the “signal from the noise” in vast data flows, helping organizations focus on what’s meaningful. However, to be useful and effective for businesses, machine learning algorithms must run computations at enormous scale in a matter of milliseconds -- on an ongoing basis. These ever more complex computations put pressure on traditional datacenter processors and computing platforms. To operate at scale and in real time, machine learning systems require processors with multiple integrated cores, faster memory subsystems, and architectures that can parallelize processing for next generation analytical intelligence. These are platforms with built-in analytical processing engines, as well as the capacity to run complex algorithms in-memory for real-time results and immediate application of insights. Final Prediction Processors built for high-performance computing will be in high demand. Machine learning and artificial intelligence will need a lot more power as they begin to connect the dots between IoT data flows and customer engagement for improved sales and outreach. These processors were traditionally the province of research laboratories and supercomputing challenges, such as modeling weather patterns and genome sequencing. But machine learning platforms will become more and more necessary as IoT networks become larger and more pervasive -- and as businesses increasingly base their success on the insights found in machine-to-machine communication. These processors deliver the performance required for the most demanding workloads, including machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. So they will no longer be confined to the rarified environments of supercomputing in research centers and universities, as they increasingly become a requirement for cutting-edge businesses.

According to military officers, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al-Qaida base defended by landmines, snipers and a larger-than-expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists. An elite Special Operations air regiment was sent in to pull the team and its casualties out under heavy fire. The incident ended with U.S. Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens' death.   RIP US NAVY SEAL Chief Special Warfare Operator William "Ryan" Owens, 36, of Peoria, Illinois, died Jan. 28 in Yemen #HonorHim #Salute pic.twitter.com/gKe4CB2Jog — The Fallen (@War_Casualties) January 31, 2017   "Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism," the president said in a statement. Pentagon holds the operation also annihilated 14 militants. The gun-battle in the rural Yakla district of al-Bayda province killed a senior leader in Yemen's al Qaeda branch, Abdulraoof al-Dhahab, along with other militants, al-Qaida confirmed. The U.S. military is looking into whether more civilians were killed in a raid on al-Qaida terrorists during the operation. Medics on the ground claim about 30 people, including 10 women and children, were also killed. U.S. Central Command claims an investigating team had "concluded regrettably that civilian non-combatants were likely killed" during the raid, adding that children may have been among the casualties. #DonaldTrump scores his first kill: an 8 year old American girl living in Yemen. #ImpeachTrump @adirado29 @ZantiMisft @MrDane1982 pic.twitter.com/OEdkt61FwQ — John Smith Chicago (@JohnSmithChgo) January 31, 2017 Among the dead was the 8-year-old, U.S.-born daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a militant killed by a 2011 U.S. drone strike. "She was hit with a bullet in her neck and suffered for two hours," her grandfather told Reuters. "Why kill children? This is the new (U.S.) administration — it's very sad, a big crime." They also added that the team "seeks to determine if there were any still-undetected civilian casualties in the ferocious firefight." The U.S. officials said the extremists’ base had been identified as a target before the Obama administration left office on Jan. 20, but then-President Barack Obama held off approving a raid ahead of his departure. A White House official said the operation was thoroughly vetted by the previous administration and that the previous defense secretary had signed off on it in January. The raid was delayed for operational reasons, the White House official said.   Obama admin repeatedly considered Trump's Yemen raid but "intel was not judged strong enough to justify the risks" https://t.co/uMfxdHXBI5 — Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) February 1, 2017   Trump approved his first covert CT op without sufficient intel, ground support or adequate backup preparations https://t.co/pZX3ORbkH9 — Jason Leopold (@JasonLeopold) February 2, 2017   In deadly #YemenRaid, a lesson for Trump’s national security team, and tragic loss of life for #SEALs & civilians.https://t.co/5UtPnTW43k — Kristina Dei ??

Grüssing (@KevDGrussing) February 2, 2017   Read More: Apparently, Trump Is Way Too Busy For Daily Intelligence Briefings The American elite forces did not seize any militants or take any prisoners offsite, but White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the raid yielded benefits. "Knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil — is something that I think most service members understand, that that’s why they joined the service,” Spicer said. In the two weeks following his election, then President–elect Trump received only two classified briefings making some think he was reluctant to take up the responsibilities of being the commander-in-chief of the world’s most powerful nation. Officials in Trump’s transition team dismissed the concerns, saying he had been preoccupied with forming his cabinet, meeting with world leaders and filling key national security posts, which they claim were his “No. 1 priority.” “The president-elect is missing out on a golden opportunity to learn about the national security threats and challenges facing our nation,” said Michael Morell, former deputy CIA director at the time. “Knowledge that would be extremely valuable to have when he takes the oath of office and when he steps into the Situation Room for the first time," he added. The Trump administration’s first — and definitely botched — international operation certainly adds weight to Morell's words.

Recently, the tablet’s specifications were revealed through a Wifi certification and now it has got its approval from the Bluetooth federation. Codenamed as SM-W727V, the Galaxy TabPro S2 will be a followup to the TabPro S launched a year ago. The large 12-inch tablet was a laptop that could instantly be converted into a tablet. The specifications were quite impressive with the latest Intel Core M Skylake with 4GB of RAM and a fast 256GB Solid State Drive that kept the device zippy at all times. It also featured a beautiful AMOLED display, something that Samsung does with almost all their devices that leads to great picture quality. Following the success, it was speculated that Samsung is interested in introducing a second generation hybrid tablet. The rumors were nearly confirmed when the S2 tablet was spotted in the Wifi Certification. The newly acquired bluetooth certificate further strengthens the claim that they are indeed going to launch it real soon. As the previous generation model had the best hardware, we can expect the newer ones to sport equally powerful configuration. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S2 features Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 2160×1440 pixels. While many of the features are going to be similar to its predecessor, the big change could be Intel Kaby Lake processor. Industry experts suggest that Intel has not made any significant changes to the new processor but from a buyer’s perspective going with Kaby lake feels more of a satisfying choice. It allows them to experience the latest in hardware on a hybrid tablet plus laptop. Samsung didn’t launch the Galaxy TabPro S2 at the Consumer Electronic Show 2017 expo that took place last month. They could probably be showing it or go for an official launch at the Mobile World Congress scheduled to take place this month. The company has already sent out invitations for the big event. They will launch a tablet, smartphone and maybe other devices but the Galaxy S8 flagship phone is not one of them as confirmed by multiple sources. The phone needs more attention as it competes with the likes of Apple iPhone 8 and may be launched in a separate event. With a hybrid tablet as the TabPro S2, you can get the best of both worlds as it is compact to carry around, has a great display and can also be converted into a full Windows 10 laptop when you need to be more productive.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple to use its own ARM chip for 2017 MacBook Pro Apple Apple to use its own ARM chip for 2017 MacBook Pro By Bindu Nair - Feb 2, 2017 Apple is reportedly making its own ARM-based processor for use in its MacBook laptops, cutting down on its reliance for Intel chipsets. This doesn’t mean the former is abandoning the latter completely though, with sources stated that the two SoCs will work side by side. Apple’s new chip, codenamed T310, is apparently akin to the T1 CPU powering the Touch Bar strip on its 2016 MacBook Pro. The move to develop its own chipset is supposedly part of the company’s long-term plan to become independent of Intel for its MacBooks. Apple currently utilizes its own A-Series of CPUs for the iPhone and iPad, allowing for greater hardware and software integration. Doing the same for the MacBook will likely result in similar benefits. Bloomberg reports that the new SoC’s primary function is to handle the brand’s low-power mode. Also See: Apple to kill support for older 32-bit apps in iOS 11 The MacBook’s current Power Nap tool will supposedly be offloaded to the ARM processor. It’ll handle things like installing updates and retrieving emails while the notebook’s display is shut. While the ability uses very little power right now on Intel, the shift to ARM is probably going to conserve even more power. Insiders predict that Apple won’t completely eliminate Intel chipsets for its laptops and desktops in the near future. For now, its own chip might be present in the 2017 MacBook Pro coming out later this year. It may also launch a faster 12-inch MacBook and revamped iMac with multi-functional USB-C connectivity.

Citing "people familiar with the matter," Bloomberg claims that the new chip hints at Apple's desire to build more internal Mac hardware in-house – and rely less on Intel processors as a result. The T310 is apparently based on ARM technology and will sit alongside a Core processor for the time being, but handle more functionality independent of the Intel chip. In particular, the T310 is expected to take on power efficency tasks like running the laptop in low-power mode. It's understood that development on the chip was started last year, and that it bears some similarities to the Apple T1 chip found in the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. In that instance, the Apple processor powered the laptop's distinguishing Touch Bar feature, as well as handling a handful of security-related tasks. News of a new Apple chip could mean that the Cupertino-based outfit is preparing to refresh its MacBook range in 2017, despite significantly updating it last year. If new laptops are in the pipeline, however, don't expect to see them any time soon. Apple's late-2016 MacBooks are still fresh out of the oven, so an autumn 2017 launch seems to be the only realistic possibility. That's quite a long time to wait if you're in need of a new notebook, so check out our best laptops round-up for a look at all the top alternatives. Other products Apple is being linked with this year include the iPhone 8 and an iPad Pro 2. Related: MWC 2017 WATCH: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Will Apple ever become fully independent of Intel?

"Now there are indications that Russians could be interested, for the following elections we must fall back on good old pen and paper," Plasterk told the RTL broadcaster as quoted by Deutsche Welle on Wednesday. According to reports, Dutch electronic tallying software used in counting centers is not secure. © Flickr/ Dennis Skley US Rights Group Sues National Intelligence Director for Report on Alleged Russia Hacking In January, EU Commissioner for the Security Union Julian King said that France, Germany and the Netherlands may have been subjected to hacking attacks in the light of the upcoming elections. Federal elections in Germany, French presidential election and Dutch general election are due to be held in 2017. On January 6, the US Intelligence Community released a report saying it had high confidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. However, the report did not offer proof for the claims that Russia attempted to hack and influence the US election process. Russia has repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues.

Starting this year, the company is expected to go in for its own processors for the MacBook range of laptops, according to a new report. Bloomberg Technology reported on Thursday  that Apple has been working on the new chipset since last year and it could be similar to the one on the MacBook Pro 2016 model with the Touch Bar functionality. The processor, currently under development will be built using ARM processor architecture and will bring battery-related improvements to the device such as improved low-power functionality.

The report adds that the feature, when run on Intel chipsets, consumes a small amount of battery, but is even more efficient when run on the ARM-based chipset. While the MacBook Pro 2016 comes with an ARM-based chipset and is used as a secondary chip powering the laptop’s Touch Bar functionality, in future MacBooks, the processors will handle all tasks like a primary CPU. Building its own hardware and software will allow Apple to create a more integrated device —similar to the company’s iPhones. However, Apple might not completely abandon Intel processors and could continue using them in devices such as the iMac.

The chip, which went into development last year, is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard’s Touch Bar feature, the people said. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private product development. It’s built using ARM Holdings Plc. technology and will work alongside an Intel processor. The first ARM-based chip for Mac from Apple is called the T1. It powers the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. The new chip will reportedly handle the laptop's 'Power Nap' feature which allows the device to check email, install software updates, synchronize appointments and more when not in use. While the feature uses very little battery life already, moving from Intel to an ARM based chip will conserve even more power. Sources say that Apple may release an updated MacBook Pro with the new chip later this year. Notably, an ARM MacBook has been rumored for quite some time. It's believed that A-series chips would be limited to lower-end devices initially, perhaps a future version of the 12-inch MacBook would be a possible candidate. Fueling the rumor, Apple has already added support for the ARM HURRICANE chip family to macOS Sierra. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

But local viewers of this Sunday's big game can also catch Beaumont Health's launch of its new re-branding campaign. Developed by the Detroit-based Doner agency, the campaign aims to define the new brand of Beaumont Health, the hospital network created through a merger of Beaumont Health System, Botsford Hospital and Oakwood Healthcare in September 2014. Related: DETROIT FREE PRESS Buick Super Bowl ad stars Cam Newton, Miranda Kerr DETROIT FREE PRESS Super Bowl ad rejected by NFL amid questions Detroit native Courtney B. Vance, who won his first Emmy Award for his lead role as attorney Johnnie Cochran in FX’s “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,” is the voice of the new Beaumont Health ad. Watch also for newspaper, billboard, radio and digital ads as the branding campaign rolls out. Beaumont CEO John Fox and his team tell me the new 30-second “Never Settle” TV ad, airing in Southeast Michigan during halftime of Sunday’s NFL championship game, is meant to evoke the fighting spirit of patients. John Fox, CEO of Beaumont Health  (Photo: Beaumont Health) "Our new brand campaign defines what we stand for and is focused on consumers who want more involvement and more control over their health care," Fox told me. "They should never have to settle for less than the best.” Mark Bohen, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Beaumont, said Doner mapped the campaign based on six research studies involving about 1,300 area consumers. “The health care world has changed, Beaumont has changed, and consumers have new expectations to be more involved in their health," he said. As health care grows into an ever larger portion of our economy, and as health care policies and practices remain in flux due to uncertainty in government's approach to the field, branding efforts like Beaumont's may become more common in the competition among large hospital systems. And it's shrewd that Beaumont's effort plays to those upscale consumers who expect to be more involved in their health-care decisions, like those in Beaumont's home region of Oakland County. So if you're tuning in for Sunday's game, you may not find Beaumont's ad as funny as those for beer and soft drinks. But you may find it gives a better hint as to the direction of a major segment of our economy. Contact John Gallagher: 313-222-5173 or gallagher@freepress.com.

In "Crystal Disk Mark" benchmark, it delivered 281.8 MB/s read and 271.5 MB/s write speed and with "HD Tune Pro", it delivered minimum read speed of 217.3 MB/s and maximum 242.0MB/s read speed with an access time of 0.042 milli-second. In real life test, when we transferred assorted data of approximately 14GB (including videos, documents and images) from a USB 3.0 drive to SSD, it took about five minutes and 50 seconds to complete the process. Overall, the SSD ran seamlessly on demanding applications. The drive includes WD SSD Dashboard software which allows continuous performance and capacity monitoring and is free for download. What does not work? The SSD comes at a higher price in comparison to Samsung 850 Evo. Conclusion: Having fast transfer speed, the WD Blue SSD is an excellent choice for consumers who are looking for instant responsiveness, durability and low-power consumption to boost their PCs or laptops.

Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K's and i5-7600K for cheap, along with new lows on the Radeon RX 480 and 470 By: TweakTown Dealzon | Deals News | Posted: 2 hours, 18 mins ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA It's a new month with new hardware deals for PC enthusiast. Since a number of new products are coming out (Zen etc.), prices on Intel Kaby Lake are already making some movements beyond suggested list price. As of writing, you can pick up the latest Core i7-7700K for as low as $309.99 via Monoprice's eBay store. This is a straight-up $40 discount (11% off) as all other retailers have the CPU priced at $350 or above.     So far, 680 units have been sold as of writing and we suspect Monoprice isn't carry enough units for the deal to last through the weekend. You'll earn some extra savings too as long as you don't reside in California or Kentucky, as sales tax is imposed to only these two states.   Continuing on with other hot hardware deals, Jet.com, the web retailer now owned by Walmart, has always been a hardware buyer favorite to score components on the cheap. While the "new" online retailer could use some improvement in the organization department (seriously its very hard to find things on their website) they are often at the forefront of great pricing to lure in new customers. As of writing, you can pick up an ASUS Radeon GPU for cheap, with the RX 480 4GB OC Edition priced at only $141.49 after rebate and coupon.   CPU Deals   Intel Core i7-7700K 4.20GHz Processor (Kaby Lake) - $309.99 (list $350) Intel Core i5-7600K 3.8Ghz Processor (Kaby Lake) - $204.11 (list $240) Use coupon: TRIPLE15   GPU Deals   ASUS Radeon RX 480 OC Edition 4GB Video Card - $141.49 (list $230) Use coupon: TRIPLE15 Use rebate here ASUS ROG STRIX Radeon RX 470 OC Edition 4GB Video Card - $123.80 (list $200) Use coupon: TRIPLE15 Use rebate here   Other Hardware Deals   MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Gaming X 8G Video Card - $594.99 (list $690) Use this rebate.

By: IANS | Updated: February 3, 2017 12:18 pm Rahul Agarwal, CEO, Lenovo India, said the focus on digital literacy will act as an enabler for job creation and skill development. (Image for representation) Though Budget 2017-18 demonstrated the government’s commitment towards making India a digital economy, tech players on Thursday said the absence of a robust electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country will only restrain the Make in India and Digital India vision. “We are disappointed with the lack of provisions for creating a robust domestic electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India beyond smartphones. I strongly urge the government to re-consider this as the absence of a robust electronics manufacturing ecosystem will only restrain the ambitious Make in India and Digital India vision,” said Debjani Ghosh, Managing Director, Intel South Asia. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Rahul Agarwal, CEO, Lenovo India, said the focus on digital literacy will act as an enabler for job creation and skill development. However, “we would expect more proactive measures from the government on ease of doing business as the cost of compliance in India is higher as compared to other countries, because of which large scale manufacturing is not yet shifting to India,” Agarwal added. While welcoming the government’s move to reduce corporate tax for small companies to 25 per cent with annual turnover upto Rs 50 crore, Samson Khaou, Managing Director, Dassault Systemes India, told IANS that 96 per cent of the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) will benefit from this move.

About 96 per cent of the MSME’s will benefit from this move and it sets government’s objective clear of making India competitive globally,” Khaou said, adding that the move will boost exports and manufacturing at large.

Razer acquires Nextbit, the startup behind the Robin smartphone Posted Jan 30, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Trump’s immigration order sends ripples of dismay through UK tech community Three months after acquiring iconic audio tech company THX, Razer is making another move to expand its business beyond hardware and software for the gaming community. The company has acquired Nextbit, the startup behind the Robin smartphone, founded by Android veterans who had set out with high hopes (and some decent funding) to rethink how to build a mobile phone that leaned on cloud storage. Financial terms of the deal, which closed earlier this month, have not been disclosed by either company, but sources hint that there was a decent equity portion to it. Nextbit had raised $18 million in funding from Accel, GV and Dentsu, plus another $1.36 million on Kickstarter as part of a crowdfunding campaign partly used to market the Robin smartphone. Razer will be bringing on Nextbit’s staff of 30, and Min-Liang Tan, Razer’s co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that the plan will be to develop more products keeping the Nextbit brand, which will operate as its own standalone business unit. “We’ve been huge fans of what Nexbit has been doing,” he said, “both the work on the phone technology and on the cloud-based storage side of things. There is a lot of potential and talent.” But the carry-over will not include Nextbit’s Robin phone — which in any case was no longer being sold by Nextbit, either. Min confirmed that the Robin has been discontinued, but the software and existing phones will continue to be supported for at least the next six months. As for what is coming next, Min would not specify whether that will be something similar to what Nextbit has made before or something else altogether. “We’ll be ready to talk about that when we’re ready,” Min said in an interview. “With Nextbit, it was really the software and design talent we wanted to bring in. We have a good track record of going into traditional markets and building out from there.” After THX, and gaming company Ouya, this is the third recent acquisition for Razer (which itself has disclosed around $125 million in funding from backers like Intel and Accel, with a valuation of well over $1 billion). But as a possible guidance of where Razer might go with Nextbit, we could look further back to 2008, when Razer quietly acquired another company, OQO, whose team served as the core of its move into laptops. Another clue might be found in something that Tom Moss, the co-founder of Nextbit who served as its CEO, told me about the acquisition. He said there were others who approached Nextbit, “the companies you would expect, some interested in what we were already doing in hardware, and others interested in what we were doing in software,” but the good thing about Razer, he added, “is that we can continue to do both.” (Moss and Min were introduced, he said, not by common investor Accel but by John Lagerling, VP of partnerships at Facebook, which is probably the perfect job for him.) Razer has been focused squarely on gaming (the company’s motto is “For Gamers. By Gamers”), and it has been a pretty aggressive believer in targeted, vertical integration, building a wide range of hardware and software for the gaming market. So it’s interesting that before now, the company has stayed away from making mobile phones, which have such a strong link to the gaming world. It’s not clear why that’s the case, but it’s worth wondering what kind of a role the branding of another “Razr” phone may have played. Motorola, now owned by Lenovo, made a very popular range of handsets under the Razr brand in two phases, first a “razor-thin” flip phone and then the Android-based Droid Razr, and you can imagine how potential trademarking issues or just concerns about brand confusion would have kept Razer away from the mobile handset game. (Small, coincidental side note: Years ago, Moss started, and his Nextbit co-founder MIke Chan worked at, a startup called 3LM, which was eventually acquired by none other than Motorola.) For Nextbit, the startup has found a landing place where its business can tap a large existing audience of Razer customers and (importantly) fans. But on the other hand, its decision to go the acquisition route underscores the many challenges of building hardware or cloud-based businesses (let alone a company that wanted to do both) from the ground up in today’s market — where both areas are dominated by scale: outsized companies, huge customer bases and lots of capital. Nextbit itself was no stranger to those problems: the company had planned, and sold against, but ultimately cancelled a plan to launch a CDMA version of its original GSM-based Robin handset, a crucial turning point for the startup. Time will tell if Razer will be a big enough platform to step up into the race more definitively. In its favor, it’s had an interesting and quietly successful track record so far. And there are the bigger trends of the tech world. “Every time there is a status quo for top players, something else comes along,” Moss said. “Innovation definitely slowed in the past few years, but I think of it as more of a pause. As well as technology being on the bleeding edge, there is still a lot of opportunity for change. There always has been.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Razer Founded 2005 Overview Razer™ is a world leader in connected devices and software for gamers.

The fun officially begins Sunday, but — in fact — it’s already here. This is the bowl within that other bowl: Those commercials, dozens of them, that sell everything from mobile service to avocado dip, but especially sell the famous faces that star in them. Lots of famous faces. Out of a total of 62 Super Bowl commercials on CBS’ telecast of Super Bowl 50 in 2016, just under 40 featured celebrities, according to one count (Encino, California-based E-Poll Market Research). That was an all-time high. There are expected to be fewer celebrity ads on Fox’s Super Bowl LI this year, but “fewer” is a relative term: There will still be dozens. Justin Bieber’s commercial for T-Mobile was released online Thursday, becoming part of a conga line of pre-releases that star Melissa McCarthy (Kia, although teases only), Tom Brady (Intel), Jason Statham and Gal Gadot (Wix), Joe Montana and Mike Singletary (Hyundai), Lil Buck (Lexus), Marshawn Lynch (Skittles), Brett Favre (Buffalo Wild Wings), Peter Fonda (Mercedes), John Malkovich (Squarespace), Jon Lovitz (Avocadoes from Mexico), Justin Timberlake (Bai) and Lady Gaga (Tiffany). Meanwhile, Jon Hamm will star in a major in-game commercial for H&R Block. Patriots wide-receiver Rob Gronkowski — sidelined since early December with a ruptured disc — will co-star in at least two commercials, including that one with the Beebs. Adam Driver will star in a live commercial for Snickers after the game ends. Why this arms race for Super Bowl celebrity pitchmen-and-women? Ever since the first Super Bowl, when RCA hired a Twiggy-lookalike to star in an ad for camera film, advertisers have figured: Why not hire the real person? And they have. Celebrity ads are as fundamental a part of the Super Bowl ad experience as CGI-enhanced (or CGI-degraded) animals. But since the beginning of the decade, they’ve boomed. For example, there were just 19 ads with celebs in 2013. Per E-Poll, the figure doubled in just three years. Why? Three reasons: The internet, the internet, and the internet. Ads with celebrities live long on past the game, sometimes for years, where they take up permanent residence on Facebook or YouTube. When a fans search for their favorite star on Google, they also get the ad on their results list. Another reason: The ads have enormous traction even before the game — itself one of the reasons behind the so-called pre-release craze of the past decade, in which most ads were online before they were on TV Ispot-TV — a leading firm that tabulates advertising effectiveness across the media spectrum — reports that of the Top-10 pre-release commercials this year, six feature celebrities. The top-ranked one, by far, is Wix, which stars Statham and Gadot who together demolish a restaurant. (The ad was directed by French-born high-octane action director, Louis Leterrier — the “Transporter” films, “Unleashed,” “The Incredible Hulk” and “Clash of the Titans” — and looks it.) How big is the Wix ad? By Thursday, about 20 million people had already seen it online — mostly Facebook (10 million views alone) — which means that by the time this airs in the fourth quarter Sunday, more people will have seen it on their cell phones than on their TVs. Wix — a website builder — got its money’s worth. Verne Gay Email vernejgay NYC, in your inbox.

Although NFL games overall suffered an 8% slump in ratings this season, for which President Donald Trump has taken credit, Sunday’s Super Bowl is expected to produce crowds on par with last year’s 112M viewers – roughly the same size crowd as watched Trump’s inauguration, his SCOTUS pick primetime special and all future major Trump clambakes, according to White House estimates. Related Will Hollywood's Super Bowl Ads Score, Or Be Sacked, As NFL Ratings Slide? John Malkovich is charting new Super Bowl commercial territory, in a spot that simultaneously touts Squarespace.com, JohnMalkovich.com, the actor-director’s latest fashion line, and gins up sympathy for some fishing blogger who might or might not be real and/or also named John Malkovich: Adam Driver, meanwhile, will star in Super Bowl’s first live commercial, apparently co-starring a horse. According to ad industry trade reports, the Snickers spot continues the candy campaign in which attractive women in iconic screen scenes, who have turned into unattractive men for want of sugar, are transformed back through the magic of Snickers – think Willem Dafoe as Marilyn Monroe cooling off over that subway vent in The Seven Year Itch. Snickers also promises 36 full hours of livestream from the set of the ad, leading up to the game: And Turbo Tax is trying out a Super Bowl ad trilogy this year. Part 1 launched days before the game.

This year that includes Minnie Driver’s unveiling as the “new voice of Lexus” — though her work, and the car, might be overshadowed a bit by the dance steps of Charles “Lil Buck” Riley:   Meanwhile, Bryan Cranston narrates Ford’s “Go Further” commercial: Ads eschewing celebrities seem to be in the minority this Super Bowl. Some of those doing without stars instead are counting on political statements to catch viewers’ attention. Construction-supply company 84 Lumber, making its Super Bowl debut, went with the can’t-miss, too-hot-for-the-network buzz generator. The company reportedly created a spot that featured a wall and some laborers looking for work. Fox deemed that too political and sent it back to the drawing board. Nicely played, 84 Lumber! Budweiser marketing execs have insisted in interviews that its “Born the Hard Way” ad is not intended to make any kind of political statement about this country’s raging immigration debate. This would be easier to swallow had the ad’s story of Adolphus Busch’s immigration been a little less creative a molding of the rough clay of truth: And Audi’s so-called feminist-dad ad, called “Daughter,” purports to illustrate a commitment to equal pay for equal work on the part of the car manufacturer which — Forbes reports, last fall celebrated the grand opening of its first plant in North America. In Mexico. Speaking of Mexico – avocados!

Close share panel Image copyright Pixar Image caption Can virtual software be as effective as virtual superheroes? In the Disney Pixar animation The Incredibles, the daughter in the family of superheroes, Violet, has a particular superpower. She can create a protective force field around herself - an impenetrable bubble. She can also make herself invisible. Businesses trying to ward off millions of dangerous cyber-attacks in an increasingly connected world probably wish they had the same superpower. Well, perhaps now, they do. A cybersecurity firm called Bromium reckons its technology can protect laptop and desktop users in large organisations against malware hidden in email attachments and compromised websites. It does this through a process called micro-virtualisation. Every time you open a document or visit a website, Bromium creates a mini protected virtual environment for each task - like a series of Violet's bubbles. Even if you've clicked on an email link containing a virus, there's nowhere for that malware to go because it is isolated within its bubble. It cannot infect the rest of the machine or penetrate the corporate network. Image copyright Pixar Image caption Violet's forcefield can protect anyone inside from attack. Can software do the same thing? Bromium co-founder and president Ian Pratt, who sold his first company XenSource to Citrix for $500m (£398m) in 2007, says it has taken his firm six years to perfect the product. "This is by far the hardest thing I've done by miles," he tells the BBC. One helpful development was when the big computer chip makers, such as Intel and Arm, began producing chips that had virtualisation capability built in to them. "We've created a billion virtual machines since we started - no bad stuff has ever escaped from one of them," says Mr Pratt. The technology has proved popular with intelligence services and other government agencies, he says. Image copyright Bromium Image caption Bromium co-founder Simon Crosby says trying to detect the bad guy "always fails" "The US intelligence services tend to compartmentalise data from secret sources using separate banks of computers. Now, using virtualisation, they can keep secret data separate and secure virtually on one computer," he says. One computer can have 50 virtual machines (VMs) running at the same time without much loss in performance speed, he says, although a typical user will have five to 10 running concurrently. It is this ability to create VMs instantly without much drain on the computer processor's resources that is one of the product's main advantages, he believes. Weakest link At the World Economic Forum's recent Davos summit, a cybersecurity roundtable discussion revealed that the biggest banks can now expect up to two billion cyber-attacks a year; retailers, a mere 200 million. And recent research from IT consultancy Capgemini finds that only 21% of financial service organisations are "highly confident" they could detect a data breach. Unfortunately, despite all the latest firewalls and antivirus software, it is we humans who are the weakest link in any organisation's security defences. Despite all the warnings, we still click on email links and attachments, download software to enable us to watch that cute kitten video, and visit websites we probably shouldn't - even while at work. Virtualisation is one defence against such attacks. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption How many of us have visited websites we shouldn't have, even at work? Prof Giovanni Vigna is a director of the University of California in Santa Barbara's cybersecurity centre and co-founder of malware detection company, Lastline. He says: "Virtualisation is a very effective way of containing the effects of an attack because it isolates the bad stuff, and that's awesome," he says. But it is not a "silver bullet", he warns. "It won't prevent users from giving away sensitive security data in targeted spear phishing attacks," he says. This is where staff are hoodwinked into giving away security details because hackers have collated enough personal details to make an email or document look entirely official and convincing. This type of manipulation - called social engineering - is still "very effective", says Prof Vigna. "It's difficult to protect against human stupidity." Bromium's Ian Pratt accepts that this is a limitation of virtualisation, but he maintains: "In 80% of cases hackers are gaining access to enterprise networks through staff clicking on dodgy links. "Our system limits the damage that can be caused. We're trying to make these attacks far more expensive to execute." 'Major competitor' Traditional anti-virus (AV) software works by identifying malware signatures and adding them to the huge database. Once a known signature has been detected it can then quarantine and delete the suspect program. The problem with this approach, however, is that it's reactive and does nothing to prevent previously unknown attacks made by new forms of malware, many of which can evolve within an infected system and evade the AV software. One cybersecurity firm trying to tackle this issue is Invincea, which describes its X product as "machine learning next-generation antivirus". Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Big banks can expect billions of cyber-attacks a year It aims to detect and stop malware without relying on signatures. It learns how suspect programs look and behave when compared to legitimate programs and other known forms of malware. And if a suspect file exceeds a risk threshold it is quarantined or deleted. The deluxe version of Invincea's product also ensures that all links and attachments are opened in a virtual isolated environment - it's own version of Violet's bubble. "Invincea is a major competitor to Bromium," says Prof Vigna. "The advantage is that is works on CPUs [central processing units] that don't support micro-virtualisation, so it can be used in organisations with older computers." 'Squidgy bit' Microsoft has also been exploring the benefits of virtualisation. Its next major Windows 10 update will enable users to run the Edge browser within a protected virtual machine environment. Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey's computer science department thinks the tech giant could go further. "Virtualisation is a neat idea," he says. "Lots of people are taking it very seriously. My personal suspicion is that someone like Microsoft may well try to build it into their operating system [OS] directly." Although we have much better malware detection systems these days, we - "the squidgy bit in the chair", as Prof Woodward calls us - remain the most vulnerable point in this cybersecurity warfare.

White Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement The tech industry has been the loudest in its condemnation of Donald Trump's travel ban, but the history of immigrants coming to the United States and becoming pillars of industry goes back further than the iPhone, further than dial-up — further, even, than the telephone itself.

Some of the stories are familiar: Many people know Steve Jobs' biological father was a native Syrian (Jobs was adopted as an infant by a California family), and that Google co-founder Sergey Brin's Jewish parents left Russia in 1979 to escape religious persecution. Even two technology scions who reportedly have Donald Trump's ear, Tesla founder Elon Musk and billionaire investor Peter Thiel, were born in other countries (South Africa and Germany, respectively). But people might be less familiar with others: "My mother was undocumented. No mom, no @Reddit," Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian tweeted on Sunday. Yes. My mother was undocumented. No mom, no @Reddit. https://t.co/ItkOOvIxSg— Alexis Ohanian (@alexisohanian) January 30, 2017 Intel co-founder Andy Grove came to the U.S. after fleeing political upheaval in Hungary as a young man. In his memoir, he wrote, "[M]any young people were killed; countless others were interned. Some two hundred thousand Hungarians escaped to the West. I was one of them." Last March, the National Foundation for American policy found that immigrants founded 44 of the 87 start-up "unicorns" valued at $1 billion or higher. Altogether, the value of those companies is $168 billion. On average, each of these billion-dollar start-ups has created 700 jobs, although some are much higher, such as Musk's 4,000 SpaceX employees. Musk, a member of two advisory councils in the Trump administration, on Saturday tweeted his distaste for the immigration plan. The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 He also said he would speak to the president about the possibility of modifying the measure — but noted there was "no possibility of retraction." Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President. https://t.co/qLpbsP4lEk— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 According to a 2011 analysis conducted by the Partnership for a New American Economy, 18 of the companies in Fortune's Top 100 in 2010 had founders born outside the U.S., and that doesn't even count the ones like Apple that were founded by first-generation Americans. In total, 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants. Today, the number of immigrant-founded companies on the Fortune 100 is up to 19, and runs the gamut of industries, from pharmaceuticals to telecommunications to retail. "We must do more to welcome the next generation of entrepreneurs," the group said in its report. "For years, America has loomed largest in the minds of the most enterprising individuals around the world. But as the global marketplace evolves, we cannot count on remaining their top choice." These are the companies, along with their rankings in the current Fortune 100, that were founded by immigrants. 10: AT&T Alexander Graham Bell, Scotland 11: General Electric Elihu Thomson, England 12: AmerisourceBergen Lucien Brunswig, France 13: Verizon Alexander Graham Bell, Scotland 34: Procter & Gamble William Procter, England; James Gamble, Ireland 36: Alphabet Sergey Brin, Russia 37: Comcast Daniel Aaron, Germany 45: United Technologies Igor Sikorski, Russia 51: Intel Andy Grove, Hungary 55: Pfizer Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Germany 64: Ingram Micro Geza Czige, Hungary 72: Merck Theodore Weicker, Germany 75: Honeywell International Albert Butz, Switzerland 79: Cigna John Nesbitt, Ireland 82: TIAA Andrew Carnegie, Scotland 83: INTL FCStone Saul Stone, Russia 88: General Dynamics John Philip Holland, Ireland 89: TJX Companies Max Feldberg and Morris Feldberg, Russia 95: Exelon Samuel Insull, England Martha C.

But will this gamble on subatomic particles pay off? Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has in-depth knowledge of quantum computing and has authorised $50m investment in the technology.

The UK alone has pledged £270m over five years, with the more cautious Australian government promising a AU$25m (£15m) investment over the same period, and the Canadians putting in $50m (£31m). So just what are they investing in, and why? While the end product may be some way off, quantum technologies promise to deliver multibillion-pound industries across multiple sectors in return for that investment. Quantum has touched a political nerve, from the UK’s National Quantum Technologies Programme, Australia’s Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology or the European Union’s €1bn (£0.9bn) for an EU quantum manifesto, not to mention Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s well-documented knowledge of the topic. What is quantum technology? Has the age of quantum computing arrived? Read more When you think of quantum you’re transported into the subatomic world of Schrödinger and his cat and the ability to be in two states at the same time. In the case of the cat, locked in a box with a randomly triggered radiation source, it’s both alive and dead until the box is opened and it can be observed as either one or the other. In the quantum computing world, the bits at the heart of a computer with a binary state of either one or zero become qubits (quantum bits), which can simultaneously be a one, zero, both or anything in-between. If a binary system has a one or zero at opposite poles of a sphere, then a quantum one has values anywhere and everywhere. This makes a quantum system fast at calculating because it can test every possibility simultaneously; no waiting for one calculation after another. Interrupt it at any given time to collapse it at one of its states, and hey presto you have your answer. There is, of course, a caveat: you have to control the qubits and the subatomic particles in which they are stored. And that is very, very hard indeed. Even the likes of Intel, which last year pledged $50m (£39m) to quantum computing research at the University of Delft, admit that a practical quantum computer is at least a decade away. Privacy is dead What can we look forward to when quantum computers do arrive? Well, there’s the death of encryption for a start. Encryption of data relies upon how time consuming it is to factor very large numbers into two primes. A quantum computer will quickly decrypt data that would take billions of years today. You might think this bad from the security perspective, allowing criminals to decrypt every encrypted database. But quantum research is expensive, very expensive. So the “good guys”, with the government budgets, will get the tech first, by a long margin. And when the bad guys do get all the gear, what quantum giveth it will soon taketh away again. While quantum computers will crack most any encryption, you’ll know your data’s been looked at, thanks to something called entanglement. Einstein called this “spooky action at a distance” and spooky it may be, but it does provide us with perfect privacy. Quantum key distribution systems are already being developed that will know if they are being eavesdropped on and stop communicating until the spy goes away. What will governments do with quantum? Can quantum help governments wage war? Perhaps. The Ministry of Defence lab at Porton Down has been developing a device to measure tiny fluctuations in gravitational pull, which would act like super accurate radar, with the capability to see through walls or deep underground. Relativity v quantum mechanics – the battle for the universe Read more But some of the most exciting possibilities lie in the area of public health. Researchers at the University of Glasgow, working for one of the quantum technology hubs, established through £120m of UK investment, are hoping to revolutionise quantum imaging. Their projects include developing ultrasensitive cameras that can actually detect light down to a single photon. This has the potential to detect cancer without invasive medical imaging. And Australian researchers from the government-funded Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology are taking the field of medical imaging into a whole new dimension. Rather than using magnets to create 3D images, the team’s nano-MRI project uses the natural magnetic properties of the qubit to, in theory at least, allow imaging at the molecular level. If used to determine the structure of biomolecules such as proteins it could overcome many issues researchers face when developing new drugs. At the moment quantum computing is largely speculative and hugely expensive. It has staggering potential, but it remains to be seen whether governments’ investments will pay off in the real world of public services.

(Credit: T-Mobile via YouTube) advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS The number of celebrity ads is down, but there will still be dozens Many ads are now pre-released to the internet Welcome to Celebrity Bowl LI. The fun officially begins Sunday, but — in fact — it’s already here. This is the bowl within that other bowl: Those commercials, dozens of them, that sell everything from mobile service to avocado dip, but especially sell the famous faces that star in them. Lots of famous faces. Most popular McConaughey: It’s time to accept Trump as our president ‘Hamilton’ standby Jevon McFerrin gets his chance Who was the 'Sons of Anarchy' Homeless Woman? Beyoncé breaks Instagram record, reveals nude photos 50 Cent settles bankruptcy case with nearly $23M payout Out of a total of 62 Super Bowl commercials on CBS’ telecast of Super Bowl 50 in 2016, just under 40 featured celebrities, according to one count (Encino, California-based E-Poll Market Research). That was an all-time high. There are expected to be fewer celebrity ads on Fox’s Super Bowl LI this year, but “fewer” is a relative term: There will still be dozens. SUPER BOWL COMMERCIALSGet a sneak peek at the Super Bowl LI ads50 best Super Bowl commercials everSUPER BOWL LITop this, Lady Gaga: 10 best Super Bowl halftime shows Justin Bieber’s commercial for T-Mobile was released online Thursday, becoming part of a conga line of pre-releases that star Melissa McCarthy (Kia, although teases only), Tom Brady (Intel), Jason Statham and Gal Gadot (Wix), Joe Montana and Mike Singletary (Hyundai), Lil Buck (Lexus), Marshawn Lynch (Skittles), Brett Favre (Buffalo Wild Wings), Peter Fonda (Mercedes), John Malkovich (Squarespace), Jon Lovitz (Avocadoes from Mexico), Justin Timberlake (Bai) and Lady Gaga (Tiffany). Meanwhile, Jon Hamm will star in a major in-game commercial for H&R Block. Patriots wide-receiver Rob Gronkowski — sidelined since early December with a ruptured disc — will co-star in at least two commercials, including that one with the Beebs. Adam Driver will star in a live commercial for Snickers after the game ends. Why this arms race for Super Bowl celebrity pitchmen-and-women? Ever since the first Super Bowl, when RCA hired a Twiggy-lookalike to star in an ad for camera film, advertisers have figured: Why not hire the real person? And they have. Celebrity ads are as fundamental a part of the Super Bowl ad experience as CGI-enhanced (or CGI-degraded) animals. But since the beginning of the decade, they’ve boomed. For example, there were just 19 ads with celebs in 2013. Per E-Poll, the figure doubled in just three years. advertisement | advertise on newsday Why? Three reasons: The internet, the internet, and the internet. Ads with celebrities live long on past the game, sometimes for years, where they take up permanent residence on Facebook or YouTube. When fans search for their favorite star on Google, they also get the ad on their results list. Another reason: The ads have enormous traction even before the game — itself one of the reasons behind the so-called pre-release craze of the past decade, in which most ads were online before they were on TV TVGet a sneak peek at the Super Bowl LI ads Ispot-TV — a leading firm that tabulates advertising effectiveness across the media spectrum — reports that of the Top-10 pre-release commercials this year, six feature celebrities. The top-ranked one, by far, is Wix, which stars Statham and Gadot who together demolish a restaurant. (The ad was directed by French-born high-octane action director, Louis Leterrier — the “Transporter” films, “Unleashed,” “The Incredible Hulk” and “Clash of the Titans” — and looks it.) @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff How big is the Wix ad? By Thursday, about 20 million people had already seen it online — mostly Facebook (10 million views alone) — which means that by the time this airs in the fourth quarter Sunday, more people will have seen it on their cell phones than on their TVs. Wix — a website builder — got its money’s worth.

What made it unique was its focus on running and other fitness tracking features without being obnoxiously large or ugly. If you were interested in picking one up for yourself, we have good news, it is now available for $299… The New Balance RunIQ was originally announced over a year ago and built in conjunction with Intel specifically with runners in mind. Although the body of the watch is made out of plastic and features a silicon watchband, the RunIQ did feel premium on the wrist during our limited time playing with it. One of the best features of the RunIQ is its built-in GPS capabilities. This means that you can still go for a run and track your location without the need to bring along your smartphone. Additionally, the smartwatch features an optical heart rate sensor which you can enable to run constantly if you want precise measurements of your heart rate throughout an exercise. If you would like to know more about the New Balance RunIQ you can read our hands on review here or watch our quick hands-on video with the smartwatch below. The New Balance RunIQ is available to purchase for $299 on Amazon or directly from New Balance. Unfortunately, it only comes in a one size fits all variant and doesn’t offer any color options other than black.

Linux Kernel 4.9.7 Brings Updates to the Intel i915 and InfiniBand Drivers, More GO All users of the Linux 4.9 kernel series must update Feb 2, 2017 22:41 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  It's time to upgrade the Linux kernel packages of our GNU/Linux distributions once more, as renowned Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman today, February 2, 2017, announced the release of Linux kernel 4.9.7. While still not marked as "longterm" on the kernel.org website, the Linux 4.9 kernel series recently become LTS (Long Term Support), which means that it will be supported with security patches for a couple of years. It also means that OS vendors need to adopt the Linux 4.9 kernel series for their distros as soon as possible. Arch Linux and Solus are already powered by Linux kernel 4.9, so make sure you update your PCs right now. As for Linux kernel 4.9.7, it comes one week after the release of Linux kernel 4.9.6 and changes a total of 67 files, with 534 insertions and 239 deletions, according to the appended shortlog. The patch includes mostly updated drivers, in particular for the Intel i915 graphics driver, but also for things like InfiniBand, Radeon, VC4, ISDN, I2C, PINCTRL, Virtio, FBDEV, and networking. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.9.7 kernel. All users of the 4.9 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.9.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.9.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. Users are urged to update to Linux kernel 4.9.7 The rest of the Linux kernel 4.9.7 patch is about small improvements to the NFS, XFS, and Btrfs filesystems, an updated networking stack with a couple of changes to the SunRPC protocol support, some minor fixes to the ARC, PA-RISC, s390, Tile, and x86 hardware architectures, and, of course, the usual mm and core kernel enhancements. Check out the complete changelog above for all the technical details on the changes. In the meantime, if you're using a GNU/Linux distribution powered by a kernel from the Linux 4.9 series, we recommend updating to today's Linux kernel 4.9.7 release as soon as possible. It already landed for Solus users and it's coming very soon to Arch Linux and openSUSE Tumbleweed, as well as other distros. You can also download the Linux kernel 4.9.7 source tarball right now from kernel.org or via our website. #Linux 4.9.7#Linux kernel 4.9.7#Linux 4.9#Linux LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Gentoo-Based Calculate Linux 17 OS Now Has a Cinnamon Spin, and It Looks Great Linux Kernel 3.12.70 Is a Big Patch with Over 220 Improvements, Security Fixes Solus Now Powered by Linux Kernel 4.9.7, Uses Applications from GNOME 3.22 Stack openSUSE Leap 42.2 Hits the Cloud, You Can Now Use It on AWS Marketplace, Azure Zero-Day Windows Security Flaw Could Crash Systems, Cause BSODs Oops: Windows 10 Starts Going Down on Steam Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Build 15025 Avast Releases Three New Decryption Tools to Fight Ransomware Windows 10 Start Menu Redesigned with Project NEON Transparency Google Photos 2.8 Gets Redesigned UI and Changes to Device Folders iOS Cracking Tools Allegedly Stolen from Cellebrite Get Dumped Online by Hackers Windows Is Becoming a Bigger Threat for Apple on Tablets    Linux kernel 4.9.7 released New Linux Apps GIMP: GNU Image Manipulation Program, a complex and multi-platform image manipulation software Kodi: Your one stop shop for all your media!

(Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) Day 14: Trump goes rogue again President Trump went rogue Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast and asked the crowd of religious leaders and elites to pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Trump said ratings for Celebrity Apprentice — the TV show Trump once hosted — have gone "right down the tubes" (it's true they've tanked, Nielsen said). A rep for Schwarzenegger said the actor is praying for Trump to improve his own approval ratings (it's true they're below average, Gallup said). Schwarzenegger topped off the feud with a Twitter video suggesting he and Trump switch jobs. Burn. Trump got political, too. He promised faith leaders at the breakfast he would  "totally destroy" the ban on public charities — including churches — from campaigning for or against a candidate for elected office. Those who do risk losing their tax exemption. Also on Thursday: The president threatened to pull federal funding from the University of California-Berkeley after violent protests against a controversial speaker. That threat is essentially toothless, experts say. The Treasury Department eased some economic sanctions against Russia, specifically licensing cyber-security sales to the Russian Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB. Trump brushed off the reports, saying, "I'm not easing ... anything." His press secretary said this does not represent any shift in policy. The refugee deal between the U.S. and Australia that Trump trashed? Here's what it's all about. The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017 With so many commercials, no bathroom breaks during the Super Bowl For a few magical hours every February, America stops hating commercials. Super Bowl ads cost advertisers millions for mere seconds of screen time (Fox charges roughly $5 million for a 30-second spot). And we eat them up. Last year, a Hyundai commercial called "First Date" (starring Kevin Hart) was the big winner. Oh, Kevin. But sometimes things get weird. Here are the most controversial ads of all time.

Last February, Melissa Harris-Perry and MSNBC parted ways. Now, Tamron Hall has exited NBC News after the network disclosed plans to cancel her 9 a.m. hour of the Today show to make room for Megyn Kelly. Hall's current co-host, Al Roker, will remain only until Kelly arrives. Some fans have been tweeting with #TeamTamron to tell NBC that Hall's viewers will leave with her. African Americans are underrepresented in journalism — both at newspapers and broadcast TV — according to the latest Pew Research Center report. Why is media representation important? Leslie Jones and Michelle Obama can tell you. Starting tomorrow morning I will be watching @GMA instead of @TODAYshow and I hope that everyone does the same! #teamtamron Tamron Hall— Michelle Hollaway (@UNeed2LawyerUp) February 1, 2017 Seeking a lucrative career?

A new report sheds some light on in-demand careers, and data scientists (they use statistics, database and machine learning software to interpret data) are among the jobs with high growth potential. Since it’s a relatively new career with few universities offering degrees, workers are hard to find and make a mint: The median salary in 2015 totaled $128,240, the highest among the high-demand careers listed in a new report.

Lady Liberty is not an American woman As Americans grapple with President Trump's ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, it's a good time to point out a little-known irony. The Statue of Liberty — that symbol of American freedom and diversity that has greeted immigrants for generations — was originally modeled after an Arab woman, our friends at GlobalPost point out. The statue's designer, Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, decided to build a monument to commemorate the opening of Egypt's Suez Canal. The ruler of Egypt went broke and the project was jettisoned. But the artist soon found a way to recycle his design, and the Statue of Liberty, as we know her today, was born.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / Cooling / Cooler Master releases list of Ryzen and Kaby Lake compatible CPU coolers and PSUs Cooler Master releases list of Ryzen and Kaby Lake compatible CPU coolers and PSUs Matthew Wilson 12 hours ago Cooling, CPU, Motherboard The first few months of this year are going to be quite hectic in the tech world, we have already seen the launch of Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors but we also have AMD’s Ryzen launch coming in early March. As a result of these huge launches, CPU cooler makers are in the process of ensuring compatibility with new motherboards and today, Cooler Master released its complete list of compatible products. As expected, all of Cooler Master’s current liquid and air coolers are compatible with Kaby Lake. AMD’s new AM4 platform is really the only area where things start to get tricky with some CPU coolers not currently compatible with the AM4 socket. However, Cooler Master will be joining other cooler makers in offering Ryzen upgrade kits for some modes. You can refer to the chart below to see which coolers are natively compatible and which ones will be getting an upgrade kit. Newer versions of Cooler Master’s CPU coolers will start shipping with AM4 mounts by default but there may still be old stock floating around in the meantime, in which case you will need an upgrade kit. As for power supplies, Cooler Master has tested its MasterWatt Maker series, V Series, GM Series and New GX Series with Ryzen and Kaby Lake to ensure compatibility. KitGuru Says: If you have a Cooler Master CPU cooler and are worried about compatibility when upgrading to Ryzen, then this list should help you out. From the looks of it, most CPU coolers will eventually support the new socket.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags AM4 Cooler Master kaby lake news Ryzen X370 Previous Nvidia clamps down on promo game codes to stop you selling them on Next Noctua is releasing three special-edition CPU coolers for AMD’s Ryzen Check Also Noctua is releasing three special-edition CPU coolers for AMD’s Ryzen Noctua is legendary in the world of air cooling, not only does the company often … Polls Which system memory next?

(REUTERS/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Sarah Kessler February 02, 2017 At Apple’s next shareholder meeting on Feb. 28, investors will vote on a proposal that, if passed, would force the company to create an “accelerated recruitment policy” with the aim of increasing diversity in its senior leadership and on its board of directors. The proposal was submitted by Antonio Avian Maldonado, an individual investor, and Zevin Asset Management, a Boston-based investment firm with $600 million under management that has also submitted diversity-related proposals with TJX Companies and Colgate-Palmolive. Although the proposal doesn’t specify policies, its authors have suggested that Apple link executive pay to diversity goals (a step that Microsoft and Intel have already taken) and that the company’s board instate a policy ensuring diverse candidates are included in its pool of nominees. Like many technology companies, Apple has a poor diversity record. Since publicly disclosing its diversity numbers for the first time in 2014, the company has made slow but steady improvement. But women and people of color are still severely underrepresented, especially among technical employees and leadership. Only 8% of Apple’s US tech workers identify as black, and 8% as Hispanic. Just 23% are women. That still compares favorably to other large technology companies. At Google, for instance, only 1% of tech workers are black, 3% are Hispanic, and 19% are women. Of Apple’s 107 top executives, 20 are women, three are black, and three are Hispanic. Five of the company’s eight board members are white men. The Apple shareholder proposal targets diversity specifically among these groups. Its authors argue there’s a business case for stronger diversity initiatives, citing a McKinsey analysis that found ethnically and gender-diverse companies are more likely to perform well: “Shareholders believe that companies with comprehensive diversity programs, and strong commitment to implementation, enhance their long-term value, reducing the Company’s potential legal and reputational risks associated with workplace discrimination and building a reputation as a fair employer. Equally, shareholders believe the varied perspectives of a diverse senior management and board of directors would provide a competitive advantage in terms of creativity, innovation, productivity and morale, while eliminating the limitations of ‘groupthink,’ as it would recognize the uniqueness of experience, strength, culture and thought contributed by each; strengthening its reputation and business.” Apple has advised shareholders to vote against the new diversity policy, saying that the company already has programs in place to address this issue across all employees. It cited its partnership with the National Center for Women & Information Technology, its diversity website, and its $40 million partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, which creates opportunities for students from historically black colleges and universities who are pursuing careers in the tech industry. Michael Connor, the executive director at Open Mic, a nonprofit that works with shareholders to engage companies around social issues, and which advised on the Apple shareholder proposal, argues that more could be done to increase diversity at Apple. “Every company in Silicon Valley ties the achievement of goals to executive compensation,” he says. “Why don’t they do that with diversity in the workforce, if they consider it important?” Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Social issues on company proxy statements, which can be filed by shareholders who own more than $2,000 in market value of a company’s stock, typically don’t garner high percentages of votes. Maldonado made a similar proposal at Apple’s 2016 shareholder meeting, but it only won 5% of the vote. Still, the point is often to raise a particular issue. “If you’re flagging an emerging risk and something the company hasn’t caught on yet, the proposal might not win a majority right away, but we’re content to keep flagging this,” says Pat Tomaino, associate director of socially responsible investing at Zevin. “The objective with a lot of this is to get the company to engage with us in a productive dialog.” Most Popular A new theory promises to unlock your body’s full potential—and is actually scientifically sound Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search Post to Cancel

Credit: Thinkstock More like this AT&T's next 5G trial will shoot DirecTV Now to users' homes AT&T means business with planned 5G trial at Intel Intel puts mobile chip failures in its past with first speedy 5G modem Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price AT&T will launch its first 5G wireless service in Indianapolis and Austin later this year, offering theoretical top speeds of 400Mbps or higher, the company said. Current 4G LTE networks used by customers may be far less, often no higher than 30Mbps on downloads, from the nation's major wireless carriers, according to various field tests by independent testing companies. One such testing company, OpenSignal, reported last year that AT&T had reached just 7.93 Mbps on 4G LTE for average downloads, based on thousands of measurements. T-Mobile, meanwhile, was the top performer, with 12.26 Mbps. Massive bandwidth and low latency from 5G will help self-driving cars and mobile augmented reality and virtual reality headsets, AT&T said Wednesday. New technologies atop the 5G network and greater density of wireless transmitters could bring the theoretical test speeds even higher -- to 1Gbps in 2017, AT&T said. In December, AT&T launched its first business customer trial in Austin with Intel and Ericsson. The 5G rollout in Austin and Indianapolis will occur "in coming months," AT&T said. The company also said it will build two new 5G testing labs this spring in Austin. The testbeds will be used to support a fixed wireless 5G connection to stream DirecTV Now for residential and small and medium business customers. Also, the testbeds will be used to evaluate multiple vendors of advanced 5G technology for wireless systems. The tests will also explore 5G signal coverage for frequency bands in the 28GHz, 39GHz and sub-6GHz bands. At an event in San Francisco, AT&T described 5G as one of several parts of a technology platform called Indigo. John Donovan, AT&T's chief strategy officer for technology and operations, described Indigo as similar to an operating system for the AT&T network. Every network element will become more efficient using the Indigo approach, he said. In addition to 5G, AT&T described other components of Indigo that include software-defined networking and open-sourced ECOMP, to be hosted by the Linux Foundation. ECOMP is described as a network operating system behind AT&T's software-defined network. ECOMP stands for Enhanced Control, Orchestration, Management and Policy and is basically automation software to help virtualize networks. AT&T said Indigo includes a data platform that organizations relying on AT&T's network can use to share data and collaborate securely on analytics. For example, AT&T said with Indigo, patients living far away from research centers could participate in medical trials; so-called smart cities could share data and initiatives; or cybersecurity experts could use machine learning to analyze threats to all the members of a community, not just threats faced by one member. Early in 2016, analysts predicted that full rollouts of 5G and related components by both AT&T and Verizon to reach significant parts of the U.S. would not occur until 2019 or 2020. AT&T's plans for 5G in 2017 with Austin and Indianapolis show that "AT&T is charging hard with 5G," said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. "I still think it is a neck-and-neck race with Verizon. But the key difference is that AT&T is pursuing standards-based 5G, while Verizon is pursuing pre-standards-based 5G." However, the standards have not been approved, he noted. The 5G wireless standards group, called 3GPP, approved a fixed wireless standard "accelerated plan" that could offer a completed standard by the end of 2017, so that SK Telecom could show the new technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. Entner said he believes all 5G standards won't be approved until late 2018. The current state of 5G "is like pre-season football," Entner said. "Who wins and loses in pre-season matters less than who wins the Super Bowl." To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

I rarely post anything of any real political nature, but I did want to point out that China wanting to capture the lion’s share of its own chip market makes a lot of sense.  For China, it is a legitimate national security issue.  Keep in mind that semiconductors run every computer, smartphone, or electronic device — including those that run national security and defense applications.  Imagine what would happen if China made 95% of the semiconductors that run the United States’ national defense.  The US government would scream that the sky is falling and immediately act to change this.  China has the right to protect its country and its people.  China justifiably wants to have a good share of its own chip market. Obviously, there are also financial reasons for this.  For example, China’s smartphone market is the world’s largest ( interestingly, India is second, in front of the US).  Apple sells more iPhones in China than anywhere else.  Qualcomm gets 53% of its revenue from China.  China needs to keep more revenue from its mobile industry. Since this is, after all, a blog focused on patents, what does all of this have to do with patents?  The answer lies in how China will achieve its lofty 40% and 70% semiconductor domestic market share goals by 2020 and 2025, respectively.  As noted, China is making huge capital investments.  This will lead to less “brain drain” from China to the West, as well as outright increases in innovation in this space.  Further, China will provide financial supports for domestic companies to outcompete foreign competitors.  But this will not be enough. We will likely soon begin to see more antitrust actions by the Chinese government.  But this, too, will be insufficient.  Patents and patent enforcement will provide the necessary supplement to ensure China dominates its own market.  (Again, because Intel is now connected to China, this will help them if not flourish, at least survive in, China.)  The problem is that most of the best-quality Chinese patents are owned by non-Chinese entities.  Other than the Chinese tech behemoths such as ZTE and Huawei, Chinese technology companies, including Tsinghua Unigroup, do not own many patents relative to their foreign counterparts, and the patents they do have are not as good as those owned by foreign competitors. The current lack of quality is nothing to be ashamed of.  China has generated a huge number of patents in a very short time.  In fact, more than 1 million patent applications were filed in China in 2015, but 96% were filed only in China.  This is changing quickly before our eyes, but for now, the best Chinese patents are those that are originally filed in the US, Europe, or Japan and then later filed in China as a counterpart to these foreign filings.  China has moved faster in patent protection and innovation than any country in the history of the world.  But to achieve more consistent quality, the Middle Kingdom needs a few more years as it shifts from quantity to quality.  This move is akin to the growth path of many technology companies around the world, including the US. For instance, when I was senior patent counsel at Red Hat, the company had completed a period of tremendous patent growth.  Unfortunately, because many of these patents were on operating system technology, and unlike Red Hat, its competitors do not freely provide source code, much of the portfolio was of dubious value due to the inability to determine infringement.  During my time there, and in the time since, Red Hat’s portfolio has matured from a numbers-based portfolio to more of a quality-based one.  But this did not happen overnight, and neither will it for China.  But it will happen, and it will happen quickly with the emphasis and support currently provided by the Chinese government. If most Chinese patents owned by Chinese entities are are of lower quality, then how can China use patent litigation to chase away foreign companies to support and grow domestic businesses, especially in the semiconductor industry?  The answer is Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs).  Whether they are called NPEs, licensing companies, Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs), patent trolls, or any other pejorative term, these businesses have decades of experience in licensing, monetizing, litigating, and enforcing patents.  They are fertile ground for advice regarding patent enforcement and strategy for a country and its technology leaders that may be incredibly bright and business-smart, but with little experience in the patent realm.  I recently had an article published in the Chinese state media detailing how NPEs can support innovation and technology companies in China. Further, NPEs are uniquely positioned to help China by attacking foreign entities to clear the way for Chinese companies by exerting pressure in ways that only NPEs can.  Even if Chinese semiconductor companies had the necessary patents and experience to engage their foreign competitors, they would risk retaliation from these foreign parties.  NPEs, on the other hand, can unilaterally attack foreigners without fear of retaliatory patent suits.  Although there are a few of antitrust issues, I do not believe that NPEs that act in the best interest of China should, or will, be attacked by the NDRC or any other antitrust agency in China.  Indeed, by being a good “friend of China” NPEs will be exactly what China needs:  an agent to help enact the goal of China to dominate its domestic industries in semiconductors and other fields.

Some DHS Employees Are Suspicious of ‘Extreme Vetting’ THIS WEEK: Mattis outlines budget planning; NATO tech; and more How to Survive a Russian Hack Pentagon Spells Out Details of Troops’ New Retirement System Trump’s Travel Ban Will Not ‘Help’ ISIS Recruitment Why Iraq Needs the Oil Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas Some DHS Employees Are Suspicious of ‘Extreme Vetting’ By Patrick Tucker Read bio February 1, 2017 AP / Andrew Harnik AA Font size + Print Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly pauses while speaking at a news conference at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio February 1, 2017 The Department of Homeland Security has 30 days to figure out what "extreme vetting" means. Some DHS officials and counterterrorism experts find the concept dubious. No one’s sure yet what constitutes “extreme vetting,” the screening standard invented by Donald Trump on the campaign trail and soon to be applied to people who want to visit the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries. It might include a check on phone records and social-media activity, the head of the Department of Homeland Security said yesterday. But TSA’s own counter-terrorism experts are far from convinced that this is a useful step, and some say existing measures are already extreme. DHS has 30 days from the date of the executive order to define the standard, Secretary John Kelly told reporters Tuesday. One TSA official, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, said phone-record checks wouldn’t be of much use in screening visa applications. Why would criminals, terrorists, or other national-security threats use phones that could be traced to them? A former Army intelligence analyst said collecting digital footprints can make it harder for terrorists to operate. When he was doing counter-terror operations in Iraq, he found that insurgents and terrorists “always leave digital breadcrumbs. People always screw up. When I was in Iraq, we were tracking networks of people. I was asked, ‘won’t they get wise?’ I said, if they stop talking on the phone, we’ve won. It decreases their means to communicate. And someone always screws up.…someone will inevitably call their girlfriend or wife,” he said. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily.

The former Army analyst said both the travel ban and “extreme vetting” would be counter-productive. “Calling out and segregating a section of the population like refugees is not a good idea,” he said. “I think the process we have, or had, is sufficient if you look at the data. Intel is a game of resources. If I have a finite amount of resources, I would send those resources to where there is a known threat.” No evidence has been presented to indicate that refugees from the travel-ban countries pose a threat.  Since 2001, some 784,000 refugees have been settled in the United States, many from countries on the ban list. A record number, some 85,000, came into the country last year, according to Pew research. Yet there has never been a deadly terrorist attack on American soil by  a refugee from a country on the travel ban list. The analyst said that the Israeli security model probably made more sense than a blanket ban. Travelers who enter Israeli airports may be interviewed multiple times in person, and even before they actually set foot in the airport terminal. The thinking is that someone who poses a threat is more likely to betray that fact to an observant human asking them questions than in their answers on a paper form. “The Israelis do it really well. It’s random the way that they do it. You have to randomize it,” the analyst said. Kelly said extreme vetting might start by improving how U.S. officials verify that refugees and would-be visitors are who they say they are, which is not always easy when they come from countries with different standards of recordkeeping.   There are a “number of countries on the planet that don’t have that kind of records keeping, police work, that kind of thing” that could allow authorities to better know travelers’ intentions, he said. Iran, Yemen, Iraq, Sudan and the other countries on the travel ban list “right now, for the most part, fall into that category,” Kelly said. Refugees Are Already “Vetted, Extremely” Well For U.S. officials, it’s actually easier to verify the identity of a refugee than an applicant for a tourist or student visa, simply because other organizations have already put in the work. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, is the agency that registers refugees fleeing places like Syria. They collect fingerprint data and photographs and conduct detailed background interviews.  “UN workers determine whether a refugee falls into any of about 45 ‘categories of concern,’ from serving in particular government ministries or military units to being in specific locations at specific times, even missing family members,” Defense One’s Molly O’Toole reported in 2015. When a refugee applies for resettlement in the United States, DHS conducts its own screening, running applicants’ names against the databases of the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center and the National Counterterrorism Center. The U.S. also conducts its own in-person interviews, drawing heavily on UNHCR data. In many cases, DHS officials simply re-ask the refugee the same questions from the UNHCR interview. A Customs and Border Protection official who worked with refugees said that the UN information works just great. “There’s nothing wrong with the data that we’re getting. In fact, I would prefer to trust that data more and re-collect less,” the CBP official said, requesting anonymity. “There are reasons to ask the same questions multiple times, just to make sure that the story is consistent, but there are other points where we don’t need to ask them, ‘Where were you born?’ five times.” The CBP official said that concerns about the UNHCR’s ability to conduct interviews and background checks were unfounded. “The UN, are they a bunch of refugee-huggers trying to get every refugee somewhere? In meeting with them, the answer is no,” the CBP official said “They need to make sure that their process is robust in order to maintain their legitimacy. They rely on host countries. If those countries lose faith that the UN is being objective and back out, the UN loses, in terms of resettlement as a solution.” This presents DHS with a problem. If it wants to stop relying on UNHCR, it’s going to have to  send TSA agents out to far-flung ports around the world, where they will be largely duplicating the work the UN is doing, and doing adequately, according to at least some at DHS. All of those questions will need to be answered before DHS will be able to communicate clearly what “extreme vetting” is. Then there is the question of what exactly to do with social media data. The idea of using social information from platforms such as Twitter and Facebook as part of a vetting process is not new. The Obama administration was toying with the idea of letting people voluntarily submit social media info in exchange for faster screening back in 2016. John Costello, a senior analyst at the firm Flashpoint, a company that provides threat intelligence derived from the deep and dark web, says that someone’s Facebook or Twitter page can be a part of an overall understanding of who that person is but probably does not work as a means to disqualify someone from travel. “I think it will be an extremely helpful method for getting people through quickly,” he said. So if a border agent or officer were to encounter someone with a document that looked not exactly right, that traveler’s digital fingerprint could serve as a means of verifying that identity. “Say they do have a document that may be specious that gives an identity, but they have a phone that they’ve had for seven years that also matches with that identity, and they have a social media account that’s several years old that aligns with that identity. It’s a good indicator that that identity is positive,” he said.  Allison Nixon, the director of security research at Flashpoint, said that trying to use social media information to disqualify passengers would be much harder than simple ID verification. “ Your audience dictates what you show about yourself. I think people have this image in their head of a border agent looking through someone’s Facebook casually. It’s not possible to come to those conclusions [about disqualifying someone] so quickly.” She said that she might spend 40 hours or even more piecing together the disparate pieces of a person’s social media identity across multiple platforms. She could not imagine DHS performing those sorts of searches at the scale of the traveling public. After the 30-day review to determine what Kelly called “weaknesses of our current immigration” system, DHS will develop, review, and issue new guidelines. At least some of those will be aimed at other nations, asking them to to change the way that they compile citizens’ records, he said. Patrick Tucker is technology editor for Defense One.

A vodka drinking mouse, a working tornado, and a new social network without the negativity of bullying, were among the 82 projects completed by 2nd year and Transition year boys at St Mary's CBS Portlaoise today, February 2 at SciFest. With 215 students taking part, the science fair is embraced at the school, and this year primary schools in Portlaoise got to visit. "We were delighted at the level of interest, the excitement on their faces," said science teacher Helen Felle, who thanked the 21 judges, who included engineers, teachers, pharmacists, accountants and local business figures. SciFest founder, retired teacher Sheila Porter, was impressed at the range of projects. "The standard is always very good, they are all very enthusiastic and confident in their presentations," she said. "SciFest gives everybody gets a chance, it's free, inclusive and accessible, we expect up to 10,000 entries nationwide this year, and the winners go to regional and national finals, with a chance to go to the Intel International Science and Engineering fair in America," she explained. Three 2nd years had created a mini tornado using dry ice,  hot water and a vortex creating fan, attracting lots of spectators. Jeff Leong, Tom Gbenoba and Oscar Ganly are concerned that Ireland will get more real tornados as the climate changes. "It's not just tornados, there will be more extreme weather with erosion of our coastline and higher temperatures," said Oscar. TY students Caolan Fleming and Matthew Cotter are behind 'Eva' a social network with the emphasis on content rather than users. "You chose what topics you are interested in, and content is refreshed on your page every day, which users can comment on. Everyone is anonymous so it filters out negativity that happens on other social network sites," explained Caolan. They already have an account with Google ad sense. "We can get a steady flow of income, depending on clicks, and advertisers can target customers more effectively," explained Matthew. Meanwhile the mouse which 2nd years Jack Kennedy and Rian O'Connell had fed vodka, was "on cold turkey" following their experiment. 'Jerry' had to find his way through a maze to get cheese, and was then given vodka in his water, to do the maze again.  "He couldn't make decisions as quickly, he would reach a dead end and just stand there. On the RSA website it says alcohol slows down your reaction time, and we proved that it does," said Jack, who now has reformed drinker Jerry as his pet at home. Six to eight projects will be selected to go on to the regional SciFest at Carlow IT, see Leinster Express next week for results.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition The nominees for this month's award.

 Snapchat has partnered with an ad agency to begin investing in tech startups Lara O'Reilly Feb. 2, 2017, 9:24 AM 1,090 facebook linkedin twitter email print Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel. Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Time Inc Snap Inc., Snapchat's parent company, has formed a partnership with IPG-owned ad agency R/GA and its "marketing tech venture studio," the companies announced in a press release. The R/GA Marketing Tech Venture Studio is similar to a tech accelerator, inviting early-stage and later-stage startups from the marketing tech industry to apply for the five-month program, which ends with a demo day at R/GA's New York City headquarters in September. The studio is looking for startups that work on areas to improve mobile advertising — such as machine learning, optimization, and data analytics. The 10 startups selected will get access to Snap, R/GA, and the IPG network's teams, who will help them build their businesses and offer advice, networking, and the opportunity to access executives and projects at sponsors including Intel, IBM Watson, and American Airlines. In addition, each company will be invited to present their businesses to "global brand leaders" at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in June. R/GA will also invest up to $120,000 in the selected startups in exchange for up to 6% equity. Snap will be co-investing, although the company is not providing specifics on the value of those investments. For Snap, the program gives it the opportunity to get first-look at the types of technologies that could help it boost its revenues in the future. Plus, it will help the company build on its relationships with ad buyers across the IPG group. The company has reportedly been seeking advertising commitments of $100 million upwards from all the major advertising holding companies. Snap Inc. chief strategy officer Imran Khan said in a statement: "We believe that mobile engagement has given rise to some of the best and most unique advertising opportunities. We are excited to work with R/GA and IPG to support innovative companies that help marketers provide creative and effective advertising experiences.” The venture studio — R/GA's eighth startup program — isn't the first time Snap has formed a partnership with an ad agency group. Back at Cannes Lions 2015, Snap formed a partnership with the world's largest advertising holding company, WPP, and The Daily Mail to launch a content marketing agency called Truffle Pig. Snap is expected to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at some point this week in an initial public offering valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion.

TechWhack Review Best Sites Here Best Flash Sites – A Look At The Most Creative Flash Websites February 2, 2017 By Harsh Leave a Comment Flash allows websites to truly come to life. Some of the best flash sites out there use the program in an artistic way that really grabs your attention. We are looking at some of the most unique, visually artistic and inspirational uses of flash on the web today. Although it may have had its hey day, flash still is a powerful tool. Many of these websites are a testament to the power of adobe flash, Best Flash Sites Clouds Over Cuba In October 1962 The Soviet Union and the USA where on the brink of all out Nuclear War. Clouds Over Cuba is an interactive documentary and multimedia experience that uses the immersive power of Adobe Flash to allow you to relive the Cuban Missile Crisis over 50 years later. The overall effect is quite chilling and helps you realize how close the world was to an all out conflict at this time.

If you love becoming immersed in real historical events this could be one of the best flash sites for you. Free Movies Online We Choose the Moon Another historical flash site, we choose the moon was created to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the moon landing. “We Choose the Moon” is actually a quote from a speech made by President John F Kennedy, clearly this is a period of history that looms large in the American imagination. This site is a little older than some of the others we are looking at, but it makes excellent use of flash and is well worth your time if you are a history buff. Flash allows the website to blend archive photos, audio and video seamlessly to create a real immersive experience. Free Music Download Moodstream Developed by the folks at Getty Images, Moodstream is a hypnotic flash website that is supposed to get you in a creative mood.

There are a baffling 759,375 combinations available. Personally I found this one a bit strange, but it is an interesting use of flash. The Museum of Me Museum of Me should be a real hit with the narcissists out there! The website developed by Intel gathers information from your Facebook account to create a visual snapshot of your life as if you can see your own life in a museum. This is either amazing or creepy depending on your outlook on life. Whatever your opinion Fluid inc. who helped create the website have made excellent use of Flash here. Free Movie Downloads Bear 71 This is another excellent interactive flash documentary. Compared to Clouds Over Cuba, this one tells a much smaller scale and personal story. The website is about a female Grizzly Bear that was monitored by a group of conservationists from 2001 to 2009. The use of Flash here to add atmosphere and drama to this story is stunning. Over the course of the story we come to understand the modern dilemma of a clash between humans nature and technology. Inspirational stuff. Watch Anime Online Waterlife This is an educational showcase for the documentary Waterlife. Here you can check out the stunning cinematography and some of the rich story telling that is found in the film. The designers have made creative use of the flash program in the way the navigation through the site is reminiscent of the motion of water on a lake. Music downloader free Pharrell Williams – Happy Happy was one of the biggest hits of 2015. In case you didn’t get enough of the song then, Mr Williams has a website called 24 Hours of Happy which claims to be the worlds first 24 hour music video. It makes solid use of Flash media to really complement to song well. Worth checking out. A Year in Space Another interactive site for space exploration nerds. This interactive flash website immerses you in to the trip of an astronaut to the international space station. The documentary journey is broken down in to bite size story chunks making it easy to navigate. The site includes some absolutely stunning imagery. The coolest part is how the website explains how you can go outside and spot the international space station in the sky for yourself. Awesome stuff! Favela United This cool interactive website tells a true story of the impoverished favelas of Brazil and the tough young women who live there. Through the immersive interactive experience we can see the power of football. The site includes great reporting with some stunning visuals. The story told here is a powerful one and the site presents us with some sobering statistics. The combinations of photography, quality design and honest reporting totally draws you in. A girl can dream This site is produced by the people at NPR. It combines an interactive storyboard with video and audio to tell the story of the challenges facing young women seeking an education in Afghanistan. Like Favela United, this is a powerful story that is excellently told through the interactive medium of the internet. World Airports This nice website lets you visualize the locations of websites around the world. It looks really nice and you can hover over any part of the globe to find out about the airports in that area. I am discovering transport hubs I never knew existed! Beatbox Acadamy This fun site lets you play the beatbox drums by hitting the keys on your keyboard. The site looks nice, but I’ve found that a little lag stops this from being a truly fun experience. Mp3 Download Conclusion There you have it. These are some of the best flash sites and interactive websites out there today. Flash has been employed time and again to provide a truly immersive end user experience, to tell stories and to sell products. You owe it to yourself to check out these cool websites and be inspired.

In the long term, it's about the survival of the Mac. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 2, 2017 -- 13:45 GMT (05:45 PST) | Topic: Apple CPU and GPU inside apple's 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.iFixit So, a Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on "a new chip for future Mac laptops that would take on more of the functionality currently handled by Intel Corp. processors." Must read: 7 things you need to know about Apple (Q1 2017 edition) What's Hot on ZDnet The five industries leading the IoT revolution Robots and AI: Should we treat them like pets, or people? IBM's Watson wants to help you do your taxes at H&R Block Google pushes ahead to make its cloud better for Windows enterprise users Here, in a nutshell, is what Bloomberg got from "people familiar with the matter": The chip is similar to the T1 chip currently used to power the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro Internally codenamed T310 Will be used to handle low-power mode functionality Built using ARM technology Will work alongside an Intel processor Macs already have a feature called "Power Nap" that allows them to wake up when asleep to carry out tasks such as receiving emails and install updates, but the efficiencies of this are related to what Intel can deliver. Since no one knows macOS better than Apple, this makes sense. But in the longer term, this (if it is true) is clearly the beginning of the process of ousting Intel from the Mac. This has been something that's been rumored for years, and while Apple would need to leap through a number of hoops to make it happen, in the long term, it seems like a logical direction for Apple to go in. Not only would it give Apple greater control over the hardware ecosystem, but it would also allow it to better control the processor/graphics chip upgrade cycle. Several insiders have commented on the fact that Apple was displeased that Intel did not have Kaby Lake processors ready for the new MacBook Pro, forcing it to launch a product running old microarchitecture. By developing its own silicon, Apple could better coordinate macOS and Mac hardware releases to best leverage the silicon -- just as it does with the iPhone/iPad and the iOS platform. But, ultimately, Apple's dabbling with ARM inside Macs is clearly a move to bring iOS and macOS closer together, and possibly coalesce the two operating systems at some point in the future. I know Apple executives have ruled out combining the iPad and MacBook, but I'm also old enough to remember the late Steve Jobs saying how Apple wasn't interested in getting into the smartphone business while the company was secretly developing the iPhone. Unifying iOS and macOS into single platform makes sense. Maybe now is not the right time, but in the long run, it's certainly where Apple is headed.

TensorFlow has released a that includes an experimental Java API (using JNI). It's only a matter of time before TensorFlow reaches production Hadoop and Big Data clusters in Global 5000 industries. I have seen my example TensorFlow scripts running very consistently without crashing for thousands of uses. The one thing missing is Enterprise support for TensorFlow, especially containerized and managed. I think a number of Big Data vendors will start doing that soon. IBM has added TensorFlow to PowerAI. A good time to revisit and retry the Neural Image Caption Generator in TensorFlow, I will post my findings on how well it runs on a OSX 10.12 Intel 2.5 GHz i7 with 16 GB RAM.

Tuesday conference sessions in fact will feature a three-hour tutorial on power distribution and a late afternoon panel discussion on DC-DC converters To suggest that the DesignCon presentations — with their emphasis on modeling and high-speed digital circuitry — never paid much attention to “analog” design would be a serious misrepresentation. What are we looking at as we try to preserve the “signal integrity” of a GBits-per-second data stream? To be sure, DesignCon 2017, opening in Santa Clara this week (Jan 31 – Feb 2), will showcase an impressive catalog of high-speed design tools and models for complex SoCs, as well as hands-on techniques for insuring signal integrity, while minimizing crosstalk and jitter. DesignCon’s technical sessions typically focus on knotty engineering problems such as overcoming chip and module package parasitics, PCB absorption and reflections, high-speed serial clocking, techniques for measuring and simulating signal impairments, test and measurement methodologies, and the analysis of interconnects. The opening day keynote by Zoltan Cendes, founder of Ansoft Corp. — “Turning Signal Integrity Simulation Inside Out” — effectively sets the focus knob for the entire conference. What may be a bit different this year are the number of tutorials and panel discussions devoted to power management — among the most challenging technologies for ensuring signal integrity. Tuesday conference sessions in fact will feature a three-hour tutorial on power distribution and a late afternoon panel discussion on DC-DC converters, several application focused presentation on power management for automobiles, power management for servers. Focused presentations will be looking at power delivery networks, bypass capacitors (their role in suppressing noise and jitter), distributed low-dropout regulators (LDOs), and power delivery for 10- and 7-nm chips. There sessions will review state of the art and identify the technology challenges moving forward. Bring your notebooks From a power management perspective, the most interesting panel sessions will be devoted to switching regulators. “Why We Love (hate) DC-DC Converters?” the panel asks. The point-of-load converters using pulse width modulated (PWM) supplies are getting smaller and more energy-efficient year-by-year. But they’re noisy, and there’s not a lot we can do about that, the DC-DC converter panelists agree. Their experience comes from IBM, Intel, Cisco and Oracle. DC-DC converters offer almost perfect energy transfer efficiencies, says Tony Obrien of Cisco. They are easily 97% (compared with 85%, the then State-of-The-Art in 2007). Power density is almost 1000 watts in a ¼-brick module (2.30 x 1.45 x 0.42 in). Under the supposition that elevated switching frequency unlocks the treasure chest for smaller size and higher density point-of-load (POL) power modules, Obrien sees 400 kHz as today’s typical frequency. The panelists look for the switching speed advantages of gallium nitride (GaN), but cite 5MHz as the likely ceiling for switching power supplies using GaN. The “hate” side of the DC-DC converter story is that they are noisy. And the smaller they become, the more they are injecting switching noise into to microprocessor’s circuitry. Digital systems designers have a love-hate relationship with DC-DC converters. On one hand, converters offer higher power densities for large current consumers. On the other hand, they are noisy, and newer power module design techniques only increase susceptibility. (Source: IBM (DesignCon 2016 Presentation)) Cisco Systems’ O’Brien identifies the power consumption architectures engineers will need to design for: In servers, which has been a driver for DC-DC converter development we’re seeing systems with 380V distribution buses, and local (in the rack) 48V-to-1V converters. Panelist Jordan Keuseman of IBM sees the use of the PMBus as among the most promising additions to the DC-DC converter story. Inserting a microcontroller or state machine into the control loop of a DC-DC converter does not increase its energy transfer efficiency, nor improve its response time. The insertion does allow data centers (and other large power distribution networks) to monitor and control the phase and frequency of multiphase regulators in software. Keuseman dismisses the usual argument about analog engineers not trained or well-suited to write code, but reminds that so-called “digital loops” have many analog elements. (We still need transformers for high-voltage power distribution, for example.) Power delivery misbehavior must be discovered and corrected before the power components leave the factory. Keuseman also points to wide bandgap semiconductors (GaN and Silicon Carbide) as a possible means to improve DC-DC converter performance, but the “revolution” widely touted five years ago is barely underway today. The di/dt is very hard to characterize without lab measurements and the DC-DC converters are typically selected for worst case scenarios, in order to insure they hold their specs. Worst case conditions are rare, Keusement believes. And firmware updates can introduce instabilities — which makes the DesignCon case for LOTS of testing and simulation. Voltage regulators in servers Madhavan Swaminathan and Anto Davis, researchers at Georgia Tech http://c3ps.gatech.edu/ will use the DesignCon meeting to examine the power delivery mechanisms for large processors and SoCs. In servers and PCs, power is supplied by a multi-phase buck regulator, whose outputs are paralleled to deliver (in some cases) up to 200A. This architecture is changing, as the CPU substrate shares space with what Intel calls the ‘IVR” (integrated voltage regulator), Georgia Tech explains. The ongoing application of Moor’s Law, the researchers insist, enables greater functionality in smaller packaging. But this forces the placement of voltage regulator modules (and prepackaged voltage regulator chips) on a shared substrate (with embedded passives) to shorten the power delivery path. Stacking techniques, the authors suggest, will be perfected as an ongoing technology development. But delivering “clean power” to the CPU will be the major challenge as the stacking techniques look to position switching regulators on top of the SoCs, making it likely switching noise will be directly injected into the CPU circuits. Moores Law shows system volume shrinking and functionality increasing. With circuity imploding in size, providing CLEAN POWER has become a major challenge (Source: Georgia Tech, Center for Co-Design of Chips, Packages, and Systems) Legacy technology puts a prepackaged buck converter feeding a packaged processor on the same substrate (which embedded inductors and capacitors), says Georgia Tech. With the buck regulator horizontally feeding the CPU power rails, it becomes possible to “tune” the circuit by lengthening-or-shorting the space between the buck regulator and the SoC. The advantage, the authors suggest, is “reasonable” signal and power integrity. The level of integration is low; but the Solution is what the authors call “Non-disruptive.” Newer technology, the authors say, packages the IVR (with a buck converter) and a prepackaged SoC (with LDO in package) in a SIP package (with embedded capacitors and inductors). The power delivery path from Buck Converter to SoC is horizontal on board. This topology allows slow/fast power phases, acceptable efficiency, but good Signal and Power Integrity. Integration is modest, but “non-disruptive.” What is in development are specialized Integrated Voltage Regulators (IVR) for computer applications. These use SIP packaging (with embedded capacitors and inductors, shrunken by the application of high switching frequencies), buck converter, SoC and LDO (bare die in their own shared package). While the power path between buck converter and SoC and LDO combo is horizontal, both are mounted on the IVR substrate with a vertical conduction path. This offers high performance, high efficiency, modularity, excellent signal and power integrity. But it will require lower cost materials and thermal management. Integration is ambitious as the solution can be disruptive. The most ambitious topology — already implemented in some Intel CPUs — packages the SoC, the LDOs, and buck converter in the same package, integrated vertically to the IVR (also featuring embedded passives). This is said to offer very high performance, but the modules (so far) are practically hand-crafted. The implementations thus far resist modularity, scalability, and thermal management. Technology challenges (moving forward) include the development of high-frequency multi-phase buck converters, and stacked power stages for high input voltage conversion. Current research on power delivery architectures focuses on IVR-SIP solutions with both buck converters and LDOs on the same substrate. (Source: Georgia Tech, Center for Co-Design of Chips, Packages, and Systems) In Intel’s FIVR (Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator) implementation, a high-current buck regulator drives a battery of parallel LDOs with a very fast clock and specialized inductors in package. A 93% efficiency is cited for 1.7V:1.05V conversion, and a 140MHz switching frequency. Georgia Tech’s own implementation obtained a 91.1% efficiency with a 100MHz clock. Efficiency, researcher noted, were process dependent. (A 65nm IVR would offer somewhat higher efficiency than a 130nm CMOS implementation.)

The Standing Rock protest area cleanup has been spearheaded by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which organized the protests that drew thousands of people to North Dakota throughout 2016. As ABC News reports, Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault admits that the area where opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline have been camped out for months is a mess. Not only that, much of the debris left behind by protesters has been buried under snow. Efforts to clean up the Standing Rock site are expected to take weeks, with some of the largest debris left behind consisting of vehicles.

The reason? Treacherous winter weather, the Obama administration’s halt of pipeline construction, and calls by the Standing Rock Sioux tribal leadership to get out of the area, at least for now. “There’s more than anticipated, and it’s under a lot of snow. I wouldn’t say it’s going to get done in days; it’s going to take weeks.” The area of the Standing Rock protest camp is located near where the Cannonball River flows into Missouri and is prone to flooding. Water protectors involved in the protests want to ensure that the area is cleaned up before spring runoff can wash debris and other contaminants into the Missouri River, which is the source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, as well as millions of others downstream. @kkalmes2 History repeating itself.

They are attacking American citizens. — Impeach Bannon (@kiki_kaff) February 2, 2017 In fact, it is the commitment to keeping the Missouri River water clean and drinkable that is at the root of the Standing Rock protests. Water protectors fear that the controversial, $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline may burst or leak in the future, contaminating the water of the Sioux and countless others. The four-state project, backed by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, is nearly completed. It needs only the final stretch, which runs under Lake Oahe, to be completed to become operational. The problem? Lake Oahe is an artificial lake created by the damming of the Missouri River, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their supporters fear the environmental impact that would result from a leak at the location. The land in question belongs to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who had at one time granted an easement to the folks behind the controversial pipeline. Late in 2016, before President Obama vacated the White House, the Corps rescinded that easement, telling Energy Transfer Partners to look into an alternate route. However, as one of his first acts as POTUS, Donald Trump ordered that the pipeline could be completed as planned. While the Standing Rock Sioux have vowed to continue fighting, it appears that construction will be green-lighted in the near future. .@RondaRousey & Paulina Macias bring fresh fruit, vegetables, bread, tents & wood-burning stoves to Standing Rock. https://t.co/r91KV2WVlj pic.twitter.com/fhatoalhn6 — Team Rousey (@ArmbarNation) January 26, 2017 Amid all of the controversy, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been cleaning up after their protest efforts, moving remaining protesters to a camp on higher ground. Nicknamed the “Last Child” camp, the new encampment would keep the Standing Rock protesters out of the way of floodwaters and give them space to clean up the main camp. A project, incidentally, that tribal leaders haven’t asked for help from the State of North Dakota or Morton county to complete. Even so, reports The Canadian Press, law enforcement did show up during the cleanup process. And rather than help Standing Rock protesters with their efforts, the police in military gear reportedly evicted remaining protesters from their new “Lost Child” camp, a camp that has been described as nothing more than a “peaceful assembly.” Those at Standing Rock report that in addition to police in riot gear, the Standing Rock camp was raided by members of the National Guard, and that armored military vehicles were used. Reportedly, the police intervention on Wednesday was little more than a raid, and at least one impacted protester was able to livestream video of the militarized law enforcement officers threateningly evicting remaining water protectors from the disputed site. According to social media reports, not only are police evicting and even arresting holdout Standing Rock protesters, they are even burning their shelters and destroying everything in their path. While Sheriff’s spokesman Rob Keller claims that only two protesters were arrested today, Standing Rock protesters with boots on the ground say that the number of arrested water protectors is closer to 50, perhaps even more. In addition, protesters claim that many efforts to livestream the controversial eviction efforts were blocked.

However, water protectors and protesters at Standing Rock have vowed to continue their protest efforts (both on site and via the legal system) to ensure that their water and sacred sites stay safe and unmolested. A group of U.S. military veterans numbering in the thousands has even offered to “re-deploy” to Standing Rock to stand between Native American protesters and law enforcement, if needed. ***Update: Fox News confirms that 76 water protectors were arrested at Standing Rock on February 1. According to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum’s office, those arrested were a “rogue group of some of the more aggressive elements of the protest camp.” The governor’s office added that they were “attempting to create a new campsite on private property” near Standing Rock.*** [Featured Image by David Goldman/AP Images] Now Watch This: Nancy Pelosi Calls Steve Bannon A “White Supremacist” Now Read This: Angelina Jolie Tackles Refugee Debate In New York Times Op-Ed Piece Share 213 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Patricia Ramirez Tags: #NoDAPL, Dakota Access Pipeline, standing rock, Standing Rock Protests February 2, 2017 Scandal: President Trump’s SCOTUS Pick Founded School ‘Fascism Forever Club’ February 1, 2017 Beyoncé And Jay Z Expecting Twins, Dethrones Selena Gomez’s Most Liked Instagram Comments LATEST HEADLINES Angelina Jolie Tackles Refugee Debate In New York Times Op-Ed Piece WWE Planning Huge Feud For Brock Lesnar And Roman Reigns After ‘Wrestlemania 33’ Huawei P10 Release: 2017 Flagship Arriving With ‘Plus’ & ‘Lite’ Variants?

In terms of hardware, it might differ such as with Samsung where some markets gets its Exynos chipset while others gets Qualcomm. Apple has done similar differentiation where some markets get Intel modems while others use Qualcomm’s. However for the upcoming LG G6, the company is rumored to be doing things differently. A report from ETNews (via Pocketnow) has revealed that LG could be offering different features for different markets. For example the rest of the world is expected to get an LG G6 that features wireless charging coils to support wireless charging, while the LG G6 for the Korean market will be getting a MST coil that is meant to support mobile payments like LG Pay. We have heard rumors of LG’s plans for mobile payments where the company had initially gone with a credit card-like device, but late last year we heard that they were switching to MST which is the same technology used by Samsung for Samsung Pay. We’re not sure why LG is keeping the feature exclusive to the Korean market, or why couldn’t they have included the same hardware across the board so that it could be enabled later. In any case take it with a grain of salt but LG is expected to announce the handset at MWC 2017 so check back with us towards the end of the month for the details. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors.

Its "Made in China 2025" (MIC 2025) plan was published by the China State Council in May of 2015. The milestones in MIC 2025 are for China to be 40% self-sufficient in IC devices in 2020 and 70% in 2025. In reality, it is naive to believe that being 40%, 70%, or whatever percentage less than 100%, is even close to being self-sufficient in the IC industry. In just about every case, the lack of just one low-value IC (e.g., a mixed-signal analog device), process material (e.g., a specific chemical or gas used in fabricating ICs), or package type will stop the entire electronic system from being produced and shipped, according to IC Insights. The success of MIC 2025 is fundamentally dependent upon two things - funding and technology, IC Insights noted. The goals of MIC 2025 have almost no chance of success without strong results in both of these areas. There is near-unanimous consensus that funding will not be a hindrance for the potential success of MIC 2025, IC Insights indicated. China's National Government has approved approximately US$20 billion of funding support for its IC industry programs with almost another US$100 billion of possible support coming from local governments, provinces and private investors. In total, the tens of billions of dollars of funding now targeting the IC industry is probably sufficient to construct at least 10 high-volume 300mm IC production fabrication facilities. IC Insights believes that the huge roadblock standing in the way of the success of MIC 2025 is the ability of China-based companies to acquire the IC technology to be used in the newly funded fabs. Beginning in 2014, China-based firms sought to acquire technology by acquiring existing IC suppliers. China-based companies had some early success in acquiring companies like ISSI and OmniVision, but most governments are now on "high alert" with regard to China's IC industry ambitions and future foreign IC company acquisitions will be very difficult to complete. Although the amount of money reported to be allocated toward constructing the new China company IC fabs has been massive, the technology announced to be used in these fabs has in every case been at least two generations behind what the market leaders in that segment are currently using or will be using when the fab opens, IC Insights suggested. Examples include XMC's (purchased by Tsinghua Unigroup in July 2016 and put in a holding company called Yangtze River Storage Technology) 32-layer 3D NAND technology; Fujian Jin Hua Integrated Circuit's 32nm DRAM technology; and Shanghai Huali's (HLMC) 28nm foundry logic capability. While all of the currently announced China IC fabs seem to be more than adequately funded, none of them appear to possess the IC technology needed to compete with the leaders in their respective product segments, IC Insights identified. There have recently been reports that China-based companies building the new fabs discussed above are hiring IC engineers from Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel's China-based IC facilities. This method has been mentioned as one way for China companies to develop their own IC technology as these engineers bring IC process knowledge/experience acquired at their former employer with them. In IC Insights' opinion, this is a very dangerous way to "develop" IC process technology. In 2003, in China-based pure-play foundry SMIC's second year of production, TSMC filed a lawsuit alleging that SMIC hired more than 100 former TSMC employees and asked them to provide SMIC with TSMC trade secrets. Moreover, TSMC alleged that SMIC infringed on five of TSMC's IC process technology patents (later expanded to eight patents). In early 2005, SMIC and TSMC settled the lawsuit with SMIC paying TSMC US$175 million and TSMC gaining an 8% stake in SMIC. Prior to the settlement, a California jury returned a verdict against SMIC in a US lawsuit filed by TSMC. With the stakes so high, once the newly-opened Chinese-owned memory fabs begin production, the reverse engineering teams at Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron, Intel, Toshiba and Western Digital (SanDisk) will shift into high gear by taking apart the new Chinese DRAM and 3D NAND devices to determine which of their patents are being infringed upon by these new memory players. IC Insights believes that with the decades of high-volume DRAM and NAND flash production history of the major memory suppliers, it will be almost impossible to develop new DRAM and NAND flash technology without infringing on numerous patents within these companies' extensive portfolios. In 2016, IC production in China (including foreign companies) represented 11.6% of its US$112 billion IC market, up less than two percentage points from 9.8% five years earlier in 2011. Moreover, China-based IC production is forecast to exhibit a very strong 2016-2021 CAGR of 18%. However, considering that China-based IC production was only US$13 billion in 2016, this growth will start from a relatively small base. Given the sheer size of the expected expenditures for new Chinese IC facilities, as well as an expanding presence of foreign IC producers (e.g., Intel, Samsung, etc.), IC Insights believes there will be a significant improvement in the share percentage of China-based IC production through 2025, but nowhere near the levels forecast in the MIC 2025 plan. IC Insights forecasts that this share will increase to 17% in 2020 and to 25% in 2025, each less than half of the original MIC 2025 goals.

Lifestyle London Life How health tech is making the future of medicine smart From diagnosis by wearables to roving radiology robots, the future of medicine is smart, says Phoebe Luckhurst Phoebe Luckhurst Thursday 2 February 2017 10:17 BST Click to follow ES Lifestyle The future of health is smart Rex Robots are the new usurpers. There is a consensus that sly animatronics are coming for all of our jobs, no matter how skilled. First stop, self-service checkouts; next, world domination.  We could oppose the movement with the tenacity of entrenched Luddites or learn to co-operate with our robot overlords. There is a growing trade in technology that aids the treatment and diagnosis of illness — and doctors are eager to implement the innovations in the operating room. That means you could be diagnosed by wearable tech and have medicine prescribed by an app, all without waiting to see a doctor. It is potentially very significant for the overstretched NHS. The latest intel comes from Stanford University, which found last month that wearables can be used to detect when you are about to fall ill. Using data collected from volunteers wearing smartwatches, researchers found the tracking devices could detect early signs of illness: unusually high heart rates and higher skin temperature can prefigure the obvious symptoms of an infection or cold. The team now plans to build algorithms to make predictions more sophisticated and allow users to change their behaviour in order to preclude full-blown illness.  “In the future, you will have multiple sensors relaying information to your smartphone, which will become your health dashboard,” lead researcher Michael Snyder told Reuters. “Alerts will go off with elevated heart rates over your normal level and heartbeat abnormalities will be detected — these will enable early detection of disease.” Another Stanford study reported that computers can detect skin cancer as successfully as human experts can. Doctors already encourage patients to take photographs of moles or abnormal skin and email them to the medic for monitoring. Read more Lily Cole says young Londoners 'have power to change world' Early diagnosis is a crucial area. Many other start-ups use intuitive tests that can pre-empt disorder — such as Cambridge Cognition, based at the University of Cambridge. In 2013, the firm launched its first mobile test for touchscreen, a cognitive “game-like” programme that can assess the risk of Alzheimer’s.  “What we saw with the iPad was a vehicle to put touchscreen tasks into the hands of patients and physicians,” explains Noah Konig, director of product marketing. The test takes between seven and 10 minutes, and Konig stresses that the result is “not a diagnosis. For three-quarters of people, it is a reassurance.”  There’s also Sea Hero Quest, a game that’s helping experts at University College London and the University of East Anglia create the first global benchmark for human spatial navigation. They can use this to learn more about dementia. It’s a fun, colourful game, which has attracted more than 2.4 million players. And now research from Exeter University has found a virtual reality game could be used to provide an early diagnosis of schizophrenia; the game requires patients to mirror the movements of a digitised avatar.  Cambridge Cognition is also investigating the potential of wearable technology: “The data collected provides an intricate, everyday picture of someone improving, declining, or staying the same.”  The best apps for Londoners 12 show all The best apps for Londoners 1/12 Zip car ‘Join, reserve, unlock and drive’ — it really is that simple. The capital’s preferred car club’s app gives 24/7 access to cars and vans in your neighbourhood and lets you extend or cancel reservations on the go. Free 2/12 Uncover Still on the waiting list for Chiltern Firehouse? You need Uncover, which redistributes cancelled reservations at some of the capital’s top restaurants, including The River Café and Nobu. Not for planning freaks, though — tables typically become free at 40 minutes’ notice. Free 3/12 Uber So popular it’s become a verb, this private driver service has revolutionised travel in the capital. It’s speedy and affordable, making it a welcome alternative to the night bus. Free 4/12 Santander Cycles Launched this summer, the official app for Boris’ fifth child can be used to search for nearby docking stations and check bike availability. There’s also a journey planner featuring easy, moderate and fast routes to satisfy all cycling tribes. Free 5/12 Plume Air Report This new app has been downloaded by 3,000 Londoners. Sensors gathering air pollution data submit updates every hour, resulting in a scale that ranges from ‘fresh’ to ‘extremely polluted’. Free 6/12 Nightcapp Here’s an app that will have booze hounds raising their glasses. NightCapp is a map that pinpoints more than 1,500 London watering holes that stay open past 11.30pm. It also shows users when a bar is about to close by highlighting it in orange. Better get moving. Free 7/12 Money Dashboard An award-winning budget planner, this helps you keep track of personal spending across multiple accounts, pay off credit cards and even makes suggestions on how to manage your finances better. Free 8/12 Her Promising to introduce women to ‘a lesbian that hasn’t slept with any of your friends’, this revamped dating app includes queer-themed news and blogs, upcoming event notices and an improved algorithm-matching system. Free 9/12 FoodMood This new startup, which reckons it’s ‘Tinder for food’, pledges to narrow down your choice of lunchbreak destinations. Hit ‘yum’ or ‘yuk’ on photos of dishes in your area. Juvenile, but strangely addictive. Free 10/12 Daily Yoga This offers more than 50 yoga sessions, as well as a database of 500 yoga poses. Suitable for all levels, programmes include yoga aimed at specific areas of the body and weight loss. Namaste to that. Free 11/12 Coffee Meets Bagel Billed as the ‘anti-Tinder’, this new kid on the block delivers just a single match to users once a day. Coffee Meets Bagel uses Facebook profile information to recommend suitors based on friends of friends. Neither coffee nor bagels are included. Free. 12/12 Bristlr Do you have a beard? Perhaps you’d like to stroke one on a regular basis? This can be arranged. Unlike other dating apps, Bristlr is unashamedly all about hooking up the hairy with the hairless. There’s even a beard-rating option for aficionados. Free 23andMe is also in the game of early diagnosis: the California-based start-up’s £150 DNA-testing kit delivers a bespoke report on more than 100 health conditions and traits, including inherited conditions and potential response to common medications. You receive the package by post, provide a saliva sample then send it back. Once the sample has been analysed, you’ll be notified: log in to your dashboard to read your results. 23andMe works with another start-up, VITL, which provides a package of vitamins according to the results of your DNA test. Earlier diagnosis enables preventative care; better diagnosis enables intervention. Zebra Medical Vision is a Tel Aviv-based digital health firm that has engineered an image-scanning algorithm that claims to detect cancerous cells with 91 per cent accuracy; a radiologist typically has a success rate of 88 per cent.  The mammograms are colour-coded so that they can be translated by the computer system. The software is not yet commercially available but its founders estimate that when it is — five to seven years from now — it will change the radiologist’s role measurably. “They are going to have analytics engines or bots like ours that are going to be doing 60, 70, 80 per cent of their work,” founder Elad Benjamin told Wired this month.  California-based start-up Guardant Health has devised a new blood test that could replace the biopsies that direct the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The test is the only type that can detect the four types of gene mutation that might indicate the presence of cancerous cells. Biopsies can become defunct if the cancer mutates — Guardant’s blood test can be administered regularly and could therefore track the cancer’s evolution.  Then there are the teaching tools. Touch Surgery is a platform for telling surgeons how to carry out operations. It bills itself as the “virtual surgery app”; the software — available for smartphone and tablet, as well as for VR headset — provides three-dimensional, anatomical instruction. The start-up has 110 staff across offices in Clerkenwell and New York. “Surgeons can train to deliver procedures,” explains co-founder Jean Nehme. He says it outlines the processes step-by-step. “How the surgery would look if it were perfect.” Nehme hopes Touch Surgery could outline “why some people get 12 years of life on cancer and some get three”. In common with other applications, though, the chief objective is to “save lives”.  Follow Phoebe Luckhurst on Twitter: @phoebeluckhurst More about: Cancer Technology Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

These chips could boost battery life on the Mac and also help to reduce the dependence on the Intel chips. The chip is internally codenamed as T310 and it would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, added the report. It is said to be a variant of the T1 SoC Apple first introduced on the recently released TouchBar MacBook Pro. The ARM-based chip will offload Mac’s “Power Nap” features such as receiving email; syncing data in apps like Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes; software updates; and more, from the standard Intel processor as a way to save batter life. The T1 is dedicated to the Touch Bar, but the T310, according to Gurman and King’s sources, would have more integration with other hardware components, such as storage and wireless components. The report says that the new chip might be introduced in an upgraded MacBook Pro which is tipped to slated be for later this year.

The new chip has been in development since last year and is based on the proprietary silicon Apple debuted to power its innovative Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro, according to sources speaking with Bloomberg. People familiar with the matter say the chip can take over some of the functions currently handled by Intel's processors, allowing Apple to scale back the business partner's role in creating future Mac laptops.  One such functionality Apple is rumored to be aiming for handles the efficiency of the MacBook Pro during low-power or sleep modes, potentially leading to a better battery life overall. Despite its advancements, Apple's latest MacBook Pro hit a snag with some disappointed consumers, at least in part because of inconsistent battery life. Apple did patch a battery bug in a recent macOS update.  For the best battery life results, buy the best 2-in-1 laptop or Ultrabook Chips off the iBlock Setting aside the chip housed inside the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar, Apple is no stranger to making its own chips.  The gadget giant's iOS products have seen plenty of proprietary silicon, from the debut of the Apple A4 in 2010 leading all the way to the Apple A10 used in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While it's still not known for sure when Apple's latest chip will make an appearance - or what its exact purpose will be - producing more of its own parts independently of Intel may be a worthwhile investment, giving the Apple even more control over its prices and products.

But infrastructure constraints, limited talent and digital skills, and the need for regulation around the capture and exchange of data present some challenges. By Tas Bindi | February 1, 2017 -- 16:34 GMT (08:34 PST) | Topic: Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise Agriculture is commonly cited as an industry that has much to gain by harnessing the Internet of Things (IoT), with some even saying that it could be "the first big industrial IoT market". Advancements in technology mean that farm equipment, soil, waterways, and even livestock can now be instrumented. This gives farmers the ability to automatically collect objective information about the status of their soil, water, crops, and animals. But the potential of IoT to transform agricultural efficiency, improve financial performance, and boost yield is best achieved when it's combined with data analytics and machine learning.

Read More Australia has strong productivity levels in areas such as cropping and red meat -- in 2016, Australia's crop productivity was 19.2 tonnes per hectare compared with the world's productivity of 14.6 tonnes per hectare. However, its overall agricultural productivity growth rate sits at 1.4 percent, below the global average of 1.7 percent, according to a report by StartupAus, KPMG, Commonwealth Bank, and the Queensland government. Added to that, rising production costs -- including prices of seeds, fertilisers, water, electricity, and machinery -- are placing increasing pressures on Australian agribusinesses to more efficiently utilise their resources and increase output. But manual data collection processes make it difficult for farmers to achieve optimum levels of efficiency, especially given the geographic dispersal of their farms. After all, there are more than 123,000 agribusinesses in Australia occupying 50 percent of the nation's land, according to the StartupAus/KMPG report. This is where technology is playing an increasingly important role. The sophistication of today's sensors, internet-enabled devices, software applications, and cloud data storage facilities are allowing vast amounts and types of data to be captured, stored, manipulated, and fed into decision-support tools to guide business decisions. According to a 2016 report by the Australian Farm Institute (AFI), what we're seeing is the initial stage of "a fundamental change away from the skills-based farm management systems that have prevailed until present times towards a more industrialised model of agriculture where decisions are based to a greater degree on objective data." Tassal As an example, Tasmanian salmon producer Tassal has been using IoT technology -- provided by Dell EMC and Intuit -- to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs in the business. Sam Boyes, senior manager for ICT at Tassal, told ZDNet that a typical lease area from which the company operates will consist of 20 pens holding approximately 20,000 salmon each. The pens have been fitted with smart cameras above and below the water to get more accurate information about the water's oxygen levels, temperature, and current. The software to which the cameras are connected can then identify the optimum time to feed the salmon and release food accordingly. This ensures the company maximises the salmon's growth patterns, while also minimising food wastage, said Boyes. "That's the single biggest cost in our business -- the feed. So the last thing we want to do is waste any of it or not get the return on it through [the salmon's] growth." Sam Boyes, senior manager for ICT at Tassal Image: Tassal Boyes added that a reduction of one kilo of food every day saves the business AU$25,000 per year. "Any small improvements we can make there are quite significant. If we can reduce any [losses] by understanding what's happening in the environment -- for example, if there's a fast-running current -- then we can make decisions about when and how we feed those fish so that even a small amount of food isn't taken away by the current," he said. "These are the types of insights we've been able to get to reduce the cost of operation." "Likewise, when the fish want to eat and the feeding conditions are good, we can make sure we are maximising the opportunity for fish to grow well," he added. Tassal isn't using predictive analytics yet, but Boyes admitted that it's an exciting area and that the company is headed in that direction. The Yield An agtech company that's looking to bring predictive analytics to the forefront of the Australian agriculture industry is The Yield, founded by Ros Harvey, who was previously the Sense-T program director at the University of Tasmania. The initiative uses data, sensing technologies, and analytics to solve problems for Tasmania's agriculture ecosystem. Leveraging technology from Microsoft, Bosch, and Intel, The Yield's microclimate sensing system is able to analyse components such as salinity levels in the water and predict when oysters need to be pulled out. For example, if there was a storm and the farmer knew contaminated water was going to flow towards the oyster farm in the upcoming days, then they can take action to pull the oysters out. "Regulators used to open and close oyster harvesting in Australia based on rainfall as a proxy for runoff. But the problem is that rainfall can be coming from 100km away or more," Harvey said, adding that about 30 percent of rainfall-driven closures are unnecessary. "What we do is put in real-time salinity, temperature, and depth sensing into the water that oysters drink. Effectively, what that means is the regulator is able to open and close harvesting using that information. If the salinity goes down that's because freshwater is coming in." Ros Harvey, founder & CEO, The Yield Image: Microsoft/The Yield Harvest closures, especially during peak holiday periods, can cost farmers up to AU$120,000 in lost revenue per day, Harvey said. To date, The Yield's microclimate sensing system has been able to reduce unnecessary harvest closures by 30 percent, and is currently relied upon by 300 oyster farmers, with both the Tasmanian and New South Wales state governments being customers. "It's not helpful to know something unless it's an actionable insight," Harvey said. "This is why IoT is going to be massive; effectively, we have the ability to know what we couldn't know before, and we have the ability to use that data to get insight in a way that we haven't before." Standards and data-sharing When it comes to data, the general consensus is that open standard data platforms and data sharing protocols will add significant value to agribusinesses as greater intelligence can be drawn when datasets are combined with other datasets. This is why Tassal is exploring partnerships with data providers such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). "[They] can give us more wide-scale environmental data and we can overlay that with the data we're capturing on our sites to find additional patterns that can help us," Boyes said. There are a number of use cases, as presented in the AFI's report, that show how combined datasets are delivering greater value to farmers. For example, data collected from soil sensors and crop monitoring systems are being combined with local and hyperlocal climate data, enabling farmers to make better decisions to increase crop yields. On some farms, sensors and monitoring systems are connected to automated watering and fertilisation systems to maintain an ideal soil environment, facilitate healthy plant growth, and maximise crop turnover. There are livestock identification and monitoring systems that can not only provide almost real-time information about the geolocation of the livestock, but also biometric information such as activity levels, weight changes, blood composition, changes in heart rate, milk characteristics, and ruminal parameters that can be fed into a business intelligence platform to help with decisions around animal health, welfare, and reproduction. Ben van Delden, partner, head of markets and head of agtech at KPMG Australia, pointed out that Australian farmers are operating about 24 hours behind North American farmers in terms of the speed with which data from the device can be overlaid onto farm management systems and publicly available data sources such as the Bureau of Meteorology. "Our issue is that there is a poor backhaul of data to bring intelligence back to the devices for decision application -- for example, dependence on satellite time passes. This restricts the ability for real-time gains from integrating the collection of data on crop or livestock performance with farmer interventions," he said. "Farmers and growers are incredible risk takers when you think about what they do. [They're] constantly making decisions about when to plant, when to irrigate, when to protect, when to feed, when to harvest." — Ros Harvey, CEO at The Yield According to a Commonwealth Bank Agri Insights survey of 1,400 Australian farmers, 76 percent see the value of sharing on-farm production data with others, with 58 percent of farmers already doing so. The survey, published in October 2016, also shows that the agriculture sector is generally receptive to potential productivity gains associated with the deployment of digital technologies, with 70 percent of respondents agreeing that the technology available would bring significant value to their operations, and 20 percent expecting to increase technology investment in the next 12 months. Harvey said, however, that some farmers are sceptical of new technology. "I don't think it's because farmers aren't innovative -- they are. Farmers and growers are incredible risk takers when you think about what they do. Growing something is an incredibly complex thing to do. It's not like a factory. You've got all these different variables to take into account. You're constantly making decisions about when to plant, when to irrigate, when to protect, when to feed, when to harvest," Harvey said. "I think the issue is we've not been good in the technology sector in delivering reliable, accurate technology. Because of that, often the experience hasn't lived up to the promise and so there's a fair degree of scepticism." Infrastructure issues While the extent of challenges vary across different agricultural production systems, infrastructural constraints apply across the board when it comes to IoT implementation. Many rural and regional areas have poor electrical and network connectivity, with relatively small download allowances, and at a higher cost and slower speed than the services available in metropolitan cities. As such, many Australian agribusinesses are operating with broadband connections that are inferior to those available in countries competing for similar export market opportunities such as Canada, Denmark, and the US, the AFI report states. The AFI said lack of access to mobile telephone and data coverage can be a "major impediment" to technology adoption, advising the government to increase available funding to ensure equitable and affordable access to telecommunications infrastructure in rural and regional areas and to investigate the potential for public/private co-investment models to further enhance data coverage in those areas. "Most farms will have some form of 3G or 4G connectivity, but in many cases, it's pretty poor. In many cases, there's congestion. And in many cases, they're frustrated. Clearly, the faster we can get broadband and reliable connectivity to them, the better," said Kevin Bloch, CTO at Cisco ANZ. "But there's a whole area of technology that's coming through now that we're providing which is what we call low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) technology. In other words, we can now put in the capability by using an access point that can get you 5 to 10 kilometres of coverage, which is pretty cool because a lot of sensors don't send a lot of data. You don't need a lot of bandwidth, but you need bandwidth to be kilobits per second." Professor David Lamb from the University of New England at the Kirby Smart Farm. Image: NBNCo In 2015, the University of New England (UNE) began transforming a 2,900 hectare commercial farm called Kirby-Newholme into a SMART Farm (Sustainable Manageable Accessible Rural Technologies Farm). The Kirby Smart Farm, an initiative led by the Australian Centre for Broadband Innovation in collaboration with CSIRO and the UNE's Precision Agriculture Research Group, was one of the first farms in Australia to be connected to the National Broadband Network (NBN) fixed wireless service and is often referred to as an example of what quality broadband can enable. In addition to using a low-cost wireless tracking system and video monitoring technologies to monitor animal behaviour and location, the farm has deployed sensors to collect weather, light, and soil data. Local wireless networks allow the sensors to send a continuous stream of data to a remote cloud-based computing and analytics service. While rural and regional access to fast, reliable IT infrastructure is considered a "vital precursor" to building a strong agtech sector, van Delden said the question agribusiness leaders need to ask themselves right now is not: "How do I get data when and where I need it when connectivity is disparate?" Given there are more and more sophisticated sensors coming to market, van Delden said the right question is actually: "What am I going to do to use the sensors and data to augment my business and decision making processes?" "This is not about adding IoT solutions to your business as a bolt-on; it is about fundamentally thinking about how do I embed IoT into my business systems and reinvent my processes," van Delden said. "It's critical that you reimagine your business enabled by IoT and think through how the supply chain you are part of can be reorganised and made more efficient. You need to realise that IoT creates a dynamic environment that can speed up the way decisions are made within the supply chain ... and enable real-time interventions to optimise production." James Kavanagh, CTO at Microsoft Australia, communicated a similar sentiment, saying that digital transformation should not be thought of as simply being the automation of an old process; rather, it's about changing those processes. Kavanagh also said that it's possible to work around infrastructural constraints. "We do have some infrastructure constraints in Australia from a networking perspective. But it's possible to design with those constraints in mind," Kavanagh said. "There are many places in the world that would regard Australia's infrastructure as fantastic and yet still have IoT capabilities." "We've undertaken projects in Africa and Asia where there is almost minimal wi-fi or any kind of connectivity and satellites required. We just design around those constraints. "Sometimes it requires a different architectural approach -- such as more power at the device end to manage cache and perform the analysis -- but there are ways around it." Boyes said Tassal has been able to work around those constraints, but warned that it can be challenging from a financial and technical standpoint, as well as distracting. "You have to tackle [those challenges] yourself, but at the same time you want to make sure you're not distracted from your core business," he said. Boyes added that it's not always worth agribusinesses building their own mobile phone networks, and it can be helpful to understand the roadmaps of infrastructure providers to see if there's an opportunity to work together. "Quite often there's an opportunity to influence where [the providers] might start expansion or bring improved coverage to. Having good relationships is definitely key," he said. "The centre of excellence for food production is here in Australia and that's where we want to grow the agricultural technology sector." — Mike Briers, CEO at Food Agility "If you are embarking on it yourself, you've got to make sure you don't go too far left field and make sure you cover all your bases like security ... and put the complexity into a small area that you can easily compartmentalise and then transfer and communicate the key bits [of information] that you need. "We identified that implementing these sorts of strategies would provide us with a competitive advantage, so we invested a lot of time and a lot of money to get that competitive advantage." Skills gaps Another barrier to IoT adoption is the skills and talent required to manage and get maximum value from technology deployments. Dr Mike Briers, CEO of Food Agility, a consortium of commercial companies, universities, and farming industry bodies looking to facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture industry in Australia, said improving digital literacy would help reduce the fear that might be preventing farmers from adopting IoT. Food Agility is currently working to understand what education is required. According to the StartupAus and KPMG report, Australia is seeing an increase in enrolments for agricultural university degrees and there is an opportunity to upskill the agriculture sector in STEM subjects and digital literacy. "Agtech requires people with skills that are not traditionally connected to agriculture including engineers, software designers, data analysts, and business support services," the report states. Meanwhile, van Delden noted that the average age of Australian farmers is increasing -- currently, it's 57 years old. "This creates an opportunity for the large change in ownership and shift we are seeing to corporate farming where increasingly young technology-driven farmers are rushing into the sector," van Delden said. "The top farmers are seeing the need to embrace the opportunities IoT solutions can bring them to access and utilise the best data in their businesses faster. We are seeing interest from family offices and impact investors in agriculture and agtech businesses, as they can see the productivity gains and improved sustainability technology brings." He added that IoT highlights the need for collaboration across the agriculture and food processing supply chain. "Digitisation of landscape allows a whole-of-landscape decision-making process which enables decisions down to a square metre level or scaled up to a national level," van Delden said. "IoT means that knowledge will become common knowledge. Market dynamics will shift as a consequence of the supply chain getting access to insights on regional crop yields, infestations, and quality. This will change the speed of which agriculture commodity trade prices will move." Ben van Delden, partner and head of AgTech at KPMG Australia Image: KPMG An agricultural ecosystem A collaborative agricultural ecosystem is gradually forming. Food Agility, which raised AU$160 million and is seeking a further AU$50 million in public funding to be spent over 10 years, will be working with partners to build an ecosystem that connects all stakeholders along the value chain. The organisation is a major proponent of IoT and is particularly keen on creating a common knowledge base via open standard data platforms and data sharing mechanisms. "[Australia's] got excellent brand reputation internationally for high quality green food ... We believe the centre of excellence for food production is here in Australia and that's where we want to effectively grow the agricultural technology sector," Briers said. "For the food and agriculture sector to reach a higher level of maturity from a digital transformation perspective, you'll need to have a stable and reliable underlying measurement system." Innovation Central Sydney (ICS), an innovation centre focused on agriculture, is another example of various parties coming together to support the industry. Via ICS, Cisco, Data61, and the University of New South Wales, in partnership with the National Farmers' Federation, the NSW Farmers Association, the NSW Department of Primary Industries, and ATP Innovations, are identifying and developing new uses for IoT within the agriculture sector. Kavanagh said collaborative efforts, particularly between large enterprises and small niche providers, is becoming more and more commonplace in the world of IoT, citing The Yield as an example of what can be achieved when different parties come together to solve a problem. "The magic of it is it's a partnership between a small Australian company called The Yield, Microsoft, the Tasmanian government -- each bringing their unique elements of capability, but together providing this platform that solves a problem," Kavanagh said. Van Delden said IoT can and should make it more attractive for banks, private investors, and superannuation funds to finance the agriculture sector, which has historically struggled to attract sufficient domestic and foreign investment. According to the StartupAus and KPMG report, the Australian government provided AU$306 million of R&D support to agriculture between 2015 and 2016, of which AU$252 million was allocated to rural research programs. This represents 1.3 percent of gross farm receipts in 2015, compared with the US at 9.4 percent and the EU at 18.9 percent. The report also highlights that in 2015, 0.3 percent was invested in the agriculture sector by Australian superannuation funds. Like Canadian superannuation fund PSP Investments, which acquired a significant stake in agtech company Allflex Group, the report states that Australian superannuation funds have an opportunity to play a bigger role. "Growers (borrowers) will need to be open to lenders having access to more real-time insights on farm performance," van Delden said. "Financial institutions will need to think about how they can enable sharing of performance insights and analytics they collect to help their farming clients lift their performance." "For way too long, [farming has] been a human-oriented business, with a lot of guesswork involved. With technology, we can really help farmers produce more and be more profitable." — Kevin Bloch, CTO at Cisco ANZ While all state governments in Australia are supporting the agriculture industry to varying degrees by providing funding, driving collaboration efforts, supporting research, and building agtech solutions, the general consensus is that they can do more to encourage the advancement and adoption of IoT in the industry, particularly from a regulatory standpoint. "With food production now Australia's largest manufacturing sector there is good reason for government to support the technology adoption in this sector," van Delden said. "Key areas for government to support are in embracing regulation of landscape, farming practices, transport and logistics, biosecurity, and import and export requirements. Embracing an IoT-based risk management framework has significant potential to improve efficiency and profitability to the businesses involved in the food production supply chain. "Reimagining how we regulate food production and environmental compliance will help accelerate the uptake of agtech and IoT as well as give the consumer greater confidence in the provenance and food security environment that our produce has passed through to reach their plate." Van Delden added that regulation built around the capture and exchange of data from the paddock through to customs clearance can release significant speed and efficiency dividends through the supply chain. He also pointed to the need for data standards and the interoperability of devices so that stakeholders can have confidence in the quality of the data that is collected and how it is shared. At the moment, there is little clarity around data ownership such as whether farmers or technology vendors own the data that is being captured, stored, and shared. "Data ownership and use rights become more opaque in the event that the cloud storage or farm software facility transfers the data to a third party -- even in the event that such a transfer is permitted by the farmer whose land the data was originally generated," the AFI report states. "Ideally, data use and access permissions should 'travel' with the data, although whether this is legally enforceable by the original data owner is unclear, and the extent to which this applies to anonymised data is also unclear." Van Delden pointed out that as data moves through the supply chain, an additional challenge emerges around leverage. "As we know, knowledge is power, and in the supply chain context, this insight can change your negotiation leverage. Contractual arrangements are and will change significantly because of IoT," van Delden said. "Not simply due to technology like blockchain to enable the transaction, but in how yield optimisation dividends can be shared in the supply chain. Done right, this could and should be the opportunity for producers to pull more margin back inside the farm gate." While IoT is still a maturing field, with many technologies and information systems still undergoing development, most agree that agribusinesses can still secure productivity gains from adopting it even if it requires significant initial monetary and time outlays. The maturity of cloud from multiple vendors, coupled with the cost of sensors, routers and hardware coming down, means developing and deploying an IoT solution is easier now than it was as little as two years ago. "[The agriculture industry] can definitely do with some technology enablement," Bloch said. "For way too long, it's been a human-oriented business with a lot of guesswork involved. With technology, we can take a lot of the guesswork out of farming and really help farmers produce more and be more profitable. "I think the farming community really get that now."

Incumbents set to be challenged as mid-size vendors come into play. James Henderson (ARN) 02 February, 2017 12:25 - - - - print email Comments Over the next two years, the security market will expand more rapidly than in recent years, increasing nearly 12 per cent by 2018. After growing 11.5 per cent year-to-year in 2016, Technology Business Research findings paints a new picture for the security industry in the years ahead, with market incumbents set to be challenged by emerging vendors. Looking forward, the five largest security vendors - Symantec, Cisco, IBM, Check Point and Intel - will continue to innovate and acquire to sustain revenue growth over the next five years. However, each will control a smaller share of the market by 2021 as mid-size vendors play a larger role in customers’ evolving security strategies. Specifically, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Trend Micro, FireEye and Forcepoint are on track to expand respective shares of the security market. “In this growing market, vendor market shares will change,” Technology Business Research security practice lead, Jane Wright, observed. Such change will occur as market growth enters its highest in 2017 and 2018, triggered by significant economic and political changes. “This includes the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union as well as the evolving security requirements associated with the digital transformations underway in many organisations,” Wright explained. Consequently, overall worldwide revenue for security products and managed or premium security services sold to businesses, enterprises, the public sector and other non-consumer customers is forecast to increase by 11.7 per cent from 2016 to 2021.

As a result, many organisations plan to increase security spending over the next five years, driving the market’s growth from $US49.4 billion in 2016 to $US85.7 billion by 2021.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Tested: the truth behind the MacBook Pro’s ‘terrible’ battery life GordonMahUng 2 February, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Read professional reviews of Apple’s new MacBook Pro lineup, and you’ll come away thinking the new laptops have great battery life. Dive into a customer forum, though, and the upshot will be exactly the opposite: the new MacBook Pros have ‘piss poor’ battery life. That characterisation came from user yillbs on MacRumors.com. “I don’t think anyone can convince me that this thing isn’t just flat out the worst battery life ever on a MacBook,” yillbs wrote, clearly frustrated. “I’ve been defending it like mad, but at this point… how can you? 4.42 hours is just bad.” User Happypuppy was anything but. “Not happy with the battery either. I was editing my MacBook review video last night and at 6.28pm it was at 100 percent,” Happypuppy wrote. “At 8.52pm it was down to about 42 percent.” Contrast those writeups with Macworld’s review, which said: “Battery life is also solid, with both models lasting a full day of heavy use, with multiple apps open, dozens of Safari tabs, streaming music to Spotify and occasionally indulging in some video viewing with Sierra’s picture-in-picture feature.” Macworld isn’t alone. From Laptopmag to The Verge and Notebookcheck.net, the vast majority of reviewers have lauded the MacBook Pros for good battery life. My own tests agreed. I’m no fan of the MacBook Pro’s butterfly-switch keyboard, nor its lack of USB Type A ports, but one thing I do know is it has relatively good battery life. When I tested both a non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and the base 15in MacBook Pro some months ago, I was able to coax about nine hours of 4K video playback from each at 255 nits of brightness. A search for the truth The truth about the MacBook Pro’s battery life had to be somewhere in this mess of conflicting results. I returned to the MacBook Pro 15 I’d tested before to put it through multiple run-down scenarios, charging and discharging the MacBook Pro 15 under different loads over the course of many days. This particular MacBook Pro 15 is the baseline model with a Core i7-6700HQ, Radeon Pro 450, 16GB of LPDDR3/2133 RAM, and 256GB of flash storage. The OS I used in the majority of these tests was the latest public one available when I started my testing: macOS Sierra 10.12.2. I disabled automatic screen dimming and manually calibrated brightness using our Minolta photometer for each of the brightness settings I used. You’d typically run these tests multiple times to calculate an average to reduce variability. Given the considerable time it takes to perform individual run-down tests, I went with a more casual single-run scenario. Video playback is still great For the first test, I ran the open-source 4K movie Tears of Steel. The actual video player you use can have a huge impact on battery life (you can read more on this topic here), so I opted to use Apple’s QuickTime player. Apple’s official video run-down test uses iTunes, but I’ve never figured out how the company is able to get the video to loop for its tests. The video was looped with the Wi-Fi switched off and audio on. Rather than the laptop’s speakers, I used earbuds to (theoretically) reduce the power drain from driving the larger speakers. The brightness settings I used were at a fairly dim 100 nits, a fairly bright 257 nits (which is a good setting for an office or home in the daytime) and, finally, the laptop’s maximum brightness setting of 500 nits. The MacBook Pro 15 has pretty stellar life playing video. Set to 257 nits, we’re seeing just about eight hours of battery life. Even more impressive to me is that at the blazing 500-nit setting, you can still get six hours of run time. Considering the 2880-by-1800 native resolution and brightness of the panel, that’s actually pretty nice. There’s one more result on the chart to be aware of, and that’s the battery life when none of the laptop’s USB-C ports are being used. For all the other tests, I used a self-powered device that logs the voltage of the USB port. This lets us know when the laptop is on, and when it finally dies. This device works because on older MacBook Pros and most other laptops, the USB Type A ports are run on chips that are usually powered on at all times. The MacBook Pro, however, uses Thunderbolt 3 controllers. With Thunderbolt 3, the chip appears to conserve power by switching off when not being used. With our USB device in place, however, the Thunderbolt 3 chip appears to stay awake. The laptop itself did not log any power being consumed by the Thunderbolt port, but the results pretty much match the consumption I’ve seen on another couple of laptops, so I think there’s still a small cost in power. The upshot: if you run a USB device on your MacBook Pro, you’ll take a small hit. If you refrain from doing that, then you’ll probably get slightly longer battery life. Streaming video playback Most video today is watched online, not offline. Using a brightness setting of 257 nits, I flipped on the Wi-Fi and measured how long it took to run down the MacBook Pro 15 on YouTube and Netflix. For YouTube, I picked a 24-hour Nyan Cat video that’s pretty low-res. I don’t get Nyan Cat, but apparently it’s a thing. It’s also a 24-hour video, so there wasn’t a chance it would stop in the middle of the night and invalidate my test. Rather than pick a video on Netflix and try to rewind it every few hours, or try to binge-watch a show (which can be unreliable, as the video will occasionally stop streaming), I decided to use Netflix’s internal test video called Example 8 hour 23.976. I intentionally forced the video bit rate to the 4870 option. Audio was on for both, and I used a set of earbuds. The results look good. The YouTube video ran for just under nine hours, while the Netflix video was just short of eight hours. Battery life under hard use: this is the tricky part When you’re looking at this category of laptop, however, you shouldn’t expect people to limit their chores to light duty. It is a ‘pro’ laptop, right? One thing I don’t think people understand is just how much of a penalty you pay when you push the GPU or CPU very hard. To find out, I ran two tests. The first used the game Tomb Raider. I set the game for 1680 x 1050 resolution on the medium setting and ran the game’s built-in benchmark. Once the benchmark is finished, it continues to loop a 3D scene. I then unplugged the MacBook Pro 15 and let it run down to zero. This particular test is mostly a load on the GPU, but the CPU is working as well. After recharging the laptop, I ran the test using Prime95, which is a pure CPU test. I used the Torture Test Blended mode and manually recorded when the laptop died. Both tasks emptied the battery in just over 80 minutes. You can see how drastic the battery situation gets depending on how hard you push it. Drive it hard, and you’ll be lucky to get an hour or so out of it. The point of these two tests is to address the people who say they ‘just did a little video editing’ or some other intensive tasks for a ‘short time’ before the battery ran down. Look at this chart and then think about your mix of work. A short time is all you should really expect if the task really pushes that CPU or GPU. On intensive tasks, the only way to get longer life is use a larger battery (more on that below.) There was, indeed, a bug In looking at other battery run-down scenarios, I ran smack into a problem that’s likely at fault for many of the confusing battery life issues with the laptop, at least in macOS Sierra 10.12.2. On occasion, the laptop’s discrete GPU would just get stuck on and consume power even when it wasn’t used. Others had reported this too, but you’d really have to stumble onto it. I was able to reproduce the issue in Safari by opening Google Maps, which would cause the laptop to switch over to the GPU for the WebGL workload. Opening additional browser tabs and then closing the Google Maps tab would, on occasion, leave the GPU consuming up to 10 watts of power while doing absolutely nothing. You can see from this screenshot of the 2016 MacBook Pro 15 running Sierra 10.12.2 that the discrete GPU is consuming power even though the laptop has switched over to integrated graphics. That power drain would occur sometimes even after we quit Safari. Even though the MacBook Pro 15 had switched back to Intel graphics, the Radeon Pro would just suck up power. How much? I found after triggering this bug that I could kill the laptop in just 206 minutes, or a scant three and a half hours of basically idling with Safari open, Wi-Fi on and eight websites loaded. This isn’t just a blame-discrete-graphics moment, either. I performed an idle test with Safari open to Google Maps. This switched on the Radeon Pro, which would consume about 5 watts just idling. With Wi-Fi on and the screen set to 257 nits – but essentially nothing happening – the battery stretched out to 1135 minutes, or just shy of 19 hours. This particular power drain isn’t completely the fault of the Radeon Pro. I suspect this to be the cause of many of the problems people are reporting. What Apple fixed The Sierra 10.12.3 update seems to have fixed the problem. Apple officially says the update “improves automatic graphics switching on the MacBook Pro 15,” and it does. I could no longer get the Radeon Pro to consume phantom power. It’s as though Apple basically increased the graphics load requirement before firing up the power-hungry GPU. Google Maps and even more intensive WebGL tasks would no longer fire up the Radeon Pro at all. Most of the time you really don’t need it, as the Intel IGP is generally more than enough for web graphics. I tested the updated OS running the same task that earlier gave me the horrible 206 minutes of battery life under Sierra 10.12.2. The battery life stretched out to 631 minutes under Sierra 10.12.3. Interestingly, I never initiated the developer mode that Consumer Reports did when it initially held back on recommending the MacBook Pros to consumers. Consumer Reports’ tests found the battery life to be all over the map and attributed it to the developer mode it used in its browser test. Once Apple patched the OS, Consumer Reports reversed its decision. Those fixes eventually went into the final release of Sierra 10.12.3, but it’s not clear to me what exactly happened in the situation that Consumer Reports ran into. The smaller battery is clearly a limitation If you think the battery life situation (at least on the MacBook Pro 15) is solved, there’s something else you should consider that can’t be fixed in software: the smaller battery. Prior to the 2016 MacBook Pro 15, Apple shoved giant 99.5-watt-hour batteries into the MacBook Pro 15 series. With the thinner, lighter late-2016 model, Apple reduced the size of the battery by almost 25 percent to 76 watt-hours. This downsizing has a real cost. While the new MacBook Pro 15 is impressively efficient, sometimes efficiency isn’t enough. If you think of cars, many factors contribute to the driving range between refuelling, including the size of the gas tank, how aerodynamic the car is, and how efficient the engine and transmission are. On a laptop, the battery capacity, measured in watt-hours, is akin to the fuel tank. The power efficiency of the CPU, GPU, and components could be the engine and transmission efficiency. The amount of power the display uses could be the aerodynamics. Seen through our FLIR thermal viewer, you can see the older 2013 MacBook Pro 15 (left) or the new 2016 MacBook Pro 15 (right) getting toasty when their CPUs are pushed hard. As you saw from the previous numbers, the general efficiency of the display, CPU, GPU and other system components on the 2016 MacBook Pro 15 are actually quite good. It also compares quite favourably with older systems. To illustrate this, I grabbed a MacBook Pro 15 circa 2013. This laptop was built with a quad-core Ivy Bridge Core i7-3635QM and GeForce GT 650M graphics. It has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This older MacBook Pro 15 also features the largest battery allowed by law onto a plane – 99.5 watt hours. Despite its age, the battery itself was in good shape, with fewer than 10 discharge cycles on it and a health report of 99 percent. A clean install of macOS Sierra 10.12.1 was used before testing. First came our 4K video run test at a brightness of 255 nits, Wi-Fi off and our USB data logger in place. I should note that this model doesn’t have a Thunderbolt 3 chip, so there’s no power cost from having a USB device plugged in. Even with its larger 99.5-watt-hour battery, the 2013 MacBook Pro 15 tapped out at only 330 minutes, which is well south of six hours. Compare that to the 2016 MacBook Pro, which, with its 25-percent-smaller battery, made it all the way to 474 minutes, or almost two hours more run time. During video playback, both used the integrated Intel graphics and were mostly idling. The 2013 MacBook Pro 15 consumed about 18 watts, while the 2016 MacBook Pro 15 used about 13 watts. The other factor in fuel mileage is how hard you drive it. No matter how efficient the engine is or how aerodynamic the car, sometimes having a larger fuel tank matters more. To prove this point, I tasked the 2013 MacBook Pro with the same Prime95 torture test as the 2016 model. This test, if you recall, basically pushes all cores of the CPU as hard as possible. In car terms, it would be like flooring it fully loaded with passengers and luggage while going up a mountain. You’re burning a lot of fuel. The older 2013 MacBook Pro has that in spades with its 99.5-watt-hour battery. It was able to run flat-out for 97 minutes before dying. The newer 2016 MacBook Pro, as efficient as it is, can’t push the CPU that hard for that long before emptying its 74-watt-hour battery at 83 minutes. Increasing the battery capacity by 25 percent may not yield exactly 25 percent more battery life, but it would certainly last longer than it does now under heavy-duty loads. Those who actually use their MacBook Pro 15 in heavier tasks on battery may indeed experience shorter run times than with older models, especially if their point of reference is a more recent and more efficient Haswell- or Broadwell-based model. And the tests say: your mileage will vary After all that battery testing, there are several takeaways: The 2016 MacBook Pro 15 did indeed have a bug that would sometimes cut short battery life. Apple appears to have corrected the problem. I found that plugging the MacBook Pro 15 into an external monitor engaged the discrete GPU full-time at a cost of nine watts. While it’s unlikely you’d be at a desk using an external monitor without being plugged into AC, if you do, expect poor battery life. The newer MacBook Pro 15’s 500-nit screen is brighter. If you’re comparing it to an older MacBook Pro 15, use the same brightness settings to make the comparison fair. As reviewers originally found, the MacBook Pro 15 still has pretty decent life for a notebook in its class. Eight to nine hours of video playback at 257 nits on a quad-core equipped laptop with discrete graphics is very respectable. Comparable Windows laptops I’ve seen with quad-core CPUs, 4K screens, and discrete graphics generally offer worse battery life. Apple may have compromised too much by putting a smaller battery in the MacBook Pro 15. It’s clear from the testing on the older Ivy Bridge MacBook Pro 15 and the newest MacBook Pro 15 that the 76-watt-hour battery can yield shorter battery life on heavier loads. How much battery life should you expect? Well, as the tests here show, depending on what you’re doing, the answer is anywhere from an hour and a half to 18 hours. Not satisfied with that answer? Unfortunately, it’s the only correct one, as battery life on any laptop will vary depending on what you do.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe by Camilla Dahlen, Head of ISV, SAP Changing a corporate culture doesn’t happen overnight, but fair hiring practices are an excellent start toward embracing diversity -- and attracting the best talent. More than two-thirds (67 percent) of active and passive job seekers rank a diverse workforce as a critical factor in evaluating potential employers and job offers, according to Glassdoor. That percentage is even higher with younger the job seekers. And that tells us that the up-and-coming workforce is actively searching for employers with a strong message and track record in diversity and inclusion. Finding a “Values Fit” Organizations that want to attract the best talent and reap the benefits of a diverse workforce -- according to Sarah Pollock, head of Marketing for ClearCompany’s Talent Management Software -- should integrate some (or all) of these tactics: Increase your company’s diversity branding on career pages, including a diversity mission statement, relevant imagery and awards given by reputable organizations Breed a culture of diversity within your organization by providing a variety of training outlets Drive diversity initiatives with full leadership support and reinforcement to show that diversity is valued throughout the business By training gender-diverse hiring panels to avoid bias, Atlassian got more than half of its female employees to participate in its graduate program. Panel training shifted the focus from “culture fit” to “values fit,” allowing the software vendor to hire people who share goals, as opposed to specific viewpoints or backgrounds, according to Atlassian’s global head of diversity and inclusion. Large companies have also acknowledged the importance of diversity. Intel, for one, announced plans to invest US$300 million over the next five years in its diversity in technology initiative, which aims to bring a workforce that fully represents the global demographic by 2020. Technology’s Increasing Role It’s becoming more popular for organizations to analyze and curate data in order to measure and improve hiring. Cloud solutions help to store large amounts of data, analyze it faster and produce quicker results, such as objective candidate scores from résumé data to determine and rate candidates before the interview stage. Diversity statistics from companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter revealed that they needed to make a greater effort to remove unconscious bias in the workplace, according to Fast Company. And a new group of small start-up companies that are delivering new technologies to support diversity initiatives to the market. Organizations can also use technology to scan work samples, parse social media and analyze facial expressions during interviews, for a fuller picture of the candidate beyond his or her gender. The future lies in measuring impact skills, such as grit, curiosity and other personal attributes, and then comparing these to top talent. Artificial intelligence can also be used to check for specific skills administering “blind auditions” by using bots. The KORE bots platform, for instance, can conduct conversations with applicants before engaging in face-to-face interviews, filtering candidates without bias. Strategies for Diverse Hiring Practices Most U.S. firms “promote the idea of diversity, but the problem lies in making it workable, which means to guarantee that every single hired employee feels welcomed in the firm and is given the same promotion chances as others to higher levels as far as his/her abilities allow,” an Equal Opportunity article stated. This is a particularly difficult subject to tackle, according to a recent article in the WSJ, considering that companies are less likely to take a chance on promoting a woman over a man. One-fifth of large U.S. employers with diversity programs now provide unconscious-bias training, according to Margaret Regan, head of the global diversity consultancy FutureWork Institute. Implementing a technology platform that integrates with an HR system -- alongside training and education -- can also increase hiring efficiency and help manage every step of the hiring process. For example, SAP’s Diversity and Inclusion Customer Advisory Group looks for new ways that the cloud company can use technology to drive innovation while supporting inclusiveness, such as its efforts in hiring autistic people. Competition for talent in the labor market is fierce, making it even more important to invest in training, tools and technology to support your hiring and retention of a diverse employee base. This cultural transformation doesn’t happen overnight, but it is critical to exhibiting customer empathy -- and fostering a greater sense of purpose for the hours spent in the workplace.

REED SAXON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The entrance to the Walt Disney Corp. office and studio complex in Burbank. REED SAXON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By BLOOMBERG Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Walt Disney Co. agreed to pay $100 million to resolve claims it colluded with other animation studios to not hire one another’s workers in California, where allegations of no-poaching pacts have plagued technology companies for the better part of a decade. Disney and three of its units are the last remaining defendants in a class-action lawsuit alleging the studios conspired to suppress wages through a “gentleman’s agreement” to not recruit each other’s workers. Attorneys for Disney and employees submitted a court filing Tuesday seeking approval of their settlement. Comcast Corp.’s DreamWorks Animation SKG previously agreed to a $50 million settlement, while two Sony Pictures units and Blue Sky Studios reached deals totaling $19 million. Apple Inc., Google, Intel Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. paid $415 million in 2015 to resolve their part in a similar case that was brought against Silicon Valley technology companies that had been investigated for collusion by the U.S. Justice Department. Orly Lobel, a law professor at the University of San Diego, predicted Disney’s settlement will win approval because it satisfies requirements the agreement is fair, reasonable and adequate. “Given that this was the last holdout, there are already proxies of what should be the lump sum and it seems within the range," Lobel said. A $100 million settlement for one large company is proportional to the $415 million agreed to by several technology giants in the previous case, and the much smaller earlier settlements, she said. A Disney spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a call after regular business hours seeking comment on the agreement.

Some of the stories are familiar: Many people know Steve Jobs' biological father was a native Syrian (Jobs was adopted as an infant by a California family), and that Google co-founder Sergey Brin's Jewish parents left Russia in 1979 to escape religious persecution. Even two technology scions who reportedly have Donald Trump's ear, Tesla founder Elon Musk and billionaire investor Peter Thiel, were born in other countries (South Africa and Germany, respectively). But people might be less familiar with others: "My mother was undocumented. No mom, no @Reddit," Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian tweeted on Sunday. Yes. My mother was undocumented. No mom, no @Reddit. https://t.co/ItkOOvIxSg— Alexis Ohanian (@alexisohanian) January 30, 2017 Intel co-founder Andy Grove came to the U.S. after fleeing political upheaval in Hungary as a young man. In his memoir, he wrote, "[M]any young people were killed; countless others were interned. Some two hundred thousand Hungarians escaped to the West. I was one of them." Last March, the National Foundation for American policy found that immigrants founded 44 of the 87 start-up "unicorns" valued at $1 billion or higher. Altogether, the value of those companies is $168 billion. On average, each of these billion-dollar start-ups has created 700 jobs, although some are much higher, such as Musk's 4,000 SpaceX employees. Musk, a member of two advisory councils in the Trump administration, on Saturday tweeted his distaste for the immigration plan. The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 He also said he would speak to the president about the possibility of modifying the measure — but noted there was "no possibility of retraction." Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President. https://t.co/qLpbsP4lEk— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 According to a 2011 analysis conducted by the Partnership for a New American Economy, 18 of the companies in Fortune's Top 100 in 2010 had founders born outside the U.S., and that doesn't even count the ones like Apple that were founded by first-generation Americans. In total, 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants. Today, the number of immigrant-founded companies on the Fortune 100 is up to 19, and runs the gamut of industries, from pharmaceuticals to telecommunications to retail. "We must do more to welcome the next generation of entrepreneurs," the group said in its report. "For years, America has loomed largest in the minds of the most enterprising individuals around the world. But as the global marketplace evolves, we cannot count on remaining their top choice." These are the companies, along with their rankings in the current Fortune 100, that were founded by immigrants. 10: AT&T Alexander Graham Bell, Scotland 11: General Electric Elihu Thomson, England 12: AmerisourceBergen Lucien Brunswig, France 13: Verizon Alexander Graham Bell, Scotland 34: Procter & Gamble William Procter, England; James Gamble, Ireland 36: Alphabet Sergey Brin, Russia 37: Comcast Daniel Aaron, Germany 45: United Technologies Igor Sikorski, Russia 51: Intel Andy Grove, Hungary 55: Pfizer Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart, Germany 64: Ingram Micro Geza Czige, Hungary 72: Merck Theodore Weicker, Germany 75: Honeywell International Albert Butz, Switzerland 79: Cigna John Nesbitt, Ireland 82: TIAA Andrew Carnegie, Scotland 83: INTL FCStone Saul Stone, Russia 88: General Dynamics John Philip Holland, Ireland 89: TJX Companies Max Feldberg and Morris Feldberg, Russia 95: Exelon Samuel Insull, England Martha C.

The chip, which went into development last year, is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard's Touch Bar feature, the people said. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer's low-power mode functionality, they said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private product development. It's built using ARM Holdings Plc. technology and will work alongside an Intel processor. And before you know it, you have a MacBook ARM.

(The Associated Press) Print Email The Seattle Times By The Seattle Times The Oregonian on February 02, 2017 at 9:05 PM, updated February 02, 2017 at 9:34 PM comments SEATTLE -- Microsoft on Thursday asked the U.S. government to carve out exceptions to President Donald Trump's U.S. entry ban for people with visas sponsored by companies or academic institutions. In a letter sent to the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said people on work and student visas have already gone through a rigorous vetting process. Smith proposed that, in cases of family emergencies or business travel, they should be allowed to travel abroad and re-enter the U.S. "These are not people trying to avoid detection," Smith said in the letter, addressed to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. "Rather, these individuals are 'known quantities' in their communities: their character, personalities, conduct, and behavior is well recognized and understood by their employers, colleagues, friends, and neighbors." Trump's executive order, signed last Friday, set a 90-day ban on entry into the U.S. for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, and set a 120-day halt on entry for all refugees. It sparked protests nationwide and drew opposition from a wide range of civil liberties groups, companies and academic institutions. Microsoft called the move a "fundamental step backwards" that endangered the country's values and reputation. In Smith's request Thursday, he highlighted some of the hardships presented to Microsoft employees caught up in the order. One woman who has accepted a job offer in the U.S. has been unable to enter the country. Some employees have been separated from spouses, and at least one is confronted with the choice of visiting a dying parent overseas and perhaps not being allowed to return. Other large companies have voiced dismay over the ban. Intel's Brian Krzanich and Nike's Mark Parker were among several high-profile chief executives to issue statements condemning the order. Microsoft's request asked that holders of temporary work or student visas, and their visa-holding immediate family members, be allowed to travel abroad for up to two weeks on business trips, or to address family emergencies. In a blog post, Smith said Microsoft's request wasn't the end of the company's involvement in the debate around the executive order. "But even amidst these debates, there is an opportunity under the executive order to address the pressing needs of real people," Smith said. - The Seattle Times Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Your Mutual Funds May Have Bets On Super Bowl Advertisers 3 February 2017Military News Shutterstock photo As you sit back on Sunday to enjoy the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons are not the only teams you could have a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you may have a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza. More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that are running ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which is expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the National Football League’s championship game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well. Advertisers range from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev ( BUD ), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler ( DDAIF ), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com ( WIX ). IBD’S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving. Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game include $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund ( FCNTX ), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America ( AIVSX ), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX). Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX). Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that are slated, according to superbowlcommercials.co, to advertise on television during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria’s Secret (LB) and Wix.com. Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares. Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform. Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler’s ADRs.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | February 1, 2017 -- 20:34 GMT (12:34 PST) | Topic: Networking AT&T announced on Wednesday that it's rolling out so-called 5G "evolution markets" in Austin and Indianapolis this summer, as part of a broader push to upgrade its networks. This showcase markets will start out with theoretical peak speeds of 400Mbps. That's five times faster than what AT&T currently offers in terms of wireless connectivity, AT&T CTO Andre Fuetsch noted at an event in San Francisco, Calif., on Wednesday. However, it doesn't meet the typical standard for 5G, which is supposed to reach 1Gbps. AT&T said it expects to enable theoretical peak speeds of up to 1Gbps in some areas by the end of the year. Additionally, the company announced it's building two new 5G testbeds that will go on-air this spring at the AT&T Labs in Austin. This comes on the heels of the 5G network test AT&T launched at Intel's Austin office last year. The new testbeds will support the 5G trial it's starting for DirecTV NOW customers in Austin, Texas. They include dedicated 5G outdoor and indoor test locations and will feature flexible infrastructure, allowing for updates as 5G standards develop. AT&T announced its 5G developments as part of "Indigo" -- its plan to upgrade and enhance its networks with 5G capabilities, software-defined networking, big data, AI, and improved security. As part of its Indigo rollout, AT&T also announced that its new goal of hitting 55-percent network virtualization by the end of 2017. The company has already converted 34 percent of its network functionality to SDN and is on track to hit 75 percent by 2020. Additionally, AT&T announced that ECOMP, the orchestration platform created to power its software-defined network, will be part of an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation. Special Feature Next Generation Networks The rising tides of big data, video, and cloud computing are driving tremendous demand for faster and more efficient networks. We delve into how things like software-defined networks (SDN) and new wireless technologies are enabling business transformation.

AMD shares have risen 18 percent in two days after the semiconductor maker reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | February 2, 2017 at 4:22 pm Top of the Order: Did You Blink?: A company whose name is known throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area reported quarterly results this week that were better than most had expected. As a result, it came away with a new sense of enthusiasm about its prospects, and investors threw their faith, and money, at the company’s shares. Oh? Did you think I was talking about Apple? Well, surprise, that was yesterday. Today, I’m talking about Advanced Micro Devices. Related Articles Biz Break: Apple investors buy what the company is selling Facebook’s mobile ad dollars help fuel growth in fourth quarter Biz Break: Ordering vocally, and remotely, comes to Starbucks apps Lyft gets a lift on the charts at Uber’s expense IPhones, services to take spotlight in Apple’s earnings No one would blame you for skipping past AMD. After all, the chipmaker reported its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday at right about the same time as Apple. Whether you like it or not, Apple is like an aircraft carrier projecting muscle and power as its plows through the sea. AMD, unfortunately, was like a little dinghy that, in the minds of many, got knocked out of the water in Apple’s wake when both companies delivered their quarterly reports the other day. Which was a shame. Because AMD had a pretty good last three months of 2016. Sure, AMD reported a loss of a penny a share, but that was better than the two-cents-a share loss that Wall Street expected. And its sales of $1.11 billion also topped analysts’ forecasts of $1.07 billion in revenue. During the same period in 2015, AMD had lost 10 cents a share on sales of $958 million. And while Apple’s report was good enough to give its stock price a boost of more than 6 percent over the last two days, that gain looks like a pittance compared to AMD’s increase of more than 18 percent in the two trading sessions since the company released its results. By the time the stock market closed Thursday, AMD shares had reached $12.28. “We are well positioned and on track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade,” said AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su. Graphics and high-end server chips have proven to be AMD’s savior, and have given the company a new lease on business after years of trailing Intel in the PC market. And you’ve got to give AMD some props for creativity with names like Ryzen, Vega and Zen for its newest semiconductor products. Expectations for those chipsets have AMD forecasting the midpoint of its first-quarter revenue range to be 18 percent higher than the $832 million it reported a year ago. The company’s first-quarter sales are historically less than its fourth-quarter revenue, so a sequential decrease in sales is common. And it seems like AMD’s upbeat business performances are becoming more common, too. Middle Innings: The Check May Be In The Mail: Are you a T-Mobile customer? Good. Keep your eye on your mailbox, because you might have some dough coming your way, courtesy of the Federal Trade Commission’s efforts. The FTC said it will be returning almost $20 million worth of new refunds to T-Mobile customers who were hit with third-party charges on their bills. The refunds are part of a settlement between T-Mobile and the FTC that dates back to 2014. Under that settlement, T-Mobile agreed to completely refund any unwarranted third-party charges to customers who applied for refunds. It also said it would give the FTC up to $90 million in remaining funds that weren’t sent out under the original order. The FTC will send checks to T-Mobile customers who didn’t join in the company’s refund program. Approximately 617,000 T-Mobile customers are in for refunds that will average $32 per payout. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Thursday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Cadence Design Systems, Ultratech, InvenSense, Extreme Networks and GoPro. In the Red: Decliners included Shutterfly, Power Integrations, Harmonic, Gigamon and A10 Networks. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 0.1 percent to 5,636.20 The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 0.03 percent to 19,884.91. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index edged up by 0.1 percent to 2,280.85. Quote of the Day: “The Free Speech Movement started here and now we can’t let certain people speak?

Some of the policies are likely to clash with priorities of the Trump Administration, which has yet to state plans or make appointments specific to the tech sector. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) released an eight-point policy plan calling for lower taxes and expanded investments in chip-related research in universities and federal agencies. It also called for “balanced reforms to reduce abusive patent litigation and increased protection of trade secrets” and tougher enforcement to protect chip makers from counterfeiting. Some measures in the plan may put the industry into conflict with President Trump’s stated views. The SIA called for “robust international trade.” It has supported free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Trump recently abandoned with an executive order. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he would renegotiate all trade deals, and since the election has come down hard on U.S. companies manufacturing overseas, a widespread practice in semiconductors and electronics generally. The trade group also supported an early January report recommending a tougher stance against China for heavy government funding of its semiconductor sector. The report, issued under the Obama Administration, was taken offline by the incoming Trump Administration along with all references to the President’s science and technology advisory group and the White House Office of Science and Technology. An SIA spokesman said it is not unusual for an incoming president to release advisors of the former administration. Shortly after the November election, Trump organized a meeting of a dozen tech executives including the chief executives of Intel and Apple. He also created a business advisory group that includes chief executives of GE and Tesla, however he has yet to create an organization to address science and technology policies. The SIA also called for “policies that attract and retain high-skilled [STEM] workers.” Traditionally it has favored raising or lifting caps on the H-1B program, specifically. Last week, Trump took the first steps toward enacting the tough stance on immigration he took on the campaign trail. He signed executive orders temporarily banning immigration of refugees from Syria and seven other predominantly Muslim countries and calling for the start of a wall on the U.S-Mexico border. He also signaled he will review the H-1B program. The policies come as global semiconductor sales hit $338.9 billion last year, up 1.1% from 2015 and an historic high. Fourth quarter sales reached $93.0 billion, up 12.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015 according to numbers compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics group. The modest increase over the 2015 total represented a significant comeback for the chip industry after most market watchers—including the SIA—;had predicted that sales would decline for the year. Logic was the largest segment at $91.5 billion, 27 percent of the total, followed by memory at $76.8 billion. Sensors and actuators made up the fastest growing segment, increasing 22.7 percent. Geographically China was the largest growth market up 9.2 percent followed by Japan at 3.8 percent) with all other markets down from -1.7 to 4.7 percent). Looking ahead, analysts expect 2017 will be return to historic trends with growth at about five percent. “We expect modest growth to continue in 2017 and beyond,” said John Neuffer, chief executive of the SIA in a statement. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Trump Win Roils Technology Sector Trump Needs to Embrace Industrial Revolution Dizzying Heights of Trump Tower Trump, Brexit Cloud Upbeat 2017 Email This Print Comment More Related Links UMC to Start 14nm Shipments in Q1 Q'comm-NXP Faces Trump, China Hurdles Virtual Reality Market To Grow When Hardware & Content Cost Less MediaTek Expects Slow Q1 Growth Samsung Expects Strong Memory Sales in '17 Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

The rising security breaches targeted on enterprises, increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, and improved return on investments are the main driving forces behind increased adoption of incident response services. With the rapid advancement in technology, there has been an increase in the usage of digital solutions, connected devices, and IT systems. This usage of technology attracts hackers to gain access to confidential customers and company data for their personal benefit. Due to the rise in the number of security breaches targeting business applications and data, organizations across the world are deploying cyber security solutions and adopting incident response services to recover the loss at a faster pace. However, the shortage of technical expertise and lack of awareness regarding advice threats are restricting the growth of the incident response services market. "Information Technology-Enabled Services industry is expected to gain the maximum traction during the forecast period" The Information Technology-Enabled Services (ITES) vertical is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The increased integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into the different processes of industries, governments, families, and consumers, along with the rising sophistication levels of cyber-attacks, have led the IT and telecom sector to focus more on their cyber security activities as well as services that can respond quickly to such incidents. "North America is expected to have the largest market share" In terms of market size, North America is estimated to hold the largest share in the overall incident response services market in 2016. The region, including the U.S. and Canada, has shown increased investments in the market, and a number of vendors have evolved to cater to the rapidly growing incident response services market. Considerable growth is expected in the region during the forecast period. Asia-Pacific (APAC) is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

(NASDAQ:MSDI) Tapping into Fast-Growing VR Market with High-Performance Cameras, Headsets Monster Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSDI) Tapping into Fast-Growing VR Market with High-Performance Cameras, Headsets New York, New York, 08:30 EST Feb 02, 2017 (NetworkNewsWire) – Until recently, virtual reality was typically the stuff of science fiction, a concept so innovative and unusual that it seemed highly unlikely to become reality anytime soon. For years, the concept remained almost exclusively tied to the futuristic images depicted by movies such as TRON or The Lawnmower Man. However, with rapid technological advancements in recent years, and due to the efforts of companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), with its Oculus VR, and Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE), with its PlayStation VR, virtual reality has now become a part of our day-to-day lives, already having multiple applications in a number of industries, from health care to manufacturing, education, music, athletics and more. Estimated to reach $126 billion by 2020, this fast developing market presents numerous growth opportunities for developers of VR products, apps and accessories. Simi Valley, CA-based Monster Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:MSDI), a highly versatile designer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art consumer electronics and related products, has already seized the opportunity with its exclusive line of virtual reality products that includes high definition cameras and headsets, all designed and commercialized under its own brand.

The Monster Digital™ VR cameras allow users to record their adventures in a new way and to then share them with their friends and family or experience them from an entirely new perspective due to the 360-degree viewing capabilities. In addition to VR products, the company also manufactures and commercializes a line of premium action sports cameras such as the high resolution Monster Digital™ Vision Plus 1080p+ camera and the more cost-competitive 720p action sports camera. Most of these models were on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January. Monster Digital also offers advanced data storage and memory products for use in mobile devices, cameras, tablets and more.

(Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) 84 Lumber’s revised Super Bowl ad is online now. It’s called The Journey Begins and follows a Mexican woman and her daughter as they pack their belongings for a trip. Then they join others on a journey over fields and streams and railroad tracks. The 90-second ad ends with mother and daughter holding hands. Onscreen instructions ask viewers to “See the conclusion at Journey84.com.” That’s where the rest of the story from the original ad will appear, including imagery of a border wall that the company says was rejected by FOX. The revised ad will air just before halftime and the online conclusion becomes available then. “This ad serves as the launch pad for 84 Lumber’s 2017 recruitment campaign,” writes Michael Brunner in an email to USA TODAY Sports. “We’re lucky to have a client who is not only unafraid of investing in a 90-second Super Bowl spot, but also willing to push the creative envelope. Sometimes you need to take a stance if you want to make an impact with your target audience. But in the process, you may also create detractors.” Brunner, who is chairman and CEO of the agency that produced the ad, says brands have to think long and hard if they want to take sides in today’s politically charged environment. “I don't think that means we should stay away from anything controversial, though,” he writes. “If everyone else is playing it safe, those that take a risk have an opportunity to stand out even more. We believe if a client is sharing a genuine message they’re passionate about, the risk is usually worth the reward.” CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Honda | 1:00 Yearbook photos of celebrities such as Steve Carell, Tina Fey, and Magic Johnson come to life in this ad, a celebration of the 20th birthday of the Honda CR-V. 1 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: T-Mobile | 1:00 Justin Bieber, Rob Gronkowski, and Terrell Owens take us through the history of the touchdown dance. 2 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Bud Light | 1:31 Bud Light Icon Spuds MacKenzie returns in the new Super Bowl Ad as a man's best friend to show that it was never about the parties, but friendships made along the way. 3 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Top Games | 0:30 Actors Aaron Eckhart, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Fan Bingbing star in "The Battle of Evony" a short movie promoting the mobile game Evony: The King’s Return. 4 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Audi | 1:00 Audi's Super Bowl ad, featuring a man watching her daughter win on the race track, advocates for equal pay. 5 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Sprint | 0:30 A man fakes his own death to get out of his Verizon contract before being convinced to switch to Sprint. 6 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Nintendo | 0:30 Nintendo introduces the new Switch console with clips from the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 7 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Wonderful Pistachios | 0:15 Ernie the Elephant, voiced by WWE star John Cena, discovers the benefits of Wonderful Pistachios. 8 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Ford | 1:43 Narrated by actor Bryan Cranston, Ford's Super Bowl LI ad focuses on the automaker's future plans. 9 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Squarespace | 0:30 Actor John Malkovich struggles to secure the domain name JohnMalkovich.com in Squarespace's new ad. 10 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: King's Hawaiian | 0:30 A man trying to stash away his King's Hawaiian rolls chooses a hiding place that isn't as secret as he thinks it is. 11 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: LIFEWTR | 0:30 John Legend and PepsiCo's new LIFEWTR bottled water brings color to a drab world. 12 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Kia | 0:00 With the help of the new hybrid Kia Niro, actress Melissa McCarthy saves the world.

Linux Kernel 3.12.70 Is a Big Patch with Over 220 Improvements, Security Fixes GO All users of the Linux 3.12 LTS series must update Feb 2, 2017 22:02 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Jiri Slaby is announcing the release of the 70th maintenance update to the long-term supported Linux 3.12 kernel series, which will be supported for a few more months in 2017. Coming approximately one a half months after the release of Linux kernel 3.12.69 LTS, the Linux 3.12.70 LTS kernel is a big patch that brings numerous improvements across several of the supported drivers, filesystems, and architectures. According to the appended shortlog, it changes a total of 222 files, with 1973 insertions and 783 deletions, so updating is recommended for all users. "I'm announcing the release of the 3.12.70 kernel. All users of the 3.12 kernel series must upgrade.

Triple-digit returns may not happen again, but NVDA should easily outperform By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Feb 2, 2017, 2:30 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is Too Dangerous Ahead of Earnings Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit! Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Cracks All-Time Highs With a Big Q4 Beat Recent Posts: Warning: Don’t Sell Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Short! Should I Buy Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Cracks All-Time Highs With a Big Q4 Beat View All Posts Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose shares spiked 224% in 2016, has been lethal for short sellers. They lost a stunning $4.4 billion. And yes, it will probably still be bad for them to continue with their bearish bets on NVDA stock for the new year. Source: Shutterstock Now short sellers are some of the world’s best investors. If anything, they have to since the consequences of being wrong are so great! After all, a win for a short seller is if the stock goes to zero — which rarely happens. But as seen with Nvidia shares, the downside can be horrific. The irony is that short positions can provide tremendous fuel for price appreciation. Keep in mind that short sellers need to buy back shares to close out their positions. Something else to keep in mind: It’s generally not a good strategy to take a short position merely because the valuation is excessive. There are many examples of companies — like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the 1980s and 1990s, or Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during the past decade — that have sustained long bull runs. Wall Street is more than willing to place premiums on firms that can grow fast and with consistency. As for NVDA stock, the valuation is definitely pricey. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is roughly at 42! By comparison, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) trades at 12.5 and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) sports a multiple of 11. But, of course, NVDA is growing at breakneck speed. So over time the multiples will normalize as the earnings continue to build up. For example, in the latest quarter, Nvidia reported a sizzling 54% spike in revenues to $2 billion and GAAP earnings came to 83 cents a share, up 89%. The thing to keep in mind is that Nvidia is positioned nicely to benefit from various megatrends, which should provide lots of room for growth. The company’s deep experience with graphics processing units (GPUs), which allow for intensive computations, is becoming the elixir for cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars and gaming. All these markets are massive and on the verge of major changes. For example, according to a recent presentation from Nvidia, the market opportunity for autos alone is at least $10 billion. And the company may be in the best position to benefit. The company has built a full platform for so-called AI car computing — called Nvidia Drive PX 2 — that uses high-performance chips and software to detect surroundings as well as determine optimal routes. Actually, there are over 80 automakers that use the system, including Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

It will be held in the Student Community Center’s Multipurpose Room on the UCD campus. The event is free and open to the public. The visual culture and urban planning of ancient Greece and Rome (from the 5th century B.C. in Greece to the 3rd century in Rome) had a wide impact throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. Roman architecture, art and urban planning were revived during the Renaissance starting in the 14th century and expanded further with neo-classicism starting in the mid-18th century. “Roman urbanism has had an enormous effect on architecture, past and present,” said Lynn Roller, a UC Davis art history professor. “The colloquium appeals to scholars, but is also accessible to the general public and shows that art history is a dynamic field that is relevant today.” The focus on ancient Rome was chosen to celebrate the careers of Roller, who is retiring after 40 years, and new assistant professor Alexandra Sofroniew. Both are experts in early Mediterranean visual and material cultures. Artists gave new view Appreciation and emulation of ancient Rome spread, especially to Northern Europe and Great Britain, through the work of many artists who created paintings of ancient ruins. One was French artist Hubert Robert (1733-1808), a prolific and popular painter of semi-imaginary scenes that often included ancient ruins. He completed 1,000 paintings and his work was collected by the rich and powerful. His art was the subject of a 2016 exhibition at the Louvre in Paris and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. “Hubert Robert at the Flower Strewn Abyss” is the title of the colloquium talk by Nina Dubin, associate professor of art history at the University of Illinois, Chicago. A specialist in 18th- and 19th-century French art, she is author of “Futures & Ruins: Eighteenth-Century Paris and the Art of Hubert Robert,” which examines Robert’s paintings of urban, ancient ruins. Constructing buildings and power A broader view of the impact of ancient Rome will be taken by Diane Favro, associate dean of the School of the Arts and Architecture at UCLA, in her talk “Wall, Stone, and Column: Process as Power in Augustan Rome.” Favro will examine how Augustus, the first Roman emperor from 27 B.C. to 14, rebuilt Rome in a manner that bolstered his claim, and that of his family, to power. “He redirected collective ideas by exploiting associations with the wall, stone and column to convince people that he had transformed the rather mundane Republican settlement on the Tiber River into a sparkling, majestic capital,” according to Favro. Favro, a professor of architecture and urban design, is author of “The Urban Image of Augustan Rome” and “Roman Architecture and Urbanism.” She was an early adopter of 3-D digital modeling for historical research, receiving grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, National Science Foundation and Intel for the projects Digital Roman Forum and Digital Karnak. The colloquium is named for Alan Templeton, who made a gift to support the annual colloquium and graduated from UCD in 1982 with art history and psychology degrees. The topic this year overlaps with Templeton’s interest in 18th-century European art. “Both speakers have a wealth of knowledge on the subject and Nina Dubin’s book on Hubert Robert is a true book of ideas and rather daring in some of its assertions,” Templeton said. “The colloquium will be a fitting tribute to Lynn Roller’s illustrious career,” he added. “She has been an inspiring teacher and mentor to many students over a period of 40 years. She is both a respected expert in her field and a very sympathetic, approachable person ready to share her knowledge with every interested party. She symbolizes the UC Davis spirit at its best.” — UC Davis News Special to The Enterprise Story Archive Recent Posts DHS boys shock Sheldon … for one half, host Franklin next for Break the Record Night ‘The Comedian': Can’t work the crowd Aggie women’s defense puts team on top of Big West UC Davis men take a misstep at Cal Poly, 74-70 Devils all-but clinch third straight Delta League title Special Publications » Contact Us | Customer Service Print Edition Davis Open Houses Comings & Goings Facebook Page Twitter Feed Newsroom Internships Yolo Magazine Winter/Spring 2017 Real Estate Review Friday, January 20, 2017 Student Housing 2017 Breast Cancer Awareness 2016 Welcome to Davis: Only in Davis 2016 Welcome to Davis: On the Go 2016 Welcome to Davis: On Campus 2016 Welcome to Davis: Our Community 2016 Stroll through History 2016 All in the Family 2016 Davis Visitors’ Guide 2016 Yolo Magazine Summer/Fall 2016 Senior Life 2016 Readers’ Choice 2016 Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service (updated 4/30/2015) and Privacy Policy (updated 4/7/2015).

So not surprisingly, any company that wants to get a slice of the viewing pie has to shell out a small fortune to secure advertising space. This year, it's been reported that 30 seconds of airtime during the American Football final will cost a staggering $5 (£3.9) million. In fact, Super Bowl commercials have become the stuff of legend. Perhaps the most frequently cited of the lot is Apple's Big Brother ad, directly by Ridley Scott and broadcast during the 1984 Super Bowl.

In a past post, I tested Docker network. The MySQL Server team provided their own results, which are in line with my observations. For this set of tests, I wanted to focus more on Docker networking using multiple hosts. Mostly because when we set up a high availability (HA) environment (using Percona XtraDB Cluster, for example) the expectation is that instances are running on different hosts. Another reason for this test is that Docker recently announced the 1.12 release, which supports Swarm Mode. Swarm Mode is quite interesting by itself — with this release, Docker targets going deeper on Orchestration deployments in order to compete with Kubernetes and Apache Mesos. I would say Swarm Mode is still rough around the edges (expected for a first release), but I am sure Docker will polish this feature in the next few releases. Swarm Mode also expects that you run services on different physical hosts, and services are communicated over Docker network. I wanted to see how much of a performance hit we get when we run over Docker network on multiple hosts. Network performance is especially important for clustering setups like Percona XtraDB Cluster and  MySQL Group Replication (which just put out another Lab release). For my setup, I used two physical servers connected over a 10GB network. Both servers use 56 cores total of Intel CPUs. Sysbench setup: data fits into memory, and I will only use primary key lookups. Testing over the network gives the worst case scenario for network round trips, but it also gives a good visibility on performance impacts. The following are options for Docker network: No Docker containers (marked as “direct” in the following results) Docker container uses “host” network (marked as “host”) Docker container uses “bridge” network, where service port exposed via port forwarding (marked as “bridge”) Docker container uses “overlay” network, both client and server are started in containers connected via overlay network (marked as “overlay” in the results). For “overlay” network it is possible to use third-party plugins, with different implementation of the network, the most known are: Calico network https://github.com/projectcalico/calico-containers Weave network https://github.com/weaveworks/weave For multi-host networking setup, only “overlay” (and plugins implementations) are feasible. I used “direct”, “host” and “bridge” only for the reference and as a comparison to measure the overhead of overlay implementations. The results I observed are: Client Server Throughput, tps Ratio to “direct-direct” Direct Direct 282780 1.0 Direct Host 280622 0.99 Direct Bridge 250104 0.88 Bridge Bridge 235052 0.83 overlay overlay 120503 0.43 Calico overlay Calico overlay 246202 0.87 Weave overlay Weave overlay 11554 0.044   Observations “Bridge” network added overhead, about 12%, which is in line with my previous benchmark. I wonder, however, if this is Docker overhead or just the Linux implementation of bridge networks. Docker should be using the setup that I described in Running Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes with Linux Network namespaces on the same host, and I suspect that the Linux network namespaces and bridges add overhead. I need to do more testing to verify. Native “Overlay” Docker network struggled from performance problems. I observed issues with ksoftirq using 100% of one CPU core, and I see similar reports. It seems that network interruptions in Docker “overlay” are not distributed properly across multiple CPUs. This is not the case with the “direct” and “bridge” configuration. I believe this is a problem with the Docker “overlay” network (hopefully, it will eventually be fixed). Weave network showed absolutely terrible results. I see a lot of CPU allocated to “weave” containers, so I think there are serious scalability issues in their implementation. Calico plugin showed the best result for multi-host containers, even better than “bridge-bridge” network setup Conclusion If you need to use Docker “overlay” network — which is a requirement if you are looking to deploy a multi-host environment or use Docker Swarm mode — I recommend you consider using the Calico network plugin for Docker. Native Docker “overlay” network can be used for prototype or quick testing cases, but at this moment it shows performance problems on high-end hardware.   PREVIOUS POST NEXT POST Related Vadim Tkachenko Vadim Tkachenko co-founded Percona in 2006 and serves as its Chief Technology Officer.

This option is not on by default. Rather you specify it as a driver option when you create the network. I believe the option is called ‘encrypted’ according to this blog: https://blog.docker.com/2016/07/docker-built-in-orchestration-ready-for-production-docker-1-12-goes-ga/ I would be interested in seeing the relative performance of enabling encryption at a low level rather than at the app level. Could you rerun your benchmark against an overlay network with encryption enabled? Reply Vincent Bernat says: August 4, 2016 at 3:00 am Docker overlay network uses VXLAN in unicast mode. Therefore, most of the work is done inside the kernel. Your kernel version is therefore a crucial information (but I don’t know if improvements have been made since its introduction in the kernel). Also, being an encapsulation technology, you’ll get better performance by lowering the MTU and using TCP MSS. Maybe Docker does that for you, but it’s worth a check. Reply Vadim Tkachenko says: August 4, 2016 at 3:21 am Vincent, That’s a valid request. I am using kernel Linux 4.4.0-31-generic #50-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 13 00:07:12 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux from Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS Reply Madhu says: August 9, 2016 at 9:32 am I suspect the MTU setting as well. By default overlay driver uses 1450 & hence any traffic with larger packet size will result in frag & reassembly. In docker 1.12, driver mtu can be set per network during network creation via -o com.docker.network.driver.mtu=XXXX flag which will be used by the overlay driver to setup appropriate MTU for east-west traffic. If the measurement is done for north-south traffic (via default_gwbridge bridge), then the above driver option should also be used to create this default_gwbridge network manually. More information can be found under : https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/issues/1021 Reply Madhu says: August 11, 2016 at 2:35 pm Ofcourse its easier to try traffic with size < 1450 to confirm the performance bottleneck Reply Muayyad Alsadi says: August 5, 2016 at 9:28 am Can we add the following to the matrix coreos flannel (used by kuberntes) And ovs with vxlan (where each container is attached to ovs directly) And ovs attached to linux bridge which is attached to container. Reply sargund says: August 7, 2016 at 8:57 pm Do you have this benchmark automated? I would love to experiment with my patchset which gives some of the same features, and functions as Docker bridge, but without the same overhead. If you’re interested in trying it out, let me know. Reply Vadim Tkachenko says: August 8, 2016 at 1:39 pm I do not have scripts automated, you need to run something like ./sysbench --test=tests/db/select.lua --oltp_tables_count=20 --oltp_table_size=5000000 --num-threads=100 --mysql-host=$HOST --mysql-user=sbtest --oltp-read-only=on --max-time=300 --max-requests=0 --report-interval=10 --rand-type=uniform --rand-init=on run Do not forget to prepare (load data) before tests. Reply Alexander Holbreich (@aHolbreich) says: October 11, 2016 at 2:24 pm thank you. Do you have any insight to latency of small requests? In my case it’s more about them. Reply linsununc says: December 12, 2016 at 11:01 am This is a good post, thank you! Could you clarify if the test were using the docker swarm mode (v1.12 or +)? I’m interested to see if it supports network plugins like calico for docker swarm mode. Thanks! Reply Bryan Boreham says: January 24, 2017 at 3:57 am Hi, I work ok Weave Net. Hadn’t seen this page before. Must have been something seriously broken when you did that test; nobody has ever reported figures that bad. It would be helpful if you could open an issue or otherwise point to your methodology, so we can get that corrected. Reply Bryan Boreham says: January 24, 2017 at 10:10 am Weave Net is perfectly able to deliver good performance. You can see at https://www.weave.works/weave-docker-networking-performance-fast-data-path/ we measured throughput of 7.7GB/sec at EC2. Some options you can choose will lower performance – for instance turning on encryption – and Weave Net has multiple fall-back strategies when the default VXLAN will not work. But it should always be many times faster than what you reported. However, we are unable to test every scenario, and welcome input if you are able to document cases where we can improve. Reply Kai says: February 2, 2017 at 11:00 am One possibility is that the host machine does not have the OVS in the kernel but in the user space, which might explain the poor performance. Reply Bryan Boreham says: February 2, 2017 at 3:05 pm Thanks for commenting, but Docker uses the same kernel module as Weave Net does, so it must have been installed.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 13h ago in Mobile Comments 992 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Throughout much of 2016, it seemed like lots of Apple fans were unhappy. The year brought few updates to the Mac (and the one big change was quite polarizing), a barely redesigned iPhone with no headphone jack, AirPods that shipped two months late and a new Apple Watch that was a modest improvement to a product still seen as nonessential. But it's time to accept that the complainers on the internet (including those of us in the media) might not have our fingers on the pulse of Apple fandom. Case in point: Apple just reported a massively successful quarter. According to CEO Tim Cook, both iPhone and Apple Watch sales hit records for both unit sales and revenue. In the case of the iPhone, that reversed three consecutive quarters of declining sales. The iPhone turnaround had to be a huge relief for Apple: The product is the company's biggest revenue source by far. Mac sales also generated record revenue, despite the fact that the new MacBook Pro was limited in supply and the rest of Apple's computer lineup hasn't been updated in a long time. Meanwhile, Apple's services business (iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Pay and so on) increased 18 percent over last year. Tim Cook has been talking up the company's services for a year now and says the goal is to double its size over the next four years. The one weak spot in Apple's quarter was the iPad, which is facing three years of declining sales and had the second-worst holiday quarter in its history. (The worst holiday quarter for the iPad was in 2010, when the original iPad was less than a year old and just carving out a place in the market.) The iPad's ongoing struggles aside, this quarter suggests Apple might actually be giving customers what they want. Or, more cynically, customers who've become locked into the Apple ecosystem decided that now was the best time to upgrade, not jump ship to another platform. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle. While power users might miss the MacBook Pro's full-size USB ports and longer battery life and those with great headphones might be annoyed at having to use a dongle with the iPhone 7, it seems the majority of "normal" consumers out there are not rejecting Apple's new products en masse because of these changes. The iPhone's strength was particularly surprising when you consider how many viewed the iPhone 7 as an iterative update. It has essentially the same design as the iPhone 6 and 6S, and many believe that Apple is saving a radically redesigned smartphone for later this year, the iPhone's 10th anniversary. But dismissing the iPhone 7 because of its looks does the phone a disservice. The dual camera and portrait photo mode in the 7 Plus are huge steps forward in mobile photography, and they appear to resonate with customers. Tim Cook specifically called out unexpectedly high demand for Apple's larger phone in this week's earnings call. Waterproofing and the expected battery and performance improvements make for less-dramatic but nonetheless welcome updates. And when you figure it's been two years since Apple's positively massive quarter that accompanied the iPhone 6 launch, it stands to reason plenty of people were in the market for a new phone. It's a little harder to explain the Mac's successful quarter. But the simple answer is that the Mac is fitting customers' needs, despite the relative lack of updates over the past 18 months. Indeed, last year's tech is more than enough for the average consumer at this point. Pros might bristle about not having the latest Intel processor, but for those who aren't rendering video or dealing with massive Photoshop files, the Macs out there are more than capable. That plus a bump from the new MacBook Pro was enough to put the Mac back in the black. A year of iterative updates that were nonetheless successful with consumers last quarter speaks to an industry-wide trend of modest improvement in both PCs and smartphones. These product categories are extremely polished at this point, and there are simply not going to be sweeping, massive changes every year anymore. That might be a bummer for those of us who breathlessly await new products from the tech industry's biggest companies. But you can currently buy a Mac or iPhone and rest assured that it'll last you years, even if it doesn't have a shiny new form factor or the latest Intel processors in it. For the average consumer who just wants to buy something that works well with minimal fuss, that maturity is a good thing.

Image Credit: Fig Fig has another success story. The PC indie platformer Liittle Bug has passed its $35,000 goal. Fig is a crowdfunding site that gives people the choice to invest in a project, differentiating it from competitors like Kickstarter or Indiegogo. This is the first game from developer Buddy System. It has players using dual-stick controls to simultaneously move a girl and a firefly through puzzles in levels filled with hand-drawn art (and plenty of neon). “In the atmospheric Little Bug, a young lost girl Nyah learns to harness emerging telekinetic abilities to navigate through real, metaphysical, and emotional challenges, working with her firefly companion,” Fig detailed in a press release sent to GamesBeat. “Little Bug won the Best Platformer award in Intel’s 2016 LevelUp competition. The Fig campaign for Little Bug runs through next Thursday, February 9.” You can try out a free demo of Little Bug here. With funding complete, Little Bug’s team has added stretch goals for its final week on Fig. If it reaches $37,000, it will add more hand-drawn background creatures to the platformer’s levels. At $40,000, the team will make console versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Little Bug joins other games that received funding on Fig, most recently Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire. Other successful Fig campaigns include Wasteland 3, Psychonauts 2, and Jay and Silent Bob: Chronic Blunt Punch. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

By Elsa Buchanan February 2, 2017 18:06 GMT Close DRC's conflict mining curse IBTimes UK Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker is expected to sign a statewide legislation to fight against deadly "conflict minerals" in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) this afternoon (2 February). The term "conflict minerals" is used to describe raw materials, such as gold, tungsten, tantalum and tin, that are mined in areas where fighting or human rights abuses take place. Massachusetts will later today become the third state in the country to have passed legislation, known as Resolve S.2463, supporting a conflict-free minerals trade and peace in the DRC. They join Maryland and California in recognising this. Local activists, Congolese diaspora members and human rights groups welcomed the legislation, saying it was the result of over six years of campaigning. Julie Kabukanyi, a community leader of the Congolese diaspora and member of Congo Action Now, said: "Resolve S.2463 indicates that the state of Massachusetts cares about the Congolese people, and is willing to work to support their fight for peace." Sasha Lezhnev, associate director of policy at the Enough Project, added: "Taxpayer money should not be used to subsidise companies that are unable to weed conflict minerals out of their supply chains. This resolution is timely and will help drive further industry reform." The legislation is aligned with existing goals of the national conflict minerals legislation, Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires listed companies, including Apple, Intel and HP, to report annually on their conflict minerals supply chain examination process. Stephen R. Hilbert, foreign policy adviser for Africa and global development at the Office of International Justice and Peace at the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, described the Dodd-Franck's Congo Conflict Minerals Act as "the culmination of bipartisan work to acknowledge the effects that illicit mineral mining had on the deadliest conflict in our world since World War II". "This bill has even deeper meaning for the Congolese people. Going all the way back to 1885, the Congolese people have watched foreign powers exploit their country for its mineral and natural wealth while the people lived in poverty. Section 1502 breaks that 115 year-long brutal legacy," Hilbert said. Technically, Resolve S.2463 requires the state to conduct an assessment and issue a report on its procurement policies with regards to conflict minerals from the DRC. Based on future findings, the state will have to encourage the implementation of mechanisms that support responsible mineral sourcing from the resource-rich African nation. Congo's mining curse DRC's mineral potential, worth $24tn (£16.9tn) – the size of the US and European GDPs combined – is a curse, which Western powers have sought to have their share in by either maintaining tyrannical leaders, invading Congo or fanning political instability through violent armed groups fighting government troops (FARDC) to control mines and smuggling routes. Those minerals have denied local people the peace, stability and prosperity that could result from the ethical management of the the nation's natural resources, said Bandi Mbubi, founder of Congo Calling, an NGO working to raise awareness of the role of conflict minerals in fuelling the conflict in the DRC.

The next time you're driving from New York to Boston on I-95, you should make a little detour in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to visit the Old Slater Mill national historic landmark. It’s the site of what is considered to be the first successful water-powered textile spinning mill in America. That feat was made possible by Samuel Slater, an immigrant to the US who came here at the age of 21 in 1789 from England — a country with which we had just fought a long, bitter war. He had the mill going only a few years after the signing of the US Constitution, and is sometimes referred to as the "Father of the American Industrial Revolution." The textile industry became a huge deal in 19th century America, kind of like the tech industry is today. And that immigrant tradition continues, especially in tech, America’s most dominant and dynamic industry today. In fact, if you were drawing up a business plan for countries back in 1789, you couldn’t have done better than the American founders did by, among other things, welcoming the most ambitious people from around the world to build lives here as full participants in the American experiment. For me, it is this long, deeply ingrained tradition of American immigration — and the huge benefits it has paid to our country — that makes President Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries deeply worrisome. Yes, I understand it is supposedly meant to buy time to develop a better system to block terrorists from entering our nation. Yes, I understand that our government has clamped down on immigration from time to time in the past, sometimes shamefully excluding specific peoples, like the Chinese. Nativism is un-American, and bad for innovation But the Trump action carries with it the unmistakable scent of nativism, the idea that immigration is a bad idea. And that is just un-American, and bad for innovation to boot. That isn’t to say that refugees fleeing horrors in Syria or elsewhere and seeking asylum must be computer programmers or biochemists to be admitted. We should admit as many as we can, after proper vetting, simply because they are refugees. That’s reason enough. It will forever be a stain on our history that we turned away some Jewish refugees fleeing Hitler. The same goes for average immigrants who aren’t refugees, but are simply seeking economic opportunity. Not all are Samuel Slaters. Like native-born Americans, only a few will change the world. But you never know which foreign-born barista putting herself through school might one day build a great business or invent a great product. Just by pulling up roots in another country and coming here, she’s already shown grit, ambition, and a strong work ethic. Immigrant ingenuity The immigrants who did important, world-changing things did them here because this country welcomed them when others shunned them, or weren't as open. And the tech industry, America’s most famous worldwide, is a prime example. Our lives and our culture have been significantly changed and improved by hardware, software, and services developed by immigrants. Who co-founded Google? Sergey Brin, a Russian-born Jew whose family fled anti-semitism in the Soviet Union to settle here and who considers himself a refugee. Brin showed up at the San Francisco airport to protest the Trump order. “We are able to build products for everyone because we attract talent from around the world.” Who runs Google today? Sundar Pichai, a man born and raised in India but who received his advanced education here. I asked Pichai, who has spoken out against the Trump order, about American immigration more broadly. “In Silicon Valley, being an immigrant doesn't matter,” he replied via email. “It's the ideas that matter. We are able to build products for everyone because we attract talent from around the world. Immigration is a strength for this industry and our country — it's one of our defining characteristics.” Exactly. And it’s not just Google. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was born in South Africa. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang was born in Taiwan. Oracle CEO Safra Catz was born in Israel. And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, like Google’s Pichai, was born and raised in India. In remarks this week during a Q&A with Microsoft employees, Nadella said, “It is the enlightened immigration policy of this country that even made it possible for me to come here in the first place, and gave me all this opportunity. And so I always think about that. I will always advocate for that America that I know and that I’ve experienced.” The giants Perhaps the greatest technology icon of our time, the man responsible for so many tech innovations, the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was the biological son of a Syrian immigrant. And one of Jobs’ mentors, a seminal figure in Silicon Valley, was the late Andy Grove, one of the three creators of Intel, whose processors are in nearly every desktop and laptop computer today. Mr. Grove was a Hungarian whose family fled Communist repression. As he once wrote: “By the time I was twenty, I had lived through a Hungarian Fascist dictatorship, German military occupation, the Nazis' "Final Solution," the siege of Budapest by the Soviet Red Army, a period of chaotic democracy in the years immediately after the war, a variety of repressive Communist regimes, and a popular uprising that was put down at gunpoint… [where] many young people were killed; countless others were interned. Some two hundred thousand Hungarians escaped to the West. I was one of them.” Rank and file, too And it isn’t just so many of the famous CEOs of tech who were immigrants. In my 25 years of covering the industry, it’s become routine to encounter product managers, engineers, and startup founders from Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, Britain, France, and so many other countries. Just two well-known examples. The chief designer of your Apple iPhone, iPad, and Mac? It’s Jonathan Ive, native of the United Kingdom. The new head of virtual reality at Facebook and former senior Android team member at Google? That would be Hugo Barra, native of Brazil. A little skepticism Of course, like every other government policy, immigration laws can be abused. I wouldn’t bet my life that every single H-1B visa issued to the tech industry fully meets its intended purpose of allowing in skilled foreign workers for specialty jobs only after failing to find an American worker for the slot. And there certainly are some tech jobs US companies base abroad that could be filled with native-born labor at home. What’s more, a strong belief in immigration doesn’t relieve us of our responsibility for better education and training for US workers so they can do all those “specialty” jobs — and many others — and few H-1B visas will be needed. Bottom Line But, overall, the American technology industry is a shining example of the wisdom of the founding fathers, and the example of Samuel Slater over 200 years ago. The moral of their story is that being open to immigration is not only the right thing to do, but the smart thing as well. It’s a humane good and a competitive advantage, all rolled into one. If President Trump is as good a businessman as he says, and not a short-sighted nativist, he should understand that.

Drew Gottlieb designed a new app called HoloViveObserver that lets multiple people see the same virtual world while wearing the headsets. Gottlieb built an app similar to Tilt Brush. After the HoloLens was setup to track the Vive controller, the two worlds became one. Players also have the ability to collaborate using the same app, allowing them to build objects that hover in the air together. Gottlieb, who is studying at the Rochester Institute of Technology, set out to solve the problem that only the person wearing the virtual reality headset could see the experience – leaving everyone else viewing 'a distorted preview of the player's perspective on a computer monitor'. 'A friend was recently painting a 3D submarine in Tilt Brush. 'Look at this periscope!' she said. I told her to look closer at it, and I leaned into my computer monitor to get a glimpse of what she made,' Gottlieb shared in a recent blog post. 'We can do better than this.' 'Why do I have to get up off the couch to see what my friend is creating?' 'Why can't I just lean back and see the art floating in the middle of the room?' He also believed the feat was impossible until Microsoft released new kits of their mixed-reality HoloLens glasses. Gottlieb began working on a proof of concept by designing his own 3D painting app, which is similar to Tilt Brush, called HoloViveObserver. This app uses the Unity’s built-in networking and matchmaking service to connect the HoloLens to the virtual reality session.

Share this article Share Once the two headsets were connected, Gottlieb calibrated the HoloLens controller to track the Vive controller - merging the two worlds into one. 'When the HoloLens app connects to the VR app, the game enters 'alignment mode',' explained Gottlieb. 'The HoloLens speaks, prompting the wearer to pick up one of the Vive controllers and intersect it with a floating 'ghost' controller.' Video courtesy of Drew Gottlieb  MICROSOFT'S HOLOLENS  The headset is designed with multiple environment understanding sensors and powered by a custom-built Microsoft Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) and an Intel 32-bit architecture. The device weighs just a little over one pound and consists of a 64GB of Flash memory and 2GB of RAM. The battery lasts for about two to three hours, with up to two weeks of standby time, says Microsoft.  HoloLens has 'see-through holographic lens' that use an optical projection system to create multi-dimensional full-colour holograms. According to Microsoft, 'the key to a great holographic experience is holograms that are light point rich, they have a high holographic density and are pinned, or anchored, to the world around you. In order to achieve this, the device has an optimal holographic density of 2.5k radiants.  'Once the real and holographic controllers are aligned, the wearer pulls the trigger and the voice proudly announces, 'You are now aligned'.' Gottlieb noted that there is no limit to how many people you can share the experience with. Gottlieb began working on a proof of concept by designing his own 3D painting app, which is similar to Tilt Brush, called HoloViveObserver  Players also have the ability to collaborate using the same app, allowing them to build objects that hover in the air together. 'I have no doubt this kind of mixed space will be a big part of the future, especially for creative industries,' said Gottlieb. 'As virtual and mixed reality become stronger platforms for content creation, it's only inevitable that they'll be able to be interact on a whim.'   A developer designed a method that uses a HTC Vive headset (left) and a Microsoft HoloLens headset (right) to create a true 'mixed reality' Drew Gottlieb designed a new app called HoloViveObserver that lets multiple people see the same virtual world while wearing the headsets. The app displays both players on a screen, as they are sharing the same VR experience HTC claims the Vive is ‘the first complete VR solution’ as it includes two wireless controllers, room scale movement sensors, the headset – complete with a built-in camera and phone – as well as two VR titles to play on it. Vive uses Kinect-style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in their games. Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles. The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better than previous models. This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example.  Gottlieb began working on a proof of concept by designing his own 3D painting app, which is similar to Tilt Brush. Once it was finished, he connected both the Vive and the HoloLens (pictured) using the Unity's networking and matching service And after the HoloLens was setup to track the Vive (pictured) controller, the two worlds became one. Gottlieb noted that there is no limited to how many people you can share the experience with Microsoft released its HoloLens last year, which it believes will ‘break the walls between humans and technology’. The headset is designed with numerous environment understanding sensors and powered by a custom-built Microsoft Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) and an Intel 32-bit architecture. The device weighs just a little over one pound and consists of a 64GB of Flash memory and 2GB of RAM.

With 99 Percent Success Rate, 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T Ethernet Plugfest Shows Technology is Ready for Primetime First joint Ethernet Alliance, NBASE-T Alliance test event demonstrates market readiness of next-gen Ethernet Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail February 02, 2017 11:15 AM Eastern Standard Time BEAVERTON, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Ethernet Alliance, a global consortium dedicated to the continued success and advancement of Ethernet technologies, and NBASE-T Alliance, an industry-wide cooperative effort focused on enabling the development and deployment of products that support 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T Ethernet, today shared findings from their recent plugfest. The two organizations’ first-ever joint test event was held October 10 – 14, 2016 at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) in Durham, N.H. Aimed at verifying interoperability, robustness, and standards conformance of 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T Ethernet technologies, the plugfest results confirm the specifications’ maturity and readiness for adoption by the market. “When the NBASE-T Alliance was formed just over two years ago, we had a vision of new Ethernet solutions enabling enterprises to evolve their access layer networks, providing up to five times the bandwidth without re-cabling—and now that vision is a reality,” said Peter Jones, chairman, NBASE-T Alliance; and principal engineer, Cisco. “This most recent plugfest proves that NBASE-T technology is ready for mass deployment in a variety of applications. It is also a tribute to our many members who played an active role in delivering a technology that will have a major impact on several different industries.” “With the release of the IEEE 802.3bz™ 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T standard, NBASE-T Alliance’s PHY interface specifications, and other application-driven standards, we’re on the cusp of the largest Ethernet build-out ever. We’ll see networks gaining the ability to connect more people and deliver better end user experiences and new services, thereby increasing the value of the networks themselves,” said John D’Ambrosia, chairman, Ethernet Alliance; and senior principal engineer, Huawei. “Our plugfest results illustrate 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T are ready to go, as is the Ethernet ecosystem. As we enter the next era of Ethernet, the Ethernet Alliance is ready to accelerate market acceptance of these advanced technologies by helping to instill confidence in their multivendor interoperability and educating users on the benefits they offer.” During the event, more than 1,100 interoperability link up and Frame Error Rate (FER) tests were completed, covering the complementary IEEE 802.3bz standard and NBASE-T Alliance PHY interface specifications, resulting in a >99 percent success rate for all cabling and equipment combinations. A broad array of products supporting 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T were thoroughly evaluated against multiple test scenarios and checks, such as: Conformance – verifying equipment conformance against the IEEE 802.3bz standard and NBASE-T Alliance specifications; Link up – authenticating ability of 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T equipment to connect with other devices; FER – monitoring of errors in data frames passed between devices; and Downshift – confirming NBASE-T ports’ capacity to move to a slower data rate when the capacity of the cabling is constrained due to noise. The five-day gathering marked the first test of IEEE 802.3bz. The industrywide effort brought together 15 diverse stakeholders from across the Ethernet ecosystem, including manufacturers of Ethernet switches, network interface controllers (NICs), wireless LAN access ports, physical layers components, cabling, and protocol test and electrical test equipment. Among the companies and equipment vendors taking part were Aquantia Corp.; Aukua Systems, Inc.; Berk-Tek LLC (EPA: NEX); Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ: AVGO); Cisco Systems, Inc.: Dell, Inc.; Extreme Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXTR); Fluke Corporation (NYSE: DHR); Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.; Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC); Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL); Panduit Corp.; Rohde & Schwarz USA, Inc.; Spirent Communications plc (LSE: SPT); and Tektronix, Inc. (NYSE: DHR). Complete details and analysis of the plugfest results will be presented during a joint Ethernet Alliance/NBASE-T Alliance webinar scheduled for March 9, 2017, at 8am PST, with a second presentation at 5pm PST the same day. The webinar will provide a comprehensive, in-depth review of testing performed during the plugfest and its subsequent results.

Note to Editors: The Ethernet Alliance and NBASE-T Alliance believe the IEEE 802.3bz standard and NBASE-T Alliance PHY interface specifications work together, hence their referral as “complementary”. About the Ethernet Alliance The Ethernet Alliance is a global consortium that includes system and component vendors, industry experts, and university and government professionals who are committed to the continued success and expansion of Ethernet technology. The Ethernet Alliance takes Ethernet standards to market by supporting activities that span from incubation of new Ethernet technologies to interoperability demonstrations and education. About the NBASE-T Alliance The NBASE-T Alliance is an industry-wide cooperative effort focused on enabling the development and deployment of products that support 2.5G and 5GBASE-T Ethernet. The alliance was founded in 2014 to build consensus and help streamline the development of a new standard. That standard, IEEE 802.3bz, was approved in September 2016 and is compatible with specifications published by the NBASE-T Alliance. In addition, the specification includes additional features that further optimize networks based on the standard. The specifications enabled member companies to quickly develop and deploy 2.5G and 5GBASE-T products, making use of the large, installed base of copper cabling, such as Cat5e and Cat6, found in many places including enterprise, home and service provider networks. Today, the alliance continues to publish specifications, facilitate interoperability and educate the market about the multiple applications of the technology.

EVGA is no stranger to liquid-cooling—it even has graphics cards with CLCs strapped on them. These are the first mount-and-go closed-loop CPU coolers from the company, though. They look pretty slick, and include an RGB-LED-lit EVGA logo on the block itself, plus a new fan design that EVGA says offers "superior cooling and lower noise" over typical radiator fans. As you probably guessed from the names, the coolers come as a single-fan 120-mm version and as a dual-fan 280-mm model. In either case, the coolers can mount to Intel LGA 115x and LGA 2011 motherboards, and to AMD's AM4 socket. The new fans are a pretty interesting design that eschews most of the frame encircling the fan itself. EVGA says the new fans should help the CLC 120 and CLC 280 stay under 40 dBA in the worst case, which is pretty quiet as these things go. EVGA's new coolers are available now from the company's web shop. The CLC 120 will set you back $90, while the much larger CLC 280 goes for $130.    Tags: Cooling User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Two Infants Treated with Universal Immune Cells Have Their Cancer Vanish Boston Dynamics Has a New “Nightmare-Inducing” Robot Experimenting with the Future of Glass To make the devices of the future, we need the materials of the future, too. And perhaps some of the most unfathomable challenges lie within glass. While the optical properties of the material are unparalleled, it can be stiff, brittle, and easy to scratch. That’s why researchers at Corning’s headquarters in upstate New York are working out how far they can push it. The company's Gorilla Glass is a good start, and probably already graces your smartphone. But it thinks it can do better—so that we might one day have foldable tablets or car interiors that are entirely made of displays. We took a peek inside the company’s far-out glass lab to find out more.   The Plan to Build a Giant Quantum Computer—Now An international team of scientists has published a plan to build a huge quantum computer. The device, proposed in the journal Science Advances, would be as large as a football field and cost upwards of $125 million. The proposed design uses magnetic fields to trap ions, which would be used as qubits—the quantum equivalent of digital bits—and controlled via microwaves. Intriguingly, the team claims that it could be built now, arguing that components required for the system have been demonstrated in labs. In theory, it would be far more powerful than currently available systems. But researchers would have to face up to many engineering problems, like how to string the elements together and ensure it all stays cool. “Such high-level issues are rarely considered by people in the field of quantum computing,” said Christopher Monroe, a physicist from University of Maryland in College Park, to Nature. “Our community needs a systems-engineering push to simply build it.” Do you need The Download?

A Texas jury found that Palmer Luckey—co-founder of the VR company Oculus, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for over $2 billion—failed to comply with a non-disclosure agreement that he signed when he left the video game publisher. Oculus was not, however, found to have stolen trade secrets, as Zenimax had claimed. Unsurprisingly, Facebook plans to appeal. But it will also breezily push on with a plan to take over TV. In a call with investors yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg described how he plans for Facebook to become the place where “you want to watch videos, you want to keep up with the content that you watch episodically week over week.” To source content, the social network will pay video producers with up front payments as well as a slice of ad revenue. Meanwhile, earlier this week it was rumored that the company plans to build its own TV apps. Looks like we should stay tuned. Ten Fascinating Things 01. The solution to botnets?

While building a PC is not as difficult as beginners think, there are common mistakes you should avoid. These range from installing your components in the wrong order to forgetting to install your IO shield before mounting your motherboard. Even experienced builders occasionally fall victim to these simple errors. Below are a several pitfalls to watch out for when building your own PC. Incompatible parts This mistake is most often made by beginners with limited knowledge of PC hardware. There are many different compatibilities for each PC component and it is important to ensure that all your components work with each other. This can range from problems like chipset and processor incompatibility, to less obvious issues such as buying an mSATA drive for an M.2 slot. Ask the retailer where you are purchasing the parts if they are compatible with one another, or do a quick check online. Cheap PSU One of the most overlooked purchases for a PC is a quality power supply. If you’re building a PC with powerful hardware inside, you should power your components with a reliable PSU. Cheap power supplies are prone to malfunction, which could damage components. I/O shield The I/O shield should be the first component you install, as it is impossible to insert into your chassis once other components are in. If you forget to install this protective shroud, you will have to disassemble your build and start over. This can be a great frustration, especially if you have installed a liquid cooling loop. CPU installation The most nerve-wracking part of building your own system is the installation of your processor. Although newer Intel processors have more refined pins and mounting systems, it is still important to follow the included instructions and double-check your orientation before installation. Forcing your processor into the socket could bend socket pins, rendering the CPU unusable. Thermal compound Many system builders and overclockers have different opinions regarding the ideal amount and brand of thermal paste you should apply to your CPU. It is generally recommended that you apply a pea-sized amount of compound to the lid of your CPU and then mount your cooler onto the processor – letting the heat sink contact spread the paste. Make sure your cooler has pre-applied thermal compound and that the plastic covering the heat sink contact is removed. DIY If a component doesn’t fit into a slot or a cooler does not fit on your CPU or motherboard, the components are not compatible. Shaving down connections or drilling holes will probably destroy expensive components and cause serious problems. There are exceptions to this rule, but any DIY tasks should be conducted by someone with a sufficient knowledge of the hardware. Fan orientation Fans are mounted as intakes and exhausts in order to achieve optimal airflow through the chassis. Mounting fans in the wrong orientation (example: three intakes instead of two intakes and one exhaust) could result in high PC temperatures. Brute force While components like RAM modules may require a bit of elbow grease to lock into place, applying brute force to motherboard connections is not a good idea. This is especially true for processor and graphics card installations, where a need to use brute force probably indicates a connection or compatibility problem. A bit of pressure is fine, but leaning your whole body onto your graphics card will result in tears. Static electricity Electrostatic discharge can be a real danger to your components and it is important to neutralise any static charge when working on a PC. Avoid working in carpeted areas or wearing clothes prone to static build-up when building your system. It is recommended that you either use an anti-static wrist strap or periodically maintain contact with the chassis when installing and touching components.

Caterpillar invests in Airware bringing drone tech to mining and construction enterprises Posted 17 hours ago by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Google Chrome gets its own QR code & barcode scanner The venture arm of Caterpillar Inc., a major manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has invested in San Francisco drone tech startup Airware. Rather than make its own unmanned aerial vehicles, Airware has focused its efforts around providing software and services that help large enterprises use drones throughout their operations. Airware’s cloud-based software helps companies plan flights, automate those as much as possible, then analyze all the data their drones collect. In putting drones to work, large construction, mining and insurance companies generally seek to cut costs, improve worker safety or increase their revenue and productivity. The founder and CEO of Airware, Jonathan Downey, tells TechCrunch that the company has narrowed its focus from many industries to just a few: insurance, construction and mining. “These are industries where there’s already a real use case, and economic feasibility for employing drones commercially at scale,” he said. He offered a few examples of how these business are using Airware today. Insurance companies use the company’s drone tech to inspect rooftops for damage, or to analyze the flood plains around a building. Mining companies use it to track how much material is coming from a quarry, moving to a stockpile, and getting out to customers– all without having to send workers scrambling to the top of a stockpile with heavy sensors. In construction, Airware helps developers create site maps, conduct pre-site inspections and monitor the progress and safety of a given build. Caterpillar Ventures invested in Airware as part of the company’s last round of funding in 2016, Downey said. Airware has raised around $90 million in equity funding to-date, the company said. Downey declined to disclose specific terms of the deal, including whether or not Caterpillar’s involvement may preclude Airware from working with other heavy equipment makers. According to a press statement, Caterpillar is working with Airware to offer drone services to its own customers, and to enable large dealers of the company’s equipment to also offer drone services to their customers. Caterpillar Ventures’ partners were not available for comment. Earlier backers of Airware included Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, GE Ventures, Google Ventures (GV), Intel Capital, John Chambers, KPCB and Next World Capital.  In a quest to bring drone tech to large enterprises, Airware’s U.S. competition includes other venture backed startups like PrecisionHawk and Kespry, and others globally. A tight relationship with Caterpillar, which is based in Illinois but has worldwide distribution of its equipment, will undoubtedly help Airware win customers beyond the US. Of a $100 billion market for drone tech overall, including military and consumer drones, Goldman Sachs forecasts $13 billion in spending between 2016 and 2020 on drones in commercial and civil sectors. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Airware Founded 2011 Overview Airware is building the aerial information platform for the rapid development and safe operation of commercial drones, providing hardware, software and cloud services.

Russia should consider, divisions. To open patrol roads. Russia have Tigers, Typhoons and other vehicles. TYPHOON could be at least one, armed with drones. Aerial with cords and mobile smaller tanks. URAN 9 or better solution could be used. The top of Typhoon corded drone could have a sniper rifle attached and some grenade launcher where each grenade be self run and take over targets.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Artifex Software to Host Exhibitor Booth at RSA Conference 2017 USA 2 February 2017Military News PRWeb Artfiex Software, developer of SmartOffice, the leading mobile Office productivity app, will be an exhibitor at the upcoming RSA Conference 2017 USA being held at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco, CA from February 12 -15. Artifex and SmartOffice will be located in booth #S1948 located in Moscone Center’s South Hall. SmartOffice is a mobile app that enables people to view, edit, create, share, present and print Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) on their mobile devices, and works on the leading mobile platforms, smartphones and tablets. With over 350 million downloads, the SmartOffice app’s high quality document representation and small file size (one-fiftieth the size of MS Office 365 Mobile) make it a perfect fit for today’s growing mobile workforce. RSA Conference is a premier event where the world gathers to discuss security and the latest thinking and technologies related to securing information in the digital age. “Maintaining data and document security in today’s increasingly mobile work environment is critical to today’s enterprise and organizations,” said Miles Jones, President of Artifex. “At the same time, employees of the secured organization still need to conduct their work, which means they need to access, view and edit their Office documents while using mobile devices. Our enterprise version of SmartOffice makes it easy for an MDM, EMM or EFSS to incorporate these critical work functions into their overall offering for customers. That is why we refer to SmartOffice as a ‘securable alternative’ to MS Office for mobile devices.” The SmartOffice enterprise SDK (SmartOffice Dev Kit) is a customizable way to secure enterprise document workflow, editing and management while empowering your mobile workforce. It fully integrates with an organization’s EFSS, MDM or EMM environment, enabling enterprise IT to distribute secure and controlled document viewing and editing across multiple platforms. In addition, SmartOffice’s controlled access permission tools extend down to the user or document level, further aiding IT departments’ ability to prevent data leakage. The result: SmartOffice provides a safe way for mobile users to work with MS Office documents regardless of device. Enterprise information is secured while employees are empowered to be productive. More information about SmartOffice DevKit is available on the SmartOffice web site. “When it comes to providing MS Office document viewing and editing capabilities within a secured mobile platform environment, SmartOffice has several advantages vs. Microsoft Office 365 Mobile,” said Ted Simon, Vice President of Marketing for Artifex. “First and foremost, SmartOffice offers better security as it is designed to integrate within the platform rather than require a user to leave the secure environment to view or edit a document. Second, at 1/50 the size of MS Office 365 (21 MB vs. just under 1GB), SmartOffice’s smaller size is better suited for mobile devices. Third, SmartOffice provides PDF viewing and annotation capabilities, something MS Office does not offer. And, finally, SmartOffice is fully functional without Internet access; a user can access and work on files natively with no Internet dependency.

Prices For Tickets, Airfare, Hotels In Houston Cheaper This Year By Tim Marcin @TimMarcin On 02/02/17 AT 9:40 AM Close Going to the Super Bowl is never truly cheap. But comparatively speaking, data out Thursday showed Super Bowl 51 scheduled for Sunday in Houston wasn't breaking the bank as much as previous games.  Ticket prices fell sharply after the lineup was settled between the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots. Tickets about a week ago might have run you double what you would pay now. But the only real way to land a ticket at this point was through the secondary market, meaning the seats were being re-sold. The get-in price, or the cost floor, was $2,043, according to the latest data from TicketIQ, which tracks the secondary market for tickets. The average re-sell price was $4,243, though popular secondary marketplace Stubhub showed tickets Thursday for as little as $2,250 and as much as $112,000. The cost to attend the 2017 championship was cheaper than it has been the past two years, but it was more expensive than it was in 2014, according to Yahoo Finance, which tracks prices leading up to the day of the game. Prices also typically fall immediately before the game as sellers looking to sell off their seats at the last second. Fans might be able to get in for — gasp — as little as one grand per ticket.  Related Stories Gisele Bündchen Gave Tom Brady Necklace For 'Protection' Fox Sports and Intel Go All Out For Super Bowl "I'd predict the over/under for the get-in price to be at $1,000 on game day," TicketIQ representative Jesse Lawrence told USA Today Sports this week.  Actually getting to Houston will cost fans as well, although not quite as much as game tickets will. Prices from travel site Kayak showed a round trip ticket from Boston to Houston arriving Thursday and departing Monday could cost as little as $962. The same itinerary from Atlanta cost at least $1,069. People who booked flights earlier, however, probably paid far less: Enterprising travelers who used all local airports could have secured tickets for a couple hundred bucks, NBC News reported. Once a fan arrives in Houston, the cost doesn't stop climbing. Hotels aren't cheap, either. Data from travel site Trivago revealed a standard room was set to cost $343 per night in Houston during the Super Bowl, according to KHOU. That's far less than an average of $503 Trivago found for last year's game. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.
