Optane tech is a new class of non-volatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Micron and the chip making giant, according to PC World. Intel by Roebot, Flickr Both Optane products based on 3D Xpoint Intel’s first Optane products, which were announced at CES this month, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into PCs’ storage slots. The Optane memory DIMMs is not the same. They are intended to replace DRAM in PCs and servers. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has begun shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and is hoping to launch the final products next year. Optane SSDs performed ten times faster than traditional SSDs in the demonstration. PC makers said that bootup, applications and game play are all quicker with Optane SSDs, notes PC World. Not much is known about the Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units for testing out to enterprise hardware makers. The chip maker said the Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. Also it has floated the notion that Optane could unite memory and storage. For instance, a single Optane unit could serve as both DRAM and storage, notes PC World. On Thursday during the earnings call, CEO Brain Krzanich said that 3D Xpoint is the base technology of both types of Optane products and is a bridge between storage and memory. Krzanich said Optane is a “differential technology” that could change server and PC architectures. Intel hires Cisco veteran as new VP of channel sales In other Intel news, the company has hired Ricardo Moreno as a new vice president of channel sales. Moreno, a 16-year Cisco channel veteran, will be the new VP of Intel’s sales and marketing group and general manager of Intel’s Partner Program Organization. According to the company, Moreno will not only be in charge of strengthening the focus on investments across Intel’s go-to-market strategy but also channel resources and training strategies from a global perspective. Todd Garrigues, director of reseller channels and North American marketing, said, “It’s a strong statement from Intel to add another executive on that level to focus on the partner infrastructure, tools and resources that we bring to market to support our channels worldwide.” Tags: intel Optane SSDs Load Comments Send us your tips at tips(at)valuewalk.com Latest News From ValueWalk James Grant – A Different Investment World The Growing Clout Of Rural Consumers Emerson Electric (EMR): A Dividend King With 60 Consecutive Years Of Dividend Increases Despite Net Short Positioning, Sui Generis Investment Partners Up 5% In 2016 Copyright © 2016 ValueWalk - Privacy Policy Follow Us: Developed by ValueWalk Team Sponsored Content - Resource Center

Credit: Intel More like this With ARM server market fading, Qualcomm's new chip may be too late What boost will Intel's next chips deliver? Moore's Law lives on with speedy 7nm mobile chips coming in 2018 Video Mingis on Tech: 'Alexa, what's in the news?' Intel's next big Moore's Law advance will be a 7-nm pilot plant it is establishing this year to explore the upcoming manufacturing process. The chipmaker announced it was establishing the pilot plant during an earnings call on Thursday. For decades, Moore's Law has been the guiding light for Intel to make teenier, faster, and more power-efficient chips. The effort has helped PC makers continuously shrink laptops and mobile devices while adding longer battery life. Intel is trying to hang onto the long-standing observation as a way to push its chip technology forward. However, some experts argue Moore's Law is expiring as it becomes physically impossible to cram more features on smaller chips. The pilot plant will test and iron out kinks in manufacturing 7-nm chips. Intel hasn't said when it'll start shipping 7-nm chips in volume, but it won't be in the next two to three years. "The pilot line is about figuring out how to make billions of chips," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The pilot plant has limited production, but it sets the stage for Intel to invest billions in larger factories to make smaller 7-nm chips. "Once they have the process locked down, it's replicated in the other plants," McCarron said. Intel's latest chips, based on Kaby Lake, are made using the 14-nanometer process, and the company is now moving to 10-nm with its upcoming Cannonlake chip, which was shown in a PC at CES earlier this month. The 7-nm chips will come after the 10-nm process. Cannonlake chips will ship in small volumes by year-end, and their availability will expand next year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said during the earnings call. Moore's Law has also helped Intel roll out new chips on a yearly basis like clockwork. Intel first interpreted Moore's Law as a way to double the number of transistors in chips every 18 to 24 months, which doubles performance. But that interpretation didn't work on the 14-nm process, where it became a challenge to cram more transistors in smaller geometries. Intel dealt with embarrassing product delays and had to move away from its decades-old schedule of advancing the manufacturing process every two years. Intel also broke away from its history of making two new chip technologies with each manufacturing cycle. It made three new chip technologies -- Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake -- with the 14-nm process. The chipmaker now isn't worried about doubling the transistor count with every new chip generation. Instead, Intel is now interpreting Moore's Law more in line with the economics related to cost-per-transistor, which would drop with scaling. That's an important part of Moore's Law. Intel last year said it was trying to get back to a two-year manufacturing cycle with the 7-nm process, but with smarter chip designs. The 7-nm process could bring radical design changes to chips, which will be much smaller and power efficient. Intel's planning on using exotic III-V materials like gallium-nitride for faster chips that could bring laptops longer battery life. Intel is looking at the 7-nm process to alleviate some of the challenges it faces on the 14-nm and 10-nm processors. The company has hinted it would introduce EUV (extreme ultraviolet) tools in the manufacturing process. EUV will help etch finer features on chips, but its implementation has been delayed multiple times. The pilot factory will help validate all those features, and then allow Intel to order equipment for the new factories, McCarron said. Competitors like Globalfoundries and Samsung are getting a head-start on the 7-nm process. Globalfoundries has said it will start making 7-nm chips by 2018, and ARM has released tools for the design of 7-nm chips. It's not clear if Globalfoundries will do 7-nm test runs or start making chips in large volumes. Samsung and Globalfoundries have just started making 10-nm chips like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, which will appear in smartphones soon. Globalfoundries is a close partner with IBM, which produced the first 7-nm chips last year.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel NUC mini PC kits with Core i3 now available for $300 01/25/2017 at 3:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Intel is refreshing its NUC line of tiny desktop computers with new models featuring Intel Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake chips. The new versions should offer better CPU and graphics performance than their predecessors, and Intel has also given them a slight makeover with a darker case and a power button that’s been moved from the top to the front. Earlier this month an Intel NUC with a Celeron J3455 Apollo Lake CPU went on sale for about $230. Now you can buy more powerful models with Core i3 Kaby Lake chips. Prices start at about $295. That’s how much Amazon is charging for either the BOXNUC7I3BNH NUC Kit or the BOXNUC7I3BNK NUC Kit. Both versions feature a 15 watt Intel Core i3-7100U dual core processor with Intel HD 620 graphics, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and, four USB 3.0 ports, and a USB Type-C port (which can be used as a second display output, among other things, thanks to DisplayPort 1.2 support). The difference is that the BNH model has room for both an M.2 solid state drive and a 2.5 inch hard drive or SSD, while the BNK version is a shorter, more compact PC that only has the M.2 slot. Note that Amazon is showing the wrong images for the new mini computers, but Newegg has the right pictures (and is charging $315 for the short and tall versions of the new Core i3 NUC). Both ship without storage, memory, or an operating system and support up to 32GB of DDR4-2133 RAM. Later this year Intel will also launch models with Core i5 and Core i7 Kaby lake chips, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and Intel Iris Plus graphics. Some models will also support Intel Optane storage. via NUC Blog Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Latest News Windows 10 gets new gaming features with Insider Preview Build 15019 The latest preview of Windows 10 for members of the Windows Insider Preview … [Read More...] Reports: Samsung Galaxy S8 launching March 29th, featuring brand new design Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone may have been a bit of a disaster, but the … [Read More...] In a perfect world Satechi’s new USB Type-C Power Meter wouldn’t be necessary… ... but we don't live in a perfect world.

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers - the machines at the heart of cloud computing. Although profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft is paying off. Google's Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to US$3.4 billion (S$4.8 billion) in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said on Thursday. "I definitely think we're going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for start-ups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own Web services. MICROSOFT NET INCOME $5.2b REVENUE $24.1b ALPHABET NET INCOME $5.33b REVENUE $26.06b INTEL NET INCOME $3.6b REVENUE $16.4b All figures for the fourth quarter in US dollars SOURCE: REUTERS More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud computing during the next five years, research firm Gartner estimated last July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," it added. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to buy Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company's productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales rose 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter. "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, who rates Microsoft shares outperform. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief financial officer Amy Hood last July said gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. This is because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualised revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year ending June 2018. That metric stood at more than US$14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel's fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and RBC Capital Markets expects the company's AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from the year before. Mr Moerdler said: "Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack."

During Intel’s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference on Thursday, CEO Brian Krzanich said the company provided samples of its 3D XPoint-based memory sticks to data centers during that quarter. These sticks fit into DDR4 slots in servers, promising better performance due to the “stacked” nature of 3D XPoint technology. This is the same technology Intel is using in its new Optane-labeled storage devices. “Our memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue while full-year revenue was down by one percent. This was an investment year for the memory business,” he said. “We are now shipping 3D NAND from our FAB 68, and we just qualified our first 3D XPoint-based Optane SSDs, which are expected to ship for revenue in the first quarter. And our 3D XPoint memory DIMMs are sampled to data center customers.” More: MSI posted the specs of eight upcoming Xeon E3-1200 v6 Series CPUs from Intel 3D XPoint is a new class of non-volatile memory, meaning this type of memory holds onto data when devices are shut down whereas volatile memory doesn’t. Non-volatile memory is typically used in solid-state drives and USB sticks (NAND) whereas volatile memory is typically used in system memory sticks (DRAM). However, Intel is using its 3D XPoint technology in SSD and memory stick (DIMM) form factors. Intel’s 3D XPoint is supposedly faster than standard flash-based NAND technology but slower than DRAM. It’s not supposed to replace DDR4 system memory sticks, but speed up data access without compromising the system’s storage capacity. In other words, if a server has Optane-based sticks installed, it has the speed of an SSD and the capacity of a hard drive. The first Optane-based SSDs produced by Intel were shown during CES 2017 in early January. They were M.2-class products, meaning they are stick sized and slip into a special slot on the motherboard, or can be mounted onto a special PCI Express card and connected to the motherboard like a graphics card. The units on display had 16GB and 32GB capacities. These two units expand on the hybrid storage design. Currently, there are storage products on the market that cram NAND memory into hard drives to speed up the flow of data to and from the hybrid drive. However, Intel’s solution means customers aren’t required to rip out their current hard drive to get the benefits of a hybrid drive but to just install one of these Optane SSDs instead. The idea behind the hybrid storage setup is to place the most used files on the faster non-volatile storage memory and all other data on the slower, magnetic spinning discs (platters). This will increase the speed of the system from boot because the mechanical parts typically are not accessed to load the necessary data. Systems with Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core processors and its family of Xeon E3 v6 processors will be compatible with Intel’s Optane products. Optane will be installed in pre-built systems and sold as stand-alone products for motherboards and other products listed as “Optane ready” in the second quarter of 2017. Also watch: Share

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 11:43AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is preparing to launch its next generation high-end desktop (HEDT) personal computer chips and platform at the Gamescom trade show beginning on Aug. 22, per a report from the generally reliable website BenchLife.info. Intel's HEDT lineup makes up a relatively small portion of the company's overall desktop PC chip sales, but these chips tend to carry very high average selling prices and are much more lucrative per unit than the company's mainstream desktop personal computer chip lines. The report has some information about the new lineup, so let's take a closer look.  New chipset, broader line of chips Intel's previous HEDT platform, based on the X99 chipset, supported processors that the company code-named Broadwell-E. These are six-, eight-, and 10-core chips based on the company's Broadwell architecture, manufactured in the company's first-generation 14-nanometer technology. The chips list at around $434 and go all the way up to $1723. The upcoming HEDT platform, which is based on a newer chipset dubbed X299, is said to support a broader range of chips. The Broadwell-E chips will see direct successors in the form of a chip family called Skylake-X, which BenchLife says will come in six-, eight-, and 10-core variants. Image source: Intel.  The main improvements from Skylake-X, then, are expected to come from changes to the fundamental chip architecture (both the processor cores and all the "stuff" that surrounds the cores should be new) as well as to the manufacturing technology -- Skylake-X is said to be manufactured in Intel's enhanced 14-nanometer+ technology. New to this platform, though, will be a family of chips called Kaby Lake-X. These chips are believed to be the same fundamental chips as the Kaby Lake-S processors that Intel launched earlier this month for mainstream desktops, but they will be modified to fit into motherboards utilizing the X299 chipset. The integrated graphics processors on these chips are also believed to be disabled on the Kaby Lake-X chips -- a prudent move as the motherboard infrastructure required to support integrated graphics adds cost but is of minimal value to the target market (which will want to use stand-alone graphics processors).  The addition of the Kaby Lake-X parts to the lineup should allow Intel to offer a broader range of chips on the HEDT platform at potentially lower price points, which could help to boost the adoption of said platform. No "X" processors? A translation of the BenchLife report indicates that all the chips that will initially launch for the X299 platform will be designated with "K" suffixes in their model numbers, with no "X" models at launch. The current HEDT lineup on the X99 platform consists of four chips: Core i7-6800K, Core i7-6850K, Corei7-6900K, and Core i7-6950X. The six- and eight-core models are designated with "K" suffixes, while the top-end 10-core model has an "X" suffix. It doesn't make sense for Intel to completely abandon chips with the "X" suffix -- after all, the ultra-premium positioning/branding of the "X" chip probably helps to boost the perceived value of the chip. My inclination, then, is to think that Intel might be planning an even higher-end "X" part later down the line, with additional performance and/or features. Investor takeaway A new HEDT platform isn't going to be a game changer for Intel's financials or its stock price, but new products could allow the chipmaker to maintain or even slightly grow its average selling prices within this portion of its desktop PC chip shipments. Given that the personal computer market is expected to suffer unit declines for quite some time, any and all actions that Intel can take to improve its average revenue per PC with interesting new products (which can help to offset the unit declines) should be welcomed by stockholders.

The handset will also feature an improved camera and waterproofing, improving on a key weakness of the original. Google's Pixel is intended to rival the iPhone. Tightly coupled with Android, it's Google's first attempt to design its own smartphone hardware. The result has been generally very well received, although there's still room for improvement. This year's Pixel 2 is meant to fill in the gaps to create an even better device. Google is concentrating on improving camera and CPU performance, 9to5Google reported today. The company is said to be developing multiple test versions of the Pixel 2 using different processors. Some have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 inside, a typical choice for 2017's flagship phones. Others contain Intel silicon though, potentially making the Pixel 2 one of few Android phones with Intel Inside. Google could further distinguish the Pixel by choosing to use Intel's chips. Qualcomm's dominance in the smartphone sector has led to most high-end phones using the same processor each year. Intel's alternatives now offer similar performance, although the Snapdragon is generally more powerful overall. As well as Qualcomm and Intel options, Google is reportedly working on a version of the Pixel that uses a custom chipset it has designed. The role of this chipset is currently uncertain and it may not be used in the final product. In yet another alternative, Google was also collaborating with MediaTek on the Pixel 2. This agreement is now said to have ended. READ MORE: ENGINEERS HOPE TO BREW BEER ON THE MOON As well as a new processor, the Pixel 2 will launch with an upgraded camera for better photographs in low light conditions. Rather than increase the megapixels, Google is working to optimise other aspects of the imaging hardware. It will "compensate in extra features" for the lack of a high-megapixel sensor. These changes won't come cheap though. Google is expected to raise the price of the Pixel 2 over the original phone, adding "at least" $50 to all models. The Pixel has already faced criticism for its pricing so the increase isn’t likely to be received well. Google is said to be developing a solution for this too, a lower-cost Pixel that will cater for people reluctant to splash out on the main device. The Pixel "2B" will be a budget-level phone "significantly cheaper" than the Pixel 2. Google is reportedly testing prototypes of the device with various chipsets, optimising its hardware choices both for performance and for price. As ever, details may change before the public release. The launch of any new Pixel phone is likely to be months away and Google is still developing the new models. Last year, the company chose October for its Pixel unveil. Tech companies tend to release products on a regular schedule so the Pixel 2 should release around the same time this year.

Two insane gaming PCs, of course. Overclockers UK has unveiled what is quite possibly the most ridiculous two-in-one desktop you can buy in the UK, and it’ll set you back a cool £24,000. It's called the 8Pack OrionX. Why the hell does it cost so much? Let’s dive into the specs and understand what’s happening here. First, it’s worth pointing out that this is a PC built by overclocking champion Ian ‘8Pack’ Parry. Just look at his stats on the HWBot world rankings; this guy is legit. It’ll take Parry six weeks to build a single one of these systems (among his other 8Pack PC building responsibilities), so get your orders (and house remortgage applications) in early. Related: Best gaming PC specs to build yourself (up to £1,500, not £24,000) Yes, again, this is a PC with a second PC buried inside it. PC-ception, if you will. They’re both separate systems; their only relation is that they sit in the same chassis. You could network them together if you wanted, and you can also control overclocking options on the main PC with the secondary system. Primary PC specs Processor: Intel Core i7 6950X overclocked to at least 4.4GHz Motherboard: Asus Rampage V ED 10 Intel X99 Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 64GB (8 x 8GB) at 2666MHz Graphics: 3 NVIDIA Titan X Pascals in Tri-SLI config with quad option available. Overclocked to 2000MHz+ Primary SSD: Intel 750 1.2TB PCI-E NVMe SSD (watercooled) Secondary SSDs: 2 Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSDs in RAID 0 HDD Storage: Seagate Barracuda 10TB HDD Secondary PC specs Processor: Intel Core i7 7700K overclocked to at least 5.1GHz Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z270I Gaming Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 16GB (2 x 8GB) at 3200MHz Graphics: NVIDIA Titan X Pascal Primary: SSDs 2 Samsung 960 Polaris 512GB NVME M.2 in RAID 0 HDD: Storage Seagate Barracuda 10TB HDD The highlights of the spec is of course the outer PC’s outrageous 10-core, 20-thread Broadwell-E Intel Core i7 6950X with a guaranteed overclock of at least 4.4GHz, attached to an Asus X99 Rampage 5 Extreme motherboard and 64GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum 2,666MHz DRR4 memory. Configured correctly with whatever software you’re planning on using, be it video rendering or calculating millions of Pi digits, it’ll know what it’s doing before you. You’ll have spotted those three Nvidia GeForce Titan X Pascal graphics cards. Each one is overclocked to over 2,000MHz, which is a significant boost over the 1,531MHz factory boost clock. This is made possible using a custom-built, dedicated liquid cooling loop. This differs from a regular liquid-cooled PC, which will usually only have a single loop shared between the processor and graphics card. Here, the two PC’s two processors get their own loops alongside a third loop for the three primary graphics card and the fourth secondary card in the second system. Related: Best Z170 motherboards to buy Primary storage comes from a 1.2TB, liquid-cooled Intel 750 1.2TB SSD over PCI-E, with secondary storage from a pair of Samsung 850 Pro SSDs in RAID 0 for double the speed. Tertiary storage comes from a 10TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk. Initial graphics benchmarks point to a 3DMark Firestrike score of nearly 41,000. For comparison, a single consumer-level GTX 1080 will manage a little over half that at best. There’s definitely a case of diminishing returns with the more GPUs you add to a system, so if you’re after the best bang-for-buck, you’ll be looking elsewhere. If we were looking at the secondary system in isolation, we’d call it a monster. But as a nested PC inside another, better PC, it becomes harder to remember just how powerful it is. Related: Best SSDs for your gaming rig The Intel Core i7-7700K is a highly-capable quad-core chip overclocked to 5.1GHz, paired with 16GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum 3,200MHz DDR4 memory. There’s a fourth Titan Pascal in here as well for even more 3D performance. It’s all running on a pair of high-end Samsung 960 Pro SSDs in a RAID 0 configuration. There’s a 10TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk in here as well. All of this is inside a Phanteks Enthoo Elite, and the whole thing is powered by a single 2000W power supply. Why? Great question. We suppose the answer is ‘why not?’, but as a buying guide site we pride ourselves on good buying advice. This is the sort of PC(s) you would buy if you have two heavy workloads running at once. For example, you’re a hardcore gamer but also want to run Bitcoin mining or 3D modelling on the side. You’d game on the secondary system and run your high-end applications on the primary PC. If we were to have one gripe, it’s that the two PCs aren’t more interconnected. Pre-installed remoote desktop software would have been extremely handy to keep an eye on each PC without having to switch between monitors, and the ability to perhaps route a single keyboard and mouse to both PCs would also have been nice as well. But these are gripes. Since you’re paying £24,000 for a PC, you’ll probably be able to request extra features from Overclockers. You’ve earned it. If you can afford one, you can buy an OrionX on Overclockers.co.uk. Related: Intel Core i Processors explained Watch: Acer Predator 21X So will you be buying one of these, or perhaps even two?

The international free software community KDE announced the launch of a KDE-branded laptop on Thursday called the KDE Slimbook. Built for KDE fans across the globe, the new Slimbook promises a highly stable computing experience given that KDE developers are using an identical hardware and software configuration when testing their apps. That means apps and hardware issues are resolved before a new version of KDE’s software is distributed to end users. The new Slimbook is based on the KDE Neon platform and the Plasma Desktop interface. Neon is a software repository based on Ubuntu LTS (which is based on Linux) that provides rapid updates of Qt and KDE software while the rest of the Ubuntu-based components installed on the notebook are updated at a normal pace. KDE Plasma is the visual desktop environment built to enhance the Linux computing experience. More: Lenovo issues a new Yoga 2-in-1 BIOS enabling Linux following conspiracy accusations “Spanish laptop retailer Slimbook approached KDE with the idea to offer KDE-branded laptops that come pre-installed with Plasma and KDE Applications,” said KDE’s Thomas Pfeiffer in an update. “We were excited about the idea, and put our designers and developers to the task of creating a branding for such a device and making sure that KDE neon runs without any hardware-related issues on it.” There are two versions of the KDE Slimbook: one with an Intel Core i5-6200U processor and one with an Intel Core i7-6500U, both of which are sixth-generation Skylake chips. Here is a brief rundown of each: Core i5-6200U Core i7-6500U Release date: Q3 of 2015 Q3 of 2015 Cores: 2 2 Threads: 4 4 Base speed: 2.30GHz 2.50GHz Boost speed: 2.80GHz 3.10GHz Cache: 3MB 4MB Maximum power draw: 15 watts 15 watts Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 520 Intel HD Graphics 520 Graphics speed (base): 300MHz 300MHz Graphics speed (max): 1,000MHz 1,050MHz Outside the two processor differences, the KDE Slimbooks are identical in their hardware specifications and options. Here they are: Screen size: 13.3 inches Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 System memory: 4GB DDR3 @ 1,600MHz 8GB DDR3 @ 1,600MHz 16GB DDR3 @ 1,600MHz Storage (Samsung or Crucial): 120GB mSATA SSD 250GB mSATA SSD 500GB mSATA SSD Connectivity: Wireless N Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.0 Ports: 2x USB 3.0 1x Ethernet 1x Mini HDMI1x SD card reader Keyboard: LED-backlit Webcam: Yes Battery: 6,800mAh Size: 13 x 8.66 x 0.70 inches Weight: 3 pounds Outer material: Aluminum Color: Silver According to the specs, the operating system is marked as KDE Neon “for now.” Pfeiffer said that the KDE community is open other to distributions that can be pre-installed with Plasma, offering customers a choice of multiple operating systems. He also pointed out that the KDE Slimbook was created for those who love KDE software, and was not built primarily for those who are active contributors in the KDE community. “We were not content with the quality of laptops available on the market,” explains KDE. “The majority shipped with proprietary and locked-in software solutions, filled with not-uninstallable bloat where the user was left at the mercy of whatever the company selling them a laptop saw fit for them to work with. As creators and makers we knew what it meant to be locked into a set of solutions defined by others.” To purchase the KDE Slimbook, head here. The Intel Core i5 version has a starting price of $779 and the Core i7 model has a starting price of $908. Customers can only configure the amount of system memory, the amount of storage, the wireless connectivity component, and the keyboard layout. Also watch: Share

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around cloud services.  (Richard Drew / The Associated Press file photo)   By Alistair Barr Jillian WardBloomberg Fri., Jan. 27, 2017 Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., which all posted quarterly results Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to $3.4 billion (U.S.) in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own web services. Article Continued Below More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner Inc. estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. In early trading Friday, Microsoft was up 1.6 per cent, Google was down 1.1 per cent and Intel gained less than 1 per cent. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter.  “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. chief financial officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 per cent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Read more about: Apple, Microsoft Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Sleek yet sturdy build. Long battery life. USB-C and Thunderbolt ports. Comfortable keyboard. Thin bezels maximize screen real estate. Fanless processor keeps things quiet and cool. Cons Limited connectivity options. May require additional dongles and accessories. Awkward webcam angle when used in Laptop mode. Bottom Line With the XPS 13 2-in-1, Dell marries the strengths of its ultraportables with the flexibility of a convertible laptop. You'll probably need dongles, but strong performance and ultimate portability make it a worthy contender. By Victoria Song Looking at the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (9365) (starts at $999.99; $1,299.99 as tested), you'd be forgiven for feeling a sense of déjà vu. Thanks to a new fanless Intel Kaby Lake Y-series processor, this 2-in-1 is thinner and quieter than the Dell XPS 13 Touch while retaining all of its strengths. But you may have to borrow a bit of courage from Apple lovers as there are only two ports: USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. This, along with slightly stronger overall performance and battery life from the HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx, means the XPS 13 2-in-1 falls just shy of nabbing our Editors' Choice for high-end convertibles. But if dongles don't scare you and you have cash to splash, you'd be remiss if you didn't put this versatile 2-in-1 on your short list. //Compare Similar Products Compare HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Yoga 910   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Aspire R 14   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Aspire Switch 11 V (SW5-173-632W)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Yoga 710 (11")   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Book (2016, Intel Core i7)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Pro 4   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Notebook 7 Spin   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Yoga 900S   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Spin 7 (SP714-51-M4YD)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Thinner, Quieter... Both the original XPS 13 and this 2-in-1 variation feature the same machined aluminum lids, carbon fiber palm rests, and super-thin 5.2mm InfinityEdge bezels around the display. Visually, the main differences on the 2-in-1 are the steel-wrapped aluminum hinges (of course), the Windows Hello–compliant fingerprint reader next to the touchpad, and the 720p webcam centered underneath the Dell logo. The 2-in-1 is also just a skosh thinner, measuring 0.54 inch at the hinge and tapering down to 0.32 inch at its thinnest point. It also has a width of 11.98 inches and a depth of 7.8 inches. That's more compact than both the Spectre x360 (0.5 by 12 by 8.6 inches, HWD) and the Lenovo Yoga 910 (0.56 by 12.72 by 8.84 inches), our Editors' Choice pick for midrange convertibles. This makes it easy to slip into any bag, and at 2.7 pounds, it won't break your back if you can't find a seat on your daily commute. View All 9 Photos in Gallery The nifty thing about the XPS 13 2-in-1 is that it fits a 13.3-inch display onto an 11-inch chassis. This configuration features a full HD 1,920-by-1,080-resolution touch screen, which is par for the course for the category. While a QHD+ (3,200-by-1,800) screen is a configuration option, full HD is perfectly fine if you primarily stream videos from YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix. And as is the case with other convertible-hybrids, you can use this one in four different modes: Laptop, Tablet, Stand, and Tent. Each is comfortable, though the placement of the webcam makes Stand and Laptop modes less than ideal for video conferencing. Unless you don't mind the person you're talking to looking up at your chin or up your nostrils, you're better off using Tent mode—though that could be frustrating, too, if you like to type and send notes while Skyping. Like the Lenovo Yoga 900S, the XPS 2-in-1 features a fanless Intel processor, which means it's super quiet and there's less heat. A quieter computer is always nice, but the cool factor is particularly good if you're using the XPS in Tablet mode on your lap for long periods of time. When it comes to work, the XPS 2-in-1 is more than capable of handling your average office tasks. The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, you get extra screen space thanks to the thin bezels, and the touchpad is responsive. But I/O port options are limited. Like the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro and the Acer Spin 7, there are no USB Type-A ports. On the left side, you get a Thunderbolt 3 port, a headset jack, a battery gauge indicator, and one speaker. The right side houses a Noble lock slot, a USB-C port, a microSD card slot, the power button, and another speaker. Both the Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ports feature PowerShare capabilities and can double as DisplayPort connectors. Dell includes a USB-C–to–USB-Type-A adapter, though that's not quite enough on its own if you want to use an existing thumb drive, simultaneously charge your phone and laptop, and hook up the 2-in-1 to another monitor. So you can either get creative with the accessories you already have, work around the inconveniences, or shell out for a small arsenal of dongles and adapters. Dell sent us a special power brick that features a USB Type-A port for charging, which is a helpful option but will cost you an extra $40. This won't really be an issue once USB-C becomes more prevalent, but it is an annoyance for the time being. Rounding out features, the XPS 2-in-1 has dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless connectivity, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB PCl Express (PCIe)–based solid-state drive (SSD). This is a decent setup if you're committed to cutting the cord and mostly stream videos, as opposed to storing them locally. The XPS 13 2-in-1 is covered by a one-year limited warranty. Under the Hood Inside, the XPS 13 2-in-1 packs a 1.3GHz Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor with integrated HD Graphics 615, plus 8GB of RAM. That's a combination that results in strong productivity performance at this price. During testing, the 2-in-1 was able to deftly handle multi-tab browsing, streaming, and light productivity tasks. You can see that in its respectable PCMark 8 Work Conventional test score of 3,003 points. It doesn't quite beat out Editors' Choice picks like the Lenovo Yoga 910 (3,197) or the Spectre x360 (3,286), but it's not far off, either. It did, however, outperform the XPS 13 Touch Rose Gold Edition (2,769) and the Lenovo Yoga 900S (2,636), which is powered by the Intel Core m5-6Y54, another fanless processor. See How We Test Laptops It also turned in decent 3D performance, scoring 5,412 points on 3DMark Cloud Gate and 341 points on the more intensive Fire Strike Extreme. That's an improvement over the Lenovo 900S (4,134 on Cloud Gate, 254 on Fire Strike Extreme), but it falls short of the Spectre x360, the Yoga 910, and the XPS 13 Touch. But like its competitors, on our Heaven and Valley gaming tests the XPS 13 2-in-1 wasn't able to reach the 30 frames per second (fps) needed to be smoothly playable, even at midrange graphics settings. If games are a must, you're better off looking at a real gaming laptop. Multimedia scores were also serviceable, though not particularly stellar. The XPS 13 2-in-1 completed our HandBrake encoding test in 3 minutes, 13 seconds, and lagged behind most other comparable systems on Photoshop (3:58). If you spend a lot of time editing photos and videos, or designing graphics, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Spectre x360, and the Yoga 910 are better options. As for staying power, the XPS 13 2-in-1 features a 46Wh battery that lasted an impressive 11 hours, 46 minutes, on our rundown test. That's long enough to get most of the way through a season of Game of Thrones, a transpacific flight to Japan, or an all-day writing session at a cafe (where open power outlets are a scarce commodity). But some rival systems have really upped the competition in this category. The Yoga 910 leads with a ridiculous 21:28, and the Spectre x360 lasts a neat 14 hours. Others hover around the 12-hour mark, like the MacBook Pro (11:53) and the Yoga 900S (12:06). Portable Productivity The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (9365) occupies an interesting spot in the world of convertible laptops, straddling the line between what we consider midrange and high-end. And while its performance and features are good for its price point, it falls just short in testing against our high-end Editors' Choice pick, the HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx—which is roughly the same price. The same holds true when you compare it with the slightly less expensive Lenovo Yoga 910, our Editors' Choice for midrange 2-in-1s. So why would you opt for the XPS 13 2-in-1? There are plenty of reasons, ranging from its sleek look and excellent build quality to its quiet and cool performance and that little bit of extra screen space. While the lack of USB Type-A ports is irksome now, including Thunderbolt and USB-C does future-proof the XPS 2-in-1 for years to come. Ultimately, if you value a compact form factor and solid productivity performance, the XPS 13 2-in-1 should definitely be on your radar.

We've shown you what Kaby Lake can do for enthusiast and gamer desktop platforms. We've even recently explored optimizing its price/performance ratio through overclocking, and of course, Kaby Lake notebooks led Intel's charge starting in the summer of last year. What we haven't gotten a chance to look at yet is Intel's lowest powered Kaby Lake variant, known as Kaby Lake-Y. Kaby Lake-Y is the the 4.5 - 7 Watt family of processors intended for thin and light, fanless 2-in-1 devices. Fortunately, since this little fella just showed up, we now can offer you a view of performance with the complete Kaby Lake family lineage, at least as it currently exists today...  Dell's XPS 13 2-in-1 - Review In Progress - A Super-Svelte Beauty That's the XPS 13 2-in-1, a 2.7 pound, thinner and lighter version of Dell's venerable 13-inch premium notebook, now with a 360-degree hinge. It also has a smaller 45 Whr battery versus the standard XPS 13's 60 Whr power plant. However, it shares lots of common design features, like the same gorgeous 400-nits 13.3" Infinity Edge display, a PCI Express Solid State Drive, and tasty carbon fiber composite and machined aluminum construction.  However, in what some might consider a bold move for an "XPS" branded product, Dell elected to go with Intel's low power Kaby Lake-Y series of processors, versus the traditional U series commonly found in premium thin notebook designs. Dell did work significant optimizations into the design though, taking advantage of Kaby Lake's TDP-up feature that allow the 4.5 Watt processor to boost higher in Dynamic Power Mode to a 7 Watt power envelope. In addition, Dell took that capability a step further and engineered the XPS 13 2-In-1 to be able to boost to a 9 Watt TDP for short bursts, with a healthy 3.6GHz top end clock speed. Above is a shot of the full Intel Kaby Lake lineage, though what you don't see here is what Intel typically introduces a year or so down the road from initial launch, which are the big iron E-series chips, as the company rolled out fairly recently with Broadwell-E and eventually will for Skylake-E. What we're looking at today is what Kaby Lake can do in its most power-optimized incarnation in the Y-Series family, which is designed for 2-in-1 convertible machines, which are often fanless designs, like Dell's new XPS 13 2-in-1. What Dell sent us was a carefully selected setup with the following specs: XPS 13 2-In-1 Model 9365 Core i7-7Y75 with 4MB Cache, Up To 3.6GHz 8GB LPDDR3-1866MHz 256GB PCIe SSD 1920x1080 FHD Touch Display MSRP $1299 (As tested, starting at $999) That Core i7-7Y75 is the top-end Kaby Lake-Y CPU Intel has to offer currently and Dell pushes it even further in the XPS 13 2-In-1's design to a 9 Watt peak power envelope. We would be remiss if we didn't point out that, yes, Intel has done away almost completely with the "Core m" moniker with Kaby Lake, choosing instead to denote the series in the root of the model number, like it does with the U series (as in Core i7-7Y75). However, the company does list lower-end Core m3 variants of Kaby Lake as such, while i5 and i7 higher-end SKUs are only distinguishable with the Y in the root of the model number. Clear as mud right?  Regardless, here's a quick peek, ahead of our soon-to-be-published full review, of what this new machine can do and what the fastest Kaby Lake-Y setup you can likely buy today can offer in terms of comparable performance.  In these two tests, we see the Dell XPS 13 2-In-1, along with its goosed-up Kaby Lake Core i7-7Y75 chip, take on the likes of full fledged Kaby Lake U series chips like the Core i7-7500U in the standard Dell XPS 13 and ASUS ZenBook 3. As you can see, this new Dell machine hangs with its U-series counterparts just fine, in a virtual dead-heat in SunSpider and a respectable top 3 showing in PCMark 8. In PCMark, the Core i7-7Y75 does line up more akin to last generation Haswell-U 6th generation processors, like the Core i7-6500U and Core i5-6200U, but it's not far behind Kaby Lake U in this test.

Microsoft rose 1.9 percent to $65.50 in premarket trading, while Intel gained 0.4 percent to $37.71 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time and giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks. All three major indexes were on track to post weekly gains. "The market has had a strong, solid rally and there's a pause to evaluate and react to the next set of data and other catalysts that could move the market," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. "Actions speak louder than words and the fact that Trump has signed numerous executive orders since his inauguration continues to heighten hopes of the proposed fiscal stimulus measures materializing," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Dow e-minis were down 11 points, or 0.05 percent, with 16,071 contracts changing hands at 8:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, with 85,805 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 17,615 contracts. Early fourth-quarter earnings have also boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 146 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 69.2 percent have topped expectations. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product increasing at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Another set of data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in December, with non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rising 0.8 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5 percent rise. Starbucks fell 4.2 percent to $56 in premarket trading after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. Google parent Alphabet was down 1 percent at $848.51 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 4.5 percent to $65.15 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates.

Image: MeskPhotography/Shutterstock As the world focuses on science wars in the US, internet of things developments continue unabated across the globe. While the scientific community tears itself apart following the inauguration of US president Donald Trump, within the world of the internet of things (IoT), there was some rather positive news. The European Space Agency had a busy week funding tech companies in Ireland, following up its deal to bring OCE Technology’s software into space with a €633,000 Taoglas deal to commercialise its IoT tech. The people behind Taoglas, provider of antenna products and radio frequency solutions within the IoT ecosystem, have previously been described as the ‘Irish high kings of IoT’. Elsewhere in the world of academia, there was a long-term collaboration between Intel and Dublin City University announced to foster talent and develop advanced technologies for both parties. Some of the key areas of research activity will include IoT and data analytics for application in areas such as connected health, water quality management and STEM education innovations. Across the pond, Intel have IoT to thank for its healthy returns in its latest quarterly earnings report, as it revealed earnings of $16.4bn, compared with $14.9bn at the same time last year. This was largely down to Intel’s IoT division showing a 16pc year-on-year growth margin. Here are some of the other global IoT stories you might have missed during the week. Ericsson out east Ericsson is trailing new cellular IoT technologies in China, after striking up a deal with China Mobile Group Shanghai Company and Mobike, a bike-sharing service. Operating on a live network, the trial utilises Ericsson’s tech to allow Mobike’s IoT-enabled bikes to be located more accurately, as well as extending the coverage beyond current barriers. Moving forward, the new technologies will also significantly reduce the time taken to unlock the bikes and users will enjoy ‘open upon scanning’ without waiting. Saying his group is excited by the partnership, Gang Huang, deputy GM of China Mobile Group Shanghai Company, wants to build a new suite of technologies. “Ericsson is determined to drive the development and commercialisation of the cellular IoT ecosystem and, in doing so, unleash the full potential of the networked society,” said Ericsson’s Chris Houghton. Threats are mounting AdaptiveMobile has released new research into the biggest mobile threats of 2016, and how 2017’s mobile security landscape will take shape. The security company expects to see a large-scale signalling attack on an operator network in 2017, a sophistication of messaging threats and a rise in phishing attacks as well as IoT attacks running behind the public firewall. The research identifies five vectors through which cyber-criminals made their attacks in 2016, from SMS to OTT carriers. Infographic: AdaptiveMobile Alexa on the road Amazon’s AI Alexa is making inroads into an increasing number of homes through the Echo device, but it’s focusing on roads for now. Hyundai and Volkswagen (VW) cars are the latest to embrace the technology (Ford and BMW have already made moves). VW is the first to actually install Alexa directly into the vehicle’s infotainment system, with drivers able to control lights, heating or entertainment functions through connected devices. One clever tweak allows users to ask Alexa how much petrol is in the car, from the comfort of their home. It’s not a whole lot different for Hyundai, with the manufacturer ‘bringing the car to Alexa’, rather than the other way around, whatever that means. This can be upgraded in old Hyundai vehicles. “We are first and foremost trying to give customers what they want,” said Cason Grover, who manages Hyundai Motor America’s connected car programme. “We know that customers have oriented and invited certain experiences into their life via their phones and via the devices in the home.” Google fancies some Raspberry Pi Earlier this week, Google provided a market research survey to the makers’ industry, sounding out what people want, when and how. Following that, news of a Raspberry Pi project emerged, with Google deciding between bringing IoT devices to its Pi 3 platform, or Intel’s Edison platform. “We don’t have any specifics to announce right now, but we’re excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community – stay tuned for more this year,” a Google spokesman told CIO. Raspberry Pi seems enthusiastic, blogging the significance of this project’s potential. Noting the huge range of tools developed by Google (Home, Maps, Google Now etc), Raspberry Pi is banging the tech giant’s drum. “The survey will help them get a feel for the Raspberry Pi community, but it’ll also help us get the kinds of services we need,” it reads.

Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Jan 27, 2017 at 9:31AM After the closing bell on Thursday, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2016. Here's what you need to know. Intel's fourth-quarter results: The raw numbers Metric Q4 2016 Q4 2015 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $16.4 billion $14.9 billion 10% Net income $3.6 billion $3.6 billion Flat GAAP EPS $0.73 $0.74 (1%) Data source: Intel (PDF). What happened with Intel this quarter? The fourth quarter continued the business trends Intel established in the last few reports, with data center and Internet of Things products rising in prominence. The lumpy non-volatile memory segment led the way in the fourth quarter with a 25% year-over-year sales increase. For the full year, the memory division's sales actually declined by 1%. Among the more predictable business segments, the Internet of Things group saw sales rising 16% in the fourth quarter, while data-center revenues increased by 8%. Client-computing sales grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 2% in fiscal year 2016. Within the data-center and client-computing segments, unit volumes fell year over year, but increasing average sale prices more than made up for that trend. Desktop volumes are declining faster than notebooks, and Intel is selling fewer products designed for x86 tablets these days. The client-computing group also boosted its operating income by 30%, accounting for 62% of Intel's total segment profits. That ratio stood at 53% in the year-ago quarter. Intel's management provided detailed guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year of 2017, as follows: In the first quarter, revenues are seen rising 7% year over year, to $14.8 billion. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings should stop at $0.56 per share For the full year, total sales should hold steady at roughly $59.4 billion. GAAP earnings are expected to rise 19%, landing near $2.53 per share. Capital expenses should approach $12 billion, up from $9.6 billion in 2016.  Image source: Intel. What management had to say Intel CEO Brian Krzanich saw 2016 playing out as a period of transformation, integrating the $16.7 billion Altera acquisition and investing to exploit future growth opportunities. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," Krzanich said in a prepared statement. "I'm pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future." Looking ahead Intel will flesh out its current strategy in more detail on February 9 when the company holds its annual investor conference. As an Intel shareholder, I can't wait to hear more about that drastic increase in capital spending, and in what direction this investment will move Intel. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel.

Inclusion of a key feature in future cellular modems could help Apple rely less on Qualcomm, a company it just launched litigation against. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 8:21AM With the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has ever enjoyed. Image source: Apple.  Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA. Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety of Apple's cellular modem needs. Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that "Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and chipset supply terms," the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read. I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and today there is an observation I would like to share regarding Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones. Apple's component costs could come down if Intel succeeds in implementing CDMA Based on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain features enabled, compared with variants without those features enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work. Image source: Qualcomm.  What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a "monopolistic premium." The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the opportunity for Intel. If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open the door to a couple of possibilities: Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It could be a true "second source" for all the iPhones that Apple ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment). Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular modem. Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems. This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and, ultimately, net profit. To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20 for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7, Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips; the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel. If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year. That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are significant. Intel needs to execute The key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper modems. The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume -- whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate. In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip business probably isn't going to sting Qualcomm that much. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on the right track. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

During the BETT 2017 convention in London, Lenovo revealed its latest products for the educational market that included updated ThinkPad 11e and ThinkPad 11e Yoga laptops. Both are part of Microsoft’s new “Intune for Education” program aimed to push Windows 10 into the educational system and seemingly target the low-priced Chromebook market. However, Lenovo knows many of its customers love Chrome OS, and plans to ship Chromebook versions of these two models as well. But that’s not all. Lenovo also plans to introduce the Lenovo N23 Chromebook next month followed by the Lenovo N23 Yoga Chromebook in April, and then the Lenovo N24 laptop later this year. However, as shown in the table below, Lenovo’s new Chromebooks targeting the educational sector will still be a cheaper option than the Windows 10 units on the pricing front. Whether or not that rumored Windows 10 licensing fee reduction applied to these laptops is unknown for now. Windows 10 Chrome OS ThinkPad 11e: February Starting @ $519 ($419 for Shape the Future) May Starting @ $369 ThinkPad 11e Yoga: February Starting @ $599 ($499 for Shape the Future) May Starting @ $449 Lenovo N24: Mid 2017 Pricing unknown N/A Lenovo N23: N/A February Starting @ $199 Lenovo N23 Yoga: N/A April Starting @ $279 Despite the announcement, Lenovo didn’t provide any hardware details regarding the upcoming laptops, nor have the units appeared on the company’s website. All we currently have to go on is a general list of features for each until the products show up online. More: Lenovo’s Legion Y720 is a laptop designed specifically for virtual reality For starters, the following table shows the ThinkPad 11e laptops with Windows and Chrome OS that Lenovo plans to replace next month. There’s really no difference between the “vanilla” clamshell models and the convertible “Yoga” units save for the obvious screen flexibility with the Yoga models, and the added Windows 7 Pro option for the clamshell models. ThinkPad 11e Windows ThinkPad 11e Chrome OS Form factor: Clamshell Convertible (Yoga only) Clamshell Convertible (Yoga only) Operating system: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Pro Windows 7 Pro Chrome OS Screen size: 11.6 inches 11.6 inches Resolution: 1,366 x 768 1,366 x 768 Processor: Intel Core i3-6100U Intel Celeron N3150 Intel Pentium 4405U Intel Celeron N3150 Graphics: Up to Intel HD 520 Integrated Intel graphics Memory: Up to 8GB DDR3L @ 1,600MHz Up to 4GB DDR3L @ 1,600MHz Storage: 128GB SSD 192GB SSD 256GB SSD 16GB eMMC Connectivity: Wireless N Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless N Bluetooth 4.0 Battery: 42 Watt hour 42 Watt hour Webcam: 720p 720p Ports: 1x HDMI 1.4 2x USB 3.0 1x SD card reader 1x Ethernet port 1x HDMI 1.4 2x USB 3.0 1x SD card reader Size: 11.81 x 8.27 x 0.88 inches 11.81 x 8.27 x 0.88 inches Weight: Starting at 3.3 pounds Starting at 3.3 pounds As for what the new ThinkPad 11e and ThinkPad Yoga 11e models will provide, here is what Lenovo offers in the details department: The latest Intel processors. Brighter screens. Gorilla glass protection. A water-resistant keyboard. New and improved mechanically anchored keys. Up to 10 hours of battery life. Yoga 11e comes with a pen supporting Windows Ink. Next, we have the upcoming N23 Chromebooks that will be served up in traditional clamshell and convertible “Yoga” flavors. Lenovo said the N23 Yoga Chromebook will be the company’s very first Chromebook with an ARM-based processor. That means the device will be optimized for Android apps sold in the Google Play Store even though all Chromebooks launching in 2017 and thereafter will work just fine with Android apps. “Simple to set-up and manage, both N23 Chromebooks offer students a personalized user experience simply by signing in with their Google Chrome ID while teachers and IT administrators have peace of mind and ultimate flexibility with a web-based management console,” Lenovo said. Here are the N23 Chromebook highlights: Traditional clamshell and Yoga flavors. Reinforced ports and hinges. Mechanically anchored keys. Water-resistant keyboard. 10 hours of battery life. Finally, we have the Lenovo N24 convertible notebook based on Windows 10. Given it won’t be made available until sometime around this summer, the company revealed very little about its details. However, what we know is that it will sport an 11.6-inch IPS screen that can rotate a full 360 degrees. This screen will support 10-point touch input and Lenovo’s Active Pen when the Lenovo N24 arrives later this year. Also watch: Share

These are its first Optane storage solutions. Intel will also be releasing Optane memory DIMMs to fit DDR4 slots in servers, PCs and so on. In an earnings call a few hours ago, in the wake of its latest financials, Intel's CEO said Optane memory DIMMs had started to ship to partners for testing. While we have seen impressive demonstrations of Optane storage solutions, less is known about the impact that 3D XPoint technology will have when used in place of RAM DIMMs. Intel gave us some insight into its future plans for 3D XPoint memory solutions a couple of years back when we first heard about this new non-volatile memory tech. As alluded to in the video above, Optane is expected to "completely rewrite the rules of the hot-warm-cold storage pyramid" which determines data server performance, due to its nature of being nearly as fast as DRAM but with similar costs to SSD NAND storage. With Optane memory DIMMs available it is thought servers will be able to "greatly expand" the high performance hot storage capacity available. Ahead of this Optane tech SSDs are already arriving to perk up the 'warm storage' performance available - without breaking the bank. It is evident that the above is the reasoning behind Brian Krzanich's statement in the earnings call last night, saying that the "differential technology," provided by Optane products could change PC and server architectures. Data Centre is a very successful segment for Intel and hopefully any architectural revolution in that industry thanks to Optane will trickle down to the PCs of tomorrow. Already, for example, new Lenovo, Dell, Intel and HP PCs and SuperO motherboards have been announced with Optane storage options.

Miller January 26, 2017 10 Comments The PC has a lot of life left, as proven by the latest announcements at CES. Every year people seem surprised that there's a lot of activity at CES when it comes to PCs and notebooks. I guess it's just that the PC category has been slowly shrinking over the past few years, though the gaming and corporate segments of the market continue to do well. In any case, this year's show demonstrated a number of advances that indicate the PC still has a lot of life left in it. To begin with, Intel announced some new versions of its Kaby Lake processors—the seventh generation of its Core i family and the third iteration using a 14nm FinFET process—including the high-end Corei7-7700K. (ExtremeTech has some benchmarks here.) Overall, the 7000 series looks to be a nice but not huge upgrade over the Skylake versions, offering a bit higher clock speed and a bit better power envelope. Still, it's good to have a full line of new chips out there—it will spur a lot of new upgrades. Of course, Intel is pointing to much larger leaps in performance compared to three-year-old machines, claiming 25 percent better performance on productivity applications and 35 percent faster performance creating, stitching, and sharing 4K 360° videos. Some of the more interesting new features include support for the upcoming Intel Optane memory (based on 3D XPoint technology), decode and encode for HEVC 10-bit and VP9 formats, and Intel Authenticate for hardened security and 2-factor authentication. Intel also showed off a running 2-in-1 design with its 10nm Cannon Lake chips, which are expected to ship toward the end of 2017. (In yesterday's post, I talked a bit about plans for making 10nm chips from the other major foundries.) Meanwhile, competitor AMD is getting closer to the release of its first Ryzen processors, which introduce the new Zen architecture, and look to make AMD much more of a player in the mid- and high-end parts of the PC market. AMD says that the Zen architecture has a number of new features, including what it is calling "SenseMI" technology. That includes new features to better manage energy and increase frequency at the same power, as well as a "neural net" to improve branch predictions, and a smart prefetch, both designed to improve the efficiency of the processors. At the show, AMD announced a series of motherboards that support the processors' AM4 socket from ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, and MSI, designed to support the upcoming X300 and X370 chipsets as part of its "Summit Ridge" series of processors. The company also showed off a variety of sample systems, mostly from smaller vendors. It is still promising that such systems will launch later this quarter. A lot of us are waiting to see how well such systems perform in the real world. AMD has said its "Raven Ridge" series of notebook processors based on the Zen architecture will be out later this year. In addition, AMD also disclosed preliminary details for its next generation graphics architecture, called Vega. This will use a new high-bandwidth memory cache and controller using HBM2 rather than the more common GDDR5 memory. It will also have a new programmable geometry pipeline, a new rasterizer designed to be more power efficient, and flexible compute units that can natively work on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit operations. Products using this architecture are due in the first half of the year. Competitor Nvidia showed off a new service called GeForce Now, which lets any Windows or Mac user get access to games via a cloud service that runs on the company's GeForce graphics boards, with pricing set at $25 for 20 hours on a GTX 1060 or 10 hours on a GTX 1080. This is slated to be available in early access form in March. In one interesting departure from the norm, Qualcomm showed off a laptop running a test version of Windows using its Snapdragon 835 processor. This should be able to run 32-bit legacy X86 applications through emulation, as well as modern Windows Store applications. It will be interesting to see both pricing and performance when such machines come to market. Business Notebooks On the PC front, I'm most interested in the improvements in corporate notebooks, which seem to be getting thinner and lighter, as well as offering the newest generation of Intel processors. Lenovo showed off a new version of its Carbon X1 that is notably lighter and smaller than the previous model, at just 2.5 pounds (compared to 2.75 for the previous version), and also boasts better battery life (at a claimed 15.5 hours compared with 11 hours; although as usual I almost never get the claimed battery performance from any vendor in the real world) and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 support. It should be available in February. The touchscreen-based 2-in-1 version, the X1 Yoga, was also updated and should also include similar battery improvement and USB-C/Thunderbolt support. It also offers a new keyboard design. The X1 tablet has also been updated. HP's newest entry is the EliteBook x360, which brings the convertible kinds of features found in the company's 13.3-inch Spectre x360 2-in-1 to the enterprise line. HP is claiming 16 hours and 30 minutes of battery life–which would be longer than any of its competitors—an optional 4K display, and a self-healing BIOS. The company also announced a new 15.6-inch version of its Spectre x360, with a 4K display and GeForce 940MX graphics. Both should be available this month. Dell introduced magnetic resonance charging with its new Latitude 7285 2-in-1, using technology from WiTricity including WiGig docking. This should be out later in the year. The company also introduced upgrades to its Latitude 700 series of "Ultrabooks", which are available now, as well as a new Latitude 5285 2-in-1, due out at the end of next month. Among other vendors, Asus introduced its new Asus Pro, with a 14-inch full HD display at just 2.3 pounds, while LG showed off three new models in its Gram family, with 13.3, 14, and 15.6-inch full HD displays. These are extremely light, but with two different sizes of battery available, so you could get a 13.3 inch version at just 2.07 pounds, with a 60 Wh battery and claimed battery life of 24 hours (with the usual caveats), or a version with a 34 Wh battery that weighs just 1.83 pounds. It was also interesting to see Samsung's newest take on Chromebooks, with the Chromebook Pro using a Core m3 Skylake processor, and the Chromebook Plus, using an undisclosed ARM processor. Both include 12.3-inch quad-HD touch screens, a stylus, and weigh 2.38 pounds. Gaming Notebooks There were also a number of new gaming laptops. Lenovo offered a new name for its gaming systems, calling it Legion, with the Y520 and Y720, both with Core i7 processors, but the first including a 4K display and GeForce GTX1080 graphics card. Dell showed off a number of new systems, including new versions of its Alienware 13, 15, and 17 laptops, with new processors and Nvidia graphics. In addition, the company showed its Inspiron 15 7000 series, which can include the latest processors, GeForce 1050 or 1050 Ti graphics, and full HD or 4K displays, starting at $799. Samsung stepped into the market with its new Odyssey gaming notebook, which will come in 15.6 and 17.3-inch sizes. Desktop Innovations A number of companies showed new desktop ideas, but the most interesting was probably the Dell Canvas. This is a 27-inch QHD (2560-by-1440) display that can connect to any other PC and be used at an angle or flat on a desk for drawing or other work that involves a pen. It looked a bit like Microsoft's larger Surface Studio, and will require the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Edition. Even higher end is a new UltraSharp 32 Ultra 8k monitor. And both LG and Samsung showed great looking curved monitors as well. I also liked the look of the HP Envy Curved All-in-One 34, with a widescreen WQHD display. Meanwhile, Dell showed off new versions of its XPS and Precision all-in-ones. Finally, I was a bit intrigued by a company called Endless, which makes tiny computers with its own operating system (Endless OS), effectively a stripped-down Linux distribution with all the tools and documentation, including articles and video designed to help people learn how to program. The company has been pushing the concept for a while, but is now entering the U.S. market, offering ARM-based configurations as well as a new model in a wood case, including ARM and Celeron versions. It's a neat idea, particularly if you have a child who wants to learn to code on a real machine. Back to top Previous : The Technology That May Drive The Next Generation of Phones ... By Michael J.

Inclusion of a key feature in future cellular modems could help Apple rely less on Qualcomm, a company it just launched litigation against. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 8:21AM With the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has ever enjoyed. Image source: Apple.  Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA. Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety of Apple's cellular modem needs. Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that "Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and chipset supply terms," the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read. I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and today there is an observation I would like to share regarding Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones. Apple's component costs could come down if Intel succeeds in implementing CDMA Based on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain features enabled, compared with variants without those features enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work. Image source: Qualcomm.  What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a "monopolistic premium." The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the opportunity for Intel. If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open the door to a couple of possibilities: Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It could be a true "second source" for all the iPhones that Apple ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment). Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular modem. Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems. This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and, ultimately, net profit. To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20 for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7, Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips; the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel. If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year. That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are significant. Intel needs to execute The key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper modems. The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume -- whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate. In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip business probably isn't going to sting Qualcomm that much. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on the right track. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

News Week In Review: Dow Hits 20K On Trump Rally; Boeing Hot, Google Iced The Dow industrials hit 20,000 as the Trump rally fueled infrastructure and financial stocks. (Adobe) IBD STAFF 1/27/2017 Reprints The Dow Jones industrial average hit 20,000 as the major averages rallied to fresh record highs on President Trump's early policy moves. Earnings reports generally were positive, but Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) were among those with disappointing results. M&A deals, buzz and rejections were rife. Dow Industrials Hit Milestone As Banks, Infrastructure Stocks Lead The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% for the week, topping 20,000 for the first time. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also hit record highs, up 1.9% and 1%, respectively, amid a slew of earnings, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA) and Boeing (BA). President Trump authorized a border wall and two key oil pipelines, lifting a wide variety of construction and materials related firms such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), but not steel makers. Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) broke out, joining other FANG+ stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield rose, lifting bank stocks. Alphabet Earnings Fall Short Google parent Alphabet said Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 8% to $9.36, below views for $9.64. Total revenue rose 22% to $26.1 billion, topping forecasts for 25.26 billion. Revenue growth slowed from 28% in the prior-year period. The internet search and advertising giant faced tough comparisons with the prior-year quarter, when it launched new advertising products. Capital spending soared 46% to $3.1 billion, which much of that related to its cloud computing efforts. Marketing costs for Google's new Pixel smartphones also were heavy. Alphabet shares fell 1.4% on Friday after hitting record highs earlier in the week. RELATED: Alphabet Q4 EPS Misses Expectations Microsoft Expands As Cloud Business Booms Fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9% to 83 cents a share while revenue climbed 2% to $26.07 billion, beating views for 79 cents and $25.30 billion. Credit a booming cloud computing business, including Azure. Microsoft guided Q3 revenue forecasts higher. Microsoft shares rose nearly 5% for the week, hitting record highs. RELATED: Microsoft Beats Q2 Targets On Cloud Computing Strength Intel, Other Chip Earnings Strong The chipmaker's EPS rose 4%, topping views, while its 10% sales growth was the best in four years. Intel also gave bullish guidance. Intel shares rose 1.1% Friday after breaking out of a base earlier in the week ahead of earnings. Texas Instruments (TXN) also reported strong earnings, while Samsung Electronics credit memory chip gains for its overall Q4 profit revival. Microsemi (MSCC) also had good results, along with chip gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). But mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), facing FTC charges and Apple lawsuits over its licensing practices, reported mixed results. RELATED: Intel Q4 Earnings, Sales Top Expectations, Revenue Guidance Also Beats U.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years The economy expanded at a 1.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, below views for 2.2% and not much more than half of Q3's 3.5% gain. For 2016, U.S. GDP grew just 1.6%, the 11th straight year below 3%. Meanwhile, durable goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in December. New-home sales tumbled to a 10-month low, though several homebuilders remained bullish after reporting solid earnings. Starbucks, McDonald's Revivals Doubted Starbucks (SBUX) reported its weakest earnings growth in five years, though that met views. Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out. McDonald's tested key support levels initially but closed the week up 0.5%. RELATED: Too Much Of A Good Thing? This Weighed On Starbucks' U.S. Performance McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Amid Turnaround Doubts Judge Blocks Aetna-Humana Deal A federal judge ruled that the $37 billion Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) merger would violate antitrust laws by unduly reducing competition among health insurers. Aetna, which owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, may appeal. The deal also throws into doubt the proposed $48 billion Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger deal, which the Justice Department also opposes. RELATED: Aetna's $37 Billion Deal For Humana Blocked By Federal Judge Steel Stocks Break 50-Day Lines, Try To Recover Several steel makers sold off during the week, breaking below their 50-day lines as earnings reports failed to support stocks after a postelection run, even as President Trump touted various infrastructure plans and signaled more protectionism. AK Steel (AKS) topped views Tuesday, but shares reversed sharply lower on a weak pricing outlook. Steel Dynamics (STLD), which had decent earnings late Tuesday, tumbled Wednesday. Larger peers U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), which both report on Jan. 31, also sold off. But many of the steel makers rebounded Thursday and Friday. On the upside, specialty steel firm Allegheny Steel (ATI) delivered stellar earnings Tuesday, sending shares up 31% that day. RELATED: Steel Stocks Break Key Support Even As Trump Rally Resumes AK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both Ways Boeing Flies, Lockheed Falters Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. but is bullish about President Trump's tax reforms and regulations. Boeing reported Q4 EPS and revenue above analyst views. Its guidance was cautious, but its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive,which bodes well for future stock buybacks and dividend increases. Boeing shares broke out of a base, hitting record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q4 earnings and revenue above analyst views with aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, soaring 23% to $5.41 billion. It expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year. But Lockheed gave weak guidance amid continued concerns about F-35 costs, sending shares lower. Northrop Grumman (NOC) beat on Q4 views while Raytheon (RTN) fell short. Like Boeing and Lockheed, they gave weak guidance. General Dynamics (GD) reported strong earnings and gave bullish long-term guidance.

Verizon reported a mixed Q4, with revenue falling 5.4% but beating estimates while EPS was light. Wireless margins missed. Management pushed back its goal of returning to wireless service growth to 2018. The close of Verizon's purchase of Yahoo (YHOO) will be delayed until Q2 as regulators look into its data breaches. AT&T (T) reported in-line Q4 EPS, with revenue and EBITDA slightly below consensus. AT&T again lost wireless postpaid phone subscribers. AT&T remained upbeat on regulatory approval of its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition. Comcast (CMCSA) Q4 earnings topped views amid solid subscriber gains. The cable TV firm plans to buy back $5 billion in shares in 2017, hiked its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Comcast plans to launch its wireless service buy midyear. Comcast rose 3% for the week to new highs. RELATED: Verizon Stock Falls; EPS, Revenue Outlook More Of The Same Verizon, Charter Talks Heating Up?

Celgene (CELG) missed on sales even after preannouncing Q4 results. Biogen (BIIB) stock popped despite light sales on "better-than-feared" 2017 guidance following its hemophilia unit spinoff. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) missed on earnings and gave weak EPS guidance amid weaker lung cancer drug prospects.

Along with bullish guidance, the results suggested a multiyear slump disk-drive shipments may have bottomed. Both companies are also investing heavily in flash-based chip storage, following market needs. Seagate shares shot up 22% and Western Digital 9%, both setting 15-month bests.

Pic: Shutterstock 27 Jan 2017 at 13:26, Gareth Corfield Intel's profits dipped slightly in the last quarter of 2016, with income for the entire year down by 9 per cent. Following the 5 per cent hit its share price took when the quarter's forward guidance was published in October last year, Intel hasn't failed to disappoint investors. Although revenues were up year-on-year, from $14.9bn in the fourth quarter last year to $16.3bn in Q416, profits shrank by $50m – dipping to $3.56bn from $3.61bn. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief exec, said in a canned statement. That transformative year includes decimating the company workforce by firing 12,000 as its response to the ongoing collapse of the desktop PC market. Delving into the business segments, Intel's IoT group revenues were $2.6bn, up 15 per cent year-on-year for Q4, with its security group posting revenues of $2.2bn for the same period, up 9 per cent year-on-year. The data centre group posted $4.67bn in revenue for the quarter, up by 8 per cent on the group's 2015 Q4 revenues. Revenues for the full year grew from £34.7bn in 2015 to $36.2bn last year. Profits, however, were down by a full billion over the 12-month period, from 2015's $11.4bn to $10.3bn. "I'm pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future," chipped in Krzanich, who didn't find space in his canned quotes to note that Intel's forward guidance for financial year 2017 states that Chipzilla's revenues will be "flat". The firm's share price dropped from $37.70 at the close of play on the NASDAQ last night to $37.60 at the time of writing. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Regular or premium?

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Optane: What users can expect in PCs and when it will ship Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Intel's Optane technology is already shipping in the form of storage, but you'll have to wait until next year to buy Optane memory modules. Optane is a new class of nonvolatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Intel and Micron. Intel's first Optane products, announced this month at CES, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into the storage slots of PCs. Optane memory DIMMs are different. They're intended to replace DRAM in servers and PCs. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and hopes to release final products next year. In demonstrations by Intel, Optane SSDs have performed 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. PC makers have said that game play, PC bootup and applications are all faster with Optane SSDs. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Less is known about Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units out to enterprise hardware makers for testing. Intel has said Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. The base technology of both types of Optane products, 3D Xpoint, is a bridge between memory and storage, said Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO, during an earnings call on Thursday. Optane is "differential technology" that could change PC and server architectures, Krzanich said. Intel has also floated the idea that Optane could unite storage and memory. For example, one Optane unit could serve as both storage and DRAM. Optane's ability to move large amounts of data faster inside computers and data centers could help speed up machine-learning tasks, Krzanich said. Optane also aligns with Intel's goal to focus more on data-center technologies, Krzanich said. In April, Intel made data-center products a centerpiece of its future strategy as it tried to break a longtime reliance on PCs. But PC chips took in more than half of Intel's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $16.4 billion, growing by $1.5 billion from the same quarter last year. Net income was $3.6 billion, down about 1 percent. Revenue for the Client Computing Group, which deals in PC chips, was up $9.1 billion, growing by 4 percent compared with the same quarter of the previous year. PC chip revenue got a boost from higher average selling prices of laptops and desktops. Desktop product shipments went down 9 percent, but prices went up 2 percent. Laptop product shipments were flat, but average selling prices were up 3 percent. Sales of PCs with higher-end chips like Core i7 were strong during the holiday season, Krzanich said. In particular, gaming PCs did really well. The Data Center Group, which deals in server chips and data-center equipment, recorded revenue of $4.7 billion, growing by 8 percent. Intel's Internet of Things Group had revenue of $726 million, growing 16 percent.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 27 January 2017 | MYT 6:09 PM Data centre growth drives Intel's fourth-quarter revenue, profit beat Better than expected: Intel CEO Brian Krzanich speaking during a press conference at CES in Las Vegas, Jan 4. Revenue from the company's data centre business rose 8.4% in the fourth quarter. — Reuters Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilising PC market and growth in its data centre business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4% to US$4.67bil (RM20.7bil) in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3% to US$9.13bil (RM40.46bil). Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments – which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations – fell by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9% decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilising demand. "In the data centre group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centres, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8% to US$16.37bil (RM72.54bil), beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75bil (RM69.8bil), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned US$0.79 (RM3.50) per share, beating estimates of US$0.74 (RM3.28) per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56bil (RM15.78bil), or US$0.73 (RM3.23) per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, from US$3.61bil (RM16bil), or US$0.74 per share, a year earlier.  The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat which, according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8bil (RM65.59bil), plus or minus US$500mil (RM2.22bil). Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53bil (RM64.39bil). Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Jan 26. Up to Jan 26's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5% in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60% rise in the broader semiconductor index. — Reuters You May Be Interested Chinese Lunar New Year ticket snatching apps raise hackles Facebook Stories takes a hint from Snapchat Twitter adds 'explore' to make finding tweets easier Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Ponkan oranges choice of the season Singing out strong for a night out Pacesetting Rose blooms as Woods fades at Torrey Pines advertisement Latest News China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries PayPal outlook muted on mobile competition, currency trends Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 Most Viewed in Tech China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Chinese Lunar New Year ticket snatching apps raise hackles Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries China girlfriend rental app gets leg up from Lunar New Year demand STMicro to supply iPhone 8 parts?

Image: justyle/Shutterstock Chip giant Intel has reported fourth quarter revenues of $16.4bn, up from $14.9bn last year. Revenues from IoT are starting to kick in, with 16pc growth in revenues from the new category. The technology giant, which employs more than 4,000 people in Ireland, is finding that its bet on internet of things (IoT) is starting to pay dividends. The company’s IoT division has reported 16pc year-on-year growth. ‘The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel’ – BRIAN KRZANICH Intel’s revenues from non-volatile memory also were up by 25pc year-on-year, to $816m. Intel’s Client Computing Group saw revenues up by 4pc, to $9.1bn, while its Data Center Group reported an 8pc surge in revenues to $4.7bn. Intel Security Group reported revenues of $500m, up 9pc, while its Programmable Solutions Group reported revenues of $1.7bn for the fourth quarter. Restructure and refocus pays dividends for Intel “The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources, while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera and investing in growth opportunities. “I’m pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future.” The strong results signal something of a turnaround for Intel, which last year began a major restructure that resulted in the reduction of staff by 12,000. The company said it was shifting its focus from PCs to chips for data centres and IoT. Intel dolls at a trade show booth.

Usually, funds flow the other way: from Apple to Qualcomm. Apple spends billions of dollars to buy Qualcomm’s chips and license its patented technologies, and Qualcomm is thought to have promised Apple rebates in exchange for Apple’s promise to use only Qualcomm modems in its smartphones. Now Apple is using Intel modems in some of its phones, and apparently Qualcomm has not remitted rebate payments to Apple. The “sweetheart deal” Apple and Qualcomm are thought to have struck has been souring for some time now. First, Apple decided to use Intel’s modems in the iPhone 7 devices designed for the AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile US networks. (Verizon Wireless and Sprint iPhone 7s still use Qualcomm modems.) Late last year, several reports claimed Apple was intentionally throttling the Qualcomm modems to make sure the Sprint and Verizon Wireless phones were not faster than the phones that use Intel modems. Next, Apple agreed to cooperate with South Korean authorities in a lawsuit targeting Qualcomm. The regulators think Qualcomm is charging too much for its patented technologies and getting away with it because the companies that need this technology also need Qualcomm’s chips for their smartphones. Qualcomm has two businesses: making wireless chips and licensing wireless technologies that it has developed and patented. When it comes to smartphones, the company dominates both the chip business and the licensing business. Its patented technologies are “standards essential,” meaning smartphones cannot meet industry standards without them. Qualcomm is required by law to license these technologies at “fair and reasonable terms,” but regulators want to know if Samsung, Apple and other manufacturers are paying inflated prices in order to get access to Qualcomm’s chips. “No license, no chips,” is the accusation U.S. regulators hurled at Qualcomm last week, when they too brought a lawsuit against the company. The Federal Trade Commission, with only three active members during the last week of the Obama Administration, filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California. Qualcomm denied the “no license, no chips charge,” and has also dismissed Apple’s claim it owes the company $1 billion. Qualcomm said it welcomed the opportunity to meet the iPhone maker in court, and also chided Apple for failing to acknowledge Qualcomm’s enormous contribution to smartphone technology. The FTC lawsuit did not trigger a selloff of Qualcomm shares, but the Apple lawsuit has had a clear impact on investors. Qualcomm’s stock was trading down 12% on Monday after the news broke.

As the supply chains of multinational companies become more complex, so does the potential for increased carbon emissions as more products incorporate more parts and materials from across the globe. And as companies become more desperate to shave costs, more goods are produced in countries where environmental regulations tend to be weaker than in wealthier nations. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that a more sustainable and efficient supply chain can mitigate a company’s impact on the environment, while scoring the buy-in of the chief financial officer. As CDP noted in a recent report, the efforts of its 89 supply chain members reduced carbon emissions by at least 434 million tons last year. But this metric will really attract the CFO’s attention: In 2016 alone, emissions cuts netted a combined $12.4 billion in cost savings for those firms, which include the likes of Unilever, Microsoft, Ford and Walmart. Only half of the companies surveyed for this report revealed cost savings – but those that did claimed huge gains. And while it may at first appear cliché, a large part of these savings come from engagement, engagement, engagement. For example, the global semiconductor giant Intel took a carrot-and-stick approach to gaining disclosures from its suppliers. First, CDP reporting expectations were integrated into the company’s supplier scorecards. Next, participation in Intel’s surveys was required for vendors to be eligible for the company’s supplier awards. Finally, Intel provided its suppliers with training and regular communications updates so these smaller firms would know what to do and how to go about making the necessary changes. Not that such a feat is easy. The automaker BMW Group, for example, has at least 13,000 suppliers spread across 70 nations. So BMW began by incorporating CDP disclosures into annual supplier performance reviews for its 100 largest vendors. The company first set annual internal targets, then key performance indicators (KPIs) that include transparency goals as well as carbon emissions targets. Sixty-nine percent of the company’s annual spend is now accounted for by CDP-related disclosures. According to CDP, 83 percent of its supply chain members’ cost savings can be attributed to four general types of programs. Over a third of these companies’ total cost savings comes from better product design. Waste diversion and recovery accounts for 28 percent of these total savings. Efficient transportation and energy efficiency processes round out the largest money savers for these companies. The diverse industries represented in this report shows that for any company with a large global presence, designing better products and using resources more efficiently can only add to the bottom line. And at a time when many governments indicate they may back off from pledges made at the COP21 climate talks in Paris, the private sector can show that it can step up and lead the way toward a low-carbon economy. More improvement on this front is needed, however. As Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), wrote in the report’s forward: “Only 22 percent of supplier organizations that responded to the 2016 CDP Supply Chain information request actively engage with their suppliers. It is not enough.” Image credit: Kentaro Iemoto/Flickr Corporate Responsibility Recent headlines from the 6321 articles in this category: Emissions Cuts Helped Business Leaders Save $12.4 Billion Last Year NGOs Urge Palm Oil Industry to Standardize and Improve Disclosures The Corporate Shift to Cage-Free Eggs Continues Based in Fresno, California, Leon Kaye is a business writer and strategic communications specialist.

Things look pretty good for Intel within these financial snapshots, as it reports record revenue for both the FY2016 and Q4 2016 periods. You can see the actual numbers tabulated below, but summing up in prose Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, said "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel. In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities." Krzanich added that he was confident in the future of Intel. The 'Client Computing' business, which is likely of most interest to HEXUS readers, as it includes Intel CPUs for PCs, enjoyed revenue increases both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Our favourite segment really is a cash cow for Intel bringing in nearly $33 billion during 2016. However, in terms of growth it is very much in the shade compared to Intel business operations concerned with Data Centres, IoT, and Non-Volatile memory. Microsoft and Google As VentureBeat reports, it's interesting to compare the recently published results of Microsoft and Google (Alphabet). For the last three consecutive quarters Google has managed to stay a little ahead of Microsoft in terms of headline revenue - VB reckons the relative positioning is now a trend rather than an aberration. Microsoft's FY17 Q2 financials can be read through on its Investor Relations site. Highlights in the most recent quarter were revenue was $24.1 billion and a net income of $5.2 billion. CEO Satya Nadella said "Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud." So yes, he banged on about the cloud again. The Microsoft operations HEXUS readers are most interested in, namely the 'More Personal Computing' business, was impacted badly by phone, foreign currency movements, and Xbox consoles. Check the highlights slide above for further details. Google's headline results for the quarter ending 31st Dec 2016 showed revenue of $26 billion, and a net income of $6.6 billion. Both the figures are over 20 per cent better than figures from a year ago. Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, explained that the revenue performance "was led by mobile search and YouTube." Porat added that looking forward Google has good momentum in newer investment areas and "ongoing strong progress in Other Bets" (like self-driving cars). Among the sea of positive numbers in the Google results it was hard to find a negative. However, as noted by The Independent, shares in Alphabet fell in afterhours trading as the results simply weren't as good as investors had expected. The root cause of the upset was a one-off, but significant, extra tax payment. Related Reading 9 Windows device shipments to be outpaced by Apple this year?

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose 2.2 percent to $38.38 in extended trading on Thursday. Intel's net revenue rose to $16.37 billion from $14.91 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. Intel, which will use New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to showcase its 360-degree video technology during the 2017 Super Bowl, is also driving deeper into the automotive market. The company said earlier this month that it would acquire a stake in German digital mapping firm HERE. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a statement. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share beating estimates of 74 cents per share. Worldwide PC shipments fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand.

Optane is the name under which Intel is branding products based on 3D XPoint – a non-volatile memory technology. The technology was announced in 2015 and is being developed by Intel and Micron. Micron’s 3D XPoint-based brand is QuantX. Intel has already shipped its first Optane products in the form of SSDs, but has not started selling 3D XPoint-based RAM products. According to PCWorld, Intel Optane dual inline memory modules are meant to replace the dynamic RAM (DRAM) in servers and PCs, and will fit into existing DDR4 slots. Intel said Optane memory can be 10-times denser than existing DRAM technology.

By Alistair Barr and Jillian Ward. Added by Agency Staff on 27 January 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: Alphabet, Amy Hood, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai Tweet Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel, which all posted quarterly results on Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s “other revenue” line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62% to US$3,4bn in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for start-ups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own Web services. More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25m consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47% in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co, who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Microsoft’s effort Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief financial officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualised revenue of $20bn in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14bn at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30% from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7% less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3,6bn in fourth quarter revenue, up 50% from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Reported with assistance from Dina Bass, Ian King and Mark Bergen Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 55Digital migration has ‘failed’ 9Dear Telkom, we need to talk 9Muthambi ‘ignoring’ DA on TV box report 7ICT white paper ‘not constitutional’ 7The future of radio in South Africa [podcast] Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

This will not only trigger innovations in design and manufacturing to address local needs, but also enable citizens to create productive content,” she said. She also said that there has been a significant focus on ease of starting a new venture and related support, the areas where significant hurdles still remain for startups and established companies are the regulations around latest technologies such as 5G, autonomous driving and drone deployment.” “While manufacturing is encouraged under Make in India, we should also look at encouraging Electronics Design through incentives, driven by public-private partnerships,” she added. “Over the last two years, the government has implemented several policy reforms aimed at improving the overall ease of doing business, increasing the adoption of technology in the startup and innovation ecosystem, and delivering government services to non-urban India. While these are right steps in the direction of accomplishing a knowledge economy, the expected benefits of government programs have not been effective because there is a gap between the initiatives and the actual intended outcome,” she quipped. Narendra Modi government will be presenting Budget 2017 on February 1. Yesterday, Supreme Court dismissed the plea to change the Budget date from February 1. The Budget is special not only for the fact that it has been preponed but more importantly because it comes within months after Modi government’s massive demonetisation drive. Most analysts and economists expect Budget 2017 to be tax-payer friendly, especially given the pain that common man has faced after old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes ceased to be legal tender money. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) recommended holding of the Budget Session from January 31. The first part of the Budget Session will run until February 9. The 92-year-old practice of presenting a separate Rail Budget is going to end from this fiscal, with the Finance Ministry accepting Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu’s proposal to merge it with the General Budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has indicated that railway travel may become pricier for passengers come the next financial year. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "I definitely think we’re going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. ‘Disruptive Forces’ More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week. Microsoft gained 2.2 percent, Google was down about 1 percent and Intel rose 1.5 percent at 1:57 p.m. Friday in New York. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.  "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier." Microsoft’s Effort Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. "Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud," Moerdler said. "Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Optane is a new class of nonvolatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Intel and Micron. Intel's first Optane products, announced this month at CES, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into the storage slots of PCs. Optane memory DIMMs are different. They're intended to replace DRAM in servers and PCs. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and hopes to release final products next year. In demonstrations by Intel, Optane SSDs have performed 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. PC makers have said that game play, PC bootup and applications are all faster with Optane SSDs. Less is known about Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units out to enterprise hardware makers for testing. Intel has said Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. The base technology of both types of Optane products, 3D Xpoint, is a bridge between memory and storage, said Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO, during an earnings call on Thursday. Optane is "differential technology" that could change PC and server architectures, Krzanich said. Intel has also floated the idea that Optane could unite storage and memory. For example, one Optane unit could serve as both storage and DRAM. Optane's ability to move large amounts of data faster inside computers and data centers could help speed up machine-learning tasks, Krzanich said. Optane also aligns with Intel's goal to focus more on data-center technologies, Krzanich said. In April, Intel made data-center products a centerpiece of its future strategy as it tried to break a longtime reliance on PCs. But PC chips took in more than half of Intel's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $16.4 billion, growing by $1.5 billion from the same quarter last year. Net income was $3.6 billion, down about 1 percent. Revenue for the Client Computing Group, which deals in PC chips, was up $9.1 billion, growing by 4 percent compared with the same quarter of the previous year. PC chip revenue got a boost from higher average selling prices of laptops and desktops. Desktop product shipments went down 9 percent, but prices went up 2 percent. Laptop product shipments were flat, but average selling prices were up 3 percent. Sales of PCs with higher-end chips like Core i7 were strong during the holiday season, Krzanich said. In particular, gaming PCs did really well. The Data Center Group, which deals in server chips and data-center equipment, recorded revenue of $4.7 billion, growing by 8 percent. Intel's Internet of Things Group had revenue of $726 million, growing 16 percent. Boost Sales With Brother’s Partner Program More from Brother Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Intel set a new record for revenue for this quarter, coming in at $16.4 billion. This is up 10% from a year ago. For the year, Intel brought in $59.4 billion, up 7% from their 2015 results. Intel’s gross margin fell 1.7 points to 60.9%, and they had an operating income of $12.9 billion, which is down 8% from a year ago. Net income was down 10% to $10.3 billion, and earnings per share fell 9% to $2.12. Intel also reports Non-GAAP results, which exclude several expenditures, such as acquisition-related adjustments, write-downs, and the like. On a Non-GAAP basis, Intel had a gross margin of 63.1%, down 1.7 points, an operating income up 11% to $4.9 billion, and a net income up 4% to $3.9 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4% to $0.79. Intel Q4 2016 Financial Results (GAAP)   Q4'2016 Q3'2016 Q4'2015 Revenue $16.4B $15.8B $14.9B Operating Income $4.5B $4.5B $4.3B Net Income $3.6B $3.4B $3.6B Gross Margin 60.9% 63.3% 62.6% Client Computing Group Revenue $9.1B +2.2% +3% Data Center Group Revenue $4.7B +4.4% +3% Internet of Things Revenue $726M +5.3% +5% Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group $816M +26% +26% Intel Security Group $550M +2.4% +2% Programmable Solutions Group $420M -9.7% -1% All Other Revenue $65M +47.7% +10% The gross margin impact is being attributed to a few things. Warranty and IP charges increased, as did spending on factory start-ups, due to the move to 10 nm coming this year, Client Computer Group non-platform costs, and the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group margins. Intel very much likes to keep their margins up above 60%, and for the moment they are still there even with these extra costs. Intel breaks the company down into several groups. The main group is the Client Computing Group, which as the name implies, provides CPUs, SoCs, and wireless and wired connectivity products destined for PCs. Although the PC market is still down, this group had revenue for the year of $32.9 billion, which is up 2%, but platform volume is down 10%. Platform selling prices were up 11%, which makes up the difference. For just the last quarter, Client Computing Group had revenues of $9.1 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Platform volumes were down 7%, offset by selling prices up 7%. Desktop platform volume was down 9%, while notebook volumes were flat. Desktop average selling price (ASP) was up 2%, and notebook ASP was up 3%. Considering the down market, Intel continues to drive revenue here. While good for them, it means prices are high, and some competition in this space might help out the consumer. The Data Center Group also had a strong quarter, and year. For the year, they had revenue of $17.2 billion, up from $16.0 billion a year ago. For the year, Intel saw volumes up 3% and ASP up 4%. For the most recent quarter, the Data Center Group had revenues of $4.7 billion, which was up 3%. Platform volumes were down 3%, with ASP up 6%. Intel is slowly building it’s Internet of Things group, which had revenues for the year at $2.6 billion, up from $2.3 a year ago. Revenue for this quarter was up 5% to $726 million. The Non-Volatile Memory Solutions group had revenues for the quarter of $816 million, up 26% from a year ago, and a full-year revenue of $2.58 billion, down slightly from the $2.6 billion a year ago. Programmable Solutions is new for Intel this year, with the purchase of Altera, and this segment had revenue of $420 million for this quarter, and $1.7 billion for the year. All other revenue was $65 million for the quarter, up from $59 million a year ago. 2016 was a strong year for Intel, although it was not without its challenges. Earlier this year, Intel decided to get out of the mobile SoC space completely, abandoning it’s Atom architecture for this segment. Atom does live on for low power PCs, but any of the tablets that used the Cherry Trail Atom have found themselves without a new CPU to move to. The death of Tick-Tock also had its first new entrant in Kaby Lake, although you could easily argue Devil’s Canyon was a similar situation. But they have several new exciting technologies coming to market as well, such as 3D X-Point, and of course the expected launch of their 10 nm CPUs later this year. Looking forward to Q1 2017, Intel is forecasting a midpoint revenue range of $14.8 billion, with margin estimates at 62%.

Reply Samus - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link Even when AMD was competitive with Intel over a decade ago, they weren't a good buy, and haven't been since. I have never met a single person who made money on AMD stock. Some people turned out well who owned ATi stock because as we all now know, they were overvalued and AMD overpaid. Of all a-list tech companies, I couldn't think of a worst buy than AMD. I hope, someday, this changes. Reply Haawser - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link Worst buy ?? It was $1.79 last March, and is now $10+ Your 'worst buy' would have made people over 5 x their money had they invested at the right time. I only *wish* I'd bought some at that price. Reply Michael Bay - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link You`d be outright crazy buying amd a year or two ago, and not much better now. As zen hype settles, it will return to the bottom just as quickly. Reply yannigr2 - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link I can understand your agony. With AMD becoming competitive in the consumer and enterprise market, Nvidia eating from the Datacenter market, Qualcomm announcing multicore ARM base server SoCs and Microsoft demostrating a Windows emulator for the ARM platform, you are probably very nervous about your Intel stock valuation. Do you sleep well at nights? Reply Michael Bay - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link >amd becoming competitive >muh arm servers >201X will be a year of loonix on a desktop I thought even the most hopeless cultist would get tired of repeating this well worn mantra set, but you guys somehow always manage to surprise. Reply Nagorak - Saturday, January 28, 2017 - link AMD was priced like it was going out of business last year and it Manchester to pull through, thus the outsized gains. However this outcome was far from certain, which meant no one could really interest more than a small amount in the stock anyway. It was just too risky. Maybe some did put a substantial amount of their network in AMD, and they were handsomely rewarded, but it was pretty much a gamble and not a prudent investment decision. Reply Nagorak - Saturday, January 28, 2017 - link Damn auto correct... Reply Gothmoth - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link and you know many people who have a clue about stock. don´t kid yourself you are probably a 20 year old gamer or a IT guy that thinks he has a clue about the stock market. such people are always the loser on the stock market in the end. that´s why it exists.. somebody has to lose money. there are plenty of people who know what they are doing.... and they even make money when AMD drops. Reply Nagorak - Saturday, January 28, 2017 - link Yeah... most people involved in the stock market really don't know what they're doing. Some make some big bets and do well for a while but they end up flaming out. Most just end up following the herd and buying when things are expensive and selling when they are cheap. I'm certainly not impressed with the majority involved in the financial markets--including the "pros".

Optane is a new class of nonvolatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Intel and Micron. Intel's first Optane products, announced this month at CES, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into the storage slots of PCs. Optane memory DIMMs are different. They're intended to replace DRAM in servers and PCs. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and hopes to release final products next year. In demonstrations by Intel, Optane SSDs have performed 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. PC makers have said that game play, PC bootup and applications are all faster with Optane SSDs. Less is known about Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units out to enterprise hardware makers for testing. Intel has said Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. The base technology of both types of Optane products, 3D Xpoint, is a bridge between memory and storage, said Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO, during an earnings call on Thursday. Optane is "differential technology" that could change PC and server architectures, Krzanich said. Intel has also floated the idea that Optane could unite storage and memory. For example, one Optane unit could serve as both storage and DRAM. Optane's ability to move large amounts of data faster inside computers and data centers could help speed up machine-learning tasks, Krzanich said. Optane also aligns with Intel's goal to focus more on data-center technologies, Krzanich said. In April, Intel made data-center products a centerpiece of its future strategy as it tried to break a longtime reliance on PCs. But PC chips took in more than half of Intel's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Some helpful tips on getting your new Intel Kaby Lake CPU working on your Z170-based motherboard By: Sergio Andrés Echart Kuc | Motherboards News | Posted: 1 day, 6 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA So, you have a Z170 motherboard, and Intel Kaby Lake is the CPU you want? OK, first of all, you must know that even though Kaby Lake is compatible with Intel's Z170 Skylake chipset, the CPU is designed for Intel's Z270 Kaby Lake chipset to use its new features.   As an overclocker, tester, and reviewer, I always move to the latest chipset if I decide to upgrade my CPU, and of course not an H/B or something chipset, I go to the root chipset - that means Z170/Z270. But, if you still want to stay on Z170, here's a comparison of the two designs and a must-do List to make your shiny new Kaby Lake CPU work on it.   Intel Z170 Chipset     It's clear you have more things on Z270 - 2x M.2 SSD, more USB, more SATA ports, etc.   Intel Z270 Chipset     A lot of people kept their Z170 board, sold their Intel Skylake CPU, and bought the new Kaby Lake CPU. Then all you have to do is install the new CPU and be done with it, right? Well, sorry to say it, but no. Infinite loop? Starts and turns off? Error codes? So, should I RMA? No. You should have upgraded your BIOS/UEFI first using your Skylake CPU as most motherboard manufacturers support Intel Kaby Lake on their latest BIOS released early in January. So, most of you I know, you didn't upgrade it. But, there's nothing wrong, I will help you with this.   Common Scenarios   You own a Z170 board, you don't have a Skylake CPU, and you have a Kaby Lake CPU installed. You turn on your rig, and it won't work. Reboot loops, won't start, and you get error codes. Get your hands-on any Skylake CPU, install it, go to the motherboard manufacturer page, download the latest BIOS file, put it on a flash drive, and update it from BIOS. Check if it's all ok then reinstall the Kaby Lake CPU and it should work correctly.   You have an ASUS ROG Z170 board with USB BIOS Flashback feature, you don't have a Skylake CPU, and you have a Kaby Lake CPU installed. Download the latest BIOS file from ASUS website for your motherboard model, grab a flash drive, format it FAT32, and rename the file as follows:   Here are the examples I know. The pattern is easy, just read the board name, as below:   ASUS Maximus VIII Ranger: Rename BIOS file to M8R.CAP ASUS Maximus VIII Formula: Rename BIOS file to M8F.CAP ASUS Maximus VIII Extreme: Rename BIOS file to M8E.CAP   Copy the file you downloaded to the flash drive and insert it on the board. Then press the button on the picture for six seconds (button will vary from board to board). You will see the LED on it flashes as it reads the flash drive, then it will stop. After a while, it's all set, and you are ready to go.     ASUS USB BIOS Flashback Procedure: https://rog.asus.com/technology/rog-motherboard-innovations/USB-BIOS-flashback/   ASUS Z170 Motherboards with USB BIOS Flashback feature: http://www.asus.com/us/site/motherboards/Z170/compare/   Enjoy Kaby Lake Power! - Sergio Andrés Echart Kuc, Spanish Senior Editor for TweakTown.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On ANU poaches Intel's Dr Genevieve Bell By Staff Writer on Jan 27, 2017 12:50PM Dr Genevieve Bell Will retain senior fellow title with chipmaker. High-profile Intel researcher and anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell has revealed she will leave the chipmaker to take up a role at the Australian National University from next month. The university said in a statement that it had appointed Bell as a Professor in its college of engineering and computer science. Dr Bell joined Intel in 1998 and led the company’s first user experience research and development lab. She has also served as a vice president of the chipmaker and was the first woman in the company's history to be appointed an Intel senior fellow. Bell said via Twitter that she would continue to hold her title as a senior fellow with the company. Her new professorship will involve collaboration with CSIRO’s digital wing Data61. “Genevieve has been tasked by ANU with exploring how to bring together data science, design thinking and ethnography to drive new approaches in engineering; and in partnership with Data61, exploring the questions of what it means to be human in a data-driven economy and world,” Data61 CEO Adrian Turner said in a statement. The Oregonian reported that Dr Bell’s departure from Intel is “one of a number of notable exits” of senior staff from the chip giant so far in 2017. Copyright © iTnews.com.au . All rights reserved.

Dr Bell joins ANU in February from global innovation company Intel as part of the University’s commitment to drive innovation in Australia. Dr Bell has served as a Vice President of Intel where she became the first woman in the company's history to be appointed an Intel Senior Fellow. "As a little kid, I remember thinking the ANU was the most remarkable place. It was full of big thinkers, and great story-tellers and such a lot of history," Dr Bell said. "That I get to return to it as an adult and a member of the faculty is a genuine privilege. I am also excited to be afforded the opportunity to collaborate with CSIRO’s Data61." Dean of the ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science, Professor Elanor Huntington said she was thrilled to appoint Dr Bell to the College. "I’m thrilled that Genevieve has chosen to join us," Professor Huntington said. "She is a distinguished technologist and public intellectual, and a leading figure in diversity and inclusion globally in the technology sector. "Her potential to transform the relationship between people and technology cannot be understated, and I look forward to her achieving great things from her new base here. It’s been a pleasure to build on our long-standing partnership with CSIRO Data61 and join forces to make this a reality." Acting ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Margaret Harding said Professor Bell was an exciting appointment. "The enduring mission of ANU is to develop new capability on behalf of the nation, and the fields of computing and engineering are central to delivering on that mission," Professor Harding said. CSIRO’s Data61 CEO Adrian Turner said it was wonderful to have Dr Bell return to Canberra. "Genevieve has been tasked by ANU with exploring how to bring together data science, design thinking and ethnography to drive new approaches in engineering; and in partnership with Data61, exploring the questions of what it means to be human in a data-driven economy and world," Mr Turner said. After completing a PhD in cultural anthropology at Stanford University, Dr Bell joined Intel in 1998. At Intel, she led the company’s first user experience research and development lab. She is recognised as a world leader in the ethnographic approach to developing technology. Tweet All articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.

Posted 27 Jan 2017 05:11 Updated 27 Jan 2017 07:35 Gameplayers demonstrate vitual reality headsets during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to US$4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to US$9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to US$16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

Intel reported earnings of 79 cents per share, beating the 74 cents expected by Wall Street. Revenue came in at $16.37 billion, beating estimates of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters consensus. Shares of Intel moved 2 percent higher in after-hours trading before paring those gains. "This company is doing everything they're supposed to do," Trader Tim Seymour said, noting that his only issue is that the chipmaker's stock valuation hovers around $38. Seymour owns Intel and recommended interested investors buy it for the long term. The semiconductor giant's move into the autonomous-car space intrigued trader Brian Kelly. Still, he's waiting for the stock to break out above a $39 stock price. Trader Guy Adami prefers Microsoft over Intel. He was discouraged by Intel's weak guidance for the first quarter of 2017. Microsoft beat its earnings estimates and moved up 1 percent in after-hours trading. Trader Dan Nathan said he would be more interested in buying Intel in the mid-$30s. show chapters Trading tech earnings: 5 moves to make    Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 | 5:00 PM ET | 02:27 Disclosures: GUY ADAMI Guy Adami is long CELG, EXAS, GDX, INTC.

Posted 27 Jan 2017 07:35 Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, speaks during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data centre business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4 percent to US$4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to US$9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data centre group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centres, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to US$16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index .

There are several reasons why that might be the case. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 26, 2017 at 5:41PM On Jan. 23, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share, which will be paid out on March 1 to stockholders of record on Feb. 7. Intel had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share for the past four quarters, so there was some expectation that the chipmaker would boost its dividend this time around. In fact, about a month ago, I wrote that I expected a "modest increase" in the company's dividend. The lack of a dividend increase could give us some insight into Intel's thinking around its cash generation and use during 2017. Image source: Intel.  Why keep the dividend flat? At $1.04 per share, at a share count of approximately 4.74 billion, Intel is paying out roughly $5 billion in dividends per year. Over the past 12 months, Intel has generated about $10.54 billion in free cash flow, meaning that the company is already returning a significant portion of its free cash flow in the form of the dividend. INTC Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts There are a several reasons for Intel's keeping the dividend flat for, potentially, the entirety of 2017. The first may simply be that the company was already "running hot" in terms of the percentage of its free cash flow that it allocated to the dividend. So by not increasing the dividend this year -- even if the company expects to generate more free cash flow in 2017 than it did in 2016 -- Intel may simply be trying to reduce how much of its free cash flow goes to the dividend. The next, and perhaps the most pessimistic, of the explanations is that Intel is expecting to see free cash flow stay flat or even decline over the next year. This wouldn't necessarily mean Intel is expecting its business to crater, although such an expectation could mean reduced free cash flow. However, if the company expects to, say, spend substantially more on semiconductor capital equipment for its factories this year than it did in 2016 without a correspondingly large or larger improvement in operating cash flow, then free cash flow could decline. And, finally, Intel may simply be planning a very big use of cash, perhaps in the form of a large acquisition. If Intel goes out and, say, spends $10 billion or more to buy a company, then the company is going to need to take on debt to finance such an acquisition. Then, since Intel's goal is to keep its balance sheet largely net-debt neutral, it would likely want to redirect free cash flow not committed to the dividend toward getting that debt paid off as quickly as possible. Not too much to be read from this It's hard to read too much into Intel's thinking about the future from this lack of dividend increase, given the several potential explanations for it. However, investors won't have to wait too long to find out what Intel's expectations around its business performance in 2017 are as the company should go into that in excruciating detail at its Feb. 9 investor meeting.

On Thursday, Intel reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results led by strength in its cloud computer and internet of things businesses. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 26, 2017 at 1:58 pm | UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 4:10 pm SANTA CLARA — Strong growth in its data center and internet of things product lines gave Intel a boost and helped the semiconductor giant report better-than-expected fourth-quarter results Thursday. After the close of trading, Intel said it earned $3.6 billion, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding one-time items, Intel earned 79 cents a share, topping the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast Intel to earn 75 cents a share on $15.8 billion in sales. Related Articles Tesla’s Elon Musk confesses reaction to his Trump role is getting him ‘down’ Smart cars with Silicon Valley tech dominate CES During the same period a year ago, Intel earned 74 cents a share on revenue of $14.9 billion. On a conference call to discuss Intel’s performance, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the company completed “a transformative year for Intel,” which included integrating the company’s acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera and a round of 12,000 job cuts. “I’m confident we’re making the right investments to compete and win,” Krzanich said. “By 2020, the average person will generate 1.5 gigabytes of data a day, and the resulting explosion of data is creating tremendous opportunities.” Intel remains the world’s top maker of semiconductors for personal computers, but as worldwide PC sales have declined for years, the company has branched out into other areas for new opportunities. In the last three months of 2016, Intel said revenue from cloud computing, or what it calls its data center group, rose 8 percent from a year ago, to $4.7 billion. Intel’s internet of things (also called IoT) sales for the quarter climbed 16 percent from a year ago, to $726 million. “There were a lot of positives out of today’s report,” said Mark Hung, of technology research firm Gartner. “Revenue growth in the client computing group and strong growth in the IoT group being two of the brightest spots.” Intel’s client computing sales, which include chips used in PCs, posted a year-over-year gain of 4 percent, to reach sales of $9.1 billion. While Intel’s PC-related sales grew during the fourth quarter, overall sales of PCs fell 3.7 percent, according to Gartner. Rob Enderle, president of the Enderle Group, said Intel had “an impressive quarter.” The performance of the company’s PC segment suggests “the belief that [the PC market] has bottomed and is, again, moving toward growth,” he said. For its first quarter of 2017, Intel said it expects to earn 65 cents a share, excluding one-time items, on $14.8 billion in revenue, which would exceed last year’s first-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, on sales of $13.8 billion. Intel shares initially rose 2.2 percent, to $38.37, in after-hours trading following the release of the company’s results, but the stock then pulled back to remain near its regular-session close of $37.56 a share.

(Intel image) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 26, 2017 at 2:45 PM, updated January 26, 2017 at 3:01 PM comments One of Intel's best-known researchers, anthropologist Genevieve Bell, said Thursday she's leaving the company to teach at the Australian National University in Canberra. Her departure is one of a number of notable Intel exits to start the year. Originally from Sydney, Bell earned a doctorate in anthropology at Stanford University and joined Intel in 1998. Working from Hillsboro, Bell helped lead Intel's research into how people use technology and guide the chipmaker's efforts to predict the long-term changes in the direction of technology. As a researcher, Bell liked to observe people in their homes - watching them in living rooms, kitchens and verandas to see how they responded to technology and interact with it. "It's easy inside a technology company to get seduced by the technology itself," Bell told The Oregonian in a 2004 interview. "We're all sucked in by the whistles and the bells. One of the nice reality checks that an ethnographic perspective provides is a sense of what people really care about, these kind of unexpected truths." In a tweet Thursday, Bell said she will remain a senior fellow at Intel, indicating she will continue to participate in the company's research. New year, new jobs. I'm Oz bound to be Prof at ANU (@anucecs) & collaborate with @Data61news. Will remain Sr Fellow @intel too. Woohoo!! pic.twitter.com/MklcT5wQUN -- Genevieve Bell (@feraldata) January 26, 2017 Also Thursday, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich notified employees that human resources vice president Richard Taylor is retiring in March. His successor is Leslie Culbertson, a longtime Hillsboro executive who was most recently Intel's director of finance. Culbertson takes over after a difficult year for Intel employees, as the company eliminated 15,000 jobs worldwide as part of an overhaul designed to position the company for long-term decline in the PC market. Intel is also in the process of updating its annual employee review process, an exacting system called Focal. In layoffs in 2015 and 2016, Intel changed the way it determines which employees are eligible for layoff, using the level of merit-based stock grants workers receive as a key criteria. That unexpected change produced frustration and confusion within Intel's ranks. Additionally, Jill Eiland, Intel's Oregon public affairs director since 2006, is retiring this month. Intel has declined to say if it will appoint a successor. The chipmaker is Oregon's largest private employer. It had 19,500 employees in the state before last year's cutbacks; Intel won't say how many it currently employs. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that 2016 was a transformational year for the company on a variety of fronts. Intel cut its staff, absorbed its Altera acquisition, and closed the year with strong sales in the data center, PC, and Internet of Things markets, Krzanich said in a conference call with analysts. Client computing sales, which include processors for desktops and laptops, had strong execution and higher average selling prices (up 7 percent from a year ago) as customers opted for more gaming computers and high-end PCs, Krzanich said. During the quarter, Intel saw that the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy and had inventory get used during the three months, said chief financial officer Bob Swan. “Q4 was a strong finish to a record year,” Krzanich said. In the data center, growth was good. Cloud service provider revenue was up 24 percent, and communications service provider revenue grew 19 percent. Internet of Things revenue was also strong. Krzanich was optimistic that data growth would continue to skyrocket, creating demand for Intel’s processors. He said that a connected car could generate 4,000 gigabytes of data per day. He noted that the company has good design wins in connected cars with BMW, Baidu, and Delphi. In artificial intelligence, Krzanich said Intel processors are used in more than 90 percent of machine learning applications. Of course, there’s pressure on Intel from competitors, and the PC continues to lose ground to other devices in the era of the smartphone. Intel dropped out of mobile processors, but it is still competitive in wireless data 4G and Wi-Fi chips, and it is positioning to be a player in 5G. Intel’s investment in 14-nanometer cost improves drove costs down 30 percent in the client computing business. The world’s biggest chip maker reported fourth-quarter earnings that were mixed, missing its target on earnings per share but beating estimates for revenues. The results were driven by revenues from desktop and laptop computer chips, data center chips, and the Internet of Things. The latter was up 15 percent for the full year. Analysts had expected Intel to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $15.8 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, they were expected earnings per share of $2.67 on revenue of $58.9 billion. Q4 earnings came in at $3.6 billion, or 73 a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion. A year ago, earnings per share were 74 cents, with revenue at $14.9 billion. Intel stock rose 2 percent to $38.32 a share in after-hours trading, and it has since dropped to $37.77 a share, up only 0.56 percent. During the quarter, Intel shipped more of its code-named Kaby Lake processors for computer makers showing off systems based on the chip at CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas in the first week of January. Enterprise and government business was weaker in the quarter. Advanced Micro Devices is expecting to be more competitive against Intel in 2017 as it readies its new Zen processors for PCs, laptops, and servers. “Intel had a pretty good quarter. Client computing revenue has not only flattened but actually saw some slight increases even though units declined,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “I attribute this to customers embracing more premium PCs driven by commercial upgrades, gaming and VR. Datacenter got back on track and while it wasn’t double-digit growth, many customers are waiting for the latest Purley server chips to their big upgrades, so I think there’s pent-up demand. Memory hit a home run, driven by 3D [flash memory]. It was a good end to a solid 2016 where I saw Intel making big moves and investments for the next five years.” Net income for the year was $10.3 billion, while overall revenue for the year was $59.4 billion. A year ago, net income was $11.3 billion on revenue of $55.4 billion. Intel cut about 12,000 jobs during the year as it restructured to get behind the company’s focused priorities. As part of that process, Intel is spinning out McAfee, formerly Intel Security, as a separate business that is half-owned by Intel. Intel’s most profitable segment is the data center group that sells chips for servers, the computers that process transactions in huge data centers. Data center group revenue was $4.7 billion in Q4, up 8 percent. Internet of Things revenue was $726 million, up 16 percent. Client computing revenue was $9.1 billion, up 4 percent. Non-volatile memory revenue was $816 million, up 25 percent. Intel Security Group revenue was $550 million, up 7 percent. And programmable solutions were $420 million, with no comparison to the year before because of the 2016 Altera acquisition. Krzanich said that Altera has a record pipeline for its programmable chips. Swan added that the outlook assumes a stable macroeconomic environment. Intel is more cautious about demand for chips in emerging markets like Russia, China, and Latin America. For the full year, Intel expects 2017 to be flat in terms of revenue. Krzanich said the company is taking a conservative view of 2017 PC unit sales than other analysts, but he noted there was record demand for Intel PC chips in Q4. Unit sales for 2017 could decline in the mid-single digit percentages, Krzanich said. Intel is positioning itself to lower its costs during the coming year. “What we focus on in that market is how do you make money, how do you sell up?” Krzanich said.

The company is chasing makers with open-source tools needed to add artificial intelligence to consumer, industrial, and retail devices made using board computers. The plan may include machine-learning tools, which are central to AI. AI helps Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions, and also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely. "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year," a Google spokesman said in an email. Earlier this week, Google published a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing "smart tools" to makers. In a blog entry, Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful. Devices could get Google AI technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets. Google's voice recognition is the company's most visible AI technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3. Providing a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs. The spread of Google's AI tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets. Companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud. Samsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and AI technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers. It's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends. But boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful AI and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle. Some companies like Movidius -- which is a part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones. Google is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS. The company hasn't talked about AI technologies available in Android Things.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to US$4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to US$9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to US$16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of 79 cents. Revenue for the quarter came in at $16.37 billion. Analysts expected Intel to post earnings of 74 cents a share and 15.752 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The stock rose more than 2 percent in after-hours. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," said Brian Krzanich Intel CEO, in a release. "In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products,successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities." The chipmaker beat revenue estimates for the key categories client computing and Internet of Things. Intel reported client computing sales of $9.1 billion, above a StreetAccount estimate of $8.55 billion. Sales for "Internet of Things" rose 16 percent year-over-year to $726 million, topping a StreetAccount estimate of $703.6 million. Revenue for Intel's data center group came in at $4.7 billion, an 8 percent year-over-year increase for the quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of $4.78 billion this quarter, according to StreetAccount. Intel has made efforts to move away from reliance on the generally declining PC business. The company's focus has shifted to the Internet of Things and to its data center group, which creates chips for large computers.That's the company's most profitable segment. Yet, the 2016 third-quarter revenue for the group grew less than 10 percent year-over-year at $4.5 billion. Intel's guidance is flat for revenue and gross margins in the first quarter of 2017, despite strong fourth-quarter numbers. On the conference call company leaders said the sale of gaming systems in the holiday season helped their higher end chip business. As they are expecting a weaker PC market moving forward, Krzanich noted the companies capabilities to play a major part in more innovative technologies. "Autonomous cars for example will generate about 4,000 gigabytes of data each day," Krzanich said on the earnings conference call, "The resulting explosion of data each day is creating tremendous opportunity...our products are key to turning raw data into high value insight and information." Intel also gave strong guidance for it cloud computing business. Last November, Google partnered with Intel to challenge Amazon's dominance in cloud services and has continually tried to restructure itself, including making 12,000 job cuts. Earlier this year the Santa Clara, California-based company announced plans to buy a 15 percent share of mapping software company Here Maps. The German car-maker backed company provides information for self-driving vehicles. Intel has also created other partnerships in the growing self-driving car space and has moved into the virtual reality space for live sports, too. Shares of Intel are up 25 percent in the last 12 months. Anita Balakrishnan and Rachel Cao contributed to this report.

Washington: An 18-year-old Indian-American boy has won the prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award in the US for inventing a device that quickly shuts down undersea oil spills. Karan Jerath of Friendswood, Texas, claimed $50,000 top prize on Friday at 2015 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (IISEF). Jerath was also one of the five students selected for the Intel and Indo-US Science and Technology Forum Visit to India Award. Jerath designed a sturdy device that can collect the oil, gas and water spewing from a broken well on the seafloor. "Sensors inside the 350-ton device would measure the temperature, pressure and density of the mix of gases and fluids erupting from a well. "A computer would then calculate how valves in the gadget should be adjusted so that the gas and oil can be collected. That should stop a spill in its tracks. The device could help prevent an ecological catastrophe. It also would reduce cleanup costs," Karan said. The top position was shared by two other teen researchers. One developed a technique to more quickly diagnose infections by HIV. The other used sophisticated software to improve the flow of air inside aircraft cabins that could reduce the transmission of disease among passengers. Maya Ajmera, an Indian descent who heads the Society for Science and the Public that conducts the IISEF, congratulated the winners and said, "These talented young students are the problem solvers and innovators of their generation." Scores of Indian-American students won awards in various categories, five of them getting the first award in their specialisations, biochemistry, behavioural sciences, environmental engineering, mathematics and energy physics. The IISEF honours the world's most promising high school student scientists, inventors and engineers selected through rigorous competitions held around the world.

The results were driven by revenues from desktop and laptop computer chips, data center chips, and the Internet of Things. Analysts had expected Intel to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $15.8 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, they were expected earnings per share of $2.67 on revenue of $58.9 billion. Q4 earnings came in at $3.6 billion, or 73 a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion. A year ago, earnings per share were 74 cents, with revenue at $14.9 billion. Intel stock is up 2 percent to $38.32 a share in after-hours trading. During the quarter, Intel shipped more of its code-named Kaby Lake processors for computer makers who launched the system at CES 2017, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas in the first week of January. “The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities.” Net income for the year was $10.3 billion, while overall revenue for the year was $59.4 billion. A year ago, net income was $11.3 billion on revenue of $55.4 billion. Intel’s most profitable segment is the data center group that sells chips for servers, the computers that process transactions in huge data centers. Data Center Group revenue was $4.7 billion in Q4, up 8 percent. Internet of Things revenue was $726 million, up 16 percent. Client computing revenue was $9.1 billion, up 4 percent. Non-volatile memory revenue was $816 million, up 25 percent. Intel Security Group revenue was $550 million, up 7 percent. And programmable solutions were $420 million, with no comparison to the year before because of the 2016 Altera acquisition. Intel faces threats from multiple competitors. It has largely lost the mobile processor battle to Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors are used in almost all mobile smartphones and tablets. Nvidia is increasingly competitive in the data center and connected cars with its artificial intelligence chips. And Advanced Micro Devices has touted its Zen architecture for desktops, laptops, and servers coming this year. Those are big challenges that Intel faces in a multi-front war. But it is still benefiting from trends such as demand for the Internet of Things, or making everyday objects smart and connected. Devices such as internet-connected cars, refrigerators, thermostats, and pet collars will represent a huge opportunity that could grow into the billions of units over time. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel forecasts revenue of $14.8 billion and gross margin percentage of 62 percent. Full-year capital spending for 2017 will be $12 billion, while R&D spending will likely be $20.5 billion.

Here's What You Need Print Email By Andrew Hoffman Jan 26, 2017 10:10 AM PT You worked hard to earn your customers. Now dont let a "one size fits all" marketing approach prevent you from meaningfully connecting with them. Klaviyo's email personalization & automation platform puts your data to work for more money. Sign up Now. There are plenty of reasons to build a custom computer. While custom computers may initially be more expensive than prepackaged desktops or laptops, they can provide you with nearly endless possibilities, whether you're looking for a top-notch gaming machine, a system for mixing music, or the ideal choice for developing Web applications. A custom computer is the way to go if you want both performance and flexibility. Upgrading individual parts often is less expensive than buying a new computer, which could save you money in the long run. Following are the essential parts you'll need. Processor and Motherboard The component to start with is the processor, which will dictate your selection of other necessary parts, like the motherboard. UserBenchmark's exhaustive list of user-rated processors is a good resource to help you decide. AMD and Intel are the top manufacturers, but I prefer Intel. Intel is the industry standard when it comes to processors, so you can't go wrong if that's your choice. Its Core series comes in three families: i3, i5 and i7. The i3 series is good for average computing needs, while the i5 offers a little more horsepower. The i7 series offers you the best performance. For the price, a Core i7-6700k really can't be beat. After you choose your processor, select a motherboard to go with it. Make sure it is USB 3.1/3.0-capable for optimal speed. One factor to consider is whether you plan on overclocking, which involves running your PC at a speed higher than manufacturer recommendations. While you can benefit from short-term performance boosts, overclocking may lead to a shorter lifespan for your computer, so you'll need to consider a compatible motherboard if you plan to do it. Storage and Memory Next, choose the storage you want to use. HDD drives are the traditional hard drives that most computers have, and they are extremely affordable. However, SSDs are the choice for sheer performance, and their prices are dropping. I prefer a hybrid option that includes both. A computer built with its system files on a smaller SSD will boot faster, while a larger and cheaper HDD in the 2-TB range gives plenty of storage. Decide how much RAM you need. If you plan on running a 32-bit OS, then you only need 3 GB of memory since the OS won't support any more. Most likely, though, you will be using a 64-bit architecture where 4 GB is the minimum. RAM is a relatively cheap upgrade for the performance you get in return. Choose 8, 12, or 16 GB for a better user experience. You can also put in a DVD/CD drive, though it is not necessary, thanks to portable storage and cloud-based software. Video and Audio Cards If you intend to play video games, create digital graphics or edit video, you should invest in something more advanced than a basic video card. For enhanced graphics, AMD, ATI or Nvidia cards will do the trick. The AMD Radeon RX 460 is a reasonably affordable option that can also handle the needs of most casual gamers. The same goes for your audio card: If you are editing audio files, you should always opt for a higher-quality card that's compatible with the peripheral equipment you want to connect. Case, Power and Cooling You have to buy a case to hold all of that amazing hardware! There are many types of cases on the market with different features. Many cases have a rudimentary power supply and cooling fans. However, if you are building a high-performance system, they are probably inadequate. All that performance generates heat. Too much heat will cause your computer to crash and may even damage hardware, so be sure to invest in some quality computer cooling fans. At a minimum, you will want one attached to your CPU heatsink, one larger fan to exhaust heat from the case -- and if not built in, one to disperse heat from your graphics card. The more powerful your components, the more power you'll need to run your system properly. You don't want to burn through a cheap power supply and have everything shut down on you. Plan on at least a 500w power supply, but if you've opted for a bigger processor, graphics card, and the requisite fans, you'll need something with more juice. Your components may come with recommended power allowances. If not, I suggest at least a 750w power supply. Final Thought: Don't be afraid to invest more money up front, as your custom machine can provide years of use before you'll need to upgrade it again. Good luck with your project -- and most of all, have fun! Get Permission to License or Reproduce this Article Print Email Reprints Author Search Reader Comments Join the discussion!

The new unit packs the latest Intel’s Kaby Lake CPU, a NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU, memory, an SSD and a hard drive. The system weighs just about three kilograms and its dimensions are smaller than dimensions of Microsoft’s Xbox One. Current-generation game consoles, while closed systems ripe for optimization, can have difficulty providing performance sufficient for Full-HD gaming. Many console gamers prefer to play their games on HDTVs rather than on monitors, and so makers of boutique PCs were set on introducing console-like computers featuring gaming-grade hardware. Manufacturers of computer components were, for various reasons, reluctant to launch their own SFF gaming PCs for the living room until last year. However in the recent months we have seen a number of computers from motherboards/GPU vendors cards that are both small and powerful. MSI began to sell its Trident system in November-December timeframe without making any loud announcements, and this month the company upgraded its mini PC with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors but retained the chassis and the platform. The MSI Trident 3 is based on a custom Intel H110 powered motherboard, along with a choice of Intel’s Core i7-7700 / i5-7400 processors and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 / 1050 Ti graphics cards. By default the PC comes with 8 GB of single-channel DDR4-2400 memory (upgradeable to 32 GB), a 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD, one 1 TB hard drive and a 230 W external PSU. Despite the miniature size, the MSI Trident 3 is upgradeable: the CPU, the graphics adapter, the DRAM and storage devices may be changed. Due to lack of space inside, it is impossible to install a video card longer than 17 cm or additional drives, but such limitations are understandable. Moreover, keeping in mind that many SFF PCs use mobile components soldered to their motherboards, so using desktop-class components is a tradeoff between replaceability and size.

PC gaming makes sense though, with sites like bundlestars and humble bundle, you can save $100s by buying PC vs console games, and get better graphics quality. You can also use it as a HTPC and do Netflix or KODI. Guess tough to compete with Alienware. Reply ddriver - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link Looks like it went through some rough shipment. The chasis is skewed and cracked open in one corner. Reply close - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link I get buying a cheap console, I get buying an expensive high end PC. But an expensive console-like PC? They managed to pick the worst of both worlds. Reply meacupla - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link There is a market, albeit niche, for being highly compact and portable, while still being a PC. For example, if you want to take it over to a friends house and use their TV to game on, this would be much easier to carry, compared to a mid tower weighing over 30lbs. Reply shabby - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link This is beyond niche, they should of included a game pad to append to its "gaming" audience. Reply ddriver - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link You can get a laptop of equal performance that will be more portable and compact, plus the ability to run on batteries and the integrated display.

Quite by accident, I visited the Edraw Max website only to discover that they now have a Linux version of the software. Now I could live my Ubuntu fantasy or so I thought. After a few minutes of using the open source video driver. I was about ready to pull my root hairs out. After hours of work I finally figured out how to install the official Intel graphics driver and the internet was not really that helpful. The TLDR version This is a guide about how you can install the latest Intel graphics driver in Ubuntu 16.04. I constantly digress to tell you how awesome I am; because I am totally awesome but you will find it helpful if you are using Ubuntu on a computer with the Intel Graphics chips e.g. HP laptops. Why Ubuntu 16.04? It’s an LTS (Long Term Support) edition which will receive updates until April 2021. In other versions, support only lasts for 9 months. Change is distracting. Why do I need this driver anyway? After installing Ubuntu your system will be using open source graphics. The developers at Ubuntu have worked really hard to make sure that you will have some sort of working desktop even when there are no drivers. The experience, however, is not ideal. advertisement Some of the annoyances of not installing graphic drivers are quite cosmetic. A rubbish desktop that is not so crisp looking, resolution not living up to its billing etc. Often times lacking proper drivers can be catastrophic for example you want to close your laptop lid and go for a break. When you come back you are met with a black screen no matter what you do. YouTube videos flicker, you cannot make screencasts, you cannot take screenshots without kittens dying on your screen, your software is busy chewing through some of your processor’s power instead of the GPU wasting resources. You cannot play awesome games. You cannot use the HDMI port. Need I go on? You need a graphics driver made by the people who made your graphics card. So how do you go about it? This part is easy and well documented all over the web. Go to the web Intel Website drivers website and download the installer for your platform. For most people, the 64-bit installer should do it. Once it has finished downloading, double-click on the installer and click on begin Click on install The installer will download and install the drivers for you. It will also add the Intel repository in /etc/apt/ for future updates The undocumented part You will need to launch the additional drivers’ app and install the Intel firmware Restart your computer You are still not done Now we get to the slightly hairy part. Not so long ago Microsoft (I know they love Linux now) decided to make things difficult and introduced secure boot. What it all means is that you will need permission (signed binary) from Redmond if you want to mess with the boot process. It protects devices from certain types of malware but it also complicates things. The way of installing drivers we have just outlined above works by using the DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) framework. What it means is that drivers (modules) are created on the fly on your system. The system cannot load them unless they are signed if you are using Secure Boot and there is no easy way for the Kernel to sign them. To use the drivers you have to secure boot mode. sudo update-secureboot-policy Select yes in the ncurses dialog Enter a temporary password as asked and confirm it Reboot the system You will be presented with the MOK management dialog countdown when system starts, press any key to activate it You will be asked to enter the password. You will not usually be asked for the entire password. To make sure you are paying attention you are asked for random characters from your password e.g. “Enter the third letter of your password” Be sure to press enter after typing each letter. Select yes to disable Secure Boot You should boot into your awesome desktop which can allow you to do all sorts of things including suspend/sleep, transparency, screenshot and screencasting etc NB Should you be unhappy with this procedure for some reason you can enable Secure Boot using the command: sudo update-secureboot-policy –enable  in the terminal. Final words I really hope you will find this guide useful.

But if you are dual booting, most of the time Micro$haft updates their OS, then always enable it and you will be faced with black screen with “No disk found” error. Just go through the process again. You left the actual part of installing driver, do you first install the driver and disable the secure booting or the other way round? Why Ubuntu 16.04? I would further say Ubuntu LTS versions are meant for business and people who do not want changes to their OS every 6 months. LTS are stable versions which only gets security and critical updates without altering the OS which might affect business users. Other Ubuntu versions are for enthuasiasts who are always chasing cutting edge changes and tech Reply Garikai says: January 13, 2017 at 12:29 PM The Installer (a .deb) takes care of the installation process. Then you will have to disable UEFI to allow the driver to load. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name Email Website Yes, add me to your mailing list.

MEADE, MD, UNITED STATES 01.26.2017 Story by Staff Sgt. Anthony Hyatt  70th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing ✔ ✗ Subscribe 1 “The end goal was to establish a Wing standard strength and conditioning program to minimize the effect of Intel jobs,” said William. “The Intel lifestyle includes lots of sitting, poor flexibility and strength, all of which can be corrected easily.” MOVE also provides a structured approach to physical development which may help Air Force members succeed on physical training test, according to William. “The Air Force spends a great deal of money and time investing in our Airmen to make sure they are mentally and technically able to work on robust weapon systems; and we execute our assigned missions with deadly accuracy,” said William. “But, when it comes to developing the complete continuum of fitness for individuals, I thought there was something missing, and the MOVE program was designed to fill that need.” Physical training failures also played a part in the creation of the MOVE program. “We want to come up with the best case scenario to set these folks up for success,” said Hickey, referring to those Airmen who have difficulty with physical training. “Usually, it’s not a matter of ‘I need to go out and exercise,’ instead, it’s really about changing their movement patterns, and not just exercising, but exercising well.” Those who want to take advantage of the MOVE program first need to visit the 70th ISRW Health Promotions Office to complete a Functional Movement Screen. “The FMS uses seven different assessments to identify weak and improper movement patterns,” said Hickey. Potential participants perform the movement assessments and receive a score from zero to three in each category. The evaluators assess the FMS and determine a corrective exercise program to address inefficiencies, Hickey said. The seven exercises are the deep squat, hurdle step, inline lounge, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability and rotary stability. “The actual exercise intervention is going to be dependent on what each individual scored on their FMS,” said Hickey. “If you score poorly in one of the categories, we will show you what you should be doing to improve.” According to William, the MOVE program initially started as a study to prove people who had service-related health issues due to injuries could return to fully deployable status. However, they found the program could be used by anyone, as long as they are coachable and are willing to work hard, he said. “Our approach is comprehensive and holistic, designed to pinpoint improvement areas and provide external and internal motivation through physical and online support,” said Staff Sgt. Kaz, unit fitness program manager, 29th Intelligence Squadron. “Our goal is to help you in any way possible. As always, fitness is a two-way street, but give us your all and we’ll give you ours!” For more information about the MOVE program, please call 301-688-2161 LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 01.26.2017 Date Posted: 01.26.2017 10:56 Story ID: 221448 Location: FORT GEORGE G.

It'll be customizable, interactive, and it will put them at the center of the experience. If it goes as envisioned, Intel's multi-year plan will allow viewers to tailor their own live sports broadcasts, and watch events as if they were on the field. The live sports broadcasts will be available for VR headsets, PCs, and even TVs. The experience will be unlike live sports today, in which the views and angles are selected by the broadcasters. Instead, viewers in real-time will be able to create their own 3D broadcast of a sports event. Viewers will be able to select any type of view or camera angle they want for the live broadcast. For example, users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Alternately, users will be able to view the same experience from a player's perspective. It depends on what a viewer selects, and many angles will be covered. Intel's goal is to roll out this 360-degree live broadcast technology starting in 2019, and the company is working with broadcasters to deliver the real-time interactive experience. Watching live content is now a linear experience, but live broadcasts tailor-made to viewers will revolutionize the way people watch sports, said James Carwana, general manager at Intel's sports group. Intel is already working with a number of broadcasters to deliver these unique 3D experiences in real time to viewers, said Jeff Hopper, general manager of immersive experiences at Intel. Broadcasters are eager to bring more interactive experience to live sports, Hopper said. Some sports, such as football and soccer, are ideal for this interactive 3D live sports experience. It may be difficult to bring the same experience to sports like skiing, with the action happening over long distances. But Carwana said Intel is eager to bring this experience to a variety of sports and broadcasts worldwide. Watching live sports from any angle will especially be fun on VR headsets, which allows users to view 3D content. In the future, viewers will be able to switch angles in real time and roam through a field as a play is taking place. Interactive live sports is a killer application for VR, a market that is still emerging. Games are being received with a lot of enthusiasm on VR headsets, and live sports will bring a similar experience, except a viewer isn't playing. But broadcasting live interactive content is easier said than done. It involves implementing an army of cameras in stadiums, creating a full 3D video experience so any particular scene can be viewed from any angle, and a new media format to support the interactive experience. It also requires a powerful back-end of servers to process all the data required to create an experience customized to each viewer. Intel's starting off modestly with interactive replays instead of live broadcasts, allowing it to test the technology before it goes big time. At Super Bowl LI on Feb. 5, Fox Sports will show interactive replays based on Intel's 360-degree replay technology. Intel has already used similar replay technology in sports like baseball and basketball. Further down the road, as technology is closely integrated into sports, users will be able to view live statistics as part of the experience. Intel has already done that, with live statistics on display during a live broadcast of the Winter X Games last year. In real-time, users were able to view key athlete performance data like how high a snowboarder jumped and how far they rotated. The data was captured from sensors on the snowboards. Intel is working on technology that will make all of this happen. It is using a media format called FreeD, which will be central to live interactive sports broadcasts. Instead of pixels, which are used in regular images and video file formats, FreeD will have voxels, which composes image content in a three-dimensional format. In each stadium offering live interactive video, 38 cameras will be installed, which is enough to generate a full view of all angles needed to generate a custom broadcast for each viewer. The cameras will generate terabytes of image data every few seconds. During a live broadcast, a viewer will be able to select the angle they want to see a sport from, and that request will be delivered to a server. The server will compile the custom broadcast by processing and cutting images from all 38 cameras to generate the desired angle. Servers will need a lot of horsepower to do that. Intel will use FreeD rendering technologies from its acquisition of Replay Technologies, which specializes in video formatting. It will also rely on algorithms to help generate those interactive for live sports broadcasts. Intel has targeted the TV market several times previously, including a plan to launch its own TV service, but failed. This is the most ambitious experience so far, and it'll require many years of commitment. Intel has also acquired companies like Voke -- which provides technology to deliver live 3D broadcasts to VR headsets -- that are playing a central role in the chipmaker's efforts. The amount of data generated for an interactive live sports broadcast leads to bandwidth challenges, the Intel executives acknowledged. But with technologies like 5G -- which could transmit mobile data at speeds of up to 20Gbps -- coming, some of those issues could be resolved, Hopper said. The live sports technology touches upon the key markets Intel is pursuing, including 5G, servers, and the internet of things. The technology is still not here, and Intel's plan to make it possible by 2019 seems ambitious considering the numerous challenges. But Intel has a clear vision of how live sports broadcasts will look, and it's exciting.

I find it difficult to believe just how fast things are moving with regard to using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning techniques (for example, see Deep learning machine vision system aids blind and visually impaired, Deep learning hits a sweet note, Machine learning platform speeds optimization of vision systems, Unlocking the power of AI for all developers, and Push-button generation of deep neural networks). Of course, one really interesting application is to perform object detection and identification, including the really tricky task of recognizing and identifying faces in images and videos. This sort of task benefits from the extreme parallelism offered by FPGAs. Of particular interest are Intel's current generation of FPGAs, whose hard-core DSP slices offer both fixed-point and floating-point capabilities, making them suitable for a wide range of artificial intelligence (AI) and embedded vision applications. Intel's midrange Arria 10 FPGAs, for example, provide up to 1.5 teraflops (TFLOPs) of single-precision floating-point processing performance, 1.15 million logic elements, and more than a terabit-per-second high-speed connectivity. Working with Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, engineers at ZTE -- a Chinese multinational telecommunications equipment and systems company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong -- have used Arria 10 FPGAs to implement a cloud inferencing application using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to perform high-accuracy facial recognition on more than 1,000 images/frames per second. (Source: Getty Images) Traditionally, facial recognition technology has been primarily of interest to law enforcement agencies, who use these systems to isolate and identify faces in crowds (at airports, for example). But there is tremendous potential for this technology in a wide variety of applications, such as informing blind and visually impaired persons if someone they know is approaching them. See also: Facial recognition to replace passports in Australian airports, but at what ethical cost? Troubling study claims machine-learning algorithm predicts criminal tendency based on facial traits Omron Face Detection Technology Fact Sheet In the case of your humble narrator, I'm dreadfully bad at remembering names and recognizing faces. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that I attend a lot of conferences, and people are always coming up to me saying things like "Max, how are you?" And I have to dance around (conversationally-speaking), desperately trying to work out who they are and how I know them. Based on this, I can easily envision how useful a Google Glass-type device would be if it had the ability to identify people in a crowd and present me with useful information -- possibly using bone conduction so as to leave my ears free and also prevent anyone else knowing what was going on -- like "Professor Cuthbert Dribble is approaching. You last saw him at the Embedded Conference in Copenhagen in November 2015. He loves cats and it's his turn to buy a round of beers." How about you? What applications can you see (no pun intended) for this sort of facial identification and recognition technology?

Yes, we do this at ESC now -- that's very handy -- it seems like badges naturally want to be the wrong way round. But when someone comes up to you shouting "Max, how good to see you," it's a bit "obvious" to try to look at his badge to work out who he is. That reminds be of the joke that a cat always lands on its feet, and a dropped piece of buttered toast always lands butter-side down, so if you duct-tape a piece of buttered toast to th eback of a cat, it will end up hovering in mid-air.

Without a doubt, the regime change in DC is dramatic. It is bound to significantly affect and alter the future course of our political, economic, and financial systems—well, at least for the next four years. However, the near and distant future may very well be even more significantly affected by what is happening in Silicon Valley. Certainly, recent developments in autonomous cars, robotics, and artificial intelligence have captured the imagination of tech investors. One way they’ve played the future is by investing in the manufacturers producing the semiconductor chips that will run all of these new technologies. The S&P 500 Semiconductor industry index gained 42.9% over the past 12 months through Tuesday’s close (Fig. 8). The Semiconductor Equipment industry index gained even more over the same period, 72.4%, making it the second best-performing of the S&P 500 industries we track for the period (Fig. 9). Semi stocks have also been boosted by lots of M&A activity and hopes that semiconductor revenues growth will pick up to the mid-single-digits this year. Gartner expects that last year’s lackluster 1.5% y/y sales growth will be followed by a 7.2% y/y increase in worldwide revenue to $364.1 billion in 2017, according to the company’s 1/23 press release. The pickup in growth doesn’t come from traditional areas like cell phones and computers. Those segments have moved from growth mode to replacement mode. Instead, the growth is coming from new areas like self-driving cars, the Internet-of-things, and cloud computing. Here’s a look at some of the recent developments charging up the chip industry: (1) Driving sales. The more our cars can do, the more computing power they must include. That’s good news for the semiconductor industry. “J.P. Morgan estimated that the total available market for semiconductors used in semiautonomous and fully autonomous cars will reach about $7.3 billion by 2025, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 62.5% starting in 2017,” reported an 8/27 MarketWatch article. “That estimate assumes that semiautonomous and fully autonomous cars together will make up about 15.7% of a projected 109.6 million light vehicles produced globally. The total cost of all the chips per vehicle will rise to $400 to $500 a car, up from $300 to $400 from ADAS functions.” The total world market for automotive semiconductors grew to $30.3 billion last year, and is expected to hit about $41 billion in 2020. (2) Game on. Nvidia has been one of the best-performing semi stocks over the past year, climbing 269.4% y/y through Tuesday’s close. Known for graphics processing chips that power video game machines, Nvidia’s shares have performed so well because investors believe the company’s chips will be used in gadgets that have artificial intelligence and in driverless cars. Nvidia has “an ambitious goal of getting a Level 4 driverless car--an almost fully autonomous car--on the market by 2020, which it is executing through a partnership with Audi. It also announced an initiative with Bosch to enhance artificial intelligence in automobiles, e.g., cars that can sense when you are sleeping or texting while driving, as well as a smart home hub through its Shield brand that will be powered by Alphabet Inc’s Google Now artificial intelligence,” relayed a 1/7 MarketWatch article. According to the FT, Nvidia has a technological lead over industry titan Intel. Nvidia “is widely credited with having developed the best chips for training the artificial neural networks built by companies including Google, Amazon and Baidu to do things like recognize images or understand language,” as a 12/30 FT article explained. It quoted Patrick Moorhead, a chip analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy: “I’ve never seen such agreement about a technology. I think they’re two to three years ahead of Intel.” But he added that Intel also has the same market in its sights and shouldn’t be counted out. After their strong rally over the past year, Nvidia’s shares, at a recent $107.33, trade at almost 40 times Wall Street analysts’ 2017 consensus earnings estimate of $2.75 a share. If achieved, that would mark earnings growth of 13.6%. (3) Stale chips. Not all semiconductor stocks have been moonshots. Intel shares, for example, have risen 25.7% y/y, modestly faster than the S&P 500’s 19.6% gain. The company has been held back relative to other semiconductor peers because more of its chips are used in personal computers, which have suffered from declining sales, and in servers, which have slowing sales. Worldwide PC shipments fell 3.7% y/y in Q4, and for all of 2016 they declined 6.2% y/y, estimates Gartner in a 1/11 press release. PC shipments have declined annually since 2012 and are expected to remain stagnant. Semis for servers kick in about a third of Intel’s revenue, and that market is also undergoing radical change. Fewer companies are buying servers because they’re using cloud services from Amazon.com, Alphabet’s Google, and Microsoft. Those cloud companies are certainly buying servers, but their large size gives them a better bargaining position. “Their growing market clout gives them the ability to push Intel for more specialized designs, which raises Intel’s costs. The data-center group’s operating earnings fell 1.6% year over year for the 12-month period ended Oct. 1, despite a 7% gain in sales in that time,” noted a 1/23 WSJ article. Shares of Intel, which reports earnings today, trade at 13.4 times Wall Street analysts’ fiscal 2017 consensus earnings estimates. (4) M&A boost. The semi industry has been blessed with a torrid M&A environment as small companies specializing in some of the new technologies are getting snapped up by larger competitors. A 11/14 WSJ article reported: “Semiconductor companies have capped more than $240 billion worth in mergers and acquisitions in the past two years, according to Dealogic. This year’s total to date--$130.2 billion--is a record, 16% above the previous high set last year. Big deals skew the dollar total, but there have been plenty of those, too. Six transactions in the past two years have been worth more than $10 billion and three topped $30 billion.” More normal years since 2000 have seen only $20 million to $40 million of deals done annually. The author’s conclusion: The pace of M&A will likely slow as the best companies have been purchased and those with the ability to do a deal have already done so. That conclusion leaves us wondering how much of an acquisition premium remains in smaller stocks and whether that premium will dissipate. (5) The numbers. Analysts expect the S&P 500 Semiconductors industry to grow revenue by 8.9% this year and 4.4% in 2018 (Fig. 10). The industry’s forward profit margin has increased by 4.2ppts to a record high of 24.2% since the beginning of 2016 (Fig. 11). As a result, earnings are thought to grow 15.9% this year and 8.3% in 2018 (Fig. 12). Net earnings revisions have been positive since the second half of 2016, with readings of 15.6% in January, 17.1% in December, and 15.6% in November (Fig. 13). The S&P 500 Semiconductors industry’s forward earnings multiple has ranged between 10 and 20 times over the past 20 years, with the exception of the 1999-2000 Tech bubble when the multiple soared much higher (Fig. 14). With a forward P/E of 15.2 and earnings still growing, this industry looks like it still has room to head higher. (6) Shovel-makers. Another way to invest in the sector is to purchase stocks in the S&P 500 Semiconductor Equipment industry, composed of companies that make the equipment to manufacture the chips. However, this strategy is far from a secret. As we mentioned above, the industry has gained 72.4% over the past year, and one of its largest stocks, Applied Materials, gained 99.6% over the past year. That leaves Applied Materials’ shares trading at 14.4 times 2017 expected earnings and leaves the industry’s forward P/E at 13.8. Normally a below-market multiple would be a good thing. However, semi equipment companies are typically cyclical. Earnings multiples are high at the bottom of the cycle when earnings are low and shares are undervalued. Conversely, multiples are low when earnings are high at the top of the cycle. The S&P 500 Semiconductor Equipment industry cycle, Joe informs us, lasts about a year or two, and the current cycle is long in the tooth, having begun in 2015 (Fig. 15). Earnings are at record levels, as are margins (Fig. 16 and Fig. 17). In the past when forward earnings peaked, the industry’s forward P/E was between 10 and 15. There were two exceptions: During the tech boom of 1999-2000, when the forward earnings multiple exceeded 30 and earnings were hitting a peak, and in 2002, when the excesses of the tech boom were still being shed (Fig. 18). So while the technology being developed seems awfully cool, the numbers are warning that there have been better times to buy this industry.

Miller January 25, 2017 10 Comments The new phones at CES were nice, but the new technology for future phones was what I found really fascinating. CES is never really a phone show—the upcoming Mobile World Congress, which takes place in a few weeks, usually features more mobile products—but this year's CES did see the introduction of a number of interesting mid-tier phones, and more importantly, some new technology that may well find its way into phones later on this year. The most interesting new phone was probably the Asus Zenfone AR, one of the first phones able to run both Google's Daydream VR and Tango augmented reality systems. It's an interesting concept, and I'm curious to see the quantity and quality of AR apps that will be ready when the phone ships in the second quarter. Asus also announced the Zenfone 3 Zoom, which adds a dual-camera setup to the already quite interesting Zenfone 3, which I tried at the end of last year. I was also very interested in the U.S. version of Huawei's high-end Mate 9, which is most notable for including Amazon's Alexa service preinstalled. The Mate 9 has a 5.9-inch display, runs the Kirin 960 processor, and Android 7.0 Nougat. Another large phone is the LG Stylus 3, a mid-range device that stands out for having a stylus (which is increasingly rare in the U.S. market following the removal of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7). When it comes to phones at this year's CES, much of the story was about value. The show saw the launch of LG's K series (above) and Samsung's A series—both reasonable lines of mid-range phones that aren't special but look to be good values. I would say the same about the Huawei Honor 6X, which shows that you can have a dual-camera phone for just $249. Still, I was more interested in what some of the technologies I saw could mean for future phones. The Move to 10nm Chips One of the big trends for this year will be the likelihood that higher-end phones will use chips produced on 10nm processes, which should allow for more performance and/or better battery life. Keith Kressin, SVP of Product Management at Qualcomm Technologies, demonstrated what may be the first such chip to ship, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, which is manufactured using Samsung's 10nm process. Kressin said this chip will be 35 percent smaller than the existing 14nm Snapdragon 820/821, yet will offer 35 percent lower power or 2.5 hours more battery power. Quick Charge 4.0 will allow a five-minute charge to give a phone five hours of talk time, Kressin said. Adreno 520 graphics should enable 25 percent faster graphics, which Qualcomm said should allow for better VR/AR applications. The chip will also have improved security and machine learning features, as well as an X16 "gigabit class" modem along with support for such new standards as 802.11ac and ad. This should be in phones in the first half of this year. I expect we'll hear more at Mobile World Congress. Samsung is also likely to have a version of its own Exynos processor on the 10nm processor (widely rumored to be the 8895) at about the same time. Meanwhile, the other leading-edge foundry, TSMC, has also promised 10nm processors for later this year. It seems likely that we will see Apple and MediaTek processors using this process, though neither company has confirmed this. The third major foundry, GlobalFoundries, is taking a different tact. It is now ramping up its 14nm process, as well as an alternative known as fully depleted silicon-on-insulator, which it calls FDX. Alain Mutricy, senior vice president for product management, says its 22nm FDX process delivers similar performance to 14nm FinFETs at the cost of 28nm planar. GlobalFoundries believes its 12nm FDX process, which is due in 2019, will match the 10nm processes in performance but at a much lower cost, as it will require fewer masks. High-end processors will still require FinFETs for maximum performance, but Mutricy says chips for mid-range and low-end phones, as well as other Internet of Things devices, are good candidates for FDX. GlobalFoundries plans to skip 10nm, which it says won't be cost-effective with existing lithography tools, and skip directly to 7nm FinFETs with a process that will be compatible with new EUV lithography tools when they are ready for volume production. TSMC is also rushing to get 7nm ready, and recently revealed it will use a similar strategy, offering a second version of 7nm with EUV lithography. Samsung has opted to wait for EUV before shifting to 7nm. Intel showed off a running 2-in-1 design with its 10nm Cannon Lake chips, though these are designed for laptops and 2-in-1s, not phones. (Most observers think that Intel's 10nm process will have finer details than the 10nm process from Samsung or TSMC, though it's clear that 10nm is now more of a name than a measurement of any particular dimension.) Intel continued to repeat its mantra that Moore's Law is alive and well, with CEO Brian Krzanich saying he was sure it would be going long after he retires. Thinking about processors that are yet to come, one thing that has become increasingly clear is that security will be a big concern. ARM, which makes the IP behind the processor cores in virtually all phones, talked about further work on its TrustZone technology, and work on a "crypto cell" key store and cryptography engine. In addition, ARM is working on a suite of cloud services enabled by its processors designed to provide provisioning, identity management, and authentication, particularly for IoT devices. ARM also talked about just how far processors have come in the past few years, pointing out that they now support better cameras and more sensor input, and not just fast CPU and GPU performance. ARM executives said they expect similar levels of improvement over the next couple of years. 5G on the horizon Of course, processors aren't the only mobile technology that is changing. 5G was also at the show, with Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf promoting the concept of "the 5G future," at one of the keynotes. "5G isn't an incremental improvement in connectivity, or even just a new generation of mobile," Mollenkopf said, "5G will be a new kind of network, supporting a vast diversity of devices with unprecedented scale, speed, and complexity." Qualcomm, Ericsson, and AT&T announced plans to conduct testing and over-the-air field trials based on the expected 5G New Radio specifications, and also pushed millimeter Wave tests. Meanwhile, at the show, Intel announced what it called the world's first global 5G modem supporting both sub-6Hz bands and mmWave spectrum. The company hopes this modem, which is due to be sampling in the second half of the year, will be used in many of the 5G trials that are now ongoing. I'm sure we'll learn more about other trial processors at MWC. Batteries, Scanners, and Displays There were other technologies I found quite interesting at the show. Panasonic showed off its flexible lithium-ion, which it says it hopes to have ready for production in 2018. This is still a lithium-ion battery, but it has a very different design compared to conventional batteries, with more of a flat rectangular shape for the battery cells versus the more common cylindrical shape. The battery, which is 0.45 mm thick, is bendable enough to fit around a soda can. At the show, the company showed three different versions, ranging from 17.5 to 60 mAh—not enough for a phone, but certainly enough for some kinds of IoT devices. I was also very interested in seeing Synaptics's demonstration of how it could now place an optical fingerprint sensor underneath a standard cover glass on a phone, thus enabling a fingerprint sensor on the front without the need for a physical button. At first, this feature would likely be deployed in a fixed location on the screen, but over time it could be applied anywhere on the screen. One can imagine how this could change the design of smartphones, most of which now either have a fingerprint scanner in a button below the screen or on the back of the phone. I didn't really see many new display technologies for phones at the show—the phones mostly used existing LCD or AMOLED screens—but I did see a lot of people who are trying to come up with better displays for VR headsets. Resolution is a big deal here because every VR system I've tried to date suffers from the "screen-door effect" at the short distance you wear VR or AR glasses. A "retina" display would offer a much higher resolution than anything you'd need on your phone. While there were a couple of different solutions in prototype headsets, the most advanced display I saw came from Kopin, which showed a 1-inch OLED panel with a 2048 by 2048 resolution and a 120 Hz frame rate. That's probably overkill for phone resolution, but I can imagine it could be used in some very nice companion VR glasses. Of course, I saw many wireless charging solutions and was particularly intrigued by the concept of truly wireless solutions, as I discussed in yesterday's post. It's unlikely that we'll see all of these advances in any one device this year, but taken together, we should see a variety of different mobile devices with some quite new features later in the year. It should be interesting. Back to top Previous : Truly Wireless Charging Edges Closer New Processors, Notebooks, and Desktops Highlight CES's New ... Next : By Michael J. Miller Michael J.

By John Kimelman Biography Jan. 24, 2017 6:20 p.m. ET Getty Images Unfortunately for financial journalists, the speed of markets vastly exceeds the time it takes for journalists to cover those markets. Anyone needing a reminder of that only had to see how quickly stocks moved once it was clear on election night that Donald Trump would be the next president. Stocks in sectors ranging from financial services to Big Pharma rose on the expectation that Trump, who favors a lower corporate tax and less industry regulation, will help usher policies favorable to corporate bottom lines. In the days and weeks that followed, financial writers had to play catch-up in writing about stocks and other investments that would be both helped and hurt by the GOP controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Some of this catch-up journalism has its place. Still, it can’t be forgotten that stocks absorb all available information fairly quickly in hours, if not minutes. They certainly don’t wait around for writers on a daily, weekly or monthly deadline to weigh in. That fact hasn’t stopped Fortune veteran writer Shawn Tully from writing about the likely investment impact arising from GOP plans to create a tax break on the foreign profits of U.S. corporations that would repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars.

Tully attempts to quantify how much capital could potentially infuse the bottom lines of U.S. companies should President Trump and Congress agree to tax foreign profits at a low level – say 10%. The odds of such a tax holiday are quite high since both political parties favor it. “According to data assembled by Jack Ciesielski, author of the Analyst’s Accounting Observer, S&P 500 companies held $2.2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings, or UFE, at the close of 2015,” adds Tully. “Add non-S&P 500 companies and 2016 profits, and today’s total is most likely closer to $2.6 trillion.” Tully writes that investing pros estimate that about 40% of the untaxed foreign profits – or roughly $1 trillion, will come back to the U.S. – and that companies would net at least $850 billion after they pay their modest tax bills on it. He points out that two stock sectors account for much of that money: technology and health care, chiefly pharmaceuticals. Moreover, neither industry is likely to use much of the money for research and development or new plants. “Instead, they will channel their windfalls toward goals that could be a boon for investors,” Tully adds, namely dividends and share buybacks. “For now there’s no guarantee that a repatriation bonus will help investors in the long run,” concludes Tully. “If the world’s Apples and Pfizers buy back shares at too high a price or overpay for acquisitions, their shareholders could suffer later. Still, in the short term, stocks will do a lot better if $1 trillion in foreign profits flows to U.S. shores.” It’s hard to argue with such a restrained assessment. While Fortune’s Tully focuses on stocks that can benefit from a Trump proposal, MarketWatch columnist Nigam Arora wonders whether the new president’s protectionist ideas could, if enacted, do damage to the overseas earnings of blue-chip companies. Trump has threatened countries like China and Mexico with tariffs, leading free-market advocates including Barron’s to openly worry about a potential trade war that could hurt U.S. exporters and lead to a global recession. Along those lines, Arora has tried to identified U.S. exporters that could be victims of retaliation by trade rivals. He is particularly concerned about U.S. chip makers because the Chinese and Americans compete head-on in this industry. No. 1 on Arora’s list is Nvidia NVDA 1.9334245326037391% NVIDIA Corp.

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is known for graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market as well as technology for self-driving cars and machine learning. “As protectionism heats up, Nvidia’s products could be dropped in favor of those of local companies, damaging earnings of this expensive stock,” he writes. In recent weeks, Nvidia’s stock has been under pressure in part because of concerns about a potential semiconductor trade war. Indeed as a piece on Seeking Alpha recently pointed out, “if a semiconductor trade war between the U.S. and China materializes, the onset of Nvidia’s retracement may be markedly sooner, and the low may be significantly lower. The prospect of a semiconductor trade war is not presently reflected in the stock’s price.” Email: editors@barrons.com Follow @johnkimelman Like Barron’s on Facebook Follow Barron’s on Twitter Email Print 0 Comments Order Reprints Facebook Share Twitter Google+ smaller Larger Latest in Read This, Spike That 1.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this IBM brings Google's AI tools to its powerful computers Intel's BigDL deep learning framework snubs GPUs for CPUs AWS machine learning VMs go faster, but not forward Video Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on When Intel unveiled its BigDL machine learning framework, it emphasized CPU rather than GPU power. With this move, Intel hopes to keep its present and future hardware competitive in the expanding world of machine learning. IBM also is interested in boosting the use of its CPUs for machine learning in PowerAI, though with a different strategy. It pairs IBM's Power8 processors with Nvidia GPUs, and IBM says it's a prime method for running common machine learning applications like Caffe, Torch, and Theano. [ Deep learning reviews: Spark lights up machine learning. | TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning. | Microsoft takes on TensorFlow. | MXNet: Amazon's scalable deep learning. | Caffe deep learning conquers image classification. | Scikit-learn shines for simpler machine learning. | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter. ] Now IBM has added TensorFlow to the mix. Google's deep-leaning framework spans both CPUs and GPUs, and IBM is pushing PowerAI as the perfect hardware blend to make the most of TensorFlow. While the Xeon Phi chip sits at the heart of Intel's machine learning hardware push, PowerAI uses IBM's Power8 processor with the Nvidia Tesla Pascal P100 GPU. Nvidia's Pascal line of GPUs is a next-generation machine learning server, due to a specifically tailored instruction set. But machine learning applications have to be written specifically to run that instruction set, and many cloud-based machine learning systems (like AWS) don't use Pascal hardware. IBM's plan is to provide a whole package: CPUs, GPUs, and software, all designed to complement each other. The GPUs, for instance, use Nvidia's custom NVlink bus to provide high-speed GPU-to-GPU and GPU-to-CPU connections, which IBM has already featured in other servers aimed at the high-performance computing market. IBM also wants a slightly narrower focus for PowerAI compared to some of its competition. Mainly, it'll be used for training machine learning models from raw data. This is the slow and computation-intensive phase of any machine learning project, particularly for TensorFlow-powered deep learning applications. Thus, IBM emphasizes having high-end CPUs and GPUs, and on building out the hardware underneath to accelerate the entire product. IBM's PowerAI ambitions are also likely to be carried forward by the introduction of the Power9 processor later this year.  As always with IBM, the bigger question is the size of the prospective market for this iron. IBM's issue isn't that customers are more readily served by commodity Intel processors; having Linux on the Power platform has helped knocked down that problem. Instead, it's that businesses interested in machine learning have the luxury of opting for the cloud to obtain cheap, flexible access to GPU-powered services where TensorFlow and other algorithms are available.

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 01.25.17 in Personal Computing Comments 576 Shares Share Tweet Share Save This year marks a first for Dell's education-focused computer family: 2-in-1 laptops. Like the company's other computers destined for schools, the Dell Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles are built to withstand classrooms and student abuse. They both sport the same basic design -- rubberized shock protection for falls, sealed keyboards to handle spills and lots of rounded corners -- but one runs Windows 10 and the other is powered by Chrome OS (we'll let you guess which is which). Gallery: Dell's 2017 Education Laptops | 8 Photos 8 +4 As with most convertibles -- including Dell's recent XPS 13 2-in-1 -- the new 11-inch laptops can be used in a traditional mode, folded in a tent formation, or have their screen wrapped all the way around like a tablet. Stylus-wise, they support Dell's optional Productivity Active Pen. The Latitude 11 Convertible will be powered by Intel's seventh-generation Pentium and Celeron chips, while the Chromebook model runs sixth-generation Celerons. Dell also redesigned its 11-inch and 13-inch Latitude and Chromebook laptops with a slimmer, more minimalist look. They're also built to withstand falls and spills, and they've received the requisite processor upgrades over the last generation. Once again, the Windows versions will get more CPU options, with seventh-generation Intel Pentium and Celeron chips for the Inspiron 11 and newer Core i5 processors for the Inspiron 13. The Chromebook variants, meanwhile, are stuck with sixth-gen Celerons (the Chromebook 13 also has a Core i3 option). All of the company's new education laptops will be available on February 7th. The Latitude and Chromebook 11 Convertibles will start at $579 and $349, respectively. The traditional Latitude and Chromebook 11 laptops, meanwhile, will start out at $349 and $219. And the flagship Latitude and Chromebook 13 models will go for $519 and $299. As usual, Chromebooks are an enticing deal for schools that want to get as many computers as possible in their classrooms. In other news, Dell also announced two new Interactive Touch 4K displays, a 55-inch and 86-inch model. They follow in the footsteps of the company's 70-inch 1080p touch display, and they're meant to offer more options for educators who want to have a large collaborative screen for their classes and meetings. They pack in DisplayPort and VGA connections for plugging in computers, as well as the expected HDMI ports (three for the 55-inch and four for the 86-inch). They'll be available on March 30th below $5,000 and $11,000, respectively (we still don't have an exact price).

Close Skip to main content The Guardian The long read Vanishing point: the rise of the invisible computer For decades, computers have got smaller and more powerful, enabling huge scientific progress. But this can’t go on for ever. What happens when they stop shrinking? by Tim Cross For decades, computers have got smaller and more powerful, enabling huge scientific progress. But this can’t go on for ever. What happens when they stop shrinking? by Tim Cross Vanishing point: the rise of the invisible computer Thursday 26 January 2017 00.59 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In 1971, Intel, then an obscure firm in what would only later come to be known as Silicon Valley, released a chip called the 4004. It was the world’s first commercially available microprocessor, which meant it sported all the electronic circuits necessary for advanced number-crunching in a single, tiny package. It was a marvel of its time, built from 2,300 tiny transistors, each around 10,000 nanometres (or billionths of a metre) across – about the size of a red blood cell. A transistor is an electronic switch that, by flipping between “on” and “off”, provides a physical representation of the 1s and 0s that are the fundamental particles of information. In 2015 Intel, by then the world’s leading chipmaker, with revenues of more than $55bn that year, released its Skylake chips. The firm no longer publishes exact numbers, but the best guess is that they have about 1.5bn–2 bn transistors apiece. Spaced 14 nanometres apart, each is so tiny as to be literally invisible, for they are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelengths of light that humans use to see. Everyone knows that modern computers are better than old ones. But it is hard to convey just how much better, for no other consumer technology has improved at anything approaching a similar pace. The standard analogy is with cars: if the car from 1971 had improved at the same rate as computer chips, then by 2015 new models would have had top speeds of about 420 million miles per hour. That is roughly two-thirds the speed of light, or fast enough to drive round the world in less than a fifth of a second. If that is still too slow, then before the end of 2017 models that can go twice as fast again will begin arriving in showrooms. This blistering progress is a consequence of an observation first made in 1965 by one of Intel’s founders, Gordon Moore. Moore noted that the number of components that could be crammed onto an integrated circuit was doubling every year. Later amended to every two years, “Moore’s law” has become a self-fulfilling prophecy that sets the pace for the entire computing industry. Each year, firms such as Intel and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company spend billions of dollars figuring out how to keep shrinking the components that go into computer chips. Along the way, Moore’s law has helped to build a world in which chips are built in to everything from kettles to cars (which can, increasingly, drive themselves), where millions of people relax in virtual worlds, financial markets are played by algorithms and pundits worry that artificial intelligence will soon take all the jobs. But it is also a force that is nearly spent. Shrinking a chip’s components gets harder each time you do it, and with modern transistors having features measured in mere dozens of atoms, engineers are simply running out of room. There have been roughly 22 ticks of Moore’s law since the launch of the 4004 in 1971 through to mid-2016. For the law to hold until 2050 means there will have to be 17 more, in which case those engineers would have to figure out how to build computers from components smaller than an atom of hydrogen, the smallest element there is. That, as far as anyone knows, is impossible. Yet business will kill Moore’s law before physics does, for the benefits of shrinking transistors are not what they used to be. Moore’s law was given teeth by a related phenomenon called “Dennard scaling” (named for Robert Dennard, an IBM engineer who first formalised the idea in 1974), which states that shrinking a chip’s components makes that chip faster, less power-hungry and cheaper to produce. Chips with smaller components, in other words, are better chips, which is why the computing industry has been able to persuade consumers to shell out for the latest models every few years. But the old magic is fading. Shrinking chips no longer makes them faster or more efficient in the way that it used to. At the same time, the rising cost of the ultra-sophisticated equipment needed to make the chips is eroding the financial gains. Moore’s second law, more light-hearted than his first, states that the cost of a “foundry”, as such factories are called, doubles every four years. A modern one leaves little change from $10bn. Even for Intel, that is a lot of money. The result is a consensus among Silicon Valley’s experts that Moore’s law is near its end. “From an economic standpoint, Moore’s law is dead,” says Linley Gwennap, who runs a Silicon Valley analysis firm. Dario Gil, IBM’s head of research and development, is similarly frank: “I would say categorically that the future of computing cannot just be Moore’s law any more.” Bob Colwell, a former chip designer at Intel, thinks the industry may be able to get down to chips whose components are just five nanometres apart by the early 2020s – “but you’ll struggle to persuade me that they’ll get much further than that”. One of the most powerful technological forces of the past 50 years, in other words, will soon have run its course. The assumption that computers will carry on getting better and cheaper at breakneck speed is baked into people’s ideas about the future. It underlies many technological forecasts, from self-driving cars to better artificial intelligence and ever more compelling consumer gadgetry. There are other ways of making computers better besides shrinking their components. The end of Moore’s law does not mean that the computer revolution will stall. But it does mean that the coming decades will look very different from the preceding ones, for none of the alternatives is as reliable, or as repeatable, as the great shrinkage of the past half-century. A smartphone that packs more computing power than was available to nations in 1971 can last a day on one battery charge Moore’s law has made computers smaller, transforming them from room-filling behemoths to svelte, pocket-filling slabs. It has also made them more frugal: a smartphone that packs more computing power than was available to entire nations in 1971 can last a day or more on a single battery charge. But its most famous effect has been to make computers faster. By 2050, when Moore’s law will be ancient history, engineers will have to make use of a string of other tricks if they are to keep computers getting faster. There are some easy wins. One is better programming. The breakneck pace of Moore’s law has in the past left software firms with little time to streamline their products. The fact that their customers would be buying faster machines every few years weakened the incentive even further: the easiest way to speed up sluggish code might simply be to wait a year or two for hardware to catch up. As Moore’s law winds down, the famously short product cycles of the computing industry may start to lengthen, giving programmers more time to polish their work. Another is to design chips that trade general mathematical prowess for more specialised hardware. Modern chips are starting to feature specialised circuits designed to speed up common tasks, such as decompressing a film, performing the complex calculations required for encryption or drawing the complicated 3D graphics used in video games. As computers spread into all sorts of other products, such specialised silicon will be very useful. Self-driving cars, for instance, will increasingly make use of machine vision, in which computers learn to interpret images from the real world, classifying objects and extracting information, which is a computationally demanding task. Specialised circuitry will provide a significant boost. Facebook Twitter Pinterest IBM reckons 3D chips could allow designers to shrink a supercomputer that now fills a building to something the size of a shoebox. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images However, for computing to continue to improve at the rate to which everyone has become accustomed, something more radical will be needed. One idea is to try to keep Moore’s law going by moving it into the third dimension. Modern chips are essentially flat, but researchers are toying with chips that stack their components on top of each other. Even if the footprint of such chips stops shrinking, building up would allow their designers to keep cramming in more components, just as tower blocks can house more people in a given area than low-rise houses. The first such devices are already coming to market: Samsung, a big South Korean microelectronics firm, sells hard drives whose memory chips are stacked in several layers. The technology holds huge promise. Modern computers mount their memory several centimetres from their processors. At silicon speeds a centimetre is a long way, meaning significant delays whenever new data need to be fetched. A 3D chip could eliminate that bottleneck by sandwiching layers of processing logic between layers of memory. IBM reckons that 3D chips could allow designers to shrink a supercomputer that currently fills a building to something the size of a shoebox. But making it work will require some fundamental design changes. Modern chips already run hot, requiring beefy heatsinks and fans to keep them cool. A 3D chip would be even worse, for the surface area available to remove heat would grow much more slowly than the volume that generates it. For the same reason, there are problems with getting enough electricity and data into such a chip to keep it powered and fed with numbers to crunch. IBM’s shoebox supercomputer would therefore require liquid cooling. Microscopic channels would be drilled into each chip, allowing cooling liquid to flow through. At the same time, the firm believes that the coolant can double as a power source. The idea is to use it as the electrolyte in a flow battery, in which electrolyte flows past fixed electrodes. There are more exotic ideas, too. Quantum computing proposes to use the counterintuitive rules of quantum mechanics to build machines that can solve certain types of mathematical problem far more quickly than any conventional computer, no matter how fast or high-tech (for many other problems, though, a quantum machine would offer no advantage). Their most famous application is cracking some cryptographic codes, but their most important use may be accurately simulating the quantum subtleties of chemistry, a problem that has thousands of uses in manufacturing and industry but that conventional machines find almost completely intractable. A decade ago, quantum computing was confined to speculative research within universities. These days several big firms – including Microsoft, IBM and Google – are pouring money into the technology all of which forecast that quantum chips should be available within the next decade or two (indeed, anyone who is interested can already play with one of IBM’s quantum chips remotely, programming it via the internet). A Canadian firm called D-Wave already sells a limited quantum computer, which can perform just one mathematical function, though it is not yet clear whether that specific machine is really faster than a non-quantum model. Like 3D chips, quantum computers need specialised care and feeding. For a quantum computer to work, its internals must be sealed off from the outside world. Quantum computers must be chilled with liquid helium to within a hair’s breadth of absolute zero, and protected by sophisticated shielding, for even the smallest pulse of heat or stray electromagnetic wave could ruin the delicate quantum states that such machines rely on. Each of these prospective improvements, though, is limited: either the gains are a one-off, or they apply only to certain sorts of calculations. The great strength of Moore’s law was that it improved everything, every couple of years, with metronomic regularity. Progress in the future will be bittier, more unpredictable and more erratic. And, unlike the glory days, it is not clear how well any of this translates to consumer products. Few people would want a cryogenically cooled quantum PC or smartphone, after all. Ditto liquid cooling, which is heavy, messy and complicated. Even building specialised logic for a given task is worthwhile only if it will be regularly used. But all three technologies will work well in data centres, where they will help to power another big trend of the next few decades. Traditionally, a computer has been a box on your desk or in your pocket. In the future the increasingly ubiquitous connectivity provided by the internet and the mobile-phone network will allow a great deal of computing power to be hidden away in data centres, with customers making use of it as and when they need it. In other words, computing will become a utility that is tapped on demand, like electricity or water today. The ability to remove the hardware that does the computational heavy lifting from the hunk of plastic with which users actually interact – known as “cloud computing” – will be one of the most important ways for the industry to blunt the impact of the demise of Moore’s law. Unlike a smartphone or a PC, which can only grow so large, data centres can be made more powerful simply by building them bigger. As the world’s demand for computing continues to expand, an increasing proportion of it will take place in shadowy warehouses hundreds of miles from the users who are being served. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google’s data centre in Dalles, Oregon. ‘As the world’s demand for computing continues to expand, an increasing proportion of it will take place in shadowy warehouses hundreds of miles from the users who are being served.’ Photograph: Uncredited/AP This is already beginning to happen. Take an app such as Siri, Apple’s voice-powered personal assistant. Decoding human speech and working out the intent behind an instruction such as “Siri, find me some Indian restaurants nearby” requires more computing power than an iPhone has available. Instead, the phone simply records its user’s voice and forwards the information to a beefier computer in one of Apple’s data centres. Once that remote computer has figured out an appropriate response, it sends the information back to the iPhone. The same model can be applied to much more than just smartphones. Chips have already made their way into things not normally thought of as computers, from cars to medical implants to televisions and kettles, and the process is accelerating. Dubbed the “internet of things” (IoT), the idea is to embed computing into almost every conceivable object. Smart clothes will use a home network to tell a washing machine what settings to use; smart paving slabs will monitor pedestrian traffic in cities and give governments forensically detailed maps of air pollution. Once again, a glimpse of that future is visible already: engineers at firms such as Rolls-Royce can even now monitor dozens of performance indicators for individual jet engines in flight, for instance. Smart home hubs, which allow their owners to control everything from lighting to their kitchen appliances with a smartphone, have been popular among early adopters. But for the IoT to reach its full potential will require some way to make sense of the torrents of data that billions of embedded chips will throw off. The IoT chips themselves will not be up to the task: the chip embedded in a smart paving slab, for instance, will have to be as cheap as possible, and very frugal with its power: since connecting individual paving stones to the electricity network is impractical, such chips will have to scavenge energy from heat, footfalls or even ambient electromagnetic radiation. As Moore’s law runs into the sand, then, the definition of “better” will change. Besides the avenues outlined above, many other possible paths look promising. Much effort is going into improving the energy efficiency of computers, for instance. This matters for several reasons: consumers want their smartphones to have longer battery life; the IoT will require computers to be deployed in places where mains power is not available; and the sheer amount of computing going on is already consuming something like 2% of the world’s electricity generation. User interfaces are another area ripe for improvement, for today’s technology is ancient. Keyboards are a direct descendant of mechanical typewriters. The mouse was first demonstrated in 1968, as were the “graphical user interfaces”, such as Windows or iOS, which have replaced the arcane text symbols of early computers with friendly icons and windows. Cern, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory, pioneered touchscreens in the 1970s. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The computer mouse was first demonstrated in 1968. Photograph: Getty Images Siri may leave your phone and become omnipresent: artificial intelligence will (and cloud computing could) allow virtually any machine, no matter how individually feeble, to be controlled simply by talking to it. Samsung already makes a voice-controlled television. Technologies such as gesture tracking and gaze tracking, currently being pioneered for virtual-reality video games, may also prove useful. Augmented reality (AR), a close cousin of virtual reality that involves laying computer-generated information over the top of the real world, will begin to blend the virtual and the real. Google may have sent its Glass AR headset back to the drawing board, but something very like it will probably find a use one day. And the firm is working on electronic contact lenses that could perform similar functions while being much less intrusive. Moore’s law cannot go on for ever. But as it fades, it will fade in importance. It mattered a lot when your computer was confined to a box on your desk, and when computers were too slow to perform many desirable tasks. It gave a gigantic global industry a master metronome, and a future without it will see computing progress become harder, more fitful and more irregular. But progress will still happen. The computer of 2050 will be a system of tiny chips embedded in everything from your kitchen counter to your car. Most of them will have access to vast amounts of computing power delivered wirelessly, through the internet, and you will interact with them by speaking to the room. Trillions of tiny chips will be scattered through every corner of the physical environment, making a world more comprehensible and more monitored than ever before. Moore’s law may soon be over. The computing revolution is not.

Tim Brugger (timbrugger) Jan 25, 2017 at 9:23PM Investors and pundits have clearly been in NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) corner compared to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). In the past 12 months, NVIDIA shareholders have enjoyed an astounding 277% share price appreciation. After such a stellar run, it could be argued that NVIDIA stock is overvalued. On the flip side, Intel, similar to NVIDIA, is putting its efforts and resources into conquering new high-growth markets. Though Intel's stock performance pales in comparison to NVIDIA's -- as does most every stock on the planet -- its 28% gain in the past year is nothing to sneeze at. So, which is the better buy, Intel or NVIDIA? Image source: NVIDIA. The case for NVIDIA It's not difficult to see why investors have been so enamored with NVIDIA lately. One peek at its most recent earnings explains it. NVIDIA's outstanding quarter was driven by "strength across all product lines." The result was a record-breaking quarter including a 54% jump in revenue year over year to $2 billion. Gross margins of 59%, up from last year's 56.3%, were also a new NVIDIA record, along with earnings per share (EPS) that skyrocketed 104% to $0.94 excluding one-time items. As impressive as NVIDIA's top and bottom lines were, what made the quarter even better was that it was able to accomplish those results, along with develop and introduce industry-standard graphic processing units (GPUs) like its GeForce lineup, and increase operating expenses a mere 11% to $544 million. As if its third-quarter results weren't enough, NVIDIA's revenue forecast of $2.1 billion for the current quarter would be a 33% improvement over last year's $1.4 billion. And NVIDIA is increasing its capital return initiative to $1.25 billion from the expected $1 billion this fiscal year. NVIDIA is the preeminent gaming GPU provider, and has already upgraded its GeForce units to enhance the gaming experience even further. NVIDIA is also expected to launch its next-gen Voltus GPU this year to power its super computing, artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Along with self-driving cars, NVIDIA's offerings are targeting all the right markets, at the right time. Image source: Intel. The case for Intel Intel has many pundits beginning to change what had been a fairly muted tone. The concerns regarding Intel's reliance on the PC market simply don't apply. The PC market isn't "dead," just ask HP (NYSE: HPQ), which continues to gain market share and could become the world's PC leader when fourth-quarter sales results are released. CEO Brian Krzanich has Intel heading in new directions, including self-driving cars, AI, virtual reality (VR), and drones, among others. Intel is also making strides in the Internet of Things (IoT) and utilizing its new technologies ideally by targeting specific markets. The recently released Responsive Retail Platform (RRP) incorporating real-time data, 3D, and sensors for brick-and-mortar retailers is one example. Intel is taking a similar approach to its drone strategy designed specifically for commercial use, which many expect will be the driving force behind a nearly $127 billion market in 2020. But its future isn't entirely reliant on a steady PC market and budding new technologies. The shift to cloud data centers is in full force, and Intel already owns a dominant position. Don't be surprised when Intel announces another quarter of record-breaking data center revenue on Jan. 26, just as it did last quarter. Intel's data center revenue climbed 10% to $4.5 billion in the third quarter. Though it remains a small piece of Intel's total revenue, quarterly IoT sales jumped 19% year over year in to $689 million. Add in the potential of Intel's other forays and the future looks bright. Compared to NVIDIA's valuation of 40 times future earnings, Intel's modest stock price of 13 times makes it a slam dunk as the better buy, right? Not necessarily. NVIDIA, despite its incredible run and lofty valuation, is still a sound growth play given its inroads into gaming, autonomous cars, and deep learning. For the more conservative income investor who can take slow but steady growth, Intel and its 2.75% dividend yield won't keep you up at night but still offers plenty of appreciation potential.

Tim Brugger (timbrugger) Jan 25, 2017 at 9:23PM Investors and pundits have clearly been in NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) corner compared to rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). In the past 12 months, NVIDIA shareholders have enjoyed an astounding 277% share price appreciation. After such a stellar run, it could be argued that NVIDIA stock is overvalued. On the flip side, Intel, similar to NVIDIA, is putting its efforts and resources into conquering new high-growth markets. Though Intel's stock performance pales in comparison to NVIDIA's -- as does most every stock on the planet -- its 28% gain in the past year is nothing to sneeze at. So, which is the better buy, Intel or NVIDIA? Image source: NVIDIA. The case for NVIDIA It's not difficult to see why investors have been so enamored with NVIDIA lately. One peek at its most recent earnings explains it. NVIDIA's outstanding quarter was driven by "strength across all product lines." The result was a record-breaking quarter including a 54% jump in revenue year over year to $2 billion. Gross margins of 59%, up from last year's 56.3%, were also a new NVIDIA record, along with earnings per share (EPS) that skyrocketed 104% to $0.94 excluding one-time items. As impressive as NVIDIA's top and bottom lines were, what made the quarter even better was that it was able to accomplish those results, along with develop and introduce industry-standard graphic processing units (GPUs) like its GeForce lineup, and increase operating expenses a mere 11% to $544 million. As if its third-quarter results weren't enough, NVIDIA's revenue forecast of $2.1 billion for the current quarter would be a 33% improvement over last year's $1.4 billion. And NVIDIA is increasing its capital return initiative to $1.25 billion from the expected $1 billion this fiscal year. NVIDIA is the preeminent gaming GPU provider, and has already upgraded its GeForce units to enhance the gaming experience even further. NVIDIA is also expected to launch its next-gen Voltus GPU this year to power its super computing, artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Along with self-driving cars, NVIDIA's offerings are targeting all the right markets, at the right time. Image source: Intel. The case for Intel Intel has many pundits beginning to change what had been a fairly muted tone. The concerns regarding Intel's reliance on the PC market simply don't apply. The PC market isn't "dead," just ask HP (NYSE: HPQ), which continues to gain market share and could become the world's PC leader when fourth-quarter sales results are released. CEO Brian Krzanich has Intel heading in new directions, including self-driving cars, AI, virtual reality (VR), and drones, among others. Intel is also making strides in the Internet of Things (IoT) and utilizing its new technologies ideally by targeting specific markets. The recently released Responsive Retail Platform (RRP) incorporating real-time data, 3D, and sensors for brick-and-mortar retailers is one example. Intel is taking a similar approach to its drone strategy designed specifically for commercial use, which many expect will be the driving force behind a nearly $127 billion market in 2020. But its future isn't entirely reliant on a steady PC market and budding new technologies. The shift to cloud data centers is in full force, and Intel already owns a dominant position. Don't be surprised when Intel announces another quarter of record-breaking data center revenue on Jan. 26, just as it did last quarter. Intel's data center revenue climbed 10% to $4.5 billion in the third quarter. Though it remains a small piece of Intel's total revenue, quarterly IoT sales jumped 19% year over year in to $689 million. Add in the potential of Intel's other forays and the future looks bright. Compared to NVIDIA's valuation of 40 times future earnings, Intel's modest stock price of 13 times makes it a slam dunk as the better buy, right? Not necessarily. NVIDIA, despite its incredible run and lofty valuation, is still a sound growth play given its inroads into gaming, autonomous cars, and deep learning. For the more conservative income investor who can take slow but steady growth, Intel and its 2.75% dividend yield won't keep you up at night but still offers plenty of appreciation potential.

IPhone sales will be one of the main areas of focus when Apple reports its fiscal first-quarter results on Tuesday. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 27, 2017 at 4:28 pm | UPDATED: January 27, 2017 at 4:57 pm Top of the Order:   An Apple a Day: Earnings reporting season has been in full swing for a couple of weeks. And we’ve seen some of the usual suspects report mostly decent results. Among big-name Bay Area companies, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), eBay, Chevron and Intel have all given us a look at how things went during their most-recent quarters, and how they expect business to shape up over the next three months. But, there remains one company that gets as much attention as just about all the others put together: Apple. And on Tuesday, when Apple delivers its fiscal first-quarter results, it will do so during a period of auspicious anniversaries and anticipation over where the world’s most-valuable company is headed. Those anniversaries include the iPhone turning 10 years old in early January, and marking one year since Apple delivered an earnings forecast in which it foresaw iPhone sales, and overall revenue, starting to decline. Related Articles Elon Musk says his “boring” tunnel plans could start soon Why Apple wants to power ahead with making products in India Biz Break: GoPro shares go ga-ga on hopes of holiday sales gains Biz Break: IBM said to be cutting jobs amid CEO’s big hiring plans Biz Break: Trump Era begins with stock markets getting back on track Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters estimate that Apple will report a profit of $3.22 a share, on revenue of $77.4 billion, for the three months that ended in December. The company itself has estimated sales for its biggest business period of the year would be between $76 billion and $78 billion. During the year-ago period, Apple earned $3.28 a share on $75.9 billion in sales. Among all the things that Apple does, investors and consumers will likely give their attention to two items above all others: iPhone sales and Apple’s services business. The iPhone should come as no surprise. Even as those sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for a few quarters, the iPhone remains Apple’s biggest source of earnings and revenue. Michael Olson, who covers Apple for Piper Jaffray said he thinks concerns about the iPhone’s performance over the last three months, and the first quarter of this year, may be a bit overblown. “Many investors fear iPhone units may be weak in the December and March quarters due to potential iPhone 7 buyers waiting for iPhone ‘X,'” Olson said. “We believe most consumers are not aware of the potential for a more significant upgrade coming in the fall, due to the 10th anniversary of the device and will, therefore, not hold back on upgrading now.” Services, which include sales of apps, Apple Music subscriptions, revenue from Apple Pay and other items, are seen as Apple’s next big growth engine. For the last two quarters, services have been Apple’s second-largest source of revenue. And during the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter, which ended in September 2016, services was the only one of Apple’s main business lines that saw sales grow from the prior year. “We see double-digit growth persisting and expect it to contribute to 10 percent of overall revenue,” said analyst Angelo Zino, of CFRA Research. “We see a greater percentage of higher-margin services revenue acting as a tailwind to margins over time.” And on Tuesday, we’ll get a look into how well services, and the rest of Apple’s businesses, are set up for what’s to come. Middle Innings: Welcome (Back) to the Club: Remember the year 2000? A two-term president was about to leave office. We had a close, and contentious election to choose his successor. And Microsoft had a market capitalization of $500 billion. By the end of that year, all of that had passed. And Microsoft wouldn’t reach that lofty valuation again until … Friday. After a strong earnings report Thursday, investors put more muscle behind Microsoft stock on Friday. By the time the market closed, Microsoft shares had risen by 2.4 percent to end the day at $65.78. That was good enough for Microsoft to end the week with a market capitalization of $511.5 billion. Sure, Microsoft still trails the valuation of Apple ($641.2 billion) and Alphabet ($574.5 billion), but a market cap of $511.5 billion is nothing to sneeze at, especially as it shows investors have plenty of faith in the new cloud-based efforts of Chief Executive Satya Nadella. Since Nadella became Microsoft’s CEO in February 2014, the company’s valuation has climbed by almost $200 billion. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Maxim Integrated Products, Accuray, RingCentral, Abaxis and KLA-Tencor. In the Red: Decliners included Synaptics, Super Micro Computer, Proofpoint, Aviat Networks and ShoreTel. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.1 percent to end the day at 5,660.78. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down by 0.04 percent to 20,093.78. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped by 0.1 percent to finish the week at 2,294.69. Quote of the Day: “I found out changing a diaper. That was my drama. It wasn’t a good diaper either. Highlight of my day.” — Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, describing how on Thursday night he found out he had been selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game. Green will join fellow Warriors Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on the Western Conference All-Stars. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

Microsoft Corp. topped quarterly growth projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings, such as Azure, which saw revenue almost double. (Swayne B. Hall / Associated Press) By Alistair Barr and Jillian Ward Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., which all posted quarterly results Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers – the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Updated: Jan. 27, 2017, 6:18 p.m.  Tags: Alphabet, amazon.com, Azure, “cloud” computing, Google, Intel, internet, microsoft, Other Revenue, Technology Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Early Benchmarks Of The Intel Core i7 7700K On Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 27 January 2017 at 02:05 PM EST. 15 Comments For those curious how Intel's flagship Core i7 7700K "Kabylake" processor is performing under Linux, my sample arrived yesterday and I've begun putting the CPU through its paces. The Core i7 7700K has four physical cores plus Hyper Threading, 4.2GHz base frequency, 4.5GHz turbo frequency, and 8MB smart cache. This CPU has HD Graphics 630 that clock up to 1.15GHz. The Core i7 7700K retails for about $350 USD. I'll have up a proper Core i7 7700K Linux review in the days ahead compared to various other CPUs. For this comparison I am using Intel's Clear Linux distribution as the base. So far today though I do have some fresh Kabylake comparisons from Clear Linux using the Core i3 7100, Core i5 7600K, and Core i7 7700K. So while waiting on the complete results, you can check out these early numbers: Find more of these fresh Intel Kabylake Linux benchmarks via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. If you wish to compare your own system's performance to these early Core i7 7700K results, simply install the Phoronix Test Suite and run phoronix-test-suite benchmark 1701270-RI-CLEARLINU19. Given the recent Beignet 1.3 release with OpenCL 2.0 support, I'm also working on a fresh Intel HD/Iris Graphics OpenCL GPU compute comparison: More of that early data via this result file.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: ENTREPRENEUR 1 week in, Trump’s Silicon Valley buddy list is short Harrison Weber@harrisonweber January 27, 2017 10:15 AM Tags: Elon Musk, politics, Tech and Trump, Trump News hit this morning that Trump’s “Manufacturing Jobs Initiative” will feature two tech CEOs: Intel’s Brian Krzanich, who nearly hosted a Trump event during the primaries, and Tesla’s Elon Musk, who appears to be pragmatically — and, I assume, reluctantly — steering the president on issues like climate change. The list of Silicon Valley somebodies willing to work with the president now tops out around five, a rather low number, counting Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who’s on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum with Musk; Oracle CEO Safra Catz, who joined Trump’s transition team; and contrarian investor Peter Thiel, who spoke at the RNC. All this underscores a problem for Trump: Hardly anyone in Silicon Valley will work with him. Yet, in Tech Land, the list of executives willing to disparage him publicly at this point is almost as short. One exception there is Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who said yesterday that Trump’s anti-abortion policy “could have terrible consequences for women and families around the world.” Beyond Sandberg, I ask: How is an industry so hell-bent on “making the world a better place” so quickly silenced by Trump and the threat of controversy? What’s going on? Here’s one explanation, from Musk in an impromptu interview with Gizmodo.: The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better. Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication. Translation: The CEOs working with Trump all want something from him. Those who won’t collaborate probably haven’t figured out what to ask for yet. For Thiel, his $20 billion data company, Palantir, depends on government contracts. For Catz, she’s after tax reform. Musk has made clear what he wants: a carbon tax. And he wants former ExxonMobil CEO (and likely next Secretary of State) Rex Tillerson to make it happen. For the few big-company CEOs willing to collaborate with the current administration, we’ll see if this brand of pragmatism works. Without it, Trump doesn’t stand a chance of making friends in idealistic Silicon Valley. If Musk’s strategy works, the controversy may indeed hit tech companies right at the bottom line — already protesters are lashing out at Uber for Kalanick’s willingness to work with Trump, and at Twitter for its refusal to silence his stupid tweets. Peter Thiel, on the other hand, has little to worry about. If things go south, there’s always the “backup country: New Zealand.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Intel reported first-quarter profits today that were down more than 60 percent from last year. Texas Instruments also reported, and earnings at the leading maker of computer chips for mobile phones were off 17 percent from the same period a year ago. And layoffs were announced today. More jobs were eliminated at Eastman Kodak, where profits declined by 48 percent. But Topic No. 1 today on Wall Street was an unusually dire profit warning from technology giant Cisco Systems. The company that stood as a symbol of the Internet's rapid growth and stock market riches is now a symbol of its stunning decline. "From 1997 to mid-2000, it was the stock that could do no wrong and it put up quarter after quarter of ever-improving revenue growth," said Paul Sagawa, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "So when the inevitable down cycle comes, it's all the more wrenching." Locomotives That Carry Internet's Freight For a time, Cisco was the world's most valuable company. It became a titan by making the equipment that carries e-mail, video files and other data over the Internet. Its routers and switchers are essentially the locomotives that carry freight around the Internet's railways. Last year, Cisco couldn't make these routers and switchers fast enough. Now, as companies have slashed their spending on the Internet, Cisco finds itself with $2.5 billion worth of inventory it expects to become outdated before it ever can be sold. "This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated," Cisco CEO John Chambers said in a written statement. In an understatement, Cisco Vice President Ron Ricci told ABCNEWS that "the speed bumps in the investments that companies are making in the Internet are a little bit larger than we thought." Cisco's stock is down about 80 percent from its high. The San Jose, Calif., company plans to lay off 8,500 workers. Its new corporate campus outside Dallas is on hold. And the company expects sales and profits next quarter to be even worse. Investors who believed Cisco was different from other New Economy companies have lost $400 billion learning it is not. "There was a feeling if there was ever going to be a shakeout in technology, Cisco would weather the storm much better than any of the other stocks," said Jeremy Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of Finance. The good news today is that this bad news did not send the market into a tailspin. Perhaps that's because it was largely expected. 0 Shares Email Star Comments More Bad News From Cisco " Trump Orders Suspension of All Refugees, Immigrants From Some Muslim Nations " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " Vice President Mike Pence Tells March for Life: 'Life Is Winning Again in America' " Seasonal Flu Reaches Epidemic Levels in US " Trump Says He'll Let Defense Secretary 'Override' Him on Torture After New Rape Lawsuit, Baylor Says Made 'Great Progress' " Trump, Mexico's President Speak by Phone " Putin Consults His Security Council Before Talking to Trump " Mumps Outbreak Worsens in Washington State " Army Veteran, Double-Amputee Finds New Battlefield in DC " Georgia Town Leaders Apologize for 1940 Lynching " In Iowa, Trump Voters Cheer Changes, Dismiss Petty Fights " Ivanka Trump's Son Crawls for First Time in White House " Holocaust Site Spurs Questions on Young Germans' Changing Views " How Trump's Memorandum Could Boost Military Readiness " Philadelphia Mayor: Trump's Remarks an 'Insult' to Police " New Trump Agency Memo Gags Staff Communications, Democrats Say " Little Girl Befriends Baby Cow Who Lost Its Mom " NASA Opens Exhibit on 50th Anniversary of Apollo 1 Fire " FBI Offers Up to $10K Reward for Information in Murder of ABC Chicago Producer in Belize " 'Hamilton' Actors to Sing 'America the Beautiful' at Super Bowl LI " Inside Taylor Swift's $25 Million Beverly Hills Mansion " 'Bear' the Dog Hoping to Find a New Forever Home

You find a great deal on a 2-in-1 you can't easily return and discover it's a piece of junk. Or you spend a lot of money on a new laptop and, just a few weeks later, a new model makes yours obsolete. Fortunately, you don't have to waste a lot of money buying devices that are either underperforming or on their way out. Here's a list of laptops you'd be a fool to buy right now. 1 of 11 Lenovo ThinkPad T460 The ThinkPad T460 is our favorite business laptop of 2016, because of its 17+ hours of battery life, best-in-class keyboard and durable chassis. However, in February/March, Lenovo will be shipping its successor, the ThinkPad T470.  The ThinkPad T470 will have a more-powerful Intel 7th Gen "Kaby Lake" processor and it will be 0.25 pounds lighter. The new model adds a Thunderbolt 3 port you can use for charging, exchanging data with high-speed peripherals and outputting to dual 4K monitors over a single connection. There's also an optional PCIe SSD, which should double or triple app open, boot and file copy times. MORE: Which Laptop CPU is Right for You? PREVIOUS 1 of 11 NEXT 2 of 11 Apple MacBook (12-inch) Apple doesn't give advance notice of its product refreshes so we can't say for certain when it plans to refresh its 12-inch MacBook. However, the company has delivered new MacBooks (and Airs) in the spring each of the past two years.  If you've got your eye on a new MacBook, we recommend waiting for the next refresh, which we expect to come by May or June. The new model will likely have a Kaby Lake Y Series CPU, which promises better performance than the 6th Gen Core m processor in the current one. Considering the middling speeds we got out of the 2016 model, even a little bit of extra horsepower would go a long way. PREVIOUS 2 of 11 NEXT 3 of 11 Dell Chromebook 11 or 13 The Dell Chromebook 13 is one of the best laptops with Google's OS, because of its attractive, magnesium chassis, snappy keyboard and 13-hour battery life. However, the current model is extremely long in the tooth, no having had a major update in over a year.  Due out in early February, refreshed versions of the Chromebook 13 and its smaller sibling, the Chromebook 11, will feature more durable designs and faster processors. Built for education, the laptops will be available with 6th Gen Celeron or Core i3 CPUs and feature sealed keyboards that can withstand huge spills for even student tampering. If you want a 2-in-1, Dell will also be offering a Chromebook 11 2-in-1 that has a bendback display. MORE: Best Chromebooks Available Now PREVIOUS 3 of 11 NEXT 4 of 11 Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Our favorite student laptop is getting a faster, Kaby Lake processor and some new, high-end options. Due out within the next few weeks, the refreshed ThinkPad 13 will offer an optional touch screen and PCIe SSD, neither of which was available on the original. Even better, you can now get this laptop with a backlit keyboard, a feature that was conspicuously missing from the 2016 model. MORE: Best Laptops for College Students PREVIOUS 4 of 11 NEXT 5 of 11 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon The 2016 ThinkPad X1 Carbon offered the best combination of lightweight chassis and heavy-duty productivity, but its successor promises to kick it up another notch when it arrives in February. With a new Kaby Lake processor and a slightly-larger battery, the 2017 X1 Carbon should last even longer than the prior gen's strong 9-hour endurance.  Despite its higher-capacity battery, the new model is also about 0.1 pounds lighter. Even better, the X1 Carbon will have a Thunderbolt 3 port for charging, sharing data with high-speed peripherals and outputting to 4K monitors. MORE: Best Ultrabooks PREVIOUS 5 of 11 NEXT 6 of 11 Razer Blade / Blade Pro While most gaming laptops already have quad-core, Intel 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors, Razer's Blade and Blade Pro are behind the curve. Considering that performance is extremely important on expensive rigs like this, we strongly recommend waiting for these to get a CPU refresh or purchasing a competitor that already has the new chip inside.  MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops PREVIOUS 6 of 11 NEXT 7 of 11 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Surface Pro 4 sets the gold-standard for detachable 2-in-1s, but it came out all the way back in October 2015. Inside, the Surface has an Intel 6th Gen processor and it lasts just 6 hours on a charge, far less than the average ultraportable laptop.  We expect Microsoft to finally release the Surface Pro 5 sometime later this year. While the company hasn't hinted at a launch date, we expect a new model to come out sooner rather than later. There's no doubt that the Surface Pro 5 will have an Intel Kaby Lake processor, but hopefully it will also include a USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 port and longer battery life. MORE: Best 2-in-1s PREVIOUS 7 of 11 NEXT 8 of 11 HP Elitebook Folio G1 One of the lightest and thinnest business laptops of 2016, the EliteBook Folio impressed us with its snappy keyboard, great looks and colorful screen. However, the low-power laptop uses a mediocre Intel 6th Gen Core m processor that's not very speedy and provides only modest battery life.  Now that Intel has refreshed its low-power processors with 7th Gen "Kaby Lake" architecture and turned them into the Core i5 / i7 Y Series, they should provide better performance and longer endurance. HP hasn't announced plans to refresh the Folio, but we expect the company to offer an improved model in the near future. MORE: Best HP Laptops PREVIOUS 8 of 11 NEXT 9 of 11 HP Elite X2 and Other Business Laptops The EliteBook Folio G1 isn't the only HP laptop using a 2015 processor in 2017. At present, you can't buy any of the company's business-oriented EliteBooks or ProBooks with an Intel 7th Generation Core Series CPU inside. The outdated laptops include the powerful Elite X2 detachable 2-in-1 and the super-light EliteBook 1030, both of which we like a lot. However, if you can put off your purchase, we recommend waiting to see when HP starts shipping models with the newest processors on board. You're likely to own your notebook for at least three years so you should get the latest and best processor. MORE: The Best Laptops for Business and Productivity PREVIOUS 9 of 11 NEXT 10 of 11 ANY Gaming Laptop with Nvidia GTX 900 Graphics If you want to play the latest games or connect to a high-end VR system like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, you need a laptop with an Nvidia Pascal graphics chip inside. Pascal GPUs all carry model numbers that begin with 10 and include the GTX 1050, 1050TI, 1060, 1070 and 1080.  When you're laptop shopping, you will still find gaming laptops with GTX 900 series chips (ex: GTX 960), but if you do, run away screaming. Forget about the appealing sale prices. Getting outdated graphics is a bad deal at any price.

Carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile are eager to sell you tablets that have LTE service. In theory, a 4G-connected tablet could be a huge convenience as it doesn't require a Wi-Fi hotspot to get online from anywhere.  However, you'll end up paying an extra $10 per month for each slate, even as it shares the same bucket of shared data as your phone. You're better off using the hotspot feature on your handset to send Internet to  your tablet.

It is a great idea to periodically do an article like that to help customers plan their purchase. I would add the Macbook Pros, as I find Apple didn't do anything compelling to buy at that price, unless you really need one now. Let's teach them a lesson you can't sell old tech at that price. They need at least Kaby Lake if they want to charge that amount of money. Hopefully, they would offer more models without touch bar for less too, but that might not be in their best interest.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 11:43AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is preparing to launch its next generation high-end desktop (HEDT) personal computer chips and platform at the Gamescom trade show beginning on Aug. 22, per a report from the generally reliable website BenchLife.info. Intel's HEDT lineup makes up a relatively small portion of the company's overall desktop PC chip sales, but these chips tend to carry very high average selling prices and are much more lucrative per unit than the company's mainstream desktop personal computer chip lines. The report has some information about the new lineup, so let's take a closer look.  New chipset, broader line of chips Intel's previous HEDT platform, based on the X99 chipset, supported processors that the company code-named Broadwell-E. These are six-, eight-, and 10-core chips based on the company's Broadwell architecture, manufactured in the company's first-generation 14-nanometer technology. The chips list at around $434 and go all the way up to $1723. The upcoming HEDT platform, which is based on a newer chipset dubbed X299, is said to support a broader range of chips. The Broadwell-E chips will see direct successors in the form of a chip family called Skylake-X, which BenchLife says will come in six-, eight-, and 10-core variants. Image source: Intel.  The main improvements from Skylake-X, then, are expected to come from changes to the fundamental chip architecture (both the processor cores and all the "stuff" that surrounds the cores should be new) as well as to the manufacturing technology -- Skylake-X is said to be manufactured in Intel's enhanced 14-nanometer+ technology. New to this platform, though, will be a family of chips called Kaby Lake-X. These chips are believed to be the same fundamental chips as the Kaby Lake-S processors that Intel launched earlier this month for mainstream desktops, but they will be modified to fit into motherboards utilizing the X299 chipset. The integrated graphics processors on these chips are also believed to be disabled on the Kaby Lake-X chips -- a prudent move as the motherboard infrastructure required to support integrated graphics adds cost but is of minimal value to the target market (which will want to use stand-alone graphics processors).  The addition of the Kaby Lake-X parts to the lineup should allow Intel to offer a broader range of chips on the HEDT platform at potentially lower price points, which could help to boost the adoption of said platform. No "X" processors? A translation of the BenchLife report indicates that all the chips that will initially launch for the X299 platform will be designated with "K" suffixes in their model numbers, with no "X" models at launch. The current HEDT lineup on the X99 platform consists of four chips: Core i7-6800K, Core i7-6850K, Corei7-6900K, and Core i7-6950X. The six- and eight-core models are designated with "K" suffixes, while the top-end 10-core model has an "X" suffix. It doesn't make sense for Intel to completely abandon chips with the "X" suffix -- after all, the ultra-premium positioning/branding of the "X" chip probably helps to boost the perceived value of the chip. My inclination, then, is to think that Intel might be planning an even higher-end "X" part later down the line, with additional performance and/or features. Investor takeaway A new HEDT platform isn't going to be a game changer for Intel's financials or its stock price, but new products could allow the chipmaker to maintain or even slightly grow its average selling prices within this portion of its desktop PC chip shipments. Given that the personal computer market is expected to suffer unit declines for quite some time, any and all actions that Intel can take to improve its average revenue per PC with interesting new products (which can help to offset the unit declines) should be welcomed by stockholders.

(NASDAQ: INTC) reported its fourth-quarter financial results on Thursday, the reaction so far has been fairly positive. The results handily beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Analysts and investors appear to be in agreement and sent the stock higher in Friday’s session. 24/7 Wall St. has included some brief highlights from the earnings report, as well as what a few analysts are saying after the fact. The company posted $0.79 in earnings per share (EPS) and $16.37 billion in revenue, compared with consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters that called for $0.75 in EPS and revenue of $15.76 billion. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $0.76 and $14.9 billion in revenue. Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its price target to $45 from $40, implying an upside of % from Thursday’s close ($37.56). This also represents a P/E of roughly 15-times 2018 estimated earnings of $2.98 per share. The firm further detailed in its recent report: We will continue to challenge management to scrutinize investments, to drive more leverage, and to generate higher levels of free cash flow – but the narrative of “spending scared” is not fully supported by the facts. With low investor expectations, “manageable” guidance and a Feb 9 Analyst Day, we see positive risk/reward. A few other analysts recently weighed in on Intel: Merrill Lynch reiterated a Buy rating with a $42 price target. Jefferies cut its price target to $45 from $46.

But despite these concerns, a survey has found that almost half are not keeping track of what their kids are getting up to online. Now experts have revealed four tips on how to keep kids safe on the internet, without having to watch their every move. Scroll down for video  A survey has found that thousands of parents are not keeping track of what their kids are getting up to on the internet (stock image) KEEP YOUR KIDS SAFE Intel is urging parents to follow their series of tips if they are worried about what their kids might be up to on the internet. Start conversations early: If you start talking about online safety early, it will make your job that much easier when your children get older. If your kids are young, start with simple rules like: 'don't open emails from people you don't know.' You want online safety to be part of normal behaviour. Set a good example: Set a positive example by limiting your time on social networks when at home and putting your phone away during dinner and family time. Keep strangers out: Most children have been using devices from an early age, desensitising them to the potentials risks of online behavior.  A false sense of security can set in for children and they could be unknowingly interacting with a social predator or dangerous person posing as a teen. This isn't just on social media networks; it applies to common services such as Uber, Lyft and Craigslist.  Remind kids that anyone can create a profile and to decline friend requests from strangers. Take control of your home network: The home network is the hub for all of your connected devices. New solutions, such as McAfee Secure Home Platform, help you easily manage and protect devices connected to this network while providing parental controls with permissions that can be tailored to the entire household. The first involves setting a positive example by limiting your time on social networks, as well as putting phones away during dinner and family time. Parents are also encouraged to have more conversations with their children on the topic of online safety as early as possible, pointing out rules such as 'don't open emails from people you don't know'. Warning children about fake profiles on social media, and urging them to decline friend requests from strangers as a rule is also important. Taking control of your home network - by installing software which allows parents to manage devices in the home - is another good way of boosting safety. The four tips have been released after researchers at Intel Security carried out a study of 1,000 parents in the UK that made up part of the research. More than 40 per cent said they were completely unaware of their children's activity online. 'Technology has revolutionised our home lives, with many parents relying on devices to help their children with learning and entertainment' said Nick Viney, VP of Consumer at Intel Security. 'However, we need to empower parents to actively manage how their families interact with those devices, to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the potential risks. 'When the correct security and privacy measures are taken, everyone in the family will feel more protected enabling them to fully enjoy all the benefits of living in a smart home.' Other findings in the study include that 29 per cent of parents are not concerned about their children interacting with a social predator or cyber criminal online. But a third of parents said they would monitor their children's online activity if there was an easier way to do it.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Can YOU solve this McDonald's maths puzzle?

And only 28 per cent of parents keep their children's devices in their possession when their children shouldn't be using them, and allow their children to use the devices when the correct security measures are in place. The results of the survey follow a forecast by Gartner that 'there will be more than 10.5 billion 'things' in homes by 2020'. It also comes after it was revealed the EdTech market is set to reach over £200 billion ($252 billion) in investment globally by 2020.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 74 shares Most watched News videos Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats.

January is typically a time of year that’s filled with a bit of gloom. Gone are the colourful Christmas decorations, replaced by grey, drab weather and a lengthy gap between pay days. Although London, and the country as a whole, may be faced with a gloomy month of train strikes, grey skies, rain  and non-stop Brexit discussions, it has proved to be a happy month for those tech companies that are banking on cloud computing technology. That’s right, it’s financial reporting season and while overall revenues can be a mixed bag, particularly for some of the older tech giants, there is one constant note of optimism – cloud. A quick glance across the coverage of the financial results from the likes of SAP, IBM, Microsoft, Alphabet, VMware, SAS, Intel, all show a finger being pointed at cloud as either saving or boosting financials. First off you can see the old guard, companies like IBM, SAP, and SAS. IBM for example reported that IBM Cloud revenue growth went up 35% year-to-year up to $13.7bn, while its cloud as-as-service run rate was $8.6bn, up 63% year-to-year. Although it’s overall financial results point to there still being significant struggles, the silver lining is IBM Cloud. SAP reported 2016 cloud subscription and support revenue up 31% to €2.99bn and forecast its cloud business to reach €29 Billion total revenue in 2020. Then you have SAS, not strictly a cloud company, but the company posted $3.2bn in total revenue, up 4% over 2015 and driven in part by cloud. The company points to associated revenue rising nearly 9% due to a growing demand for cost-effective, convenient and secure methods for accessing SAS solutions. Microsoft reported revenue for its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure as well as Windows Server products, with revenue up 8% to $6.9bn for the second quarter. The company said Azure revenue increased 93%. Intel, while aiming at a different area of the cloud industry – chips, reported an 8% year-over-year revenue increase for the quarter bringing in $4.7bn. What this all points to is the old guard seeing success to differing standards thanks to a shifting reliance upon the cloud industry. On the new breed front you have the likes of Alphabet, with the cloud unit of Google a part of a 62% growth to $3.4bn in the fourth quarter. Giving a precise figure for Google Cloud growth is impossible due to the unit’s results being combined with various other revenue figures. Google’s main revenue source of advertising remains the dominant force, growing 17.4% to $22.4bn in the quarter, but clearly cloud is among one of its strongest growth areas. VMware meanwhile has quashed rumours of the demise of vSphere and troubles caused by the Dell acquisition of EMC by reporting an extremely successful year. Q4 for the company saw revenue of $2.03bn, up 9% year on year and the company even surpassed the $7bn mark for the year with revenue of $7.09bn, up 8% on 2015. The company spent a lot of 2016 pushing more significantly in the cloud area with its Cross-Cloud and significant partnerships with the likes of Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud bolstered its already existing support for Microsoft Azure. VMware’s cloud journey is one that predicts private cloud to remain an important factor as businesses continue to see it as an important element of their cloud strategies. So, what does this tell us? Well it tells us that the cloud continues to provide a significant opportunity for growth among tech companies that are both young and old. The success isn’t just a public cloud one, private remains a significant area of growth and that all bodes well for the likes of Intel and it providing the chips for the servers that run in the data centres. Tech companies that are looking at providing hybrid cloud options, such as IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure & VMware, will all clearly benefit from growth across all segments. Expect to see these growth figures continue to rise at a significant rate throughout the year as more and more businesses see the value of cloud and either begin to adopt it or significantly increase their reliance upon it. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the cloud market is still effectively in its infancy and has a way to go till it surpasses the traditional enterprise IT market. Gartner projected that the public cloud services market alone would total $208.6bn, while IDC predict that worldwide IT spending will surpass $2.8 trillion in 2019. There’s a lot of market for cloud to eat in to and it doesn’t look like slowing down.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jan 28, 2017 - Page 5　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Cloud lifts Microsoft, Intel, Alphabet results Bloomberg Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, which all posted quarterly results on Thursday, reinforced what has become a truism in technology: The biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to US$3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run Web sites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own Web services. More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner Inc estimated in July last year. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Mark Moerdler said. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. The company has pledged to reach annualized revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June next year. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter last year on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” This story has been viewed 1736 times.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 27, 2017 11:11am   Comments Share: Related INTC Markets Off To Sluggish Start Amid Slew Of Earnings Reports And Economic Data 8 Biggest Price Target Changes For Friday Stocks Fall As Market Seeks Direction; Microsoft, Intel Gains Boost Dow (Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) reported robust results for Q4, although the 2017 guidance was disappointing. Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore upgraded the rating on the company from Underweight to Equal Weight, while raising the price target from $35 to $38. Q4 Results Intel reported its revenue for Q4 at $16.4 billion, beating the consensus and the estimate, driven by improved performance in client computing, which more than offset the slower than anticipated growth at the datacenter segment. The non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.79, marginally ahead of consensus. Client computing grew 3 percent quarter on quarter and 4.3 percent year-on-year during Q4 to $9.1 billion. 2017 Guidance The analyst believes, however, that Intel’s guidance is based on a more realistic outlook for the datacenter segment, following the 35 percent underperformance to semiconductor group over the last two years. Although management is expected to drive growth back to 10 percent over time, the current guidance of high-single-digit growth for 2017 appears much more realistic. Moore believes the PC guidance is also achievable, “some nice cushion from y/y average selling price increases early in the year following 2016's 6 percent increase.” However, Intel’s 2017 revenue and operating income guidance was below the consensus forecasts but in line with the estimate, while the EPS guidance was in line with expectations, reflecting lower taxes and higher investment income. Free cash flow is expected to decline due to an expected increase in capital spending. At last check, shares of Intel were up 1.85 percent at $38.26.

Microsoft reported revenue of $24.1bn and profit of $5.2bn for the quarter ending 31 December 2016, an increase of 2% and 4% respectively compared with the same period a year ago. Cloud-delivered software and services made significant contributions to the reportedly better-than-expected revenue and profit growth for the quarter. The company’s intelligent cloud segment revenue grew 8% to $6.9bn, with server products and cloud services revenue up 12% and Azure revenue up 93%, while Azure compute usage more than doubled year-over-year. Although the personal computing segment fell 5% to $11.8bn, mainly due to lower phone revenue, Microsoft reported that Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue was up 5%, while the productivity and business processes segment – which includes LinkedIn – grew 10% to $7.4bn.  Microsoft said since its acquisition on 8 December 2016, LinkedIn had contributed revenue of $228m for the quarter. Further underlining the value of Microsoft’s investment in datacentres and switch to cloud-based software, the company reported Microsoft Office 365 commercial revenue growth for the quarter of 47%. Gaming revenue fell by 3% on lower Xbox console revenue, but Microsoft said Xbox software and services revenue was higher and Xbox Live’s active users for the quarter grew 15% to 55 million. “Our customers are seeing greater value and opportunity as we partner with them through their digital transformation,” said Satya Nadella, CEO at Microsoft. “Accelerating advancements in AI [artificial intelligence] across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.” Alphabet’s cloud business on ‘upswing’ At Google parent Alphabet, investors reportedly said profit for the quarter was disappointing despite an 8% increase to $5.3bn on revenue of $26bn, but overall results show that investments geared to providing cloud-based services are paying off. Although Google advertising revenue still accounts for 86% of Alphabet’s revenue, Google’s “other revenue” segment, which includes cloud computing, jumped to $3.4bn for the quarter, an increase of 62% compared with the same period a year ago. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on a conference call, with more than 3 million companies reportedly subscribing to Google’s GSuite cloud services. “We’re going to have a great year.” The growth in cloud and other areas is important for Alphabet as web and mobile ads drop in value, as shown by the 15% fall in Google’s earnings-per-click compared with the same period the year before. While Alphabet’s “other bets” are still losing money, revenue from segment increased by 75% year-over-year, climbing to $262m for the quarter. The segment posted losses of nearly $1.1bn. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company’s 22% increase in revenue for the quarter year-on-year was led by mobile search and YouTube. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets,” she said. Intel boosted by cloud Intel reported better-than-expected record revenue of $16.4bn, an increase of 10% compared with the previous year, but profit of $3.6bn, which was down 1%. Revenue was boosted by orders for processors that power datacentre servers responsible for cloud computing services. Intel’s fourth quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers increased 30% from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg. Intel said its datacentre group revenue was up 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% compared with the previous quarter to $4.7bn. “It’s [because of] moving to the public cloud and moving to those areas at a faster rate than we expected,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Although the PC market is still down, Intel’s main Client Computing Group reported revenue of $9.1bn for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared with the same period a year ago. Intel is slowly building its internet of things (IoT) group, which reported quarterly revenue of $726m, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Leading the cloud In July 2016, Gartner predicted more than $1tn in IT spending will be directly or indirectly targeted away from traditional IT delivery models and to the cloud between now and the year 2020. Share prices reflect this optimism, with Microsoft and Alphabet shares recently hitting record levels and Intel’s share price coming close to an all-time high set in October 2016, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is soon due to report earnings and Bloomberg reports that analysts expect the company’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business to report a 50% year-on-year increase in quarterly revenue to $3.6bn. Analysts said while Amazon’s cloud business is much bigger than Microsoft’s, both companies are beginning to emerge as the market leaders.

All you can do is make the cut. And the one after that and the one after that. Nobody has really claimed Oklahoma has a legitimate shot at Houston Bellaire Episcopal defensive tackle Marvin Wilson, but the Sooners are still standing. They made the top 10 in the summer. They made the final five at Under Armour week. And they’ve hit all the right notes in this final month heading into Wilson’s decision 3:30 p.m. CST on Feb. 1 on ESPN. http://www.scout.com/player/192587-marvin-wilson?s=73 Wilson, a five-star prospect ranked No. 1 at defensive tackle, is down to OU, Florida State, LSU, Ohio State and South Florida. OU wasn’t even in the picture this time last year. However, the hiring of Calvin Thibodeaux as defensive line coach proved to be a difference maker. Not only for his built-in ties to Houston, but also because of the way he has developed relationships with everybody during his first year in Norman. It started with Tulsa (Okla.) Memorial’s Isaiah Thomas and Thomas’ coaches knew things were going to be different. “The day Thibs got the job – if it was the same day, it was the next day – I talked to him and knew from the 30-minute phone call that he was different,” Memorial defensive line coach Darnell Whitaker said. “My opinion, and I don’t use this word a lot, I think Thibs is ‘big time.’” After three months of recruiting Thomas, Thibodeaux was able to get the Scout 300 prospect to commit in late May. That’s half the battle. Everybody knows in recruiting it’s great to get someone, but it’s a different story to hold onto somebody. Thibodeaux has done that and then some with Thomas. “When it came to Coach Thibs, he explained every reason why I would be a good fit,” Thomas said. “He really has a plan. This is the guy I want to play for. “Before, we were talking on a professional level. Now it’s more like a family. We’re more comfortable and can communicate about anything.” Thibodeaux has hit the ground running in the last couple of months. When you viewed OU’s highly touted SoonerSquad17 class, there were a lot of big names but something missing when it came to defensive line. Thibodeaux never threw in the towel with Wilson. Kept coming. Kept showing the interest. Kept showing the attention and respect. It wasn’t a surprise to Whitaker. “Even after Isaiah committed, Thibs never stopped recruiting and that means a lot,” Whitaker said. “When getting recruited, one thing you look for is a coach that really cares about you. Thibs really does, and it shows.” Relationships can only go so far, though. The one thing tough to acknowledge for OU was scheme. How did Wilson fit in OU’s 3-4 defensive front? The truth of the matter is he doesn’t or at least he didn’t. But if you listen to recruits in the last month, the Sooners are making the move from a 3-4 to a 4-3, which is tailormade for someone as talented and destructive as Wilson. Then it came time for the final push. OU did just that Monday evening sending six coaches. Bob Stoops, Mike Stoops, Thibodeaux, Tim Kish, Lincoln Riley and Dennis Simmons. Four of them (Mike Stoops, Thibodeaux, Riley, Simmons) wore OU No. 99 jerseys, the number Wilson would wear in Norman. Six coaches. It made an impression. “It was like nothing I have ever seen before,” Wilson told Sooners Illustrated. A source said it was the best recruiting pitch OU has ever delivered in quite some time. They were ready. They had a plan. If Wilson was wondering how OU could develop a talent like him, they had the answer. One cohesive unit with six coaches making the final stand. OU had some more help later in the week with former five-star defensive linemen Gerald McCoy and Tommie Harris both tweet to Wilson about why OU should be the choice. https://twitter.com/Geraldini93/status/823947148773486594 https://twitter.com/Tommieharris90/status/823960551655165953 The Sooners pushed all the right buttons at the right time. No guarantee OU is the name chosen next Wednesday. No guarantee that fax is coming to Norman, but Thibodeaux and the staff did everything they could. Now? It’s just a waiting game.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout OU surging at right time for Marvin Wilson Photo gallery: OU commit Tyreece Lott Sooner Intel: Isaiah Thomas Scout's Senior All-Americans For 2016 OU's persistence wins over Tyreece Lott Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Sooner Intel: Isaiah Thomas Intel returns with an update on OU commit Isaiah Thomas. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 8:17 AM Breaking News OU's persistence wins over Tyreece LottOU wouldn't take no for an answer and earned a yes from Tyreece Lott. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 8:05 AM Sooner Intel: Tre Norwood Intel returns with an update on OU commit Tre Norwood. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:15 AM Sooner Intel: OU news and nuggets Intel returns with a look at the visitors for the final weekend before signing day for OU. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:08 AM SoonerSquad17 profile: Levi Draper Eleven members of SoonerSquad17 have arrived in Norman.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 27, 2017 9:38am   Comments Share: Related INTC Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For January 27, 2017 The Market In 5 Minutes: Google And Microsoft And Intel, Oh My! Alphabet PT Cut; Microsoft, Southwest PTs Hiked; Ford Upgraded (Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) reported overall strong results for Q4, with upside being driven by the client and memory segments, although datacenter was weaker. Bernstein’s Stacy A. Rasgon maintains a Market-Perform rating on the company, while raising the price target from $33 to $36. Disappointing Guidance The analyst mentioned that the revenue and gross margin guidance for Q1 was also above the consensus expectations, although the opex guidance was also higher than expected. For 2017, the revenue guidance was roughly in line with the consensus forecast, after adjusting for McAfee. However, the opex guidance was again well ahead of consensus, with capex at a record $12 billion, “as Intel builds out for their memory ramp and 10nm.” “While 2017 guidance incorporates some caution on PCs and (for the first time) a cut to datacenter to start out the year, some investors are likely to approve of a revenue outlook that could be somewhat conservative,” Rasgon stated. FCF Declining The analyst noted, however, that both Intel's margins and datacenter results were disappointing, with opex control appearing to slip. The EPS guidance was also of “somewhat” low quality, while free cash flow has been declining due to record capex. “Additionally, it seems memory is no longer just a memory for Intel. Indeed, while we do believe revenues for the year could come in higher than guidance, memory is likely to be the major swing factor,” Rasgon went on to say. At last check, shares of Intel were up 1.78 percent at $38.23.

Microsoft rose 1.9 percent to $65.50 in premarket trading, while Intel gained 0.4 percent to $37.71 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time and giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks. All three major indexes were on track to post weekly gains. "The market has had a strong, solid rally and there's a pause to evaluate and react to the next set of data and other catalysts that could move the market," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. "Actions speak louder than words and the fact that Trump has signed numerous executive orders since his inauguration continues to heighten hopes of the proposed fiscal stimulus measures materializing," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Dow e-minis were down 11 points, or 0.05 percent, with 16,071 contracts changing hands at 8:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, with 85,805 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 17,615 contracts. Early fourth-quarter earnings have also boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 146 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 69.2 percent have topped expectations. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product increasing at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Another set of data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in December, with non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rising 0.8 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5 percent rise. Starbucks fell 4.2 percent to $56 in premarket trading after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. Google parent Alphabet was down 1 percent at $848.51 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 4.5 percent to $65.15 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates.

Corporate sector optimism has gained further support from stronger consumer confidence and moderate growth in the energy sector, while anticipations of protectionist customs tariffs, lower taxes and greater infrastructure spending from the US budget have all brightened the outlook for this year. However, the still-high corporate taxes somewhat hindered the private sector sentiment. The Q4 earnings of Alphabet Inc., the owner of Google, surpassed previous estimates due to a rapid expansion of the company's cloud-computing services and a surge in YouTube advertising. High taxation rates, on the other hand, impaired the investors' cheer. © Flickr/ Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Germany Follows US Fact-Checking Institute Sponsored by Soros on War Path Against 'Fake News'Google advertising advanced 17.4pc to $22.4 bln in 4Q16, and the expansion in Android app sales, hardware, such as Google phones, and cloud services has been buoyant and is poised to gain further momentum. Alphabet's revenue from other sources rose 62pc to $3.4 bln. Overall, Alphabet's revenue rose 23pc, by $21.2 bln year-on-year, compared to earlier market predictions of a $20.6-billion growth. Profit-per-equity, however, fell short of estimates at $9.36 compared to $9.63 expected earlier because of prohibitively high corporate taxes, at 22pc now compared to 5pc one year earlier. On Wall Street, Alphabet's stock dropped 2.2pc as lower profitability weighed on investor sentiment, stirring concern regarding excessive governmental interference and hindering the effects of an actual business expansion. "It was a good quarter revenue-wise, but margins were a little light because some of the strongest revenue growth came from licensing and other business that are less profitable," Ken Sena of Evercore ISI said. Another tech major, Microsoft, also beat earlier predictions, mainly due to the rapid expansion in its cloud services, where revenue almost doubled for certain products. Orders for hardware, such as data-center processors, also posted gains. "As long as the cloud is growing, people are happy," Mark Moerdler of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." © Flickr/ Truthout.org Microsoft Workers Sue Over PTSD Caused by Porn - LawsuitOne of Microsoft's most popular products, cloud-powered Office 365, saw a greater demand from both individual and corporate clients, with sales having increased by 47pc. About 25 mln users have purchased a subscription to Office 365 at this point. Microsoft is aiming to increase its revenues to $20 bln per year in their cloud business alone. Currently, the figure stands at $14 bln. Meanwhile, Intel saw a 30-percent annualized increase in sales of cloud server chips. However, orders from private and governmental entities dropped 7pc year-on-year. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, said. In other sectors, further gains in oil prices supported investor confidence in energy stocks, and overall, US corporate profits are poised to gain some 7pc for the fourth quarter, their largest gain in two years. "If all the economic data is good, if the earnings are good and the market doesn't really seem to think anything (President Trump) says or does is negative, I don't see any downside," Randy Frederick of Austin, TX-based Charles Schwab said. © AP Photo/ Richard Drew Wall Street Traders 'Should Have Been Jailed' For 2008 Financial CrisisThe US fourth quarter GDP report is expected early on Friday, and is likely to show a 2.2-percent expansion, typical for the weak Obama-era recovery, and insufficient to further boost the financial markets' sentiment. For this year, investors are expecting a 10-percent gain in their revenues, based off their expectations of the Trump administration's plan to invest $1 trln in infrastructure. However, as the current 10-year economic cycle draws to a close, the anticipated economic and financial market expansion might be damaged to profit-taking closer to the decade's end. "We think there is going to be a cost to this growth in the form of a downturn in 2019 — if we get the full Trump plan, there is a bigger boom in 2017 and 2018, then a bigger bust in 2019," Tim Drayson of Legal & General Investment Management said. ...

Honeywell did reaffirm its prior 2017 earnings outlook. General Dynamics — The defense contractor beat estimates by 10 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.62 per share, though revenue fell below forecasts. The company calls the quarter "solid" and notes an increase in profit margins. Comcast — The NBCUniversal parent was downgraded to "sector weight" from "overweight" at Pacific Crest, saying the current valuation fails to reflect increased competitive risk. American Airlines — The airline matched estimates, earning an adjusted 92 cents per share, while revenue beat estimates. The company also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. Ford — The automaker's stock was upgraded to "outperform" from "sector form" at RBC Capital following Thursday's earnings report and subsequent stock price drop. RBC said expectations surrounding Ford are low and that the next earnings revision is likely to be higher. Colgate-Palmolive — The consumer products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share, in line with estimates, but revenue fell below forecasts. Colgate's overall pricing came in higher, but total sales were lower compared to a year earlier. Intel — The chipmaker beat estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 79 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts as the PC market stabilized and demand increased for Intel's data center services. Starbucks — Starbucks matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 52 cents per share, but the coffee chain's revenue came in below forecasts, as did the 3 percent increase in both global and U.S. comparable store sales. Alphabet — Alphabet reported adjusted quarterly profit of $9.36 per share for its latest quarter, missing estimates of $9.64, though the Google parent's revenue did beat forecasts. Profit did increase by 8.3 percent over a year earlier, with more mobile usage, but analysts have noted that advertisers are not willing to pay as much for mobile searches as they are for their desktop equivalents. Microsoft — Microsoft came in 4 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 83 cents per share, with the software giant's revenue also beating Street forecasts. Microsoft is seeing growing demand for its newer cloud services, as it continues to shift emphasis away from the traditional software business. PayPal — PayPal earned an adjusted 42 cents per share for its latest quarter, with both the top and bottom lines matching Street forecasts. The payment service company's total payment volume did miss estimates, however. TransCanada — TransCanada submitted its permit application to the State Department for the now-revived Keystone XL pipeline project. Juniper Networks — Juniper earned an adjusted 63 cents per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates, while the networking services company's revenue also beat forecasts. However, Juniper's shares came under pressure after the company predicted lower than expected current quarter results. VMWare — VMWare beat estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.43 per share, while revenue beat forecasts as well. The cloud services company also announced a $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan. Wynn Resorts — Wynn missed estimates by 35 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 50 cents per share, although the casino operator did see revenue come in above forecasts. Investors, however, are encouraged by upbeat results at the company's Wynn Palace resort in Macau.

Revenue will be $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Thursday in a statement.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said he’s making progress in trying to generate revenue from more diverse sources such as cars and mobile phones while lessening the chipmaker’s reliance on a shrinking PC business. The results reported Thursday showed that Intel has carved out more sales in some areas, but profit is still tied to demand for processors running server computers in giant data centers. Intel reported 8 percent revenue growth to $4.67 billion in its data center unit, a slower increase than the company’s long-term target. Server sales were hurt by the shift of corporate computing to outsourcing with cloud service providers, the company said. Intel isn’t backing off its belief that it can return to double-digit percentage growth in server chips, Krzanich said, helped by increasing demand in networking and communications. “This thing will go back to double digits,” he told analysts on a conference call. He declined to predict when that might be. “This is an anomaly right now.” Shrinking PCs The company’s client computing group, which sells PC chips, gained 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion in the fourth quarter. For the year, the company is predicting that PC shipments will decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. That’s better than prior years, but worse than market forecasters are projecting. “We enter the year with a bit of a cautious view” on the total market for PCs in 2017, Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said in a phone interview. In the short term, demand for personal computers isn’t shrinking as fast as it was and Intel and other companies that depend on the market are enjoying a respite, according to Tristan Gerra, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. “PC trends have continued to surprise a little bit on the upside,” he said. December computer sales were higher than predicted and Intel’s orders from Apple Inc. for the iPhone are helping reduce its mobile division’s losses, he said. Shipments of personal computers fell 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, a narrower decline than the preceding quarter, researcher IDC said earlier this month. For the full year, shipments declined 5.7 percent -- following an 11 percent drop in 2015 when they dipped below 300 million for the first time since 2008. Intel shares were little changed in extended trading following the announcement. The stock gained 5.3 percent last year, compared with a 37 percent surge by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Fourth Quarter Fourth-quarter net income was $3.6 billion, or 73 cents a share, compared with $3.6 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to $16.4 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 79 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had predicted a profit of 75 cents a share on sales of $15.8 billion. Adjusted gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after subtracting production costs, narrowed to 63.1 percent from 64.8 percent a year earlier, Intel said. That measure of profitability will be 63 percent, plus or minus “a couple of percentage points,” in the current quarter, Intel said. Intel predicted that 2017 annual revenue will be unchanged from 2016. The forecast includes the divestiture of its Intel Security Group announced last year. Analysts had estimated a revenue increase of 4 percent for the year. The company plans to boost spending in 2017 on new plants and equipment to about $12 billion, an increase of about $2 billion from last year. The company is expanding its production of new memory chip technology. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

He reported that data centre growth was good, Cloud service provider revenue was up 24 percent, and communications service provider revenue grew 19 percent. Internet of Things revenue was also strong. Krzanich claimed that data growth would continue to skyrocket, creating demand for Intel’s processors. He said that a connected car could generate 4,000 gigabytes of data per day. He noted that the company has good design wins in connected cars with BMW, Baidu, and Delphi. In artificial intelligence, Krzanich said Intel processors are used in more than 90 percent of machine learning applications. Client computing sales, which include processors for desktops and laptops, had strong execution and higher average selling prices (up seven percent from a year ago) as customers opted for more gaming computers and high-end PCs, Krzanich said. During the quarter, Intel saw that the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy and had inventory get used during the three months, said chief financial officer Bob Swan. However, over all the figures appear to be mixed. Intel misted its target on earnings per share but beating estimates for revenues. The results were driven by revenues from desktop and laptop computer chips, data centre chips, and the Internet of Things. The latter was up 15 percent for the full year. The cocaine nose jobs of Wall Street had expected Intel to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $15.8 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, they were expected earnings per share of $2.67 on revenue of $58.9 billion. Fourth quater earnings came in at $3.6 billion, or 73 a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion. A year ago, earnings per share were 74 cents, with revenue at $14.9 billion. Next year though things might change for Chipzilla. AMD is expecting to be more competitive against Intel in 2017 as it readies its new Zen processors for PCs, laptops, and servers and Qualcomm is expecting to put more of its ARM based chips into PCs. Net income for the year was $10.3 billion, while overall revenue for the year was $59.4 billion. A year ago, net income was $11.3 billion on revenue of $55.4 billion. Intel cut about 12,000 jobs during the year as it restructured to get behind the company’s focused priorities. This includes spinning off McAfee, formerly Intel Security, as a separate business. Intel expects 2017 to be flat in terms of revenue. Krzanich said the company is taking a conservative view of 2017 PC unit sales than other analysts, but he noted there was record demand for Intel PC chips in Q4. Unit sales for 2017 could decline in the mid-single digit percentages, Krzanich said. Intel is positioning itself to lower its costs during the coming year.

Intel also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 index components, claiming the #153 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data centre group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centres, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index <.SOX>.

In the annual report for his trust, the manager said he also believes that "in the future, all companies will be internet companies", repeating the words of the late Andy Grove, CEO of semiconductor manufacturer Intel. Train (pictured) said: "This is an exciting but scary proposition. But the companies doing interesting things with digital - whether they are tech companies or far removed - are the ones making progress."

He added: "It really matters to us that visits to Hargreaves Lansdown's website are up 19% year-on-year, or that Burberry's digital customer contacts rose over 30% in the last financial year to £40m. "The point is, there is nowhere to hide. It is so important to ensure you are invested in companies where technology can be their friend." Train pointed out that in July 2000, the top five global companies by market cap bar one (General Electric) were technology businesses such as Microsoft and Intel. By July 2006, banks and oil companies joined the top five. But in July 2016 - for the first time ever - the top five consisted exclusively of tech companies: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Train: Why I have highest ever equity allocation in my investment trust The trust manager, who is also co-founder of asset management house Lindsell Train, said: "This emphasises just how important technology has become in driving economies and stock markets. In fact, we do not think much else really matters." Commenting on the outlook for global and UK equities, Train said he is "more excited" than he has ever been. "Almost every company we meet can see an opportunity for unprecedented growth or efficiency gains or both," he said. Over three years to 24 January, the trust has returned 35%, outperforming both its FTSE All-Share benchmark (19%) and its AIC UK Equity Income sector average (12.5%), according to FE. It is currently trading on a 0.3% premium.

Is Apple’s attack on Qualcomm’s licensing practices a red flag investors shouldn't ignore? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 26, 2017 at 8:52PM Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The lawsuit is related to the FTC's separate lawsuit against Qualcomm, which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out of the market. Let's take a closer look at this tangled mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their shares. Image source: Apple. Why is Apple suing Qualcomm? Back in 2008, Sprint deployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't heavily dependent on Qualcomm's patent portfolio. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard -- which it could generate more licensing fees from. At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions, Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple "rebates" for sticking with its baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things --  exclusively using Qualcomm's chips (from 2011 to 2016), and not instigating any litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially "bribed" Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to competing chipsets.   Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975 million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments -- which it's now suing to recover. The outcome is anyone's guess... The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty one, since it's dependent on many shifting variables. First, the FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement; but if it isn't, the rebates could be invalidated as "bribes" -- which may hurt both companies.  Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple needs to prove that it didn't violate the two main conditions of its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn't deny aiding the KFTC at all -- it recently told CNN that it was merely "responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies" instead of "instigating" litigation against Qualcomm. Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device's entire value, instead of just the chips in the device -- a practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don't use any of its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless technologies -- although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm's licensed patents don't actually cover those core technologies. This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past), and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of rebates. Understanding the risks to Qualcomm If Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business' margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business generates the lion's share of its profits. It could also jeopardize Qualcomm's planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which would make it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If Qualcomm doesn't close that deal this year, its top line will remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing business. But should you sell Qualcomm? Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout ratio of 53%. As a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainly disappointed with recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my shares unless the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I'll still consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with solid growth prospects in adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets.

And while parents are clearly concerned about what their kids may find online, research shows that many don't keep track of their kids' browsing habits. Security experts at Intel Security studied 13,000 people worldwide and concluded that while 79% of parents are worried about online safety, only 60% actually keep track of online behaviour. What's more, 40% of the 1,000 British parents that made up part of the research said they were totally unaware of their children's online activity. Interestingly, a third of parents (29%) said they would monitor their children’s online activity if there was an easier way to do it.

"When the correct security and privacy measures are taken, everyone in the family will feel more protected enabling them to fully enjoy all the benefits of living in a smart home.” Read More Why one in five kids are losing sleep - and how it is impacting their learning Children are now spending an average of 15 hours a week online (Photo: Peter Byrne/PA Wire) Intel has laid out a series of tips for parents to follow if they're concerned about what their kids might be doing online: Start conversations early. If you start talking about online safety early, it will make your job that much easier when your children get older. If your kids are young, start with simple rules like: “don’t open emails from people you don’t know.” You want online safety to be part of normal behavior. Set a good example. It’s easy to get caught up spending a lot of time on our devices, and kids pick up our habits – both good and bad. Set a positive example by limiting your time on social networks when at home and putting your phone away during dinner and family time. Keep strangers out. Most children have been using devices from an early age, desensitising them to the potentials risks of online behavior.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 27, 2017January 27, 2017 by Press Release Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit? Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is related to the FTC’s separate lawsuit against Qualcomm , which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out of the market. Let’s take a closer look at this tangled mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their shares. Image source: Apple. Why is Apple suing Qualcomm? Back in 2008, Sprint deployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn’t heavily dependent on Qualcomm’s patent portfolio. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard — which it could generate more licensing fees from. At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions, Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple “rebates” for sticking with its baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things — exclusively  using Qualcomm’s chips (from 2011 to 2016), and not instigating  any litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially “bribed” Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to competing chipsets. Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975 million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments — which it’s now suing to recover. The outcome is anyone’s guess… The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty one, since it’s dependent on many shifting variables. First, the FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement; but if it isn’t, the rebates could be invalidated as “bribes” — which may hurt both companies.  Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple needs to prove that it didn’t violate the two main conditions of its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn’t deny aiding the KFTC at all — it recently told CNN that it was merely “responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies” instead of “instigating” litigation against Qualcomm. Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device’s entire value, instead of just the chips in the device — a practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don’t use any of its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless technologies — although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm’s licensed patents don’t actually cover those core technologies. This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past), and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of rebates. Understanding the risks to Qualcomm If Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business’ margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business generates the lion’s share of its profits. It could also jeopardize Qualcomm’s planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If Qualcomm doesn’t close that deal this year, its top line will remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing business. But should you sell Qualcomm? Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout ratio of 53%. As a Qualcomm shareholder, I’m certainly disappointed with recent developments. But I don’t plan to sell my shares unless the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I’ll still consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with solid growth prospects in adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Short term: Prices are moving. Intermediate term: Prices are trending. Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside. By the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 36.06. The projected upper bound is: 38.67. The projected lower bound is: 36.57. The projected closing price is: 37.62. Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 5 white candles and 5 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 28 white candles and 22 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 81.7746. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 16 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 62.52. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 54 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 164.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a sell 23 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 2 period(s) ago.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. saw better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter thanks in part to a boost from PC sales during the holidays, but both companies know that help won’t last. Intel’s INTC, +1.12%  PC revenue rose 4% and beat analyst estimates by more than $500 million, thanks to record sales of its Core i7, with a better mix of higher end chips being sold. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, though, told analysts on a conference call to discuss the company’s earnings results that the chip maker has a slightly more conservative view on the PC market in 2017 than market-research firms. “As we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, we factored a little bit of caution in that as well,” Krzanich said, adding that Intel is looking for units to decline in the mid single-digit range. “That’s better than if you went back a year or so ago, we were in the high single-digits, depending on how you looked at it…So it is starting to get better, but I don’t think we’re back at a zero unit or positive unit [growth].” Microsoft MSFT, +2.35%  CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company saw growth across Windows broadly in the holiday quarter and that the consumer PC market was stabilizing, as Microsoft’s PC-focused business brought in $11.8 billion in the quarter. Nadella noted gamers increasingly “turning to Windows 10 premium PCs,” providing a boost for Microsoft’s Xbox Live service for online gaming despite a drop in Xbox console revenue during a typically strong holiday quarter for that business. Both CEOs enjoyed after-hours boosts to their stock prices thanks to holiday PC sales, but they pointed elsewhere for optimism for the future: the cloud. For Microsoft’s part, it is placing more emphasis on Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, -0.40%  Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division, which saw revenue jump 93% year-over-year. The software giant’s cloud-based versions of its Office productivity suite, Office 365, saw revenue grow 49%, while the PC business shrunk 5%. Intel didn’t show that same level of growth from its cloud business, which sells chips to data centers that power remote computing and has recently disappointed investors. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue grew 8%, and Intel’s outlook calls again for “high single digit growth,” but it is worth noting that Intel is in the midst of launching a new server platform called Purley that could boost results later in the year. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. “Data center got back on track and while it wasn’t double-digit growth, many customers are waiting for the latest Purley server chips to their big upgrades, so I think there’s pent-up demand,” Patrick Moorehead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, said in an email. Intel and Microsoft are fortunate that PC sales rebounded a bit in the fourth quarter to help their results, but the promise of bigger cloud revenues in 2017 need to come true if these companies want to keep pleasing investors.

Thursday (Jan. 26) reported fourth quarter 2016 revenue and profit that beat analysts’ expectations on sales growth in computing, data center chips and Internet of Things (IoT) chips. The company also delivered a forecast for the first quarter that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and announced it would increase its capital spending outlay for 2017. Despite its surprising success with PC processors in the fourth quarter, Intel also tempered its upbeat first quarter forecast with caution. The company said it has a more cautious view of PC consumption trends than third-party market watchers, especially in emerging markets like Russia, China and Latin America. While Intel said it expects high single digit growth in sales to data centers, it is not expecting a sales uptick in the enterprise server or microprocessor segment Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, said in a conference call with analysts following the company’s quarterly report that Intel has a slightly more pessimistic view for the PC market than many industry observers. He said Intel expects PC unit shipments to decline by a mid-single digit percentage in the first quarter following a strong fourth quarter in which the company enjoyed strong sales for its core i7 microprocessors. Brian Krzanich, Intel “It’s starting to get better,” Krzanich said of the PC market. “But I don’t think we are back into zero unit or positive unit growth.” Some analysts have said the PC market is starting to show signs of stabilizing after five consecutive years of annual declines. Intel has historically relied on the PC market as its primary engine of growth. As the PC market has declined in recent years, Intel has sought to diversify outside of its core business with mixed results. On the earnings call, Krzanich frequently referred to Intel as a company in transition and highlighted growth and opportunities in IoT, networking, autonomous driving and others. Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.) reported sales of $16.4 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. The company reported a net income for the quarter of $3.9 billion, up 4 percent from the same period of 2015. Intel reported year-over-year quarterly sales growth across its Client Computing Group, Data Center, IoT, Non-Volatile Memory and Security groups. Intel’s Client Computing Group, the company’s largest business unit which products for PCs, servers and mobile devices, had sales of $9.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Intel reported record sales of $59.4 billion for 2016, an increase of 7 percent from 2016. The company reported a net income of $10.3 billion based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), down 10% from 2015. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel said it expects sales of between $14.3 billion and $15.3 billion. The company expects 2017 sales to be roughly flat with 2016, and said it expects to allocate between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion for capital spending during the year, up from $9.5 billion last year. —Dylan McGrath covers the semiconductor industry and business news for EE Times.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 27 January 2017 | MYT 8:23 AM Data center growth drives Intel Q4 revenue NEW YORK: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News You May Be Interested Azman’s journey with AMMB Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018 US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Clubside clinch KLHA League title after beating DBKL in entertaining final Ponkan oranges choice of the season A road trapped in time Property Related advertisement Latest News Shell set to sell US$3b North Sea assets to Chrysaor Resurgent Tesco surprises with US$4.6b swoop for wholesaler Booker US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Most Viewed in Business Making money from money Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap Giving banks a run for their money What Dow hitting 20,000 points means to Malaysia Unlocking value in MMC Shell set to sell US$3b North Sea assets to Chrysaor Azman’s journey with AMMB Resurgent Tesco surprises with US$4.6b swoop for wholesaler Booker How to make smart investment choice US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Credit: Raspberry Pi More like this Apple collaborates with rivals to advance A.I. research Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Intel chases A.I. with new chips, but still lacks a potent GPU Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Google wants to bring smarts to cool gadgets and devices made using Raspberry Pi 3 or Intel's Edison. The company is chasing makers with open-source tools needed to add artificial intelligence to consumer, industrial, and retail devices made using board computers. The plan may include machine-learning tools, which are central to A.I. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions with the help of A.I., and the technology also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely. "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year," a Google spokesman said in an email. Earlier this week, Google published a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing "smart tools" to makers. In a blog entry, Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Devices could incorporate Google A.I. technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets. Google's voice recognition is the company's most visible A.I. technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3. Providing a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs. The spread of Google's A.I. tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets. Companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud. Samsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and A.I. technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers. It's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends. But boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful A.I. and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle. Some companies like Movidius -- which is part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones. Google is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS. The company hasn't talked about A.I. technologies available in Android Things.

Intel, the world's largest computer processor-maker and a foundational hardware provider for all of IT, was founded on July 18, 1968. In none of the subsequent 49 years has the chipmaker been more successful businesswise than 2016. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based corporation reported Q4 and full-year 2016 revenue on Jan. 26, and there were new records to be entered into the books. The company reported an all-time-high yearly revenue of $59.4 billion and record quarterly revenue of $16.4 billion, up 10 percent from $14.9 billion a year ago. Profitwise, Intel said it earned $10.3 billion in FY 2016 and $3.6 billion, or 73 cents a share, in the quarter—flat from the year-ago total. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on sales of $15.75 billion, so Intel easily beat the estimate. Intel said revenue from its client computing group rose 4 percent to $9.1 billion, whereas the FactSet analysts had forecast $8.6 billion. 'Terrific Finish to a Transformative Year' "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel. In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities," CEO Brian Krzanich said in the report statement. "I’m pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future." Full-year 2016 business unit trends were noted by the company as follows: --Client Computing Group revenue of $32.9 billion, up 2 percent from 2015 --Data Center Group revenue of $17.2 billion, up 8 percent from 2015 --Internet of Things Group revenue of $2.6 billion, up 15 percent from 2015 --Non-Volatile Memory Solution Group revenue of $2.6 billion, down 1 percent from 2015 --Intel Security Group revenue of $2.2 billion, up 9 percent from 2015 --Programmable Solutions Group revenue of $1.7 billion Premium PC Sales Lead the Way "Intel had a pretty good quarter. Client-computing revenue has not only flattened but actually saw some slight increases, even though units declined," Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights told eWEEK. "I attribute this to customers embracing more premium PCs driven by commercial upgrades, gaming and VR. "Datacenter got back on track, and while it wasn’t double-digit growth, many customers are waiting for the latest Purley server chips to their big upgrades, so I think there's pent-up demand. Memory hit a home run, driven by 3D NAND. "It was a good end to solid 2016 where I saw Intel making big moves and investments for the next five years."

MATIAS J. OCNER For the Miami Herald 1 of 4 i By Fred Grimm fgrimm@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Silicon Valley, with its insatiable need for highly skilled foreign labor, especially from India, has nothing on us. South Florida is downright desperate for the imported expertise of Masi Sadaiyan and Vadivel Gopal. Google, Apple, Oracle, Intel — all have begged the feds to relax limits on how many software engineers with advanced degrees and “specialty skills” they can import from the Europe and Asia, especially the Indian subcontinent. American techies, of course, rail against the contention that Asian engineers outperform homegrown workers. They argue that tech firms are just employing a clever variation of outsourcing. That these foreigners are stealing American jobs. Forget that stuff. That argument hardly applies to the special kind of Indian expertise imported by the University of Florida and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Sadaiyan and Gopal can do what we can’t. Which is maybe save South Florida from an economic catastrophe. The two visiting emissaries from southeast India’s famed Irula Snake-Catchers’ Cooperative can track pythons. Understand, I’m not referring to the hunting techniques employed by our homegrown snake wranglers, who occasionally surprise a python sunning itself on an Everglades hammock. Sadaiyan and Gopal track snakes through the underbrush. These guys, like generations of Irula tribesmen before them, can figure out the whereabouts of cobras, vipers and kraits in their homeland. In South Florida, they can search out Burmese pythons, the discarded castaways of the pet trade that are propagating like crazy in the Everglades, annihilating native mammals and wading birds. Who knows what’s next on their menu? Pets? Small children? County commissioners? The two Irula tribesmen can track pythons to their very lair, using skills developed generations ago. The Irula became snake catchers in the reptile-infested Tamil Nadu state (known as Madras during the British colonial days). They were so damn efficient, capturing snakes and selling the snakeskins, that the region’s serpents were nearly wiped out (allowing the rat population to surge). In 1972, the Indian government outlawed the snakeskin trade. The Irula adjusted, catching cobras, vipers and the wildly dangerous kraits and milking them for poison to sell to drug companies for use in anti-venom medicine, then setting the snakes free. It’s a crucial industry in a country where venomous snakes kill 46,000 people a year, according to the Daily Mail India edition. Two snake hunters for $68,888 sounds like a better deal than paying Pitbull a million bucks. The Herald’s Jenny Staletovich (who usually stalks snakes of the political kind) reported that the FWC has allocated $68,888 for the two-month project, covering the costs for two snake hunters along with a pair of Tamil-language translators. Which sounds like a better deal compared to the million bucks Visit Florida paid Pitbull to promote Florida tourism with a music video and on social media. Let Pitbull wrestle a 16-foot python out of an abandoned vine-choked missile silo, then we’ll be getting a bang for the taxpayer’s buck. (And the makings of a hell of a music video.) Indian writer and filmmaker Janaki Lenin was with a party of wildlife biologists accompanying Sadaiyan and Gopal last week when the snake catchers descended into an old Nike missile silo in the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Key Largo. “With a machete, Masi cut the strangler fig roots that blocked the entrance,” she wrote for FirstPost.com, an Indian online publication. Lenin wrote that pythons were rarely seen in the refuge. None had been captured in the traps set around the area. No one but the Irula hunters had any notion that they’d find a snake that afternoon. Then, she wrote, Masi shouted, “Malappambu,” Tamil for python, from inside the bunker. Make that pythons. They found two males and a 16-foot female. University of Florida biologist Frank J. Mazzotti told me via email Thursday that the snake hunters had snagged 15 pythons in their first two weeks. Most of those, he judged, would have gone undetected without the tracking skills of the Irula. Staletovich noted that last year 1,000 local hunters, participating in the state-sponsored monthlong Python Challenge, found only 106 snakes. Mazzotti said “our best hope” in the struggle to contain the python outbreak would be to set up an “early detection and rapid response” system. Maybe we ought to import a few more Irula rapid responders. The python infestation has seemed hopeless. But maybe not. The International Union for Conservation of Nature now lists the Burmese python as “critically endangered” through large swaths of its natural habitat in southeast Asia, mostly due to the skin trade. And python leather is currently fetching premium prices. The Guardian reported Wednesday that Paris-based Kering — owner of high-fashion brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen — was building its own python farm in Thailand. No wonder. Gucci python boots are going for $3,500. A Fendi python jacket costs $11,500. So: Parisian fashions and Irula snake catchers. Maybe we’ve found the magic combination that can save the Everglades.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo By Aishwarya Venugopal Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

With a $30 billion factory How does China respond to US chip threats? With a $30 billion factory Tsinghua Unigroup is investing $30 billion in a factory that will make DRAM and flash storage, striking at the heart of a chip battle between the US and China Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 21 January, 2017 07:30 - - - - print email Comments For China, actions speak louder than words, especially in the escalating chip battle with the U.S., which has been hurling out verbal threats in recent months. The Chinese chip infrastructure is getting a serious boost from Tsinghua Unigroup, which is investing US$30 billion in a new foundry to make chips. The state-owned Tsinghua Holdings is a majority shareholder in Tsinghua Unigroup. This news comes just two weeks after U.S. accused China of rigging the chip market and artificially reducing the prices of semiconductors. The tough talk came from the administration of former President Barack Obama but will continue under Donald Trump, who was sworn in as president Friday. The factory in Nanjing will primarily make 3D NAND flash and DRAM chips to bulk up the country's semiconductor and storage markets. The first stage of investment will be $10 billion and produce 100,000 chips per month. The manufacturing facilities will stretch over 1,500 acres, or 2.34 square miles. Beyond the investment in the chip factory, Tsinghua Unigroup will also invest about $4.3 billion to build a complimentary IC (integrated circuit) international city that will include a science technology park, a school, commercial facilities, and apartments. China has a poor chip-manufacturing infrastructure, and this investment should fill a hole in the country's long-term effort to be self-reliant with technology products. Companies like Intel, Samsung, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) and GlobalFoundries, which invest billions in fabs, will feel the pinch. Intel and GlobalFoundries operate factories in the U.S., and those companies also spend billions to upgrade manufacturing facilities. But the U.S. will certainly take notice. Earlier this month, a White House working group said China was not playing fair in the semiconductor market, by artificially reducing the prices of chips through government assistance. The working group, called the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology or PCAST, recommended the U.S. respond to the Chinese chip threat by investing more in innovation and education and creating new types of quantum and neuromorphic computers. The U.S. and China have conflicting technology agendas. China has made it difficult for U.S. technology companies to do business in the country. Most hardware companies have turned to partnerships or joint ventures to operate, with the Chinese government having some level of ownership. Security and intellectual property theft have also been major U.S. concerns. The U.S. has been placing more emphasis on China's semiconductor market in recent months. China today hosts the world's fastest supercomputer called TaihuLight. Fast supercomputers are used in weapons development, economic forecasts, and scientific research, making them central to a country's security and economic strategies. The U.S. in the past has banned the export of supercomputing chips to China, citing concerns that it could be against U.S. national interests. In 2014, China said it would invest $150 billion to subsidize chip development over a 10-year period. That's partly because China wants 70 percent of devices in the country to use homegrown chips by 2025. That investment helped spur the development of low-cost semiconductors, which are also shipping outside China. But the U.S. charges that Chinese semiconductors are inferior and have affected the quality of devices. The flood of Chinese chips has slowed down demand for chips and hurt the bottom line of U.S. companies, giving them less money to spend on the research and development of new chip technologies. Products like the iPhone and iPad are assembled in Chinese factories, helping to keep down the price of those devices. The cheap Chinese chips have also reduced the cost related to building electronics, appliances, and cars. U.S. companies are also moving factories to China, which offers a cheaper way to make chips. Intel is making its memory chips at a factory in Dalian, China.

First, came its Compute Sticks and then its credit-card-shaped Compute Cards. But nothing's quite like the mysterious Euclid, which is a self-contained computer the size of a thumb designed to be the brains and eyes of a robot. More details have emerged about the computer, which was announced in August and has yet to be released. The Euclid is so small and light that's possible to hold like a pen. It has a built-in 3D RealSense camera, making it like a PC fused into a Microsoft Kinect. [Related: The best Japan Robot, gadget and car expo gallery] The design makes it possible to install the Euclid where the eyes of a human-like robot would be typically placed. The 3D RealSense camera will act as the eyes of a robot, capturing images in real-time and helping with movement. Euclid has motion and position sensors that can help the robot move around both indoors and outdoors. Intel announced and demonstrated the Euclid computer in a robot moving on stage during CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote at the Intel Developer Forum in August. The Euclid Developer Kit launch page is up on the website of Mouser Electronics. Intel didn't provide a specific launch date or pricing. Once the Euclid is placed in a robot, it can be operated remotely through a mobile device or PC. The Euclid has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity to communicate with the PC. The Euclid can also "serve as a full, autonomous brain with sensing capabilities, or as a smart sensor controlled by a more powerful computer," Mouser states on its website. The computer has GPS capabilities for navigation. The Euclid presentation about RealSense technologies last year at the Roscon robotics conference. The Atom CPU provides the horsepower to process and analyze the images collected by the 3D camera. The CPU will drive a robot's movement and help it complete tasks. The ZR300 is a 1080p camera bundled with an infrared camera and an infrared laser projector. The combined features will help robots get a better sense of depth and motion, which will aid in movement. The device operates on a battery and has environmental sensors on the back. One sensor is a barometric pressure sensor. Additionally, it has a microphone and speakers, and HDMI and USB 3.0 slots. Euclid supports Linux-based Ubuntu OS and Robotics Operating System (ROS), which typically sits on top of an OS. It will also support Arduino, a software package commonly used by developers to create basic electronics.

But which one is better? In the recent past, we have seen a new breed of laptops dominating the market. Known as convertible or hybrid laptops, they give us the convenience of a tablet with rotating touchscreen and performance of a classic laptop.   Asus and Dell are one of those few manufacturers that are trying hard to capture this market with their own alliteration of convertibles. Asus has come up with a new hybrid laptop known as ZenBook Flip UX360CA which is now priced at Rs 57,479 and Dell has Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 for Rs 52,990. Both the laptops have a lot to offers and come with some interesting specs sheet. But which one is better? Let's try and analysis it.   Design   Starting with the Asus ZenBook Flip, the laptop comes with a sleek design. The company has added a ‘spun-metal finish’ with the “Zen-inspired pattern of concentric circles” design on the cover. The laptop measures 32.3 (width) x 22.0 (depth) x 1.39 ~1.39mm (height) and is lightweight with 1.3 kg.   On the other hand, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 comes in a hue that Dell calls "theoretical grey." The laptop is a bit thicker as compared to the ZenBook Flip with 325 x 224 x 20.4mm measurement and heavier with weighing 1.62kg. Both the laptops come with a 360-degree rotatable screen, but if you ask us, we will opt for Asus ZenBook Flip as it comes with better design language, is sleek and lighter than Dell’s 2-in-1 making it easier to carry around.   Display   On the display front, the Asus ZenBook Flip sports a 13.3 LED-backlit FHD display with a screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels coupled with 72 percent NTSC colour. On the other hand, Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 comes with 13.3-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) Truelife LED-Backlit display. As both the laptops come with an almost similar display, we call this round a tie.   Hardware and Software   The heart of any laptop lies in its hardware. Keeping that in mind both the laptops are specced pretty decently. Starting with the Asus ZenBook Flip, the laptop comes with 6th-generation Intel core m7 6Y30 Processor (4M Cache, up to 2.2 GHz) with Integrated Intel HD Graphics 515. The laptop is backed by a 4 GB RAM and 512GB GB SSD storage options. The laptop comes with chiclet keyboard which the company’s claims a travel of 1.5mm and is equipped with Bang and Olufsen speakers.   On the other hand, the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 is equipped with 6th Generation Intel Core i3-6100U Processor (3M Cache, up to 2.30 GHz) along with Intel HD Graphics 520. The laptop packs a 4GB of RAM and 1TB of storage option. The laptop comes with a backlit keyboard and there are two brightness levels as well as the option to turn it off completely. The device also comes with dual tuned speakers powered by Waves MaxxAudio Pro.   Both the laptops run on the latest Windows 10 Home and houses an HD camera and 3.5mm audio jack. Looking at the sheer specs sheet, Dell Inspiron 13 emerges as a clear winner as it comes with some advanced specs, more storage option and a better keyboard as compared to the Asus ZenBook Flip.   Battery and Connectivity   On the battery front, the Asus ZenBook Flip is backed by 3 Cells 54 Whrs Polymer battery, and Asus is promising 12 hours of usage time on a single charge. The laptop support connectivity ports like one USB 3.1 Type C port, USB-C Gen 1 port, one micro HDMI port, one SD card reader and one AC adapter plug. The laptop also offers Wi-Fi 802.11 AC and Bluetooth v4.1.   The Dell Inspiron is backed by a 42WHr, 3-Cell battery and offers connectivity ports including one HDMI v1.4a port, 2 USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, micro SD card reader. The device supports connectivity options like Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0. Judging by the battery power and connectivity options, Asus ZenBook Flip is the winner of this round.   Conclusion   Wrapping up, both the laptops come with some decent specifications. The Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 scores high in hardware department as it comes with a better processor, more storage option and not to forget a backlit keyboard, while the Asus ZenBook Flip comes with a sleek design and offers better battery backup and connectivity options. At the end it all boils down to the consumer preference, as those who are looking for a sleek device with better battery life will opt for Asus ZenBook Flip, while those looking better internals should go with the Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 laptop.

The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} January 26, 2017 11:57am   Comments Share: Earnings from three blue-chip stocks covering the technology and oil services sectors may offer another snapshot of a global economy that appears to be mostly in recovery mode. Tech giants Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday, while the oil patch’s Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) opens the books Friday ahead of the bell. The common thread among the three is “a look to the future.” INTC and MSFT, which have been a mainstay inside personal computers for decades, now seem to be eyeing life beyond microprocessors, operating systems and software, though these core products still make up a significant portion of the firms’ revenue. CVX, meanwhile, survived last year’s dive in oil prices and, like the rest of the oil sector, picked itself up, brushed itself off, and looked ahead.     Microsoft, AI and Azure Widely-held MSFT is slated to report its fiscal year Q2 results after the close Thursday. Its Q1 results blew past Wall Street’s expectations and prompted some analysts to call MSFT the “comeback kid,” as it transitions from a PC software mainstay into a commercial cloud-based services business and further develops its artificial intelligence technology. “As computing becomes more ubiquitous, converting data into ambient intelligence that can fuel digital transformation is at the very core of our innovation agenda,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the company’s annual meeting in November. “In fact, AI is already working on your behalf to predict and automate tasks in many of the products you use today,” he added, pointing to handwriting recognition in Windows 10, the Windows Hello facial-recognition feature, voice recognition of Cortana, language translation in Skype, and the input recognition and the Swiftkey keyboard on iOS or Android devices. Its fastest-growing product is reported to be Azure, what MSFT calls a “growing collection of integrated cloud services—analytics, computing, database, mobile, networking, storage, and web.” Azure revenue has grown in triple digits over the last seven quarters, Nadella said, to help the commercial cloud division’s annualized revenue rate exceed $13 billion. “We remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal ’18,” he added. MSFT also completed its purchase of LinkedIn in December and named Kevin Scott to the newly created role of chief technology officer. This expands what his role was at LinkedIn, and it is aimed at driving strategic initiatives across the company. The Q4 consensus earnings estimate from third-party Wall Street analysts is $0.79 a share, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. Revenue is projected to dip slightly to $25.21 billion from $25.69 billion last year. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 3.8% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Calls have been active at the weekly 64 and 65 strikes while puts have seen activity at the 62.5 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 40th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. INTC and the Internet of Things INTC, the world’s largest maker of computer chips, posted record revenue and strong year-over-year growth in Q3, thanks in part to personal-best revenues out of its data center and Internet of Things (IofT) groups. Might that happen again? Last quarter’s rise in revenue in the data center group appeared to be helped by stronger numbers in its cloud-computing solutions group, according to INTC, while some analysts noted that the IofT revenue was boosted by sales of embedded video, retail and transportation products. Some analysts expect more of the same in Q4. Also, INTC announced last summer that it was coming out with a headset called Project Alloy to offer a “merged reality” experience without the fussy cords and hardware. Some analysts admit they don’t know what that term means, and will be looking for more information on it. Third-party Wall Street analysts have a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $0.76, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim® platform. Wall Street analysts have revenues pegged at $15.76 billion, on par with what the company forecast during its Q3 release. Last year, INTC posted Q4 revenue of $14.46 billion. INTC has outpaced Wall Street’s expectations in nine of the last 10 quarters. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of just over 3% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform. Options trading has been concentrated around its current share price, with call activity at the 38 strike and puts active at the 37 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 29th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) CVX and Wading Through the Oil Patch It’s been a rough road for oil producers and refineries as they’ve juggled the mostly low crude oil prices amid a global surplus. But the recent pact by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 11 non-OPEC countries, including Russia, which recently agreed to curtail oil production, might have pumped new life into the oil patch worldwide. CVX solidly outpaced Wall Street’s earnings expectations in Q3 as its domestic and international downstream divisions, coupled with its international upstream unit, helped offset a loss in domestic upstream operations. (Downstream operations are those closest to the end user of crude oil products; upstream operations drill wells and locate raw materials.) The results also were a welcome relief from the prior two quarters, according to the company. “Third quarter results, though down from a year ago, reflect an improvement from the first two quarters of this year,” Chief Executive John Watson said in the earnings release. “Our operational performance in the third quarter was strong. Our refineries continued to run well.” Some analysts expect to see more of that, as well as improvement in exploration and production, when results are reported ahead of the bell Friday. The consensus earnings estimate from third-party Wall Street analysts is $0.63, according to the Earnings Analysis tab on the thinkorswim platform. Revenue is projected at $32.8 billion, up from $29.25 billion last year. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 1.7% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim platform. Call activity has been higher at the 118 strike, while put activity has been focused at the 114 strike. The implied volatility is at the 14th percentile.

(GeekWire Photo / Dan Richman) It’s not unusual for internet and software giants to design and even make their own hardware, to increase efficiency and build a competitive advantage. Google custom-designs its own servers, filling them with millions of chips from Intel, and announced in May that it has designed its own application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for use on neural networks. Facebook uses its own switches in its data centers. But market-leading public-cloud company Amazon Web Services may have gone farthest down this path — designing not only its own routers, chips, storage servers and compute servers but also its own high-speed network. “We’ve got, in the same company . . . digital designers working on (chipsets), hardware designers working on NICs (network interface cards), and software developers,” said James Hamilton, an AWS VP and Distinguished Engineer, during a keynote at the AWS re:Invent conference in November. “When you own the horizontal and vertical, we get to move at the pace we’re used to, we get the make changes at the pace we’re used to, we get to respond to customer requirements at the pace we’re used to. We think this is a really big deal.” During a 1.5-hour geekfest, replete with close-up photos of servers, racks and cables, Hamilton posited that the networking world is going the way of the mainframe, getting “chopped up into vertical stacks” with different companies innovating and competing on those stacks. That’s helping make networking gear a commodity, he said — one that AWS can save money on by building its own. (Via Amazon video) “We run our own custom-made routers, made to our specifications, and we have our own protocol-development team,” Hamilton said. “It was cost that caused us to head down our own path, and though there’s a big cost (improvement) . . .  the biggest gain is in reliability.” This custom-made gear “has one requirement, from us, and we show judgment and keep it simple. As fun as it would be to have a lot of tricky features, we just don’t do it, because we want it to be reliable.” If AWS were using standard commercial routers and a problem arose, “the most committed, most serious company would take six months” to resolve the issues, he said. “It’s a terrible place to be. So we love where we are right now.” AWS has standardized on 25-gigabit Ethernet (25 GbE) as a fiber networking transfer speed, even though “that looks like a crazy decision,” Hamilton said. “I was heavily involved in this decision, so I’ll defend it.” The industry standards, he noted, are 10 GbE and 40 GbE, with 10 GbE representing a single optical wave and 40 GbE representing four waves but at almost four times the optics cost, he said. “Well, 25 gigs is almost the same price as 10 gigs, which means we can run 50 gigs at much less cost (than 40 gigs). From an optics standpoint, it’s absolutely the right answer. . . . I believe this is where the industry will end up.” Hamilton displays a custom-made ASIC. (Via Amazon video) AWS routers run a customized Broadcom Tomahawk ASIC with 7 billion transistors and 128 ports of 25 GbE, for a total flow-through of 3.2 terabits (Tbit). “These are absolute monsters,” Hamilton said, holding one aloft. Similar chips with 6 Tbit and 13 Tbit capacity are coming, at around the same price, he said. Another key piece of AWS’s networking strategy is software-defined networking — the ability of network administrators to change and managed network behavior through interfaces. Part of that is moving processes from software into hardware to the extent possible. “Sometime about 2011 we made an obvious but important observation: whenever you have a workload that’s very repetitive . . .  you’re better of taking some of that down into hardware,” he said. “People say, ‘Hey, the reason (AWS) had to go to customer networking gear is you could never have the bandwidth we have in our data centers if you didn’t,’ Hamilton related. “That’s not true. I could give you any bandwidth you want . . . with anyone’s equipment. It’s absolutely not hard to do. . . . You know what is hard to do? Latency. That is physics. . . . I tell software people, the things you’re measuring are milliseconds (one thousandth of a second). In hardware, they measure nanoseconds (one billionth of a second) and microseconds (one millionth of a second). So this is the right place for us to go.” (Via Amazon video.) AWS also produces its own customized chipsets, emblazoned with the name “Annapurnalabs,” for use in “every server we deploy,” Hamilton said. Amazon bought Israeli chipmaker Annapnurna last January for a reported $350 million. This was the first time AWS has made clear it’s using chips from the company. “Do you believe we’re in the semiconductor business?” Hamilton exclaimed. “Not only are we building hardware, but we built this,” he said, showing off the chipset. “This is a very big deal. If I’m right on those trends I told you about in hardware implementation (and) latency — and I’m fairly confident on that one — that means we get to implement it in silicon.” AWS uses power-switching gear with custom firmware for its data centers, ensuring that if faults occur outside the center, the facility continues to operate, and if they occur inside, the load is not dropped. That, Hamilton said, avoids problems like the airline that lost $100 million when switching gear locked out reserve generators, and a 34-minute gap in 2013 Super Bowl coverage that occurred for the same reason. AWS’s more recent custom storage servers hold 11 petabytes (one million GB) of data on 1,100 disks contained in a single standard-size 42U rack, up from the 8.8 PB in the 880-disk model that Hamilton showed. He said company policy prohibited showing the latest model. A custom AWS compute server. (Via AWS) The company’s custom compute servers, each occupying one slot on a rack, are sparsely populated, Hamilton conceded. “Turns out this is implemented for thermal and power efficiency. . . . What the OEMs are selling to customers are probably three, four, five times more dense than this, and they’re less efficient. But they make up for it in cost.” The AWS compute servers’ power supplies and voltage regulators operate at greater than 90 percent efficiency. And because AWS spends hundreds of millions of dollars on electricity, “if this power supply is 1 percent better, that gets to be a pretty interesting number.” AWS’s data centers, in 16 regions worldwide, are linked by a 100-Gb private network controlled exclusively by AWS, with no interconnection sites administered by other companies. “It’s many, many parallel 100-Gb links. There’s no way a single link will ever have any on impact on anyone in this room, because we have the capacity to survive a link failure. We engineer it that way. We’d be crazy not to.” (Via AWS) “Every link is 100 gigs, absolutely everywhere,” Hamilton said. “This is a pretty important asset. When we started this, I was a little concerned, because it’s really, really, really expensive. The networking team is 100 percent committed that this is the right thing to do.” AWS uses short- and long-term leases, dark fiber lit under contract, and “in several cases we’re laying our own cable,” he said. “We’ll do whatever’s most cost-effective to get the resources we need.” Amazon is an investor in the Hawaiki Submarine Cable, a 14,000-kilometer cable linking Australia, Hawaii, New Zealand and Oregon. (Via AWS) Hamilton provided details, too, on Amazon’s data centers, which are usually surrounded by secrecy. It’s already known that each “availability zone” within a region contains at least one data center, but Hamilton added that most new data centers consume between 25 and 32 megawatts (MW) of power. That’s a fairly modest size: the most power-hungry data center in the world, China Telecom’s Inner Mongolia Information Park, consumes more than 150 MW on an ongoing basis. “You get really big gains in cost advantage as you get bigger, and we could easily build 250-MW facilities, but if it goes down, it’s not a good place to be,” he said. “So our take right now is that (25-32 MW) is about the right size facility. It costs us a tiny bit more to go down this path, but we think it’s the right thing for customers.” Watch the full video of Hamilton’s talk below. Sponsor Post Salesforce is ready for you.

Linux Memory Performance With Intel Kabylake From DDR4-1600 To DDR4-3333MHz Written by Michael Larabel in Computers on 26 January 2017. Page 1 of 5. 10 Comments For those that may be thinking about picking up an Intel Kabylake processor and trying to justify if DDR4-2400 memory is worthwhile for your budget, or even faster DDR4 memory via XMP profiles / overclocking, here are some tests using a Kabylake CPU and testing DDR4 memory at frequencies from 1600MHz up to 3333MHz. This article is intended for providing some reference DDR4 memory Linux benchmarks at different frequencies in conjunction with an Intel Core i5 7600K running on an ASUS PRIME Z270-P motherboard. The memory I used throughout all of this testing was the Corsair Vengeance 2 x 8GB DDR4-3200MHz memory 16 Memory Kit. This Corsair memory used has an XMP profile for running the memory at DDR4-3200MHz with 16-18-18-36 latencies at 1.35V. Plopping these DIMMs into the PRIME Z270-P motherboard with i5-7600K, as soon as activating the XMP profile, the system had no troubles running at 3200MHz. I was able to increase it to 3333MHz too without any issues, but trying to push the memory further than that resulted in problems with the HD Graphics 630 not working due to timing issues. So for these Linux tests today I ran this memory at frequencies from 1600MHz to 3333MHz while running various real-world and synthetic Linux benchmarks. During testing only the frequency was changing without any tweaking of the latency or other tunables. All of this benchmarking was done in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 was running on the system with the Linux 4.10 kernel.

There's Now A KDE-Branded Laptop Running Neon With Plasma 5 Written by Michael Larabel in KDE on 26 January 2017 at 06:32 AM EST. 37 Comments For KDE fans not interested in setting up a KDE-based Linux distribution on your own laptop and worrying about potential graphics driver bugs with Plasma or other possible headaches, there is now a "KDE laptop" backed by the KDE community. KDE has teamed up with Spanish computer hardware retailer Slimbook to offer the KDE Slimbook. It's an Intel laptop preloaded with KDE Neon and thus running the latest KDE Frameworks 5 + Plasma 5 experience. This isn't a laptop running Coreboot or the like or any other real innovations besides just being pre-loaded with KDE Neon and tested by KDE Developers to ensure you don't run into any hardware troubles, etc. The KDE Slimbook currently comes in two varieties with either a Core i5 6200U or Core i7 6500U processor, 4 / 8 / 16GB RAM options, Intel Graphics HD 520, SSD storage, 13.3-inch 1080p screen, and a two-year warranty. Pricing on the Core i5 laptop starts out at 729,00 € (~$780 USD) while the Core i7 model starts out at 849,00 € (~$911 USD). That's for the base models with 4GB of RAM and 120GB SSD storage. So as with most Linux laptops not from a tier-one vendor, the pricing is higher than you'd normally pay for a Windows laptop from one of the major vendors, but at least you know it will work with KDE just fine. More details on the KDE Slimbook via today's dot.kde.org announcement or by visiting Slimbook.es. 37 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Sends In Final Batch Of DRM Features For Linux 4.11: DP MST Audio, HuC Firmware Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 26 January 2017 at 06:18 AM EST. 4 Comments Daniel Vetter, the i915 DRM kernel maintainer from Intel's Open-Source Technology Center, has announced their final set of feature changes to be queued in DRM-Next for the Linux 4.11 kernel. Going back to the end of 2016 they had already been staging their DRM / graphics changes for Linux 4.11. They've sent in several series of updates and the code sent out today is believed to be their last feature work they are looking to merge for this next kernel cycle. The updates today aren't too exciting for end-users. Among the changes are some code clean-ups, Panel Self Refresh (PSR) fixes, and various other fixes throughout. Two noticable items though include DP MST audio (DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport) support as well as HuC loading support. DP MST was already supported by the Intel DRM driver while with Linux 4.11 is now DP MST audio capability. The HuC is another binary-only firmware blob. HuC follows in the GuC firmware blobs for the Intel DRM driver. HuC is related to video decoding support. Earlier feature work already in DRM-Next for the Intel driver on Linux 4.11 is frame-buffer compression by default for Skylake and newer hardware. Great to see FBC finally getting flipped on by default there! Linux 4.11 also has initial support for Intel Geminilake. The changes for this latest DRM-Next i915 pull request can be found via intel-gfx. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It joins other thin mini-ITX boards based on Intel’s new Apollo Lake processors, including Aaeon’s EMB-APL, Advantech’s AIMB-217, Adlink’s AmITX-AL-I, and Congatec’s Conga-IA5. mITX-APL (click image to enlarge) Like Kontron’s full-size, Intel 7th Gen Core based mITX-SKL-H Mini-ITX board, the mITX-APL features a TPM 2.0 security chip, and supports the new Kontron Security Solution, which also includes the Approtect software framework and optional security services. “Applications are comfortably protected against unwanted access and make possible creating, managing, and tracking licenses,” says Konton. “At the same time, privileges can be assigned and access levels defined.” The 170 x 170mm mITX-APL board supports the quad-core, 2GHz Atom E3950 and 1.8GHz Atom E3940, as well as the dual-core 1.8GHz Atom E3930 and 2.3GHz Celeron N3350, with TDPs ranging from 6-13W. No OS support was listed, but we imagine that like the mITX-SKL-H, the mITX-APL runs Linux or Windows. mITX-APL block diagram (click image to enlarge) You can load up to 8GB of DDR3L-1867 RAM, and eMMC is optional. The mITX-APL provides triple display support using dual DisplayPort 1.2 ports plus 24-bit, dual-channel LVDS. In addition to the DP ports, coastline ports include four USB 3.0 ports, dual audio jacks, and dual GbE ports. Onboard interfaces include dual SATA 3.0 slots, a full-size mini-PCI, a second mini-PCIe devoted to mSATA, and a SIM card socket. The board is further equipped with RS-232, RS-422/485, SPI, SPDIF, and a 9+9 DIO Kontron Feature Connector. CAN and USB 3.0 client interfaces are optional.

(AAPL), Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Options activity provides a look at expectations on AAPL, RAD and IBM By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 23, 2017, 9:14 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Eyes $13 Ahead of Earnings Bank of America Corp’s (BAC) Irrational Exuberance Will End Recent Posts: Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Going to Record Highs! Friday’s Vital Data: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 2 Ways to Play Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Q4 Earnings View All Posts U.S. stock futures are pointed lower this morning over concerns that President Donald Trump will pursue a protectionist agenda. Traders are beginning to shift away from the U.S. dollar, with the Japanese yen drawing a safe-haven bid, and oil is also moving lower. In earnings, Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) will be in focus later today. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average had slipped 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were both lower by 0.19%. On the options front, Friday’s Jan. 2017 expiration drove massive volume with more than 21.3 million calls and 18.6 million puts crossing the tape. Over on the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio whipsawed from a one-month low of 0.59 on Thursday to a two-week high of 0.70. The 10-day moving average, however, held steady at 0.65. Turning to Friday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw accelerated bullish bids following report the company is planning new iPad launches in the first half of 2017. Elsewhere, Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) puts gained popularity after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) balked at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc’s (NASDAQ:WBA) buyout plan. Finally, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) hit a fresh all-time high following strong fourth-quarter earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL) AAPL stock finished Friday pinned at $120, as heavy call and put accumulations at the expiring Jan. 2017 $120 strike proved too much for the stock to overcome. The shares had plenty of bullish drivers on the session, including a report that Apple was preparing to launch a slate of revamped iPads in the first half of 2017. Specifically, a pre-publication note in DigiTimes said that Apple is building a “9.7-inch iPad with a friendly price range” for the first quarter, with an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a 10.5-inch iPad for the second quarter. However, the note doesn’t call the 12.9-inch iPad a “Pro” model. Volume was brisk on AAPL stock Friday, with nearly 1.1 million contracts traded on the shares. What’s more, calls accounted for a well above average 71% of the day’s take. Overall, traders remain heavily focused on the $120 strike in both the 27 Jan. and 3 Feb. series, with the latter bearing the brunt of speculation heading into next week’s quarterly earnings report.
