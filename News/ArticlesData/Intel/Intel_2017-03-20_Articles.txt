The automotive semiconductor market is worth $24 billion, according to consulting firm McKinsey, and by 2025 more than $7 billion worth of semiconductors will be used in partially or fully autonomous cars, according to analysts at J.P. Morgan. The world’s largest semiconductor company clearly wants to dominate the market for technology used in autonomous cars. Intel recently agreed to pay $15.3 billion to acquire Israel’s Mobileye, which makes cameras and sensors for self-driving cars. That’s 36-times Mobileye’s annualized revenue, and more than double the amount analysts are predicting the entire market for chips used in autonomous cars will be worth eight years from now. Mobileye is already doing business with 27 automakers, according to Recode, and Intel apparently sees immense value in those relationships. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has said he believes automakers will outsource their self-driving vehicle technologies. The Mobileye purchase gives Intel a better shot at becoming a dominant supplier of automotive modules and the chips inside them. Meanwhile, chipmakers that focus primarily on the wireless market have been busy making their own deals with the auto industry. Qualcomm recently inked a deal with PSA Group, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and DS. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon automotive processor will be integrated into PSA Group’s next generation of vehicles. Qualcomm says its Snapdragon 820A processor can support in-vehicle music and video streaming, 3-D navigation and multiple high-resolution displays. Sierra Wireless recently announced its LTE technology will connect Volkswagen vehicles starting next year. The company said its AirPrime modules and Legato platform will provide cellular connectivity for Volkswagen’s Car-Net platform, which is used for vehicle access, roadside assistance, diagnostics and maintenance. The world’s fastest car, which is being made by a British company called Bloodhound, will also use Sierra Wireless’s AirPrime LTE embedded modules, as well as the company’s AirLink gateways, management services and technical support.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Rumor: AMD may be planning a 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen titan to challenge Intel’s Broadwell-E, Skylake-X Rumor: AMD may be planning a 16-core, 32-thread Ryzen titan to challenge Intel’s Broadwell-E, Skylake-X By Joel Hruska on March 20, 2017 at 5:01 pm Comment AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700 all debuted earlier this month, officially putting Intel on notice that Team Green was back and ready to fight. Now, there’s a rumor making the rounds that Ryzen 18 may not be the end of AMD’s desktop ambitions. Supposedly, there’s a chip coming that would go toe-to-toe with Intel’s HEDT line. Obligatory reminder: Take this with enough salt to kill a donkey. Here’s the text of the rumor, as reported by FLCLimax, at Overclock.net: Public knowledge by now but AMD has a new HEDT platform coming out in a couple of months. You’ll see more of it at Computex I believe. It’s a 16 core /32 Thread, quad channel behemoth. And it is insanely quick in the tests that Ryzen is already excelling at. So Cinebench, and all other related productivity programs. The gaming issues that were causing the Ryzen AM4 CPUs to behave erratically to say the least have been ironed out. It’s akin to a newer revision on a newer platform. This should be competing with the Xeon and of course 6950X Intel offers for $1700~$1800USD, but at about $1,000 USD if not less for some Skews(sic). Coming soon. CPSs(sic) are pretty big physically, about twice the size of surrent (sic) 6950X CPUs and a bit more perhaps. And if you were hoping for pins, nope it’s strictly LGA! IT’s NOT 8 channel, but Quad. One thing I want to call out right from the start. FLCLimax’s claim that “the gaming issues… have been ironed out,” is not, to the absolute best of my knowledge, true. It’s true some motherboards had early BIOS problems that made them perform more poorly than they should’ve in gaming benchmarks. AMD said this issue is because games compiled prior to Ryzen do not accurately detect its capabilities or take advantage of the CPUs architecture. And AMD has already said the issue isn’t the Windows 10 scheduler, despite some users being convinced this was the case. Some games may indeed be ironed out if developers release patches to improve Ryzen’s performance, but the issue isn’t in the thread scheduler and it doesn’t seem to be something AMD can improve on its own. AMD has shown how it connects two Naples chips together with its Infinity Fabric, but connecting 16 cores together in a single socket is still difficult if you want to minimize bottlenecks. Now, as for the rest of the rumor, it’s by no means impossible. AMD is already planning to build a 32-core Ryzen with 8 memory channels (one per CCX). A 16-core device could easily turn out to be a quad-channel part, and that would compete well against Intel’s HEDT lineup. The one thing I’d caution against, however, is treating this rumor as if its either proof AMD will launch such a chip or that this kind of processor would be desirable to most enthusiasts. First, AMD will be required to cut clock speeds. The more cores you have, the lower your maximum clock is going to be. That’s always been true for server chips from both companies. Even allowing for some variation between product SKUs, higher core counts mean lower clock speeds or similar clock speeds at a substantially higher TDP. Intel’s E7-8894 v4 (24 cores) has a base clock of 2.4GHz and a boost clock of 3.4GHz in a 165W TDP. The E7-8891 v4 (10 cores) has a base clock of 2.8GHz and a boost of 3.5GHz in the same 165W power envelope. Which of these CPUs is “better” depends entirely on how multi-threaded your workloads are, of course, but the trend holds clear. If AMD wants to build a 16-core Ryzen, even in a 150W TDP, it’s going to have to give up some clock speed to get there. It might make a fabulous workstation chip, but I’d bet you’d get better gaming performance from a different CPU in AMD’s lineup. Would a 16-core Ryzen punch holes in Intel’s product family? Possibly. There is some concern that by joining that many CCX’s together, the relatively limited 22GB/s of bandwidth between the CCX’s could prove a scaling bottleneck with that many chips to handle. And it’s absolutely possible, even likely, that gamers would see little benefit from this kind of firepower. Games are typically designed to run on higher clocks with lower threads; few platforms can saturate threads to the point that they count for more than raw clocks. Still, it’ll be interesting to see if this rumor proves true. Depending on what AMD pulls off, it might be able to regain market share, even at the highest end of the non-server market.

Minyanville Trade of the Day: Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Programmed for a Leg Up By Scutify Mar 20, 2017 12:48 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) - This designer and manufacturer of digital technology platforms was last reviewed by me on Nov. 16 when I recommended it as a buy "under $35" with a trading target at $40. Despite several successful trades during the year, the highest price since the last review occurred on Jan. 27 at $38.45, where it "double-topped" with the Oct. 5 high at $38.31. However, with the offer to purchase Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) at $63.54 per share and INTC's decline to the mid-$30s, INTC's high number of stock holders makes it attractive for another review. Despite "periods of lumpiness," higher cloud investments, growth within "the Internet of Things" and increased demand for more powerful memory chips should benefit Intel. The company's recent agreement to purchase MBLY, a leader in the research and development of advanced driver assistance systems, should help Intel cut prices while offering superior autonomous driving platforms. Standard & Poor's anticipates that Intel's cash flow will accelerate, which will enable it to raise its dividend and repurchase shares. The target for INTC is $41 and is based on a multiple of 13.9X 2018 EPS estimate of $2.94, up from EPS of $2.80 est. for 2017. INTC's current dividend is $1.04, providing an annualized dividend yield of 2.95%. For the last year, INTC's stock has advanced along a bullish support line. In November 2016 that line began to run coincident with the stock's 200-day moving average. As noted above, the stock "double-topped" at about $38 in January and fell below the support line last week. However, on Wednesday it reversed up, with a CBR buy signal from my internal proprietary indicator. However, in order to confirm the reversal, it must regain the 200-day moving average now at $35.41. Thus, buy INTC at about $35 with a trading target of $41. A stop-loss order should be placed under the "CBR Buy" at $34.60. Click to Enlarge Tell us what you think about this article!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest Is Optane Intel’s secret weapon? Jack Gold, J.Gold Associates@jckgld March 20, 2017 3:05 PM Tags: Intel, Jack Gold, Optane Image Credit: Intel.com Intel has announced availability of its first Optane storage solution (DC P4800x, 375GB) targeted at data centers and built with its revolutionary 3D CrossPoint memory technology. This first release of Optane is targeted at replacing existing NAND-based SSD products, but I expect a full range of Optane-powered memory products to be released in the coming quarters. Is this an indication that Intel wants to take over the memory business? Optane is targeted specifically at the “warm” data market. Hot data needs to be kept near the CPU to maximize processing speeds and minimize latency, using dedicated memory chips (DRAM) and fast buses (DDRx). Typically HDD/SSD devices are targeted at “cold” data where the primary selection criteria is the amount of data that can be stored at a reasonable price (hence the term mass storage), and not primarily the speed of data transfer, which is done on a relatively slow bus (e.g., eSATA). Warm data exists in between – not as close to the CPU as DRAM, but close enough and fast enough (e.g. PCIe) to aid the overall computing process, with even faster (e.g., NVMe) units coming. With all the expansion of compute-intensive, memory-hungry applications emerging, this is becoming a critical function. Optane has an advantage in density and speed over NAND-based flash memory, as well as being able to scale in a traditional semiconductor process evolution. But NAND will, for the foreseeable future, remain lower cost and more available. This will make it a preferred mass storage platform for many applications, although traditional magnetic HDD devices will continue to dominate when largest capacity at lowest cost is the priority. Flash storage/SSDs have been coming down in price over the past few years reflected by their increasing share of the traditional storage market in both PCs and servers. But I don’t expect Optane to compete directly with flash drives. Rather I expect Optane to be priced on a per byte basis between DRAM and NAND flash. As a result, I estimate Optane-based SSDs will initially be priced at a 50-75 percent premium compared to SSD equivalent devices, although on a price/performance basis, Optane will be a better value for process intensive applications (e.g., big data/analytics, graphics/gaming, video/CGI, VR/AR, AI/ML). It’s not only about the speed. Optane has 100X the endurance of NAND flash, a significant issue when many read/write operations are required. Flash storage elements in general have been known to wear out when written to many times. In one intensive graphics rendering application, a typical NAND SSD will wear out in about six months, whereas the Optane equivalent will last about four years. Durability is no trivial issue for users of highly compute intensive read/write systems. And durability is no small selling point for these cutting edge applications, particularly in cloud-based servers and high performance computing. Does Intel really want to own the memory/storage market? While many have focused on Optane’s ability to take market share away from traditional NAND storage devices, I believe that is missing the point. The true advantage of Optane, once machines are properly designed/configured for its unique capabilities, is that it can significantly increase performance and act as a processing accelerator. Because it is significantly less expensive than DRAM and can have 15X – 20X the memory capacity per die (e.g., 8GB vs. 128GB) while achieving speeds at least 10X that of NAND, it is an ideal “intermediary” memory element where adding more relatively fast memory can significantly increase overall system performance at a lower cost than stacking it with large amounts of DRAM (Optane is likely to cost 5X – 10X less than comparable amounts of DRAM). This makes Optane ideal as an accelerator between the CPU and mass storage device. Indeed, I see this as the primary advantage to Optane for Intel going forward, since it’s a proprietary technology and no other vendors have yet come up with a similar technology that can be produced in volume. I expect the initial primary markets for Optane to be in high performance computing like big data servers, high-end gaming, and other data or graphics intensive applications where large amounts of memory are advantageous. For Intel, the first release of Optane as a purpose built SSD replacement makes the most sense, as it requires the least amount of work by the industry to adopt the technology and gives Intel the opportunity to scale volume and capabilities. While the Optane SSD will offer significant performance boost over exiting SSDs (10X or more), it can only be used with Intel 7th gen Core products, eliminating the ability of companies to upgrade existing older generation systems. This has much to do with the internal bus structures on these machines, as well as a need to enhance the drivers and tune the system. It also allows Intel to give companies with older machines an incentive to upgrade, helping Intel accelerate the upgrade cycle and create more revenue. Bottom line: As Moore’s Law slows and competitors like AMD and Qualcomm come at Intel in a variety of its markets, having exclusive availability of a technology like Optane could give it a 10 – 25 percent competitive performance advantage. This could be a deciding factor in many corporate and consumer selection criteria and may provide Intel with a competitive advantage it would not have with CPU production alone. I expect to see Intel increasingly leverage Optane as an accelerator and potentially a cost advantage in competing at the end point and server market, as well as create a new cloud-targeted computing platform strategy. As with all things semiconductor, I expect the price to come down and capacity and performance to increase over time, making Optane a strategic partner for all of Intel’s processor and SoC offerings.

The news came during Comey's testimony alongside National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Roger before the House Intelligence Committee. The Hill's Katie Bo Williams has the story: The bombshell revelation puts an end to months of roiling speculation and frustration on the part of Democrats, who saw the director's silence as a double-standard after Comey's repeated disclosures in the FBI's investigation into Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonObama and Trump haven’t talked since inauguration Perez, Ellison start multistate ‘turnaround tour’ for Dems Watergate reporter on Russia: 'I’ve been saying for a while there’s a coverup going on' MORE's private email server. In a dramatic moment at the beginning of a hotly anticipated House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the U.S. election, Comey announced that he had been authorized by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to break bureau policy and publicly disclose the probe. ADVERTISEMENT "As you know our practice is not to confirm the existence of an ongoing investigation," he said. "But in usual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so." Read more here.

The Hill's Jordan Fabian has the story here. The White House also sought to distance itself from some former Trump campaign officials, claiming many of them did not play a large role in the campaign. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had only a "limited role." The Hill's Jonathan Easley has more on that here.

The Hill's Ellen Mitchell reports: Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis told reporters Monday U.S. Central Command (Centcom) is assessing reports of civilian deaths after a March 16 strike. Observer groups reported that at least 49 people were killed in the airstrike, which targeted a building near a mosque in the village of Al-Jineh in the northern province of Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the destroyed building belonged to the mosque and was part of the same compound. Davis said he had no information on whether the building was affiliated with a mosque. "We did not judge this to be a mosque," he said.

In a letter released Monday, the senators quoted Defense Secretary James Mattis's support for the program in arguing for additional visas. "Keeping our promise to those Afghans who meet the strict qualifications of this program is a strategic imperative as well as a moral one," they wrote. "During his confirmation process, Secretary Mattis noted that 'most of our units could not have accomplished their missions without the assistance, often at risk to their lives, of these courageous men and women,' and he pledged to work to ensure such individuals are not left behind."

The latest report found that more than a quarter of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) rolled over to backup centers, much higher than the Veterans Affairs Department goal of 10 percent. Further, the report said, none of the recommendations made in the original February 2016 report have been fully implemented. "Veterans are at a disproportionately high risk for suicide compared to the rate of U.S. civilian adults," Michael Missal, Veterans Affair inspector general, said in a statement. "The VCL is a critical effort to reduce veteran suicide for those who call in crisis. Therefore, it is imperative that VA take further steps to increase the effectiveness of VCL operations."

Intel and Deutsche Messe joined forces to produce an unparalleled live demo showcase at CeBIT 2017. As drones are finding their way into more and more commercial applications, the two companies want to highlight the diverse commercial applications of the latest drone systems. The Intel CeBIT Drone Park at the Hannover Exhibition Center will provide a unique insight into the entire UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) value chain. On the open-air site just outside Hall 2, visitors will be able to see drones demonstrations in a variety of applications. Intel CeBIT Drone Park Visitors will also see how the comprehensive data gathered by the drones are converted into usable information at a central control station by means of special analysis and visualization tools. The results and 3D graphics generated from the drone’s raw data are then used to inform decisions - for instance, the drone surveys an array of solar collectors and the gathered information will tell you when the solar plant is next up for maintenance. The Intel CeBIT Drone Park will also demonstrate the intrinsic role of drones in the Internet of Things, and as data-gathering devices for totally new business models. Aerial displays and other demonstrations will highlight the many tasks drones are already capable of, the incredible speed with which drone technology is evolving and how companies can put drones to profitable use in their own operations.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Mar 20, 2017 at 3:23PM The first batch of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) Ryzen PC CPUs launched on March 2 to mixed reviews. The Ryzen 7 series, all high-end chips aimed at competing with Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) best, offers impressive performance in applications capable of utilizing all eight cores. For the price, especially considering that Intel's 6-10 core Broadwell-E chips are extremely expensive, Ryzen 7 looks like a great choice for workstation and professional applications. But Ryzen 7 fell short in applications where single-threaded performance mattered. While AMD's new chips offer a massive leap in performance over the previous generation, they're still no match for Intel in situations where more cores provide little to no benefit. Gaming is the most prominent example, with third-party reviews putting Intel's cheaper four-core i7-7700k ahead of even the most expensive Ryzen chip in nearly every gaming benchmark. AMD will have another shot to impress gamers in April. The company plans to launch four mainstream Ryzen 5 CPUs on April 11, priced to compete with Intel's own mainstream offerings. While Ryzen 7 was meant to turn heads with its impressive multicore performance, Ryzen 5 may end up being more disruptive. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. A look at Ryzen 5 AMD's Ryzen 5 chips will be priced between $169 and $249, comprised of two hex-core and two quad-core options. The $249 hex-core 1600X, essentially a Ryzen 7 1800X with two cores disabled, will be the most expensive, roughly the same price as Intel's i5-7600K. The $219 1600 will also feature six cores, but a lower clock speed will slow it down. The $189 1500X and $169 1400 will both come with four cores, going after Intel's lower-end offerings. Independent third-party reviews are still weeks away, but it's safe to say that Ryzen 5 will wipe the floor with comparably priced Intel chips in scenarios that benefit from more cores. AMD claims that the 1600X beats Intel's 7600K by 69% in a cherrypicked multicore benchmark, not a surprise given that it has 50% more cores and triple the threads. Single-threaded performance will still be an issue, just as it was with Ryzen 7. But the 1600X could end up far more attractive for PC gamers due to the lower price. While multithreaded performance will be worse than its high-end eight-core siblings, gaming performance shouldn't be too far off from the 1800X in many games. The gaming performance that the 1800X delivers isn't worth its $499 price tag. But a $249 price tag is a different story. We'll have to wait and see how these new chips perform against Intel's products. If the 1600X provides similar gaming performance as the highest-end Ryzen chip, it will certainly shake up the mainstream PC CPU market. It will be no match in terms of raw single-threaded performance for Intel's more expensive i7-7700K, but the price-to-performance ratio could make the 1600X a popular chip. The Ryzen train rolls on AMD will further fill out its CPU lineup during the second half of the year with its Ryzen 3 line of low-end products. With prices topping out below $169 and likely featuring only quad-core chips, perhaps even dual-core chips, Ryzen 3 will be aimed at Intel's budget offerings. Ryzen so far has been a mixed bag. There's no question that AMD has accomplished a lot, greatly improving performance over its previous line of chips. AMD claims that Ryzen achieves 52% higher instructions-per-clock, a measure of single-threaded performance, an impressive feat. But that gain also reflects how abysmal single-threaded performance has been on AMD chips in recent years. Intel likely won't sit still if AMD begins to win considerable market share, so there's no guarantee that Ryzen will lead to the kind of profits that investors are expecting. AMD stock is up about 375% over the past year, reflecting a fervent optimism that may end up being a bit too intense. Ryzen is a big step forward for AMD, but whether it will be enough to justify those gains remains to be seen. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Is Brian Krzanich taking too much heat for Intel’s lackluster growth? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 20, 2017 at 3:06PM Brian Krzanich became Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth CEO on May 16, 2013. Since then, Intel stock has rallied 46% -- which seems solid, but merely matches the S&P 500's 46% gain and underperforms the NASDAQ's 72% gain. That performance isn't bad, but many investors have wondered if Intel would fare better under a new leader. Last May, fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa argued that it was time to replace Krzanich, due to Intel's disastrous mobile strategy, its delayed transition from 14nm to 10nm chips, and the stock's lackluster performance. But is Krzanich the real reason that Intel failed to outperform the market? Let's take a closer look at the biggest problems with Krzanich's leadership, and whether or not those flaws are dragging down Intel's growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Image source: Intel. Intel dropped the mobile ball before Krzanich took over To be fair, Krzanich was dealt a terrible hand in the mobile market when he became Intel's CEO. In 2006, his predecessor Paul Otellini sold Intel's ARM-based Xscale business to Marvell Technology, then rejected Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) offer to supply application processors for the first iPhone. At the time, Otellini didn't believe that mobile chips would disrupt the PC market. In 2008, Intel launched its low-power Atom x86 chip for netbooks and mobile devices, but the first generation chips were less power efficient than ARM designs. The Atom chips gradually improved over time, but that initial misstep enabled ARM chipmakers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to take over the mobile market. ARM claims that 95% of all smartphones in the world now use its chip designs. But Krzanich's solutions were also ineffective The good news is that Krzanich realized that Intel had to counter ARM in the mobile market. The bad news is that his solutions were expensive and ineffective. Krzanich tried to win back mobile OEMs by giving them steep discounts on Atom chips, co-marketing agreements, and financial aid in redesigning logic boards for x86 chips. The company called those subsidies "contra revenues", which burned through roughly $10 billion to capture less than 1% of the mobile market. Intel's Atom-powered smartphones. Image source: Intel. Krzanich then hired several major executives from Qualcomm and ARM, which was a bold move for the insular company. But those hires, particularly that of former Qualcomm co-president Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, reportedly stirred up internal conflicts. Krzanich finally admitted defeat and Intel stopped investing in its Atom chipsets for smartphones and tablets last year, opting to pivot toward modems for the latest iPhone and next-gen 5G chipsets instead. Pulling some iPhone modem orders from Qualcomm should have been a victory for Intel, but Apple admitted that it throttled the speed of Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 to match the slower speed of the Intel modems. That report casts serious doubts on Intel's ability to effectively grow its baseband modem business. Krzanich believes that expanding Intel's presence in the Internet of Things (IoT) market with low-power modules like the button-sized Curie will offset its weakness in mobile devices. However, the IoT business accounted for just 4% of its revenues in 2016, and the business faces stiff competition from low-power ARM modules. Intel could lose its dominance of PCs and data centers Looking ahead, Intel's dominant market shares in PCs and data centers could be threatened by new products and partnerships. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), for example, recently introduced its new Ryzen x86 chips, which appear to trump Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips in terms of price-to-performance. Image source: Intel. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently launched new versions of Windows 10 which are compatible with both Intel's x86 chips and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips. Microsoft also announced that it will run its Azure cloud platform on Qualcomm's new ARM-based Centriq 2400 server solutions. These new deals could eventually throttle the growth of Intel's core Client Computing and Data Center businesses. Krzanich's pricey turnaround strategies Lastly, Krzanich's turnaround strategies are expensive. Besides the $10 billion in contra revenues it burned through in three years, Intel spent nearly $17 billion on programmable chipmaker Altera in late 2015, and recently announced that it would acquire automotive collision avoidance system maker Mobileye for over $15 billion. These moves are causing Intel's long-term debt to surge relative to its free cash flow. Source: YCharts Those acquisitions won't endanger Intel's dividends, which used up just 35% of its FCF over the past 12 months, but they indicate that Krzanich could "diworsify" the company's business with desperately pricey acquisitions. The verdict It's tempting to think that Intel might fare better under a new leader, but Krzanich inherited a troubled company and I believe he's trying to rejuvenate the company with outside hires, expansion into new markets like non-volatile memory and IoT chips, and strategic acquisitions. These efforts won't pay off anytime soon, since analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 1% and 3% this year, but they could eventually reduce the company's dependence on its aging PC and data center businesses.

Launches New Red iPhone 7, New iPad View All Posts When you think PCs, two companies always come to mind: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). During most of the Wintel partnership between these two companies, however, there has been a second supplier of computer CPUs. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has barely made a dent on Intel’s business, but that could change with AMD’s new Zen architecture chips. Source: AMD The newest version — the Ryzen 5 — is aimed at mainstream computing and Intel’s Core i5 lineup. AMD recently announced the new CPU will launch on April 11. Intel Dominates the CPU Market for PCs There is no question that Intel dominates the world’s PC market. Nearly nine out of 10 CPUs sold for use in computers carry the Intel logo. It’s the exclusive supplier for makers of premium computers, such as those from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), while rival AMD has tended to be shunted to the side as a less expensive option on some budget PCs. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, Intel was showing off its new Kaby Lake processors. The 7th generation of the company’s Core CPUs represent a slight improvement over last year, as part of Intel’s new three-phase “Process, Architecture, Optimization” product development cycle. In other words, a relatively boring year for Intel upgrades leaves an opening for the competition to make some noise, and AMD is doing just that with its new Zen architecture CPUs. The Ryzen 7 has already been released, but it is the Ryzen 5 that could really cause problems for Intel. AMD’s Zen Architecture and Ryzen 5 Built for PC Future AMD set out to win big with its new Zen architecture. While Intel has been content with delivering single-digit gains in performance per clock cycle, AMD says Zen offers a 52% improvement over its previous generation. The Zen chips –including the new Ryzen 5 — still lag Intel’s Core CPUs on single-thread performance. That means with software that’s not written specifically to take advantage of more than one or two simultaneous threads for faster processing, Intel still has the raw power edge and will offer superior performance. However, AMD is looking at high-processor-demand applications and the future of computing. That means software that takes full advantage of multiple cores and multiple threads per core — meaning multiple instructions can be processed simultaneously. The top of the line Ryzen 5 CPU has six cores and 12 threads, for $249. It goes up against an Intel Core i5 CPU priced at $240 with four cores and four threads.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel launches its first Optane SSD, the DC P4800X Intel launches its first Optane SSD, the DC P4800X By Joel Hruska on March 20, 2017 at 8:35 am Comment Roughly 18 months ago, Intel and Micron announced they had developed a new type of memory they dubbed 3DXPoint. While details have always been scarce on how the NAND flash competitor would perform in the real world, Intel made impressive claims about its reliability, power consumption, and performance. Today, Intel is launching its first Optane SSD, the DC P4800X. This new card has a 375GB capacity, with much lower latencies than NAND. Intel is still playing its cards close to its chest. It doesn’t want to talk about how, precisely, Optane works or what it’s made of. Still, we now know a great deal more about where Intel sees this technology fitting into the data center, as well as how much it will cost. In the old days, data was kept in-cache as much as possible, in main memory if not, and on a hard drive if there was absolutely nowhere else to put it. Hard drives were always the biggest problem with this approach; their latencies are measured in milliseconds and are orders of magnitude higher than DRAM, which is significantly worse than CPU cache. NAND flash latencies are vastly lower than hard drives, but there’s still a significant gap between NAND and DRAM. Intel’s Optane memory is meant to sit between DRAM and NAND in much the same fashion as NAND might sit between DRAM and a conventional hard drive in a modern system. Intel’s DC P4800X without its cover. Another advantage of Optane is that it offers the same performance at multiple queue depths. SSDs typically run faster the higher the queue depth, and so does Optane, but the gap isn’t nearly so large. Intel sees two main use-cases for the Optane DC P4800X, both shown below: It can be used as a fast storage and cache drive, where its primary purpose is to buffer NAND and offer higher performance, or it can be deployed as a memory replacement / extension. We’ve seen some of these approaches before that actually utilized NAND flash — and while it may seem counterintuitive to deploy NAND (which is still vastly slower than DRAM), there are workloads that simply don’t care much about access speeds. Being able to hold colossal amounts of information in memory for significantly less power can be more important than raw bandwidth. The price for the 375GB drive, while high, is scarcely stratospheric. A PCIe-based P4800X will sell for $1,520, with a 750GB drive following later this year. While that’s a lot for a conventional high-speed drive, I remember when SSDs cost more than that in terms of $ per GB. It will be extremely interesting to see how Optane performs against other SSDs in real-world workloads. Its latency is excellent, its reliability is outstanding, and if the drive performs as promised, it should offer a notable speed increase compared with PCI Express-based storage solutions.

The vendor claims that the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X Series "breaks the confines of traditional storage" by increasing scale per server and accelerating applications. The SSD also offers high throughput, low latency, a high quality of service and high endurance, as well as being able to expand the system memory pool when deployed as extended memory, Intel said. "Intel Optan SSDs offer unrivaled performance at low queue depth, where the vast majority of applications generate storage workloads, which means CPUs are more active and more fully utilized," the vendor proclaimed in its announcement. "Intel Optane SSDs for the datacenter let users do more work with the same servers, improving TCO or expanding capabilities," Intel added. The offering is available now to customers in an early ship program, Intel said, with additional capacities and form factors becoming available in the second half of 2017. IDC's innovators IDC has today released details of three infrastructure vendors with revenue under $100 million that the analyst says offer "innovative solutions" for improving server hardware utilization in the datacenter. In its IDC Innovators: Virtualizing Infrastructure with Software-Defined Compute, 2017 research the analyst details TidalScale, DriveScale and Cloudistics as the three smaller vendors of note. Of each, IDC said that TidalScale's software-defined servers offer a new way to pool commodity server hardware into a single virtual system that matches the size of the data need, while DriveScale provides a software-based datacenter architecture that allows datacenters more freedom for responsive scale-out deployments and Cloudistics is potentially the "first true software-defined cloud infrastructure that integrates network, storage, compute, virtualization and management under a single platform". The innovators document is comprised of research around virtualization infrastructure vendors with revenues under $100 million and a product, service or business model with a specific use case, IDC said. Cisco's vulnerability advisory Cisco has released an advisory highlighting vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software. The vendor said on Friday afternoon that the vulnerability could enable an unauthenticated, remote attacker to remotely execute code with elevated privileges. There is also the risk of such an attacker causing a reload of an affected device, Cisco said. The vulnerability is a result of two factors, the vendor noted: A failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options to internal, local communications between cluster members and the incorrect processing on malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. There are currently no workarounds to address the vulnerability, Cisco said, adding that it will release software updates to address the issue. TSMC's U.S. chip plant? Conflicting reports have emerged today as to whether Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC will be building a chip plant in the U.S. next year. Reuters reported earlier today that the world's largest contract chipmaker and major supplier to Apple will decide in the first half of next year whether it is to build a chip plant in the U.S., noting that that the company currently brings in approximately 65 percent of its revenue from the U.S. However, in an article on Focus Taiwan News Channel, an official at the Taiwanese Ministry of Science and technology was reported to have spoken with TSMC chairman Morris Chang, who said that the firm currently has no plans to invest in a plant in the U.S. and will prioritize investment in Taiwan. WikiLeaks' vendor demands  Apple, Google, Microsoft and other tech firms who were named in documents published by WikiLeaks as having been victims of bugs and exploits by the CIA, have reportedly been emailed by the document-leaking outfit and asked to submit to a series of demands before WikiLeaks will send them details of the how the hacks were carried out, Motherboard reports. The email, reportedly sent from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, contained a document that firms were asked to sign, detailing a number of demands, including a 90-day disclosure deadline, which would mean having to issue a patch within three months, Motherboard cites one of its sources as saying. Other demands were unclear, the website added. The reported demands come after WikiLeaks published a collection of documents supposedly detailing internal discussions at the CIA of hacking techniques used over a number of years.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Intel Unveils Solid-State Drive Tech To Boost Data Center Memory By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MARCH 20 2017 A new series of solid-state drives (SSD) from Intel target data centers looking to deploy advanced applications with heavy database demands. Unveiled yesterday, the Optane SSD DC P4800X Series can provide either "blazing fast" storage or cache support for databases, according to the company. Intel's latest SSD series is built on the 3D XPoint non-volatile computing memory technology announced in mid-2015. That technology, created by Intel and Micron Technology, represented the first significant memory breakthrough since NAND flash memory was introduced in 1989, according to its developers. By incorporating the 3D XPoint technology, the new Optane SSD DC P4800X Series offers a way for data center users to "combine the attributes of memory and storage," Intel said. By speeding up both fast caching and storage, the latest SSD enables data centers to more easily meet quality-of-service requirements in database dependent applications. Better Handling of Memory-Intensive Demands The new SSD DC P4800X Series showed in tests that it could handle many more memory-intensive MySQL database transactions per second than Intel's previous generation of solid-state drive, said SSD storage solutions architect Ken LeTourneau in a post on Intel's IT Peer Network blog. "What stood out to me most wasn't the advantage in the number of transactions that the Intel SSD DC P4800X could support relative to the Intel SSD DC P3700, but rather the Quality of Service (QoS) it provided as the number of threads increased," LeTourneau said. "If one were to impose a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of a 10ms response time for 99% of all transactions, the Intel SSD DC P3700 is already out of SLA at just 4 threads, while the Intel SSD DC P4800X is still within SLA at 64 threads." By improving both fast caching and storage, the new Optane series enables data centers to increase scale per server and reduce transaction costs for latency-sensitive workloads, according to Intel. It also allows users to deploy "bigger and more affordable datasets to gain new insights from large memory pools," the company added. Support for AI and Machine Learning Applications The latest Optane series can help data centers deliver new solutions in cloud computing and other cutting-edge service areas. By providing more -- and more cost-effective -- memory, the latest SSD can enable applications driven by artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as faster trading and better medical insights, Intel said. The Optane SSD DC P4800X Series has a capacity of 375 GB and can handle 30 drive writes with 12.3 petabytes written per day, according to Intel's specifications for the technology. The drive series is available now for $1,520 through an early ship program. Intel plans to release additional capacities and form factors in the second half of 2017. Those are expected to include capacities of 750 GB and 1.5 TB.

Symantec Warns of Risks in the Cloud Next Article > IBM Updates Its 'Connections' Enterprise Social Network By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MARCH 13 2017 Big Blue wants to put its enterprise social network platform to work with a new set of features designed to make it easier for employees to collaborate with each other. The latest version of the platform, IBM Connections, set to be released March 28, will also feature tools to help onboard new employees. The updated IBM Connections also integrates with IBM Cloud Object Storage, providing companies the ability to scale their storage needs with their employees' usage while improving storage costs, the company said. Business Social Network IBM described the platform as a business social network that accelerates and encourages innovation within enterprises by making it easier for employees to share knowledge between themselves. "Connections can help you improve decision-making, increase productivity and accelerate time to market on a platform that is delivered on premises or as software as a service on IBM Cloud," the company said on the Connections Web page. The latest version of the platform, IBM Connections 6.0, has been redesigned with an eye toward highlighting the most useful content from an employee's social network thanks to a new feature called Orient Me, the company said in a statement. Orient Me sports a new containerized, API-driven architecture to bring the most relevant information to a user's attention. In addition, Big Blue said the new version of Connections will include a "Touchpoint" experience for new users. Touchpoint aims to make it easier for new employees to get up to speed in their new positions by offering them an easy login procedure as well as the ability to follow their colleagues' activities and join communities to begin working more efficiently. The company said it also makes community management easier for network administrators by copying designs from existing communities. "As employees evolve how they communicate and what media they use, file distribution services need to evolve with the workforce," IBM said in a statement. "IBM Connections provides a simple to use interface and desktop sync for easy access to files. By providing large file uploads, rich text editor, new preview/editing features in File Viewer and search improvements, users can find and collaborate on files in an environment employees expect." New Social Analytics Tools The new update will also include tools to allow enterprises to leverage high-powered analytics across various channels on their employees' digital networks, including blogs, wikis and activity streams. It will also allow employees to connect with each other and collaborate on work products through a single interface, the company said. "As data is exploding, companies are realizing it is critical to capture, store and analyze it efficiently for their current -- and future -- employees,” the company said. “IBM Cloud Object Storage delivers a solution for IBM Connections that stores ever-increasing workloads of social data and allows companies easy access to that information for analytics and new learning."

The solution, IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization, is optimized for technology from Intel and HyTrust to simplify reporting demands for organizations in highly regulated industries and provide hardware-enhanced workload security. IBM deploys an immune system-like approach to security – with data analytics and Watson for CyberSecurity helping clients to discover, manage and remediate threats across the entire enterprise. IBM is providing a security-rich cloud computing environment for customers by incorporating its own security technologies with capabilities from partners Intel and HyTrust. Data security is a primary concern for enterprises considering hybrid cloud adoption – particularly in highly regulated industries such as financial services, healthcare and government. According to Technology Business Research, more than 40 percent of enterprises surveyed cite security as the most important factor in the hybrid cloud decision process[1]. IBM Cloud designed this new offering to assist clients with security concerns and compliance reporting readiness. IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization is a unique collaboration that automates the deployment of Intel® Xeon® processor-based servers with Intel® Trusted Execution Technology (Intel® TXT) and HyTrust CloudControl, DataControl and BoundaryControl software on IBM Cloud infrastructure. The solution runs on VMware Cloud Foundation on IBM Cloud, taking advantage of the infrastructure automation jointly developed by IBM and VMware. This advanced automation supports deployment and integration of Intel and HyTrust technologies with the unified SDDC platform from VMware so IBM clients can continue to use familiar tools to manage their workloads without having to retool or refactor applications. This agility allows a client to go from months to days to deploy a security-rich cloud environment with reporting readiness capabilities that can assist with regulatory requirements. Specifically geared toward clients in highly regulated industries, IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization is designed to give enterprises control over where their data is located to address performance, security or data privacy needs. With IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization, clients may benefit from: Continuous monitoring and real-time reporting to help address regulatory readiness and reporting for industry compliance standards such as PCI 3.0, HIPAA and FISMA, among others. Geo-fencing at the hardware level for more control over where data can and cannot be moved.  More granular access controls to help reduce operational risk and configuration errors. “With the rapid proliferation of data, cloud is becoming the platform enterprises turn to for innovation, but security and compliance concerns remain top of mind,” said John Considine, general manager for cloud infrastructure at IBM. “IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization can help facilitate cloud adoption and provide enterprises with an automated and security-rich cloud infrastructure to invigorate business innovation and growth.” “Data centers and the cloud have a dramatic impact on businesses and consumers by enabling new and improved services around the globe,” said Raejeanne Skillern, vice president data center group and general manager of the CSP platform group at Intel. “Our collaboration with IBM delivers new and more secure cloud services based on Intel technologies enabled in the IBM cloud infrastructure. IBM’s services ensure workloads run and data encrypts on trusted servers in approved locations.” “Customers demand the highest levels of security, scale and availability for mission critical workloads in the cloud,” said Eric Chiu, founder and president at HyTrust. “We are excited to collaborate with IBM on this unique cloud-based solution, leveraging HyTrust workload security solutions, to help automate compliance controls and security in the cloud.” To learn more about IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization, please visit: https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/products/secure-virtualization.

In Windows 10 you're at the mercy of Microsoft's schedule, unless you know hidden settings and tweaks. We'll help you keep Windows Update under control. Read More * entirely: Buy a computer with the latest Intel, AMD, or Qualcomm processor and install Windows 7 or 8.1. Now Windows Update will no longer work, courtesy of Microsoft. At least that’s the plan, according to a Knowledge Base article released this month. While this hard block of Windows Update does not seem to be in effect yet, it could have dire consequences. What if you wanted to avoid Windows 10 by installing an old copy of Windows 7 on your new machine? Whatever your reason for wanting to stay with an older Windows version, you’ll want to receive security-related patches! Let us show you a workaround for installing updates on Windows 7 and 8.1, regardless of your CPU. *We don’t seriously recommend disabling Windows Update! Although Windows Update can be a pain, we strongly recommend keeping Windows updated! The Problem: Windows Support Linked to Hardware Microsoft will support Windows 7 and 8.1 with updates until 2020 and 2023, respectively. However, as of last year, Windows support is limited to certain processor (aka silicon) generations Why Windows 7 Won't Work On Intel's Current & Next Gen CPUs Why Windows 7 Won't Work On Intel's Current & Next Gen CPUs Microsoft doesn't want you to use old Windows versions on new hardware. Users on Intel Skylake processors won't receive updates for Windows 7 after July 2017. And next generation processors will be Windows 10 only. Read More . Specifically, Intel Kaby Lake, Qualcomm 8996, AMD Bristol Ridge, or newer processor generations will receive support for Windows 10 only. Note that you can still install Windows 7 and 8.1 on those processors! However, when you try to run Windows Update you might soon see an error like this: Unsupported Hardware Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates. You might also run into this error: Windows could not search for new updates An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error. To some readers, this may sound like good news, particularly following the latest Windows Update redesign to monthly rollups Windows 7 and 8.1 Now Update Like Windows 10 Windows 7 and 8.1 Now Update Like Windows 10 Your next Windows 7 and 8.1 Update will work a lot like Windows 10. Microsoft will roll all updates for the month into a single update package. It's all or nothing. Let us explain what... Read More . However, an unpatched computer is a disaster waiting to happen. The fix Microsoft proposes obviously is to upgrade to Windows 10 You Can Still Upgrade to Windows 10 for Free (With a Loophole) You Can Still Upgrade to Windows 10 for Free (With a Loophole) If you missed the deadline for the free Windows 10 upgrade, you're in luck because there's still another method you can use -- as long as your conscience allows you to do so. Read More , which you can still do for free using a loophole. But what can you do if you can’t get yourself to upgrade to Windows 10? Maybe one of the following solutions will work for you. Solution 1: Manually Install Updates Microsoft maintains an online library of Windows updates called the Microsoft Update Catalog. While the catalog was set up to support the distribution of updates across corporate networks, home users can use it too. Search for your Windows version, sort the results by Last Updated, then download the latest Update Rollups or Security Updates and install the respective package on your system. When you click the Download button, a pop-up window will open from where you can download individual EXE, CAB (driver), or MSU (Microsoft Update) files. Open and run these files to apply the respective updates. If you choose this option, you’ll suddenly appreciate that all Windows updates are now rolled into a single package. The drawback of this method, however, is that you have to remember to check for updates once a month and do it all manually. Solution 2: Install Updates with WSUS Offline Rather than manually browsing the Microsoft Update Catalog and gathering updates, we recommend using WSUS Offline. This portable open source tool allows you to update any Windows computer, even when it’s offline. WSUS Offline downloads selected updates from Microsoft servers and it allows you to deploy them to multiple systems. Step 1: Download Updates Go ahead and download the most recent version, extract the ZIP file, and run the UpdateGenerator.exe. Next, select which updates you would like to download; for example, Windows 7 x86 for your 32-bit Windows 7 system or Windows 8.1 x64 for your 64-bit Windows 8.1 installation. Under Options, you can choose to download security only updates rather than full rollups. To burn the updates to CD / DVD or add them to your Windows installer, choose Create ISO image(s)… and check the appropriate option. If you’d like to transfer the updates to multiple machines, select USB medium > Copy updates for selected products into directory… If you select nothing, WSUS Offline will save the updates locally in the client folder. Finally, click Start to initiate the download. This will open a command window where you can follow the current status. This can take a long while. Step 2: Install Updates To install the downloaded updates, open UpdateInstaller.exe (find it in the folder wsusoffline > client) on the target PC and check the relevant options under Installation. Also, check Control > Automatic reboot and recall. This option allows the Installer to go through all the motions of installing updates using a temporary user account. To do this, it will temporarily disable the User Account Control (UAC) so that it can proceed without user input. WSUS Offline doesn’t offer an easy way to automate the entire process. However, you can use the Windows Task Scheduler 7 Nerdy Things You Can Automate with the Windows Task Scheduler 7 Nerdy Things You Can Automate with the Windows Task Scheduler The Windows Task Scheduler can automate almost anything. If you can make it happen in a command line or a Windows script, you can schedule it with the Task Scheduler. Let us demonstrate. Read More to launch the Generator a day after Patch Tuesday, followed by the Installer on the next day. Patch Tuesday occurs on the second and, sometimes, the fourth Tuesday of the month. Update Windows on Your Own Terms Should enough (Enterprise) users stick to Windows 7 and 8.1, Microsoft might still backtrack on its decision and extend support for new processors. In the meantime, you don’t have to let them ruin the show for you. Install Windows on whatever hardware you please and update it manually. If all else fails, you could still bite the bullet and switch to Linux. However, you might find that the same hardware that blocks Windows Update for older Windows versions won’t even let you install some versions of Linux Will Linux No Longer Work on Future Windows 10 Hardware? Will Linux No Longer Work on Future Windows 10 Hardware? Secure Boot can prevent some Linux distros from booting. On upcoming Windows 10 devices, manufacturers may remove the option to turn off Secure Boot. This will affect Linux Mint and several other popular distros. Read More . It looks like Microsoft really thought this through. Would you rather upgrade to Windows 10 or continue using old hardware? What options are you considering? Let’s hear in the comments!

The last time I checked their site, they were still considering their support for it. Reply Tina Sieber March 22, 2017 at 9:33 am Yeah, the software received an update earlier this year. Reply Nick March 21, 2017 at 4:35 pm This is total BS. I work in IT for a living. Do not let this article scare you. Windows 7 updates are working just fine. This is a scare tactic that Microsoft is using to get people to switch to 10. You windows 7 pc is supported until January of 2020. Reply Tina Sieber March 21, 2017 at 5:02 pm Microsoft's plan is to not support Windows 7 on new hardware by disabling Windows Update. Extended support will continue until 2020 on old hardware. And -- as the article above states -- the Windows Update block hinted to in the KB entry has not yet come into effect. Reply William Fitchard March 20, 2017 at 6:23 pm I'm running Win7 which was upgraded from Vista which was upgraded from XP. {Yes I know.... an old machine but it still runs great!) I had called Microsoft support and wad told that since the basic platform is XP, I cannot upgrade to 10. So as long as I can continue to receive and install updates, I will be running this machine until it dies! Reply Brigid Caomanaig March 21, 2017 at 2:18 am I upgraded from windows 8 to windows 10, Microsoft decided it was the thing to do....things went well for a while, and then the nightmare began, forced updates are not my cup of tea, lucky for me, my loved one gave me a MacBook Pro for Christmas, problem solved. I'm sooo happy! Reply Tina Sieber March 21, 2017 at 11:53 am Glad to hear you're enjoying your MacBook! Sounds like it was easy to adapt coming from Windows. Is there anything you miss? And what do you like most? Reply Tina Sieber March 21, 2017 at 11:55 am William, did you try the free Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7? Did it not work? Or did Windows not offer you to upgrade in the first place? Microsoft will support Windows 7 until 2020. If your machine still works then, you can always install Linux for free and it might run even better than with Windows 7. Reply William Fitchard March 21, 2017 at 3:19 pm Before attempting to upgrade to win10, I called Microsoft tech support and was told that there would be performance/compatibility issues. Even though I'm running win7, its on XP infrastructure. That's the problem. I know 7 will be supported till 2020. I'm sure I'll be replacing my computer before then! Reply Tina Sieber March 21, 2017 at 3:22 pm Yeah, that makes sense. Depending on your hardware, performance could be an issue or driver support. Thank you for sharing!

Developed with Micron, 3D XPoint memory is a new memory technology that can reach speeds up to 1000 times faster than the NAND memory we have all come to love, while also being 10 times denser. Those are definitely desirable characteristics and Intel has finally announced its Optane SSDs, which are targeting data centers first. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X Series is a 375 GB drive that can be used to increase the storage capacity of a server while also providing consistently high performance at a latency of less than 10 microseconds. Combined with Intel Memory Drive Technology, the drive will act like DRAM to the system, significantly increasing the amount of available memory to operating system and applications. If you happen to be part of Intel's early ship program, the Optane SSD DC 4800X Series is now available to you, so you can start upgrading your data centers. Additional capacities and form factors are to be available in the second half of this year. Hopefully it will not be too long before this can start reaching consumer computers.

The SSD takes advantage of Intel's 3D XPoint technology, which is reportedly 1,000 times faster than NAND and comprising of a higher density than DRAM memory. The new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X Series, which optionally comes bundled with Intel Memory Drive Technology, provides 375GB of fast storage and caching tier functionality. By installing the DC P4800X as extended memory, the model creates bigger, more cost-effective memory functionality -compared to other server-side SSD memory on the market. Having previously faced delays for its 3D XPoint technology, the technology behind the Intel Optane SSD series has been in the making since July 2015. Intel has made the Optane series available through an early ship program, and is priced at $1,520. The company also reportedly has plans to introduce a U.2 form factor, a 1.5TB PCIe card and 750GB model later in the year.

VOICES Ideas and Insight From Explorers Menu Voices Home BioBlitz Cat Watch City Solutions Explorers Journal Fulbright Stories Ocean Views Voice for Elephants Water Currents Voices for Wildlife Community Rules Terms of Service Dreams of the World: Intel/Disney Drone Lightshow with Anil Nanduri, Vice President of Intel’s UAV Segment Posted by Kike Calvo of Photographer; Expert at National Geographic Expeditions on March 20, 2017 (0) More » Dreams of the World: One Dream a Time. This post is the latest in the series Dreams of the World, which profiles interesting people Kike meets during his travels.   “Bringing change to the world – when technology or a product I work on becomes a necessity or feels ubiquitous, and the journey to getting there is something I always dream of,” said Anil Nanduri, Vice President and General Manager of Intel’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Segment. Intel’s new UAV division plans to help lead the way in the expanding field of drone technology.   Nanduri’s work focuses on an advancement of Intel’s Real Sense Technlology, a combination of 2D and infrared cameras that sense the environment around them and help a drone intelligently calculate how to move and avoid obstacles. Intel is also exploring how to control many synchronized drones at once with its 100 Drones Project. Nanduri hopes that his role in the drone industry will help further the field’s enormous potential to use the forces of drone technology for good. While at Intel, Nanduri has explored chip design, platform enabling, and technical and product marketing. He was chief of staff and technical assistant to the general manager of Intel’s PC Client Group. From 2008 to 2010, Nanduri worked as head of netbook marketing at Intel, promoting netbooks through business strategy and design. Near the beginning of his work at Intel, he directed platform strategy and marketing for Intel’s next-generation mobile platform. Nanduri’s career stands as an inspiration to many in the younger generation – does he have any advice to share? “You can wait for it to happen or you can drive it to make it happen,” he said. “I have learnt through many big idea projects throughout my career – the difference between success and failure is mostly about people’s willingness to take action towards the solution. But just one person may not be enough to accomplish it; it requires a committed team to drive to success. Nanduri looks back on the moment in his career he will never forget: the success of the functional chip for the first design project that he ever worked on. The Intel 440MX chipset in 1997-98 worked on the first try. However, Nanduri also holds many moments in his personal life to be equally important. He sees the moment his daughter was born as a turning point in his life. Nanduri’s trajectory has led him to another one of his current projects: the Intel/Disney Lightshow. The show has made history as the first US lightshow powered by 300 drones. The drones carve through the air in elegant loops, forming 3-dimensional shapes that change and grow as the performance goes on. Intel Shooting Star drones are light, maneuverable, and designed for safety and ease of use. The drone fleet can create over 4 billion color combinations.   An event 100 drones took to the air over Tornesch, Germany, on the evening of Nov. 4, 2015, to create Drone 100. The elaborate marriage of music and light and flight was the result of months of effort by Intel Corp. engineers and Ars Electronica FutureLab digital artists. Their sky-filling artwork was accompanied by an orchestra on the ground and fully enabled by Intel-powered PCs. All their efforts were rewarded with a Guinness World Records citing for the “most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously.” Photo © Intel Corporation   “What we realized is that the Disney team also works with technology is many different ways and we shared very common goals on how we approach execution to a completely new technology which has risks and take the can do it attitude as a team,” said Nanduri. “It was very complementary to the skills we all had. We had experts with the drones and the technology and Disney had the animation and the park experts.” “The light show operation, the software, automation (fleet management) as well as the drone itself is all designed with safety in mind,” he added. The drone itself is very lightweight (280 gms) and has a full propeller cage around the blades for added safety. Each drone used in the light show is constantly monitored, and they follow preprogrammed safety directions, including GPS based safety fences. A pilot is always standing by to step in and manually control the drones should a problem arise. The software is designed so that the whole show can be controlled by one person. When flying 300 drones, all the software details must be automated beforehand. A team of people program the software beforehand, with the idea of an incredible light show in mind. First, the animators simulate the dimensions of the light show, and let the software help them translate it into drone programming. The end result? A breathtaking nighttime show that hopes to pave the way in the new world of drone-based entertainment.   Follow Kike Calvo on Facebook, Twitter, Web, LinkedIn or Instagram.   Recommended Readings:  . New Holiday Drone Show: 4 Billion Color Combinations will Light Up the Sky . Drones for Conservation: A Field Guide for Photographers, Researchers, Conservationists and Archaeologists.

Nat Geo Expedition: Rising Star Two years after being discovered deep in a South African cave, the 1,500 fossils excavated during the Rising Star Expedition have been identified as belonging to a previously unknown early human relative that National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Lee Berger and team have named Homo naledi. With at least 15 individuals of all ages and both sexes represented, the find adds an unprecedented amount of information to our understanding of early human evolution in Africa. In addition, the absence of any other animal remains or large debris in the fossil chamber strongly suggests that these non-human beings intentionally deposited their dead within this cave.

While MBLY shot up 28% after it was announced that the company will be bought out for $63.54 a share, INTC stock fell 2% and closed below its 200-day moving average for the time since last June. Prior to Monday’s breakdown, Intel stock had been consolidating in a trading range with the 200-day (the red line) acting as support and the 50-day average (the blue line) as resistance. The breach of support came on double the average volume, which is a bearish sign that highlights the large number of sellers. Was Mobileye a Good Buy? The consensus on the Street is that Intel paid too much for Mobileye. That ultimately will be determined years from now, but what I found interesting was the fact that an Intel executive came out and highlighted the amount of data the company will be able to gather as a direct result of the acquisition. Think about it: Mobileye is a key player in the autonomous automobile industry, making the chips that are used in driverless and semi-autonomous vehicles. And all those chips control the sensors that map the road. The information that Intel will now be able to accumulate has the potential to be worth much more than the $15.3 billion it paid in the transaction. There has been a flurry of analyst moves since last Monday’s news, and Wednesday morning Credit Suisse jumped on the bandwagon, downgrading INTC stock to “Neutral” from “Outperform.” What’s interesting here, though, is that the Mobileye purchase was actually applauded. The downgrade was based on Intel being expensive. 10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash I don’t share that mindset, but I also do not see INTC stock as an overly attractive investment from a fundamental view right now. Its earnings growth is slowing, and the company needs to find more catalysts to boost its bottom line. Bottom Line on INTC Stock Perhaps the Mobileye acquisition is a step in the right direction. I like the potential that Intel’s 3% dividend yield represents, but I wouldn’t be a buyer just yet. If INTC stock weakens further but is able to hold price support near $33.50 in the coming weeks, I might consider opening a position in the $33.50-$34.50 area based on a combination of the acquisition and the potential within the chip sector.

First announced in mid-2015, 3D Xpoint is a joint effort between Intel and Micron. It was claimed to be a whole new class of solid-state storage, offering blazing fast speeds and far superior reliability to the flash memory used in mainstream SSDs. The new Optane SSD DC 4800X is a 375GB SSD in a PCIe card form factor. It will be available in limited quantities, priced at $1,520 (approximately Rs. 99,384). Higher capacity models as well as U.2 form factor variants will follow later this year. The Optane SSD DC 4800X is targeted at workloads which benefit from extremely low latency and high responsiveness under load. Intel says the drive can achieve speeds of 2GBps even at low queue depths, whereas flash-based SSDs only work their best with a queue depth of 32 or more. Moreover, a high volume of random writes and reads simultaneously without compromising each other, with latency remaining low even under extreme load. Endurance is rated at 30 drive-writes per day, or 12.3 total Petabytes written. Along with this hardware, Intel has announced its Intel Memory Drive technology, which makes the Optane SSD DC 4800X drive appear to the operating system as RAM, rather than storage space. This allows a system to address far more memory than it is architected to support, with only slightly higher latency. Memory Drive manages this combined storage pool and allocates data to the physical RAM or Optane SSD automatically and transparently. Intel claims that this capability means that giant data sets such as those used for machine learning, scientific simulations and big data analytics can be stored entirely within the low-latency memory pool for lightning-fast access. It also reduces costs compared to an equivalent amount of RAM. When not used for that purpose, the Optane SSD becomes a new tier in the memory structure, between extremely fast RAM and non-volatile storage. Each individual byte of 3D Xpoint memory can be addressed independently, as opposed to structures comprised of pages and blocks Intel's products based on 3D Xpoint will be branded "Optane", while Micron will be able to launch its own products under different branding. Intel has talked about Optane products that would fit into motherboards' RAM slots and use the much faster native memory bus. Intel has also said that this year, it will offer low-capacity 16GB and 32GB consumer SSDs that can be used to quickly flush and restore a PC's RAM when it goes to sleep and wakes up, eliminating the need for RAM to consume power. Intel's Kaby Lake consumer platform, launched this year, supports future Optane memory and storage products. However, in-depth specifics of how the technology works have still not been disclosed.

For all the noise made around the deal — the largest ever cross-border sale of an Israeli tech firm — experts say only a small fraction of the sale sum will end up going into state coffers. Because Mobileye was not a privately held Israeli company, but a publicly traded company whose shares are now held mostly by international funds and institutional investors — the Israeli founders, initial investors and employees of the firm hold an estimated 25 percent stake — analysts believe that Israel will likely only see about $1 billion in tax money from the sale, and that may be an optimistic assessment. The Israeli tax authority declined to disclose an official figure due to privacy issues, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said by email. Professor Avi Simhon, the head of the National Economic Council, said in an interview to Israel Radio that the country is expected to gain some NIS 3 billion ($830 million) in taxes from the deal this year, and in the longer term the revenues will reach some NIS 10 billion, he said. To calculate the amount of taxes to be collected, many things need to be taken into account, including which owners have Israeli citizenship, the employees’ options, the capital gains they made, and whether the company is subject to special tax incentives in Israel. Amnon Shashua, co-founder and chairman of Mobileye, arrives at a Mobileye and Intel Workers Conference in Jerusalem, March 14, 2017. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) Yaniv Pagot, an economist and head of strategy for the Ayalon Group, an Israeli institutional investor, said that based on the assumption that some 25 percent of the shares are owned by the founders, initial investors and the employees, Israel is expected to get some $1 billion in taxes once the deal is completed. Mobileye was and for now remains a publicly traded company, at least until Intel conducts a tender to acquire the outstanding shares held by the public. In this tender, the date of which was not specified at the time of the announcement of the deal on March 13, a subsidiary of Intel will offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $15.3 billion, and a premium of 34 percent to Mobileye’s closing price before the deal was announced. A disclaimer on the Mobileye website indicates that the tender has not commenced yet. Mobileye’s Israeli founders, initial investors and its employees hold shares in the company. But the lion’s share of the deal money will go to the institutional investors and funds that were invested in the company. Based on data compiled from public filings by Bloomberg and companies like Yahoo Finance and Morningstar, the majority of these holders are US and global funds. To be fair, it should be remembered that the founders and some Israeli institutional investors have also reaped profit from the sale of stakes along the way, at the time Mobileye issued shares in its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, for example, or at its secondary share offering in 2015. What becomes evident from scrutinizing the shareholder data is that no Israeli institutional investors are listed among the major shareholders, meaning that Israeli pensioners will be largely excluded from the bonanza. That is because Mobileye, like many other tech firms, preferred to list its shares in the US and not in Tel Aviv. “We know that company founders, initial investors, employees and insiders held approximately 23-26% of the company, and that the majority of non-insider holders were institutional investors and mutual funds from outside of Israel, primarily US and global index investors, and active investors,” said Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar indexes, a financial firm that has developed indices and exchange traded funds (ETFs) with a focus on the Israeli capital markets. “The only clear-cut losers from this massive Mobileye deal are Israeli institutional investors, and the Israeli citizens they serve,” he said. Ziv Aviram, president and CEO of Mobileye, demonstrates the driverless car to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2R) and former US president Barack Obama (C) during an exhibition of technological innovation at the Israel Museum as Amnon Shashua (R), Mobileye‘s co-founder and chief technology officer, looks on, Jerusalem, March 21, 2013. (Kobi Gideon / GPO /FLASH90 These Israeli institutional investors use the primary indices of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange – the TA-35 and the TA-125 — as their benchmarks, and Israeli companies that are listed abroad, on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and London, are not included on these benchmarks. Mobileye, Checkpoint Software Technologies Ltd., Amdocs and Mellanox Technologies and Wix.com, for example, are not listed in Tel Aviv, and thus are not included in the local indices which are tracked by the local institutional investors. Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar indexes (Courtesy “Even though these investors can and could invest in Mobileye, they tend not to do so, or do so in very little amounts, because it is not their benchmark,” Schoenfeld said. “The risk/reward of holding a large position in a non-index stock is not worth it to pension funds and insurance managers, who are judged by how they perform relative to the TA-125 index.” Israel’s benchmark bluechip index, the TA-35 (it used to be the TA-25 until recently), includes Tower Semiconductor Ltd. a chip maker, Ormat Technologies Inc., a provider of alternative and renewable energy technology, Nice Systems Ltd., a software developer, and Elbit Systems Ltd. a defense systems manufacturer. The TA-125 index has companies such as AudioCodes, a maker of data networking products, Compugen, a drug discovery company, and medical device maker Mazor Robotics. But a big chunk of the Israeli technology firms are simply not on the exchange, and as a consequence not tracked by the Israeli institutional investors via the benchmark indices. “Had Mobileye shares been traded in Israel, they would have been included in the indices and then Israeli institutions would have held the shares because it is in the index,” said Ayalon’s Pagot. “Israeli pensioners are at the sidelines of this deal.” Pagot attributed the lack of prominence of the Israeli institutional investors in the stock to its price. “The company was trading at 100 times its reported earnings and 30 times its income, and that is not the kind of stock a portfolio manager goes for,” said Yaniv Pagot, chief strategist for Ayalon Investment House, an institutional investor. “The company was trading at a very high price, something that a strategic investor like Intel is ready to pay for and not so much a financial investor.” Israeli tech companies have spurned the local stock exchange and opted for offering their shares on the Nasdaq or NYSE to be closer to their markets, get higher valuations, and avoid what they see as burdensome local regulation. Mellanox Technologies Ltd., whose shares are listed on the Nasdaq, delisted from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2013, citing regulation as one of the reasons. At the end of 2016 there were 73 Israeli companies listed on the Nasdaq, according to data provided by the Bank of Israel. In addition, a 2014 report commissioned by the Israel Securities Authority to promote investment in publicly traded tech companies showed that Israeli institutional investors shy away from investing in technology shares because such shares are perceived as being more risky, investors often lack the expertise to understand the technologies involved, and tech companies are relatively small and don’t offer the liquidity these investors require. BMW, Intel, Mobileye announce cooperation for a driverless car, July 2016 (Courtesy) The Marker reported that Menora Mivtachim Holdings Ltd., one of Israel’s five largest insurance and finance groups and an institutional investor, held some 941,000 shares in Mobileye at a value of some $60 million at the time of the sale, with the other funds holding just a few million dollars’ worth of shares in the firm. “Israeli institutional investors can and are allowed to invest directly in technology shares like Mobileye and they have invested there in the past,” Moshe Bareket, a senior adviser to the US investment bank Jefferies, said in a phone interview. But these investors shy away from investing in stocks that are not included in the benchmark index. If they invest in a stock outside of the benchmark and if it performs badly, that is something they could get criticized for, he said. “There is a negative incentive not to invest,” he said. Bareket is a board member of and former chairman of Phoenix, and a former senior regulator at the Israeli Securities Authority. The lack of tech companies on its exchange, and the steady decline of Israeli companies choosing to go public, has prompted the Israel Securities Authority and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to spur efforts to ease regulations to encourage small and medium Israeli tech companies to list their shares with it. It has also started a project in which it provides investors with analysis about tech firms, to bridge the knowledge gap. Leonard Rosen, the chief executive officer of Barclays Plc in Israel, said in a phone interview that listing shares abroad for a company like Mobileye is essential for it “to be able to get access to the largest pool of capital in the world and to reach the widest group of investors.” Barclays was a bookrunner for Mobileye’s initial public offering of shares in 2014 and also its secondary offering in 2015. A bookrunner is usually the main underwriter or lead-manager in a securities offering. “If we want people to make investments in Israel they need to know that they can get a good return on their investment,” Rosen said. “It is better to be sold for $15 billion with only part of it coming into Israel, versus being sold for $1 billion, and never growing to achieve your potential, with all of it coming to Israel,” Rosen said.

While details have always been scarce on how the NAND flash competitor would perform in the real world, Intel made impressive claims about its reliability, power consumption, and performance. Today, Intel is launching its first Optane SSD, the DC P4800X. This new card has a 375GB capacity, with much lower latencies than NAND. Intel is still playing its cards close to its chest. It doesn’t want to talk about how, precisely, Optane works or what it’s made of. Still, we now know a great deal more about where Intel sees this technology fitting into the data center, as well as how much it will cost. In the old days, data was kept in-cache as much as possible, in main memory if not, and on a hard drive if there was absolutely nowhere else to put it. Hard drives were always the biggest problem with this approach; their latencies are measured in milliseconds and are orders of magnitude higher than DRAM, which is significantly worse than CPU cache. NAND flash latencies are vastly lower than hard drives, but there’s still a significant gap between NAND and DRAM. Intel’s Optane memory is meant to sit between DRAM and NAND in much the same fashion as NAND might sit between DRAM and a conventional hard drive in a modern system. Intel’s DC P4800X without its cover. Another advantage of Optane is that it offers the same performance at multiple queue depths. SSDs typically run faster the higher the queue depth, and so does Optane, but the gap isn’t nearly so large. Intel sees two main use-cases for the Optane DC P4800X, both shown below: It can be used as a fast storage and cache drive, where its primary purpose is to buffer NAND and offer higher performance, or it can be deployed as a memory replacement / extension. We’ve seen some of these approaches before that actually utilized NAND flash — and while it may seem counterintuitive to deploy NAND (which is still vastly slower than DRAM), there are workloads that simply don’t care much about access speeds. Being able to hold colossal amounts of information in memory for significantly less power can be more important than raw bandwidth. The price for the 375GB drive, while high, is scarcely stratospheric. A PCIe-based P4800X will sell for $1,520, with a 750GB drive following later this year. While that’s a lot for a conventional high-speed drive, I remember when SSDs cost more than that in terms of $ per GB. It will be extremely interesting to see how Optane performs against other SSDs in real-world workloads. Its latency is excellent, its reliability is outstanding, and if the drive performs as promised, it should offer a notable speed increase compared with PCI Express-based storage solutions.

Intel has revealed its new Optane SSD DC P4800X Series paired with its new memory drive technology to drive storage and memory architectures for the data centre. The new Intel Optane product is delivered as a unique form of storage compared to traditional storage as it significantly increase scale per server and can speed up applications. The Optane SSD DC P4800X, which can also be used as extended memory, expands the system memory pool to create bigger and more cost-effective memory to gain higher quality insights. This also enables data centres to deliver more affordable memory pools by displacing a portion of DRAM or significantly increase the size of memory pools. The solution works to integrate the drive into the memory subsystem and presents the SSD as DRAM to the OS and applications. Read more: New Intel software bolsters data centre security Also, the company’s Optane SSD DC P4800X Series is built to drive new solutions with innovative applications such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, faster trading and deeper insights into medical scans. This expands the reach of cloud computing solutions. Intel’s Optane SSDs are built to offer performance at low queue depth, with the majority of applications delivered to generate storage workloads enabling CPUs are more active and utilised. For the data centre, it allows users to perform more work with the same servers to improve TCO or expand capabilities. As the drive has been found to be responsive under any load, it is highly predictable and delivers a consistent ultra-fast service, according to Intel. The new product release comes shortly after Intel’s recent announcement of its new cryptographic isolation technology for the data centre (Intel SGX), which is delivered to enable application developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel’s Optane SSD DC P4800X Series and its SD DC P4800X with Memory Drive technology is now available for customers in an early ship program, with all additional capabilities and form factors expected to be added in the second half of 2017.   Tags artificial intelligence Homepage News List Intel Machine Learning memory Optane Previous ArticleIBM Cloud woos financial services with developer tools Next ArticleWhat is big data?

Will we see new iMacs, Mac minis, and Mac Pros? What will the iPhone 8 look like? And are there any new products we don't even know about yet? We gather the rumours and whispers about Apple and make our pedictions for the year ahead. by Martyn Casserly | 21 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents iPhones iPads iPad mini Apple Watch 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. Apple predictions for 2017: iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September Apple predictions for 2017: iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 Apple predictions for 2017: iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Watch 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also specualted on the possibilty of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also likely to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the LCD panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that.

We think September Apple predictions for 2017: Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly.

We think WWDC Apple predictions for 2017: Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October Apple predictions for 2017: 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When? We think WWDC Read more in our new iMac rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Apple predictions for 2017: Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page. To refresh your memories on what Apple included in macOS 10.12 Sierra read more here: macOS Sierra new features and release date or watch the discussion video: Apple predictions for 2017: WatchOS 4 WatchOS is developing nicely and in 2017 we expect to see the introduction of Sleep Tracking, which would further bolster the fitness focus of the Apple Watch. No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple predictions for 2017: Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Apple predictions for 2017: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. Apple predictions for 2017: But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

Image: Patryk Kosmider/Shutterstock Mapping Ireland’s vast internet of things network reveals a web of collaboration and innovation. The internet of things (IoT) has grown from distant concept to near-realisation owing to the collaboration of many moving parts. Network providers, electronics manufacturers, R&D labs, multinational corporations, start-ups, innovators and strategic advisers have each made their contribution to the act of ushering in this new age of connected devices. In Ireland alone we can see how tightly knit the IoT ecosystem is, weaving together a broad spectrum of players. From networks to infrastructure to research to software, we can see how each component interacts with the others to make integral systems such as machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the industrial internet of things (IIoT) happen. Entrepreneurs and commercial partners are collaborating with universities and research centres. Forward-looking consultancies are not only writing the reports on IoT and its impact, they’re also working with their clients to develop and implement solutions. It’s all one big interconnected IoT family on this, the ‘island of things’. Accenture Global consultancy Accenture needs to stay on top of business-transforming technology. At its recently opened multidisciplinary research and incubation hub, The Dock, the company focuses its research on artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and the internet of things, hiring widely for talent interested in developing new IoT technologies. AMBER Last year, the Advanced Materials and Bio-Engineering Research (AMBER) centre at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) won a €4.4m Horizon 2020 research contract to develop a new class of magnetic materials for electronics. Led by TCD’s Prof Plamen Stamenov, the TRANSPIRE project could lead to on-chip and chip-to-chip data links at least 100 times faster than current standards, enabling speedier data transfer for the internet of things. Analog Devices For the past 40 years, Analog Devices has been developing semiconductors – particularly within IoT – in Ireland, with a staff of 1,200. Twenty per cent of the company’s patents are filed by Ireland-based workers. In November last year, Analog acquired solid-state laser beam steering technology from Vescent Photonics for future autonomous vehicles.

Cubic Telecom Employing over 100 staff at its Dublin office, Cubic Telecom has created a global connectivity platform in all new Audi road cars. On a visit to Dublin last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella referred to the company as “a fantastic example of an Irish start-up”. Dairymaster Dairymaster brings the internet of things to dairy farms. The company is behind MooMonitor+ and Swiftflo Commander, designed to give farmers up-to-date information on herd health and milk yield. A shining light of agritech R&D, Dairymaster provided tech for a €2.3m UCD dairy research facility in Kildare. Daqri With an array of smart devices on offer, Daqri wants to create “the gateway to augmented reality”. Of particular interest is its AR helmet, which could revolutionise the IIoT world. In 2015, Daqri opened its European headquarters at Dublin’s Silicon Docks, the epicentre of Irish IoT innovation. Davra Networks Award-winning start-up Davra Networks is taking the IoT world by storm in Ireland and abroad. It has already worked with Cisco to create an end-to-end IoT platform in Texas. This year, it launched ConnecThing.io, a platform dedicated to solution providers. DCU Croke Park is not where DCU’s IoT ties end. The university runs an electronic systems course, allowing students to ‘major in IoT’. At its Ryan Academy, an accelerator supports IoT start-ups. And DCU researchers are currently working on a €4.6m cloud project that will support next-gen IoT development. Dublin City University.

IBM One of the major global players in the IoT space, through both development and investment, IBM’s fingerprints are all over the industry. Claire Penny, IoT leader for IBM, recently told Siliconrepublic.com about the potential of the Watson supercomputer in industries such as healthcare, though its true reach could prove limitless. IDA Ireland One of the greatest proponents of making Ireland the ‘island of things’ has been IDA Ireland, the country’s foreign direct investment agency. When not encouraging companies like PTC to open a new IIoT R&D centre in Dublin, it is partnering with AT&T to collaborate and develop smart cities technologies. Insight Insight is one of the biggest data analytics centres in Europe and its researchers have significantly contributed to Europe’s strategic agenda for the internet of things. With 400 researchers across health, social media analytics and smart cities, Insight has ties to several institutes and universities, including UCD, DCU, NUI Galway and Tyndall National Institute. Intel/Movidius One of Ireland’s finest companies, Movidius’ chip technology – low-powered and in demand across huge swathes of the IoT landscape – saw Intel snap it up last year. Intel is one of the top employers in the country at its Leixlip base, from where it supplies a significant proportion of the company’s 14nm chips globally. Lero Lero, also known as the Irish Software Research Centre, is an industry-focused SFI research centre based at the University of Limerick. Following a €46.4m investment last year, Lero’s scope expanded beyond pure software engineering research to a wider range of disciplines, combining its core research with targeted projects in hot sectors such as IoT, medical devices and smart cities. Limerick IT Limerick IT has recently put itself at the forefront of IoT in Ireland, with newly received planning permission for a new IoT campus at Coonagh.

Silver Spring Networks US smart energy player Silver Springs Networks has quite a presence in Mayo, last year bringing its smart city and energy efficiency programme to the town of Crossmolina. The company viewed the project as such a success that a comparable initiative began in Dundrum, Dublin, earlier this year. SmartBay Subsea Observatory Supported by the Marine Institute, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and SFI, the SmartBay Subsea Observatory is the IoT answer to the question of marine data. It collects data deep underwater using sensors, platforms and robotics and is a critical component of gathering information about the sea. SmartBay general manager Dr John Breslin.

Early last year, the company announced a $2m investment in a state-of-the-art San Diego IoT centre. Other investments in Taiwan, Germany and France give the company an international footprint. Three Three is one of Ireland’s most prolific data carriers and had the largest market share of M2M subscriptions in Q2 2016 at 50.1pc, according to ComReg. Last year, Three’s Karim Benabdallah explained the brand’s sensor-centric view of IoT. “Our approach isn’t to brand former machine-to-machine solutions using cellular SIM cards with the IoT logo, which others may look to do, but rather distinguishing a new market,” he said. TSSG TSSG, the Telecommunications Software & Systems Group at Waterford Institute of Technology, is a research centre dedicated to IoT development. The body claims to have delivered solutions to more than 210 start-ups in the past five years, with 14 spin-out companies emerging from its campus. In 2014, TSSG partnered with Tyndall to target €82m worth of EU funding for IoT start-ups. Tyndall The Tyndall National Institute, based at UCC, is one of Ireland’s leading IoT centres, with Siliconrepublic.com recently featuring 13 pioneering technology projects currently underway there. As mentioned above, Tyndall paired with TSSG to source EU funding for IoT start-ups in 2014 and, today, the centre continues to drive conversations and innovation in this space. Ulster University Ulster University is very active in the IoT space. In the past three years, it has spearheaded 20 projects, with a value exceeding £10m. Two particular areas of focus are robotics and healthcare, reflecting general industry trends. In January, the university hosted an Internet of Things Alliance event. U-blox Switzerland-headquartered U-blox invests heavily in the development of IoT products and solutions, and its facility in Cork is one of its global R&D centres. U-blox’s chips, modules and software solutions can be used to locate a device’s exact position and communicate wirelessly over mobile and short-range networks. University of Limerick University of Limerick plays a big role in Ireland’s IoT ecosystem with strong links to a number of SFI research centres investigating this sector. This summer, the university will host an Internet of Things Summer School, offering a unique opportunity for students to learn about fundamental and state-of-the-art technology from UL’s industry experts. Vodafone Beyond offering mobile and fixed data connections to Irish consumers, Vodafone also uses its networks to support IoT. ComReg reported that, in Q2 2016, Vodafone had a 43.9pc share of M2M subscriptions in Ireland and, recently, Madalina Suceveanu, CTO of Vodafone Ireland, said, “IoT is a key component of the Gigabit Society and 5G.” VT Networks Supported by Enterprise Ireland’s New Frontiers programme, VT Networks successfully raised €1.2m last year to roll out Ireland’s first IoT network. Using Sigfox technology, the nationwide network went live in June 2016 and aims to connect 1m devices by the end of this year. Co-founder Mark Bannon believes that the future of IoT lies in creating products with zero battery consumption, noting specific potential with sensors in the agricultural sector. Wia Wia, led by Conall Laverty, is an NDRC-based IoT start-up that originated in Belfast, and aims to provide makers with a platform to bring home and school projects to life. Targeting both consumers and businesses, Wia’s SDK provides an interface between a hardware device and its real-time service. With just a few lines of code, a developer can create a production-ready product, as well as a complementary mobile app. Want stories like this and more direct to your inbox?

They just need to join the dots. I have a tendency to repeat myself, especially on stage at conferences. A lot of the time, while I try to illustrate why I believe this little powerhouse of a country I call home has industrial prowess, I breathlessly intone how, when Intel came to Ireland in 1989 ,it set up in a little office within a car showroom on the Long Mile Road. Six years later, in the mid-90s, when the PC revolution was in full steam, half the Pentium processors in the world came out of Leixlip, Co Kildare. ‘As manufacturing moves towards the internet of things, it is crucial that we have access to graduates who are trained in state-of-the-art facilities’ – DENIS DOYLE The last time I trotted out this worthy allegory for how Ireland could succeed in the next industrial revolution was at a Tyndall Technology Days event in Croke Park last October. Afterwards, off stage, I had one ear on what one person was saying to me while scanning the room for where the coffee might be found. Suddenly, out of the throng emerged Eamonn Sinnott, country manager for Intel Ireland’s 4,000-strong manufacturing operation. “You may need to update your figures, John,” Sinnott said, smiling. “We now make half of the world’s supply of 14-nanometre processors.” This is significant. It puts Ireland at the bleeding edge of sophistication when it comes to making chips for the cloud – but also the internet of things – and secures the chip plant’s future for a long time to come. The Intel story reminded me of the occasion back in the 1990s when IBM brought a call centre investment to Mulhuddart, which was soon followed by manufacturing and more. After decades as a sales outpost, then-country manager William Burgess had higher ambitions and was intent on bringing further investment into Ireland. At the opening of the call centre, someone among the assembled press and dignitaries made a dry remark about call centre jobs not being very high-end. Burgess remarked back that this would only be the beginning. He was right. Today, IBM employs over 3,000 people across a vast tech campus in west Dublin that is engaged in a variety of very high-end activities from R&D to cloud, software, analytics, design, internet of things and cognitive computing. The examples of IBM and Intel are a testimony to the ambitions of talented local management who see beyond the horizon and the limitations, and think big. Are we ready for the next industrial revolution? You betcha! The machines age, or the internet of things age, is being characterised as the next industrial revolution, or Industrial Revolution 4.0. It will take all the sophistication of our smartphones and personal computers, matched with a tapestry of sensors joined together by wireless networks, data centres and the cloud. It will mean data gathering at a pace never seen before and the crunching of that data in real-time. For historical and economic reasons, Ireland definitely missed out on the first industrial revolution and narrowly saw some of the tracks laid for the steam age. But when it comes to the age of sensors and robots, will we have an edge? The economic quagmire of post-empire Ireland saw several decades of talent waste until the economic and educational policies of Lemass and TK Whitaker turned the Irish from the flotsam and jetsam lost on the tides of the world into a vibrant raw material that would finally bring the gold home. This time around, the visionaries won’t be just local managers of multinationals, they will be entrepreneurs and academics who see an opportunity to steal a march on the march of the machines. The island of things The reason I believe a small country like Ireland could bound ahead in the internet of things (IoT) revolution – and associate revolutions in the form of artificial intelligence and machine learning – is because I have already seen the evidence. The industrial revolution 4.0, as it pertains to Ireland, won’t be just a multinational job creation movement, it will be an indigenous effort too. And, as PCH founder Liam Casey famously remarked, in this new industrial revolution “geography will be history”. PCH is integral to the design and delivery of the high-end smart devices consumers crave globally, while IBM, HP, SAP, Vodafone, Analog Devices, Intel, Qualcomm, SAS, EMC and many others are working on IoT in Ireland. Dublin-headquartered Cubic Telecom is behind the technology powering the wireless hotspots in the newest Audi vehicles and has attracted an €18m co-investment from the German car giant and Qualcomm. Last year, DecaWave revealed that it now has 1m installations of its internet of things chips, which are capable of finding anything to within 10 centimetres. The metaphor of Pentium is no accident, and Irish company Movidius has developed a chip technology that will, in effect, be the Pentium of the machine age, capable of machine-learning and doing things like enabling smartphones to sense the dimensions of a room. It was no accident, therefore, that Intel acquired Movidius last year for a rumoured $300m. Ireland was also recently selected as the latest location for an Intel internet of things Innovation & Development Ignition Lab, where Intel will collaborate with local companies to develop technologies for the IoT marketplace. Dairymaster, a Kerry company investing big time in agritech R&D, utilises sensors, accelerometers and GPS to good effect, with genuinely innovative devices that help with the complex nature of farming. There is also the $2m investment by Taoglas in an IoT centre in San Diego. The Wexford company’s IoTx Centre is the first facility of its kind in North America. Taoglas, which develops antenna technologies for IoT, actually makes an annual turnover of around €32m and has ploughed its profits back into the company. On the research front, academic and industrial collaborations facilitated by groups like Tyndall, Amber, CRANN, Insight, Connect, Adapt and TSSG have put Ireland on the world stage for IoT-related breakthroughs. In Cork and Waterford, research institutes Tyndall and TSSG have signed a memorandum of understanding to draw down €82m from the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme to fund 10 IoT start-ups. Both bodies are also leading the charge on collaboration in fields like smart agriculture, where IoT sensors and smart grids could transform what is still Ireland’s biggest industry. In recent weeks, we reported how Artomatix, a Dublin-based artificial intelligence company founded by Trinity PhD graduate Eric Risser, raised €2.1m in a seed round. The Mayo town of Crossmolina is going to be the first town in Ireland to roll out a smart lighting system. US tech firm Silver Spring Networks, whose technology manages 23.6m devices in cities across the world, has deployed an IoT network canopy for Mayo County Council for smart street lighting, and a residential energy-efficiency project for the council, with the project being funded in part by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Last year, VT Networks completed the rollout of a nationwide Sigfox network across Ireland. Large mobile operators like Vodafone and Three are also spearheading a lot of the action on the machines age front. Two years ago, Vodafone embarked on a €2m industrial IoT venture with Dell-owned EMC in Cork. Vodafone Ireland CTO Madalina Succeveanu recently revealed that Ireland will be one of the first countries where the telecoms giant will trial NB-IoT, the wireless standard mobile operators are backing for the IoT world. Currently, around 12pc of mobile connections in Ireland are machine-to-machine (M2M). Three is responsible for 50.1pc of that figure, according to recent ComReg figures. Three’s CTO David Hennessy told Siliconrepublic.com that NB-IoT will also be arriving on its networks in Ireland. “We have a big 4G network and the intention will be to provide NB-IoT on that in the next 18 months,” he said. A meeting of minds and machines The new Coonagh campus in Limerick will be an IoT powerhouse. Image: Limerick IT While all of this activity is positive, there are still barriers to entry when it comes to accessing talent and bringing indigenous companies into the fold as a hyper-connected, data-centric world becomes a reality. The key here is education. While Ireland slowly brings coding onto its second-level curriculum, new ideas and new approaches will also be required at third level. Hybrid degrees that bridge business, software, hardware and logistics will need to be formulated. The entire approach to traditional areas like supply chain management (SCM), for example, will need to be re-imagined, with academic qualifications that take SCM from the clipboard in a warehouse to orchestrating the movement of goods at a global level. Computer science, for too long focused solely on software, will need to be repurposed and brought back to its traditional foundations in hardware and electrical engineering. TSSG at Waterford Institute of Technology is already on the case on this one, and has devised the world’s first internet of things degree designed specifically for computer science students. In December, Limerick Institute of Technology got the go-ahead for a €14m campus at Coonagh, which will be an IoT engineering and manufacturing centre of excellence. “As manufacturing moves towards the internet of things, it is crucial that we have access to graduates who are trained in state-of-the-art facilities,” said Denis Doyle, vice-president and general manager in charge of US and Ireland manufacturing operations at ‎Analog Devices. It is clear that Ireland has all the moving parts, bright and ambitious executives, and a track record that belies the country’s scale on the global stage. Just as Liam Casey said that geography is history, Ireland can nimbly navigate the issues of scale and become a world leader in the machine age. All it takes is ambition, imagination and hard work.

The technology comprises a transistor-less cross point architecture, hence the name. This creates a 3D checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. This means that the data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to faster and more efficient read/write processes. Intel's first 3D XPoint product, the Optane DC P4800X SSD, is aimed at the data centre, with the firm claiming that it fills a gap created by costly DRAM and lacking NAND performance.  According to Intel, the P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than leading SSDs at low queue depths, making it "ideal for critical applications with aggressive latency requirements." What's more, the company says that it will allow for 2GB/s random read and write speeds, and terms of pure throughput, Intel says the drive is roughly three times as fast as its DC P3700 drive - an NVMe drive capable of delivering 2,800MB/s sequential read and 2,000MB/s sequential write speeds. Intel's Optane SSD, which the firm claims will be particularly useful for analytics and machine learning, also offers improved QoS scales transactions, resulting in up to 10x more transactions per second at same service, or up to 91 per cent lower cost per transaction.  The P400X, which will initially clock in at 375GB via a PCIe card of U.2 drive, will consume 12-14 watts under a heavy load, which is slightly more power-efficient than competing high-end NAND solutions. "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage," the firm said. "With an industry-leading combination of high throughput, low latency, high QoS and ultra-high endurance, this innovative solution is optimised to break through data access bottlenecks by providing a new data storage tier." The Intel Optane DC P4800X SSD is available now for $1,520, albeit in limited availability. The firm says that a 750GB PCIe model, alongside a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor, will b released in the second half of the year.   Intel also has a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 models, in the works.

The company also announced other Optane SSD variants, which would be released to the market this year.  ( Intel ) Advertisement Intel released its Optane solid state drive (SSD) in January, but the memory capacity was limited to just 32 GB. However, it has now unveiled Optane SSDs that have a much higher memory capacity. The chipmaker took the wraps off the Optane SSD DC P4800X series, as well as the Optane SSD DC P4800X series with Intel Memory Drive technology, on March 19. The company dubs them the most responsive SSDs for data centers. "Deployed as blazing fast storage or caching tier, Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X breaks the confines of traditional storage to significantly increase scale per server and accelerate applications. When deployed as extended memory, this drive expands the system memory pool, creating bigger, more cost-effective memory to gain higher quality insights," shared the company. New Optane SSD Series The first variant of the highly anticipated SSD series is the DC P4800X, which has 375 GB of storage capacity. It will retail for $1,520 from March 19, but has limited availability. The second half of the year will see the SSD become available widely. A 750 GB PCI-Express or PCI-E model is anticipated to make its way to enterprise users by Q2 2017. Per reports, Q2 will also see the arrival of a 375 GB model, which has the U.2 form factor. Moreover, a 1.5 TB PCI-E card - along with 750 GB and 1.5 TB U.2 sticks - will hit the market in H2 2017. Due to the Optane SSD's compatibility with the PCI-E or NVMe and U.2 slots, these drives are expected to run on some of AMD's 32 core Naples processors. Features Intel will supposedly also ship DRAM modules along with the SSD from 2018. However, the company has shied away from revealing when exactly these modules would hit the shelves. The Optane series has been touted as the superfast replacement to the older generation of SSDs. Intel has previously stated that these drives would be nearly eight times faster than the ordinary SSDs available in the market. Intel, along with Micron, has developed a new technology dubbed 3D Xpoint. This technology has been housed in the Optane line of products. The technology stores data by using the resistance of cells. The P4800X features low latency and possesses sequential transfer capabilities of 2,400 MBps for reading and 2,000 MBps for writing. Thanks to the low latencies, the P4800X is able to withstand high input and output loads. P4800X Vs. P3700 The P3700 was the fastest flash drive, in the context of random reading and writing data, from Intel prior to the arrival of the Optane series. Therefore, the P4800X was pitted against the three-year old SSD by Intel in a benchmark test. It was observed that in sequential tasks, the older-gen SSD performed better than the P4800X. However, when the data was recorded from a standard 4K block, it was revealed that the Optane was five to eight times faster than the P3700. Due to these test results, critics have commented that while the Optane technology shows promise, it lacks the polish found in the present flash SSDs.

The chip maker has unveiled the Optane SSD DC P4800X, a drive destined for the PCI Express or NVMe slots in servers. It only has 375GB of space, but its extremely low latency (typically under 10µs) and 2GB/s throughput means that it can serve as either a memory cache or storage. If you're involved in high-performance computing, online shopping or other categories obsessed with gobs of RAM and rapid turnaround times, this is theoretically your dream device, Engadget said. Intel also promises higher endurance than your typical SSD. The inaugural Optane model can withstand stresses normally associated with RAM, writing about 12.3 petabytes of data in its lifespan. You can get the drive right now if you're part of Intel's early shipping program, and there are promises of larger capacities (750GB and 1.5TB) and U.2 form factors coming later in 2017. Not that you're going to drop any of them into your gaming rig any time soon. The 375GB version costs a hefty $1,520 -- even if you could realistically buy one for home use, you'd get far more value out of a high-capacity conventional SSD. Optane won't be viable for mainstream PCs (outside of tiny capacities) until prices fall much, much lower, Engadget said. Related links: Engadget.

Is it memristor-based? Peter Bright (US) - Mar 20, 2017 7:45 am UTC Intel reader comments 173 Share this story Intel announced today the first Optane-branded product using its new 3D XPoint memory: the catchily named Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X. It's a 375GB SSD on a PCIe card. Initial limited availability starts today, for $1520, with broad availability in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, a 750GB PCIe model, and a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor will be released, and in the second half of the year, a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 stick, are planned. UK pricing is TBC, but don't expect much change from £1,500. Further ReadingIntel and Micron unveil 3D XPoint, a brand new memory technology 3D XPoint is a new kind of persistent solid state memory devised by Intel and Micron. Details on how the memory actually works remain scarce—it's generally believed to use some kind of change in resistance to record data—but its performance characteristics and technical capabilities make it appealing for a wide range of applications. When it was first announced in 2015, Intel claimed it would be 1,000 times faster than NAND flash, 10 times denser than DRAM, and 1,000 times better endurance than NAND, though without saying "faster at what" or "what kind of NAND" or anything like that. With the shipping product, these comparisons are now clearer, as one of Intel's slides make clear: 3D XPoint has about one thousandth the latency of NAND flash (or about ten times the latency of DRAM), and tens times the density of DRAM. Further ReadingIntel 3D XPoint SSD specs: So-so transfer speed, awesome random I/OThe raw specs for the P4800X leaked in February. To summarise: it's a datacentre-oriented part, built for applications with high read/write loads, looking for low latency. The sequential transfer rates of 2400MB/s read, 2000MB/s write, are good, but some of the fastest NAND flash can pull slightly ahead. Where the P4800X excels is its ability to sustain high I/O loads, courtesy of those low latencies. Enlarge Intel SSD manufacturers often quote huge numbers of I/O operations per second (IOPS), but there's always a footnote: the figures are typically generated with queue depths of 32, which is to say, the drive is bombarded with read or write requests (depending on what is being measured) so that there are always 32 outstanding operations. With these deep queues, NAND flash SSDs can achieve 3-400,000 IOPS. The P4800X can do 550,000 read IOPS and 500,000 write IOPS, but critically, Intel says it achieves this even at low queue depths. The spec sheet figure has a queue depth of 16, and the company says that a queue depth of about 8 tends to be about the limit seen in the real world. Moreover, Intel says that the latency of each I/O operation remains low even under heavy load. 99.999 percent of operations have a read or write latency below 60 or 100 microseconds (respectively) with a queue depth of 1, rising to 150 or 200 microseconds with a queue depth of 16. Under a comparable load, Intel's own P3700 NAND SSD can only serve 99 percent of operations with a latency below about 2,800 microseconds. Likewise, under sustained write workloads, the P4800X retains its low latency for reads, whereas the read latency of the P3700 NAND steadily deteriorates as the write bandwidth increases. This already makes the Optane drive interesting for applications like caching, but Intel is aiming at more than just that. 3D XPoint is byte addressable; that is to say, each individual byte can be overwritten. This sets it apart from NAND flash. NAND is typically arranged in pages of 512, 2048, or 4096 bytes. Pages are arranged into blocks, typically of 16, 128, 256, or 512 kilobytes. Reading and writing takes place at page granularity, but each page can only be written once. To write it again, it must first be erased, and erasure takes place not at page granularity, but at block granularity. Spinning hard disks can perform reads and writes at the granularity of a sector, typically either 512 bytes (or 512 bytes plus some extra bookkeeping space), or 4096 bytes (or 4096 plus some extra). With 3D XPoint, the reads and writes can occur on individual bytes. Enlarge Intel Unlike flash, which physically wears out due to the stress placed by erases, 3D XPoint writes are non-destructive. This gives the drives much greater endurance than NAND of a comparable density, with Intel saying that Optane SSDs can safely be written 30 times per day, compared to a typical 0.5-10 whole drive writes per day. The low latency and high endurance make Optane a good fit for applications like caching and database servers. But taking further advantage of these two properties, Intel has developed a new way of using Optane. The P4800X can be used as a regular PCIe attached SSD, but Intel has developed something it calls "Memory Drive Technology" that allows the P4800X, when used in conjunction with an appropriate chipset and processor (which means you'll have to use a Xeon processor), can be used as if it were RAM. Optane's latency and bandwidth are both worse than that of DRAM, but the density is higher, and the price substantially lower. Enlarge Intel Memory Drive Technology uses a middleware layer that boots before, and is transparent to, the operating system, and it combines regular DRAM with the SSD to make a single large pool of volatile memory. For most workloads, this will be slightly slower than if the same amount of DRAM were being used, but the cost should be substantially lower, and the power consumption modestly improved. Intel even claims that some workloads will go faster; although Optane "memory" is slower than regular RAM, the middleware layer that manages the memory can move data around so that it is closer to the processor that is using it, which can assist when using NUMA configurations. The biggest benefit may be from substantially increasing the amount of physical memory in a server: 2 socket Xeon systems can hold up to 3TB of RAM, but 24TB of Optane, and 4 socket systems support up to 12TB RAM, but 48TB Optane. This could be a huge boost for applications that need truly enormous quantities of memory. If using the PCIe bus to attach storage and then use it as memory seems a bit awkward, next year Intel plans to release Optane DIMMS.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Storage Enterprise News 7 Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB model begins to ship by Mark Tyson on 20 March 2017, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadfhv Add to My Vault: Intel announced its first market ready Optane products at the end of January, its low capacity (32GB) Cache SSDs. On Sunday the corporation released its first high capacity Optane SSD drive; the DC P4800X with 375GB of storage. According to PCWorld, this $1520 drive will be joined by a version with 750GB of storage in Q2, and a 1.5TB model in H2. Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X range is aimed at enterprises and fit in PCI-Express/NVMe and U.2 slots. Ahead of this larger capacity Optane SSD release, Intel had been hyping the storage performance of the technology as being up to 10X faster than a conventional flash SSD. It often refers to Optane as "a storage solution that behaves like system memory". In new benchmarks published (PDF) by Intel, the performance gain isn't so large or clear cut. These tests of the shipping product show that the first Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X "delivers 5-8x faster performance at low queue depth workloads, exhibiting extremely high throughput for single accesses and super low latency". Other strengths of the Optane SSD DC P4800X series are; responsiveness under load, predictably fast service (60x better than a high-endurance NAND SSD), and ultra high endurance with extended life. The above cases show that the Optane SSD DC P4800X series offers the kind of performance that is ideal for data centres and the acceleration of enterprise applications, says Intel. The drive series should enable users to increase the size of data sets to bolster 'big data' calculations. Its affordability means that Intel Optane SSDs are likely to displace some DRAM in servers. As reported by PCWorld, the new Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X 375GB model costs $1,520 and is available now. The price tags for the larger capacity members of the series, coming later in 2017, weren't divulged.

Posted by EvilCycle - Mon 20 Mar 2017 10:43 I would love one of these, but not at that price! I'm still unsure if I can even bring myself to buy an M.2 drive yet never mind this haha, I do need another SSD though as my current one is small and aging, I am probably better off just getting another standard Sata III one, as they ARE fast enough for my gaming rig at the end of the day.

I expect Optane drives for enthusiasts will be released later on… Posted by securitywyrm - Mon 20 Mar 2017 19:25 I could see the 32 gigabyte model being amazing for video games, particularly games with lots of loading screens. I imagine the difference between a HDD and SDD would be the difference between a SDD and one of these. Imagine playing Fallout 4 or Skyrim with 1/8th the loading time. Posted by uBronan - Tue 21 Mar 2017 05:09 Why would anyone want this drives.. seriously nothing for the home user. Your better off buying a pro, nvme or much cheaper a duo of (secodn hand) enterprise ssd I actually have both to be honest my main drive is the plextor PX-512m8 and i am kinda satisfied with it. As data drive i made a raid0 partition from 2 x 480 Gb samsung enterprise Mz7 series ssd and those show to be often a match to the nvme drive.. Many people expect way too much from the new nvme drives, when people would be really honest and could compare like i did most would be surprised how well the sata 3 (sata600) enterprise ssd perform yes in many cases they beat the nvme drives. Only when at some points the nvme show their muscle. I actually preffer the normal mlc-ssd over the nvme ones but they are yound so they might get better in time. Sadly plextor does not provide drivers for their product so improvements will not happen as with the samsung drives. ( could be a good thing as samsung adds spyware in their firmware ). Anyway if you use the benchmarks the nvme ofcourse win, but normal usage you really should not think the nvme is faster. Because the reality can be the absolute opposite in my experience. My other system with 2 x ocz vertex 4 - 250 Gb ssd showed they often get better performance.. I compared the samsung 961 from a friend with the plextor and then compared that ssd's again to the raid0 mlc-ssd and again showed with normal usage you hardly get any gains. So a much cheaper setup with a duo of those normal ssd does do the job faster. Even though the synthetic benchmarks show otherwise. You really do not need them, except if you run heavy modded games their you can see a huge performance gain. For instance when you play skyrim modded for 4k screen play. Then i really see faster loading. But to pay kinda triple or more the price of a comparable sized normal ssd is really not worth the money. You really are better off buying 2 ssd and put them in raid0 for near 1100 MB/s read/write speeds To compare the speed of the plextor read 2500 MB/s write showed 1400 Mb/s max and the samsung 961 gave 2900 Mb/s and 2200 Mb/s write. This ofcourse in the synthetic benchmarks.

AP Start-up nation is being starved by the state Chief scientist warns budget cuts are endangering Israeli high tech When a start-up goes public or is sold for tens of millions of dollars, the high-tech crowd loudly celebrates. And when there is a giant deal, like Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye last week, the entire country sheds a tear. But the fact of that matter is that even in Start-up Nation the great majority of start-ups quietly fail – a phenomenon that is hardly acknowledged. “Many people enter this world naively, because the discussion surrounding it is so overly positive – because this is the Start-up Nation and it’s cool and trendy,” says Adam Benayoun, a partner in the American 500 Startups venture capital fund and a former entrepreneur. “There are people who do it because they think that can build an app and after a year sell it to Facebook and make a fortune. Even start-ups that managed an exit don’t always do so at a profit to their investors, says Benayoun, who joined a conference “Don’t Believe the Hype” sponsored by TheMarker on Sunday in Tel Aviv on the high-tech industry’s tendency of oversell itself. “Often when someone sells a company he struts around the neighborhood like a peacock, saying he sold a company. He doesn’t say, ‘You should know that I didn’t earn a shekel from the sale … Few people can stand up and say ‘I’ve been doing this for 15 years and still haven’t struck it rich,’” he says. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (L), Mobileye CTO Amnon Shahua and Klaus Froehlich, member of BMW board, view BMWi Inside Future concept car in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 4, 2017.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Glorious failures do get headlines, like Shai Agassi’s Better Place (an electric car network) and Dov Moran’s Modu (a pre-iPhone smartphone), which failed after raising hundreds of millions of dollars. But most of the start-ups die quietly in a dark corner, far from the public's eye. According to figures prepared by the high-tech research firm IVC Online for TheMarker, 653 start-ups that had been in business for at least four years closed up shop in Israel in 2014 – the latest year for which there are figures – up from 630 in 2013. By comparison, the number of companies started was 1,290. While companies hasten to announce fundraising rounds and product launches, few publicize when they go out of business, which makes tracking high-tech flops much harder. But IVC estimates that the number of start-ups that close each year is about half of the number formed, so that with big increase in start-up formations comes a big increase in failures years later. Israel isn’t alone Israel, of course, is not alone in the high rate of start-up deaths: A Harvard University study in America published in 2013 estimated that of 2,000 start-ups that received venture capital funding of at least $1 million in 2004-10, three out of every four failed to earn a profit for their backers. As much as 40% of the time, investors lost everything. But the phenomenon in Israel is arguably more significant. Start-ups are a big part of the high-tech industry – a source of jobs and capital inflows – and the number of start-ups has grown, in part due to the dreams of success that giant exits like Mobileye encourage. An electric car from the failed Better Place venture recharging its batteries. Tomer Appelbaum “There is a clear and logical correlation between the number of firms that are established and those that are closed – and we’re seeing an explosion in the number of firms being established in recent years,” says Koby Simana, CEO of IVC. “Over 10-15 years, the number of active technology firms in Israel has grown. Their number doubled from 3,700 in 2006 to 7,500 in 2017." The acid test for most start-ups is whether they can pass through the seed stage when the founders are formulating their product idea and vision, and the research and development stage. According to IVC figures, about 80% of start-ups trip up during one of those two phases and close shop. Only 20% shut down during the next stage, after they have begun marketing their product. Less than 1% of companies that died had reached the so-called growth stage, when they have sales of $10 million or more, says IVC. That said, only a tiny percentage of start-ups even reach the growth stage, which explains why they account for so few of Start-up Nation’s body count. "The point of failure in most cases is first contact with the market, when you’re trying to establishing what price you can sell you product or service,” says Simana. “Very few start-ups close at the idea stage because it didn’t work or there was no interest in it. Unfortunately, this stage can last a long time, which is unfortunate because if they knew [it would fail in the market] they could shut the company quickly and save the entrepreneurs and investors a lot of grief.” A study by CB Insights, a U.S. research house focused on high-tech, said that among 101 failed start-ups it surveyed, 42% gave up the ghost because the market wasn’t interested in their product, and another 19% reported losing out to competition. Another 29% that said they had simply run out of money and 23% said they failed because they never succeeded in assembling the right team. Smaller numbers cited problems about costs or pricing, and only 17% admitted they simply had a lousy product. Swelled-head warning Simana warns entrepreneurs against getting swelled heads because they have raised capital from outside investors. While it’s true that many start-ups fail because they can’t raise capital, many that have raised tens of millions or more, like better Place, still failed. Benayoun says the positive attitude that makes a good entrepreneur can often deter him or her from owning up to failure. Koby Simana.David Bachar “Entrepreneurs learn that they should never give up, that around the corner something good is waiting, so we see people working three and four years on a product without any users or making any progress on it. Their families suffer all that time,” he says. Benayoun says that when he meets with entrepreneurs he doesn’t want to hear about how well things are going. “Even the most successful companies have problems,” he explains. “The good companies overcome them, but everyone has to cope with them. Successful entrepreneurs know how to look into the heart of the matter and say ‘there’s a problem that I have to solve.’” He says there has to be a balance, which requires entrepreneurs to address a real need or problem, not to build their business on the idea that they have a fantastic product. “I’m bothered that media has romanticized the start-up world,” says Benayoun. “Only someone who has started a company knows after several years at it how hard it is. On the other hand, if everyone talked about how hard it is, Mark Zuckerberg might not have started Facebook.” Inbal Orpaz Haaretz Contributor Inbal Orpaz Send me email alerts for new articles by Inbal Orpaz Send Close Email * Please enter your email Inbal Orpaz For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

For decades, the company has provided a number of products that power the servers and perhaps most of the internet. Now, with the impending release of AMD’s Naples server processors, Intel is now forced to up its game when it comes to server products. Intel is rumored to release its Skylake EP Xeon processor anytime soon, nevertheless, a new leak seems to give a bit of detail about the upcoming server processor. It looks like Intel fans will have an interesting week ahead of them especially when a benchmark of a rumored server CPU surfaced online. The leak actually came from Geekbench, and from what it looks like, it pertains to the Skylake EP Xeon E5 2699 v5 processor. What is interesting about the leak is that the new server processor sports a total of 32 physical cores. This is surprising news because the original architecture where the server CPU is based is reported to only have a maximum of 28 cores. It would seem that Intel has made a last-minute decision to increase the number of cores for the Xeon E5 2699 v5 in response to the AMD Naples processor. Reverse side of rumored Skylake EP Xeon E5 2699 v5 (via vr-zone.com) Another interesting tidbit about the leak is the single- and multi-core benchmark scores. From the Geekbench website, one can see that the CPU in question managed to get a single-core score of 4044. For a server CPU running at 2.1GHz base clock, this is very impressive. In addition to an impressive single-core score, the multi-core score of the CPU is also staggering. The Xeon e5 2699 v5 managed to obtain a score of 48,088 for multi-core processing. Finally, the new server processor will boast a total of six memory channels as opposed to the current standard of four. It will also have support for Cannonlake graphics as well as FPGA integration. The Intel Skylake EP server processor will be released sometime in the early second half of 2017. It is also rumored that the CPU will make an appearance during this year’s Computex event in Taiwan.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Computers Intel Introduces Optane SSD DC P4800X, It’s Fastest Solid State Drive Yet By Necta Casiple on March 20, 2017 06:00 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Intel | Intel finally unveiled the DC P4800X, the first 3D XPoint drive in its lineup based on the Optane memory technology. We’ve been hearing about Intel’s new memory technology called the 3D XPoint since July 2015. While reports stated that it would be 1,000 times faster than traditional NAND flash at the architectural level, we haven’t really seen anything since its announcement. That changes now, though, as the company finally introduced its first 3D Xpoint drive in the line-up, the DC P4800X. Intel asserts that the P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than the leading SSDs on the market, and also allows for 2GB/s random read and write speeds.  In terms of pure throughput (speed), the newly unveiled drive is about three times as fast as Intel’s traditional DC P3700 drive which according to GameSpot is a bold claim, since the latter can deliver about 2,800MB/s sequential read and 2,000MB/s sequential write speeds. The new Xpoint drive also utilizes the PCIe NMVe interface and comes with a new Optane controller. It can push up existing applications in one’s computer and uses about 12-14 watts under a heavy load. That makes it slightly more power-efficient compared to other high-end NAND solutions. The new Intel 3D Drive is bound for all work and no play However, before you get too excited about Intel’s latest SSD, there are a few things to keep in mind. For starters, the DC P4800X is not a drive for long sequential read and write sessions, which is useful in transferring large files. Intel notes that traditional high-end 3D NAND drives perform better at those particular tasks. Plus, it isn’t aimed at home users but for enterprise use. Digital Trends reports that the chipmaker promised the release of the consumer version later with larger capacities (750GB and 1.5TB) and U.2 form factors. If you have 200-series motherboards and Kaby Lake CPUs though, Intel states that you may still use the P4800X. However, the 375GB model of the SSD will run you a cool $1,520. That’s about $1000 more than the $300 a 512GB Samsung SM951 costs, so you’ll be paying quite a bit for Intel’s new chip. If that’s not a problem for you, you can get P4800X in PCIe add-in card form factor with a limited early-ship program, per Engadget. Its broad availability is yet to be announced but it should fall sometime in the second half of the year. What do you think of the new Intel 3D Drive? Is it worth the hefty price? Does it hold the potential to outpace other SSD solutions out in the market today? Voice out your thoughts in the comments section below!

Startups Games Makers Tech Games Hardware Software Features Women Blog Events How to Opinion Competitions Forum Press office Talk to us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Join us on Google+ Subscribe with RSS By Brendyn Lotz on 20th March · General · News Intel’s insanely fast 3D XPoint SSD costs almost R20 000 Solid state storage has come a long way in recent years but Intel is shaking things up with the release of its new Optane SSD DC P4800X. This SSD is designed to be a sort of midway between DRAM which is rather expensive to implement at scale and NAND which, while cheap and burgeoning with capacity just isn’t always fast enough. The P4800X then is the coming together of the best bits of these technologies built on the back of Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint technology which was announced back in 2015. This particular SSD has a capacity of 375GB and will have an initial price of $1520 (~R19 280). There are also plans to release 750GB and 1.5TB PCIe models and 375GB, 750GB and 1.5GB models with a U.2 form factor throughout 2017. Advert The initial release is limited so don’t expect to order one for your gaming PC, in fact putting this in your gaming PC would be doing it a disservice. The P4800X is primed for data center use thanks to its incredulous throughput speeds. The SSD is capable of 550 000 read input/output operations per second (IOPS) and 500 000 write IOPS according to Intel. The drive is also rather resilient as it will be used in data centers which write and rewrite swathes of data at a time. The manufacturer says the P4800X is capable of 30 daily writes per day or 12.3 petabytes. So while the likelihood of us mere mortals getting our hands on one of these drives right now might be a pipe dream but it’s exciting that this technology is out there and perhaps it will bleed into the consumer market sooner rather than later.

The technology comprises a transistor-less cross point architecture, hence the name. This creates a 3D checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. This means that the data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to faster and more efficient read/write processes. Intel's first 3D XPoint product, the Optane DC P4800X SSD, is aimed at the data centre, with the firm claiming that it fills a gap created by costly DRAM and lacking NAND performance.  According to Intel, the P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than leading SSDs at low queue depths, making it "ideal for critical applications with aggressive latency requirements." What's more, the company says that it will allow for 2GB/s random read and write speeds, and terms of pure throughput, Intel says the drive is roughly three times as fast as its DC P3700 drive - an NVMe drive capable of delivering 2,800MB/s sequential read and 2,000MB/s sequential write speeds. Intel's Optane SSD, which the firm claims will be particularly useful for analytics and machine learning, also offers improved QoS scales transactions, resulting in up to 10x more transactions per second at same service, or up to 91 per cent lower cost per transaction.  The P400X, which will initially clock in at 375GB via a PCIe card of U.2 drive, will consume 12-14 watts under a heavy load, which is slightly more power-efficient than competing high-end NAND solutions. "The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is the first product to combine the attributes of memory and storage," the firm said. "With an industry-leading combination of high throughput, low latency, high QoS and ultra-high endurance, this innovative solution is optimised to break through data access bottlenecks by providing a new data storage tier." The Intel Optane DC P4800X SSD is available now for $1,520, albeit in limited availability. The firm says that a 750GB PCIe model, alongside a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor, will b released in the second half of the year.   Intel also has a 1.5TB PCIe card, and 750GB and 1.5TB U.2 models, in the works. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Storage Intel SMB Spotlight SMB server Storage INQ Latest Half of Android devices are still not getting security patches But Google is working with vendors to make it easier Security 23 March 2017 Super Mario Run for Android is now available at Google Play Plumber finally clears blockage Games 23 March 2017 Apple acquires IFTTT rival Workflow and makes it free Deal hints at deep automation in iOS Applications 23 March 2017 'Windows 10 has a keylogger' story is back, three years after we first broke it Yeah.

Wireless chip designers Qualcomm, Gemalto and Intel have created internet of things development boards to help makers and software engineers experiment, innovate and ultimately bring their ideas to market. Qualcomm’s DragonBoard 410c Qualcomm’s DragonBoard 410c is a credit-card sized chipset that combines Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 410E processor. The 410E targets applications for smart homes, digital signage, medical equipment, industrial automation, digital media players and smart surveillance. Both the processor and the board are distributed through Arrow Electronics. Projects undertaken to date with the Qualcomm board include an audio-controlled drone and a camera-equipped hat for the visually impaired that gives audio narration about the environment. The chipmaker is working to build a community that is actively inventing and sharing ideas. (The “c” in 410c stands for “community.”) Software support for the DragonBoard 410c stretches from the device to the cloud. At the operating system level, the board is compatible with Android, Linux and Windows 10 IoT Core. Middleware support includes Qualcomm’s AllJoyn, IBM Watson IoT and Robotics OS. Cloud services that work with the board include AT&T M2X, AWS IoT, IBM Bluemix and Microsoft Azure IoT. In addition, users can add a mezzanine board to make the 410c compatible with Arduino. Developers can use the board to create a “chip-down design” that can be implemented by purchasing the $16 Snapdragon 410E processors directly from Arrow. They can also use the board to prototype designs that will be implemented using single board computers or system on modules that use the 410E processor. Qualcomm’s ecosystem of IoT hardware providers includes development kits made by Inforce, Variscite, eInfochips, Intrinsync, Keith & Koep and Ka-Ro. Intel’s Galileo and Curie Intel has already launched two generations of its Galileo development board, which can be used as a client or a server. The board measures 123.8 millimeters by 72 millimeters and is powered by Intel’s Quark SoC 1000X processor. The board is compatible with the Arduino UNO R3 pin configuration so developers do not need extra hardware or software in order to attach an off-the-shelf Arduino-compatible shield to the Galileo board. For developers of wireless IoT products, Intel created a Bluetooth-enabled module called Curie. The coin-sized chipset is meant for developers of wearable devices and industrial edge products, and is a component of the Arduino 101 development board. The Curie module can also be purchased separately from the Arduino board. Curie is powered by Intel’s 32-bit Quark SE system-on-chip, which is said to be ideal for always-on applications, and can use a smartphone or Intel Bluetooth gateway to connect to the internet. Intel is planning a software development kit for Curie designed to enable developers to run a real-time operating system on the module. Gemalto’s Cinterion Concept Board and Cinterion Connect Shield Gemalto’s board is said to be ideal for developers who want cellular connectivity as it includes the company’s Cinterion M2M 2G/3G connectivity module, which supports voice, is compatible with Arduino and can be programmed using Java. This year, Gemalto launched the Cinterion Connect Shield for developers who want to use LTE Category 1 connectivity with Arduino. The shield attaches to Arduino boards and includes an LTE Cat 1 modem with 2G fallback, a basic set of sensors and an external antenna. Gemalto plans to migrate the shield to narrowband IoT technology during the second quarter of 2017. Gemalto says the Cinterion hardware provides the security and extended battery life needed for industrial IoT applications, smart cities, agriculture and other use cases that require connectivity for devices that are difficult to access on a regular basis. Executives from Gemalto, Qualcomm and Intel will be featured speakers this month at the Enterprise IoT Summit in Austin, Texas. They will join executives from AT&T, Verizon Communications, Texas Instruments, Telit and Silicon Labs in the IoT development kit content stream.

The initial offerings include enthusiast and gaming processors for the AMD Ryzen 7 series. A few weeks later, the company released the mainstream versions of its new Zen architecture, the AMD Ryzen 5 series. Now, rumor has it that the company is contemplating on going head to head with Intel’s extreme performance desktop processors. According to Overclock3d, AMD will be releasing a high-end desktop platform CPU within the next couple of months. This new CPU will be in direct competition with Intel’s HEDT line of processors, the Intel i7-6950X. Furthermore, the said processors will have a total of 16 physical cores and are based on the the same Zen architecture as the Risen chips. Just like the current Ryzen processors, this high-end product will also have Simultaneous Multi-threading of SMT. Therefore, the 16-core architecture will give a grand total of 32 virtual cores. In comparison to the new AMD Ryzen 7 1800X, the high-end CPU will have twice the memory channel as well as twice the core count. AMD Ryzen processor (via trustedreviews.com) To those who have been following developments regarding the new AMD Ryzen processors, this news may seem quite questionable. Especially when the current AMD Ryzen 7 1800X already outperformed the Intel i7-6950X in a number of benchmarks. However, if AMD’s plan is to officially oust Intel as the best desktop CPU, then having a 16-core counterpart for Intel’s high-end CPU is indeed quite attractive. For decades, Intel has monopolized the CPU industry with its overly-priced processors. Now that AMD has basically risen from the dead, the market will again see a healthy competition giving consumers viable options for computer builds. At the moment, AMD has yet to release an official statement about the rumored 16-core chip. The company is still in the middle of releasing the AMD Ryzen 5 as well as the upcoming AMD Naples server processors. Like with any other kind of rumors, this too should be taken with a grain of salt. For more updates on the AMD Ryzen processor, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Dubbed the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, the chipmaker says the drive is designed to be used as either a storage or caching product in data centers. The P4800X add-in card features a capacity of 375GB, latency of less than 10µs, 4K random read / write IOPS of up to 550,000 / 500,000 and an endurance rating of 12.3 petabytes written (PBW). Intel and Micron jointly announced 3D XPoint, the technology behind Optane, in 2015. The biggest benefit of Optane could have to do with boosting the physical memory of a server. Ars Technical highlights that two-socket Xeon systems can support a total of 3TB of RAM but up to 24TB of Optane while quad-socket systems can accommodate 12TB of traditional RAM and a whopping 48TB of Optane. Standard DRAM would be faster for most workloads but Optane would cost substantially less and offer modestly improved power consumption. In some instances, Intel claims, workloads could even be improved with Optane as the layer that manages it can move data around so it is closer to the processor using it. Intel’s Optane SSD DC P4800X is priced at $1,520 with limited availability as of writing. A 750GB PCIe version and a 375GB model in the U.2 form factor are coming in the second quarter with a 1.5TB add-in card and a 750GB U.2 variant expected in the second half of 2017.

The performances bump these drives offer, according to Intel, will help drive AI and machine learning applications. SSDs are all the rage. For notebook computer I would strongly recommend against a spinning hard drive and on the desk, I’d advocate for either an all-SSD approach or OS and apps on a SSD with spinning disks reserved for mass storage where performance isn’t a priority. And the same goes for the data centre. The new drives are available now to the in Intel’s early shipping program with broad market availability and new capacities, starting with the first drive coming in at 375GB, and form factors coming in the second half of this year.

A huge amount of data will be generated by autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, and internet-of-things devices. Every day, more information is being collected and sent to faster servers in mega data centers, which analyze and make sense of it. That analysis has helped improved image and speech recognition and is making autonomous cars a reality. Emerging superfast data networks like 5G -- a melting pot of wireless technologies -- will dispatch even more gathered information, which could stress data centers. Servers are already being redesigned to handle more data, and throughput technologies like Gen-Z and fiber optics will reduce latency. At Mobile World Congress this week, computing on the edge was a big topic among infrastructure providers. Edge computing involves light processing on intermediary servers or on the edge of the networks. This type of computing can lead to faster responses for mobile services, without putting stress on servers in the core network. Edge computing can also provide instant analytics to ensure the junk information is discarded and only useful information reaches servers on the core network. Edge computing is also emerging for virtualization, which slices loads of data in smaller packages rerouted to the right servers to be handled. At MWC, many companies showed products and shared new ideas for computing on the edge. Most vendors had a common goal: to better control the flow and make better sense of data, especially with more data being collected by IoT devices. Hewlett Packard Enterprise showed off its latest generation of IoT servers called Edgeline, similar to the company's Proliant servers but slimmed down. The servers sit on the edge and are able to analyze data before sending them to core servers in data centers. The servers can virtualize data packets on the edge, which then makes better use of computing resources. For example, the Edgeline servers can handle mobile computing tasks, like responding to Facebook posts or search requests, on the edge. More intense data tasks, like image recognition, can be routed back to the centralized data center network, which handles machine learning tasks. Nearby, Dell was showing off its Edge Gateway 3000 servers for multiple IoT applications. The servers can analyze data at the point of collection and dispatch them to the data center. These servers use Intel's latest Atom chips, which have up to 16 cores. The Model 3001 is targeted toward industrial automation and energy management; the Model 3002 is aimed at transportation and logistics and fits into large vehicles like trucks; and the Model 3003 is designed for video streaming and point-of-sale applications. The servers use new Xeon-D or Atom chips from Intel, which were shown by the chipmaker on the floor of the show. The chips are targeted at edge servers and networking gear. These chips are not as powerful as the Xeon E5 chips used in mainstream servers in data centers. Ubuntu showed off some Open Compute Project network router designs with edge processing. The routers ran Ubuntu Snappy Core and can run software for edge processing. These routers are servers in their own right and reduce the load on high-end servers. Ubuntu "snaps" -- which are like apps -- can be tuned for specific edge processing tasks. More information about new edge router designs will be shared at Open Compute Project Summit next week. Another interesting demo at the Ubuntu booth showed an ARM server doing edge processing for 5G networks. The ARM servers had 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2 chips that are already being used in networking gear but also could double up as low-power server chips for more powerful edge processing. Powerful CPUs aren't needed for edge processing, but chips need to able to collate large datasets and ensure they are virtualized and redirected properly. ARM servers chips can virtualize data with the ARMv8 64-bit architecture, which has been adopted by chipmakers like Cavium. Edge processing will be important for autonomous cars as well. The ultimate vision is that autonomous cars will be able to connect to superfast servers in the cloud to recognize images, draw up maps, and make better driving decisions. But those connections may not always be possible, which is where edge processing on the autonomous car will step in. Intel and Qualcomm are providing unique circuitry for handling edge processing in autonomous vehicles. Intel is pushing FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) into autonomous vehicles to handle specific tasks, while Qualcomm is relying on digital signal processors. FPGAs and other components are key components for autonomous cars and a flexible 5G infrastructure, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and the Systems Architecture Group. Edge processing is also becoming a priority for telecom providers, which are looking for ways to add flexibility to the services they provide to customers. For example, SK Telecom -- which is testing 5G rollouts in South Korea -- found edge processing valuable in virtualizing its data and radio networks.

Junko Yoshida 3/20/2017 00:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet PARIS – On the day EE Times visited Chronocam, a Paris-based startup developing an event-based computer vision technology, a ripple of shock went through the whole building. Intel had just announced the acquisition of Mobileye. The big surprise hit shortly after a talk with the startup's CEO. This reporter closed her notebook, came out of the meeting room and proceeded on the obligatory company tour. Chronocam’s CEO reappeared unexpectedly, staring into his smartphone. Calmly, but with tones of deep portent, he said, “Intel just bought Mobileye. Fifteen billion dollars.” Say what? The move to combine Intel and Mobileye, two pillars of the computing and vision markets, carries far-reaching ramifications for everyone involved in the automotive market.   But what, for example, might happen to a startup like Chronocam? Although the CEO has never described Mobileye as a competitor, Chronocam’s technology, if successful, could overthrow the conventional CMOS image sensors and image processing algorithms currently used in cars, drones and robotics. The startup’s sensor technology, designed not for human consumption but for machines to sense and detect, would completely alter today’s CMOS image sensor market. Chronocam’s event-driven sensor, still so new, has not yet been used in any commercial cars, drones or robots. Experts in the imaging/sensing market see Chronocam at the crossroads of imaging and sensing.  Charting the course of image sensors over the next 15 years, Pierre Cambou, imaging activity leader at Yole Développement, considers Chronocam’s technology to be one of many disruptive technologies emerging as the industry shifts from an era of photography to machine sensing. (Source: Yole Développement) Click here for larger image Chronocam’s story is intriguing — even more so in the context of a red hot Advanced Assistance Driver System (ADAS)/autonomous vehicle market in which competition has escalated to the point that big players are now beginning to merge. Enter the combination of Intel and Mobileye. In the face of such super-combos, is Chronocam tilting at windmills? Will the Intel/Mobileye deal quash Chronocam’s plucky plan to participate in the automotive sensor market? Maybe. But Luca Verre, CEO and co-founder of Chronocam, remains optimistic. Chronocam CEO Luca Verre A common thread that ties Chronocam with Intel and Mobileye (and by extension, Nvidia, NXP/Qualcomm and others) is that they’re all pursuing the same thing: An autonomous driving machine that can sense, detect and analyze massive data -- almost at real time -- so that a car can instantly respond to any imminent danger. Chronocam is nowhere near the same league as the big boys in the chip industry. But the startup isn’t discouraged. Here’s why.

Intel pursuing new chips as it plots a wearables future Intel is developing a new version of its Curie chip for wearables Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 16 March, 2017 07:41 0 - - - - print email Every year, Intel is present at Fashion Week in New York, showing off how technology will change fashion. It's an odd match, but the depth of technologies shown by Intel has changed every year. In previous years, Intel showed off cool bracelets, smart clothes, and an odd robotic spider dress by Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht. Intel's 2017 showcase was a lot different and more practical, sprinkling in retail technologies with otherworldly wearables. That move to the practical, in a nutshell, describes Intel's tryst with its wearables unit -- from starting as a lab for cool devices to becoming a bootstrapped group focused on practical products amid the company's efforts to reduce wasted spending. Intel believes the best wearable products are yet to come, and it wants to change the way we interact with computing devices, share information, and even entertain ourselves. Intel is developing pursuing chips for wearables like Curie, which will be smaller and faster than the existing chip, and help make sleeker wearables, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. "We have to run just like any other responsible business effort that Intel has," Bautista said. The wearables group started off under the New Devices Group, established in 2013. Intel subsequently acquired companies like Basis to boost its wearables offerings but the unit didn't turn a profit. Amid restructuring, reports emerged last year that Intel had quit wearables. But the effort is still alive and more focused on delivering products that complement Intel's broader focus in areas like servers and the internet of things. Wearables are a pretty small operation at Intel, and it'll keep operating under the radar, said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. There are huge untapped markets in wearables, especially in vertical areas like health care. It's hard to say when Intel will find a commercially successful product, but the company will continue developing products, Brookwood said. "It's like Google: You keep throwing things against a wall, something may stick," Brookwood said. Despite a more disciplined approach, the cool products and bright ideas keep coming. Every trade show, Intel dazzles audiences with wearable technologies based on its chips and software. Intel's stage shows have featured Oscar winner A.R. Rahman playing music out of smartwatch-like devices, small shirt buttons that can gather health data, and helmets that can make driving cars and riding bikes safer. Intel has also shown its Project Alloy headset, a mixed-reality headset where objects pop up as floating images in mid-air. It's much like Microsoft's HoloLens -- which also uses Intel chips -- but with faster hardware. Recently, two smartwatches from New Balance's RunIQ and TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 carried Intel software and hardware technologies. An Oakley Pace Radar headset, which runs on Intel software, provides fitness guidance when training. The company's approach to wearables is being replicated in other areas like the Intel Sports Group, which is developing technology so users can watch 3D sports broadcasts as if they were in the stadium. One way to achieve that is by putting more cameras across the field, including helmets worn by players. Using algorithms, Intel servers slice and dice the images from the cameras to provide the customized footage. This will translate well to wearables like VR headsets, as users will be able to get a bird's eye view of a touchdown in a football game or a goal in soccer. Chips like Curie are already instrumental in improving the sports viewing experience from events like last year's Winter X Games. In real time, viewers were able to view key athlete performance data like the height of a snowboarder jump and how far they rotated. The data was captured from the Curie chip and sensors on the snowboards. Data has become extremely valuable, and wearables can help gather more information, especially biometrics. Wearables are edge devices that collect data and feed them to into the large flow of data being sent to cloud servers for analysis, Intel's Bautista said. In some way, one could think of wearables as an extension to Intel's interest in IoT, and it is in some ways similar to other technologies like connected thermostats and consumer sensor devices, Bautista said. Intel cares about how the collected data is analyzed and presented to the user, Bautista said. Wearables will be key for health-care application development, and Insight 64 analyst Brookwood identified galvanized skin response as a big wearable opportunity that Intel could pursue. Wearables also fuel the development of software applications that can be used for analytics, Bautista said. For example, Intel is developing software tools that will bring artificial intelligence to smartwatches like the new Tag Heuer smartwatch with Android Wear 2.0. Intel is taking an open architecture approach to IoT devices and wearables, and a device doesn't have to be tied to x86 chips. When planning the recently released smartwatches, Intel looked at the best chip and software that may fit into a device. Intel has packed the x86 Atom smartphone chips in the recent New Balance and TAG Heuer smartwatches, but it has put ARM processors into other wearables. It remains to be seen how long Intel plays in wearables, Brookwood said. The wearables market will take years to mature, so Intel has to remain in it for the long haul. At the same time, Intel has failed in many of its consumer-facing efforts, especially in media and TV. If Intel technology doesn't power a hit wearable device in the coming years, the effort could be canned. The days of Intel splashing money at efforts that don't produce are gone, Brookwood said.

Sure, SSDs are faster than HDDs, but it seems we’re stuck on those. Two years ago, Intel and Micron said “not anymore”, and the first consumable fruits of that labor has finally landed. Introducing the Intel Optane SSD DC 4800X, the first commercially available “3D XPoint” SSD. Sadly, it’s not something you can buy off shelves, unless you happen to be a well-financed business. There are two types of memory in computing (three actually, but L caches are different beasts). There’s volatile memory, more popularly known as RAM or DRAM in some cases. And then there’s the non-volatile or persistent ones, like HDDs and SDDs. Of the two, volatile memory is fast but expensive to make in large capacities. SSDs may be faster than HDDs, but they still don’t reach the same speeds as DRAM. As you can probably imagine by now, that’s where the Intel Optane SSDs come in. Utilizing the still mysterious 3D XPoint technology, this new breed of SSDs promise the same read/write speeds as DRAM but at capacities near that of your standard data storage. As you can also probably imagine, the Intel Optane SSDs aren’t targeted yet at regular consumers. Its primary beneficiaries are data centers and companies that require high-speed storage and store massive amounts of data. Those usually include activities like artificial intelligence and machine learning, medical records, search engines, and the like. That also means that Intel Optane SSDs aren’t going to be cheap. In fact, the Intel Optane SSD DC 4800X series starts at $1,520, and that’s for only 375 GB of storage. 750 GB and 1 TB SSDs will also be made available soon, for also astronomical prices.

Performance wise, expect it to be an absolute monster - with some new technologies being baked into it from Intel.     Skylake-EX Purley should ship with 6-channel DDR4 support, compared to 4-channel DDR support - with the AVX-512 instruction set, and exciting new 100G OmniPath interconnect technology.     100G OmniPath is a huge deal, as Intel's next-gen 100Gbps networking fabric technology takes things to the next level. We're looking at 100Gbps per port, with 25GB/sec bandwidth (bi-directional), and the Prairie River switch silicon provides switches with teh ability of hitting 48 ports, with up to 9.6TBps of bandwidth (1200GB/sec, or 1.2TB/sec).   There were even engineering samples that reportedly made it online last year, selling for $3845 - quite a steep price, but 64-threaded CPU? Yes, please. The base clock on the higher-end Xeon CPUs is always lower than the consumer-orientated Core family processors, with the monster 32C/64T chip to sport a 2GHz (or so) base clock.   We should see Intel deploy a new socket for these next-gen Xeon parts, with LGA 3467 sure to make an appearance - with support for 12 DDR4 DIMMs... as well as the fresh out of the oven Optane DIMMs, which we've just written about here.   NEWS SOURCES:Tweaktown.com, Anandtech.com Recommended for You Samsung to invest $7 billion in 7nm chips production...

Mesa 17.0.2 Brings Improvements to Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan Drivers GO The Intel i965 and Nouveau drivers were improved as well Mar 21, 2017 00:17 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Immediately after announcing the last maintenance update to the Mesa 13.0 3D Graphics Library series, Collabora's Emil Velikov published the second point release for the new Mesa 17.0 branch. Mesa 17.0.2 is here only two weeks after the release of the first maintenance update to Mesa 17.0, which is currently the most advanced stable branch of the graphics stack used by default in numerous Linux-based operating systems. According to the changelog, which we've attached at the end of the article for your reading please, Mesa 17.0.2 includes a little over 40 changes improving the Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan drivers, but also the Nouveau, Radeon and Intel i965 ones. "One dozen fixes in each of the Vulkan drivers ANV and RADV. Misc. Improvements in the i965, Nouveau (nvc0) and Radeon drivers. To top it up we have a build fix for the clover (OpenCL) state-tracker," reads the mailing list announcement. A recommended update for all Linux users The adoption of the Mesa 17.0 3D Graphics Library series among GNU/Linux distributions moves at slow pace these days, but now that the second point release is out, we have all the reasons to believe more distros will adopt it for their users. Mesa 17.0.2 is a recommended update for all Linux users, especially gamers, and it should be soon available for installation from the stable software repositories of your favorite GNU/Linux distribution. The upcoming Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) operating system should also ship with the newest Mesa 17.0 graphics stack, along with the latest maintenance update of the X.Org Server 1.19 display server; all of them contributing to a better gaming experience. With this announcement, we're urging OS vendors to download the Mesa 17.0.2 source tarball from our website, compile and tweak it for their platforms, and distribute it to the official channels for users to be able to update at their earliest convenience.

The Mystery That Made Thor Unworthy Has Been Revealed That Time An Island In GoldenEye Disappointed A Generation Tips For Playing Mass Effect: Andromeda Mass Effect: Andromeda PC Benchmarked On 24 Different Video Cards Steven Walton Mar 21, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  benchmarks bioware mass effect mass effect: andromeda pc gaming performance review Share It's hard to believe five years have passed since the March 2012 release of Mass Effect 3, which cemented the trilogy as something of a modern cult classic among RPG fans. Given the prestige associated with the series, it should come as no surprise that it received a new title and even less of a surprise that it's been on our list of must-play PC games for 2017. Developed by BioWare and published by EA on PC, Xbox One and PS4, Mass Effect: Andromeda vows to be bigger and more beautiful than prior releases. Although initial impressions indicate that the game delivers on some of those promises, it hasn't been a flawless execution so you may want to read a full review before buying this one (or just Google "Andromeda animations"). The game begins in the Milky Way Galaxy during the 22nd century with humanity planning to populate new home worlds in the Andromeda Galaxy as part of a strategy called the "Andromeda Initiative". The player assumes the role of either Scott or Sara Ryder, an inexperienced military recruit who joins the Initiative and wakes up in Andromeda following a 600-year journey. Mass Effect: Andromeda features some open world elements and emphasises exploration. Many of the series' traditional gameplay elements will remain, while others have been modified, such as combat, which is less cover-based and more mobile. Previous Mass Effect games were built upon the Unreal Engine but Andromeda uses Frostbite 3. This move meant that BioWare had to build all its systems, tools and assets from scratch. Ironically, a big part of the switch was to help enhance character animation, so I hope they had more success in other areas. Although Frostbite 3 does support DirectX 12, the developer has opted to stick with DX11, at least for now anyway. That isn't shocking though. While Mass Effect games have always looked great, the series has never really pushed game engines to their limits. The previous three instalments all used DirectX 9 for example, even 2012's Mass Effect 3 stuck with DX9 despite wide use of DX10 at the time as well as the availability of DX11. On PC, the developer recommends playing Mass Effect: Andromeda with either an Intel Core i7-4790 or AMD FX 8350, which is an odd contrast. Surely a lower-end Core i5 processor will suffice if they are recommending the FX-8350 and clearly these recommendations were made before Ryzen landed. On the graphics side, it's suggested that gamers arm themselves with at least a GeForce GTX 1060 3GB or GTX 970 — apparently you're out of luck if you own a Radeon graphics card (kidding of course, something like the RX 470 should suffice since the GTX 1060 3GB is recommended). By failing to mention a single AMD graphics card, it's clear this is an Nvidia sponsored title, so you can expect the green team to have the upper-hand out of the gate. That said, AMD seems to be very much on top of the driver game right now and has already released an update. AMD is claiming performance gains of up to 12 per cent on a Radeon RX 480 with an i7-6700K and 8GB of DDR4-2666 memory, a boost that supposedly sees frame rates go from 53.7fps to a much healthier 60.1fps at 1080p. Likely contributing to these performance gains, or at least a good chunk of it, is the added "Optimised Tessellation Profile" for the game. As you're likely aware at this point, I'm not here to review the game but to test its PC performance so you know how it will run on your hardware at home. Before getting to those results, let's discuss how we benchmarked Mass Effect: Andromeda. Testing Methodology For testing we used the AMD Radeon Crimson Edition Graphics Driver 17.3.2 Hotfix for testing the Radeon GPUs and the Nvidia based GPUs were tested using the GeForce Game Ready Driver 378.78. We benchmarked Mass Effect: Andromeda using our Core i7-7700K test machine which sees the processor running at 4.9GHz with 32GB of DDR4-3000 memory. The performance numbers you are about to see are based on a 60 second Fraps pass from the beginning of the single player campaign after the player-controlled character crash lands (falls) on Habitat 7. Since Origin locks you out for 24 hours after five hardware changes (graphics card or CPU), testing was painfully slow and in the end I had to purchase three accounts so I could test 15 configurations per day for this performance review. Unfortunately, this meant I wasn't able to do the usual CPU testing alongside the GPU benchmarks. We focused our attention on the ultra-quality preset for testing and I have to say that the game looks phenomenal with these settings. We also tested three standard resolutions: 1080p, 1440p and 4K. Test System Specs Intel Core i7-7700K (4.90GHz) Corsair Vengeance LED DDR4-3000 32GB Asrock Z270 Taichi (Intel Z270) Corsair RMx Series RM750x 750-watt Samsung SSD 850 Pro 2TB Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Nvidia GeForce 378.78 WHQL AMD Crimson 378.78 ReLive Radeon RX 480 (8192MB) Radeon RX 470 (4096MB) Radeon RX 460 (4096MB) Radeon R9 Fury X (4096MB) Radeon R9 Fury (4096MB) Radeon R9 Nano (4096MB) Radeon R9 390X (8192MB) Radeon R9 390 (8192MB) Radeon R9 380X (4096MB) Radeon R9 380 (2048MB) Radeon R7 360 (2048MB) Nvidia Titan XP (12288MB) GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11264MB) GeForce GTX 1080 (8192MB) GeForce GTX 1070 (8192MB) GeForce GTX 1060 (6144MB) GeForce GTX 1060 (3072MB) GeForce GTX 1050 (2048MB) GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4096MB) GeForce GTX 980 Ti (6144MB) GeForce GTX 980 (4096MB) GeForce GTX 970 (4096MB) GeForce GTX 960 (2048MB) GeForce GTX 950 (2048MB) Benchmarks: 1080p Even with AMD's recent driver update, the GTX 980 Ti still enjoys a serious performance advantage over the Fury X, delivering 24 per cent more frames on average. The 980 Ti looks very comfortable with a 71fps minimum while the Fury X dropped down to 54fps and the standard 980 slightly slower again at 53fps. It's not often you see the GTX 970 beating the R9 390X with ease but that's the current situation here. The same is true when comparing the R9 380 and GTX 960, the GeForce graphics card is a whisker faster here and just able to deliver playable performance at 1080p using the ultra quality settings. The same sadly can't be said for the R7 370 and GTX 950 though. The latest crop of GPUs offer more models capable of pushing over 60fps, as you might expect. The Titan XP and GTX 1080 Ti were good for over 100fps at all times and averaged around 120fps. The GTX 1080 was also respectable, often pushing frame rates above 100fps. It was a rather large drop down to the GTX 1070 but even so, with almost 80 fps on average performance was impressive. The GTX 1060 6GB easily topped the RX 480 despite AMD's recent driver update and here we see the RX 480 8GB delivering similar performance to the 1060 3GB. We found that GPUs such as the RX 470 and GTX 1050 Ti were still able to provide playable performance at 1080p. Benchmarks: 1440p Pumping the resolution up to 1440p really hammers performance and now we are looking at just 53fps on average from the GTX 980 Ti with a 46fps minimum. Despite that, the 980Ti was still 23 per cent faster than the Fury X which averaged just 43fps. For a minimum of 30fps at 1440p with all the eye candy turned up, gamers will require an R9 390X or GTX 970. We also see that you can achieve playable performance with the RX470, 4GB RX 480 and 3GB GTX 1060, if only just. Ideally gamers will want at least the GTX 1070 though we see a good argument for going with the GTX 1080 here as it provided 31 per cent more performance taking the average frame rate to 71fps. Again, the GTX 1080 Ti was just 15 per cent faster than the standard GTX 1080 and frankly I was hoping to see more from Nvidia's new $1199 GPU. Benchmarks: 4K Given what we saw at the previously tested resolutions, it's no surprise that even the GTX 980 Ti can't deliver playable performance at 4K. Here we see an average of just 28fps with a minimum of 24fps. Moreover, the GTX 1080 just gets by with a 38fps average and a 33fps minimum while the GTX 1080 Ti delivered just 13 per cent more performance, though the gains were noticeable here. Final Thoughts Ideally I would have liked to include some more tests such as quality scaling results for say the GTX 1060 and RX 480, but I simply ran out of time thanks to Origin constantly locking me out for 24 hours after swapping components. That being the case, I will aim to add the GeForce GTX 700 series and Radeon 200 series later this week followed by some CPU testing. What we can tell you so far is that to enjoy Mass Effect: Andromeda with its best visual settings, you'll require a powerful GPU, even if you plan to play at a resolution of 1080p. Here we really recommend nothing less than the Radeon R9 390 or GeForce GTX 970, though you don't expect to see GPUs such as the RX 480 8GB coming in around the GTX 970. Once AMD further address these performance issues we might see lower-end GPUs such as the R9 380 delivering more acceptable performance here. Those wanting to game at 1440p will need to bring some serious firepower — the Fury X for example still dipped below 40fps at times. The GTX 1070 or GTX 980 Ti are better picks here and for a constant 60fps+ you'll need a GTX 1080. To play Andromeda at 4K, you can expect to employ two high-end GPUs. Sadly though, neither SLI or Crossfire are working at the moment so even if you have invested in a pair of GTX 1080s, they won't be particularly useful in this title yet. The good news is that multi-GPU support is coming, hopefully sooner rather than later. Although we haven't included processor results we can say that the game doesn't seem too CPU-demanding, providing you have a decent quad-core chip. Utilization sat between 30 and 40 per cent for the most part on our overclocked Core i7-7700K test system. However, it's worth noting that RAM usage was extremely high. Our system was configured with 16GB for testing and we constantly saw more than half of that allocated. Overall, Mass Effect: Andromeda ran perfectly during our benchmarking procedures (no crashing and so on). The game's visual quality is extremely impressive and the gameplay seems like a lot of fun. It's a shame that the experience appears to be spoiled by poor animation. Republished with permission from: Steven Walton is a writer at TechSpot.

Just hope they get SLI support out very soon so I can use both 780 TI's. Reply 0 thatteemo @thatteemo Mar 21, 2017, 11:12am AMD GPU users, disable Temporal AA in game and user your Raedon Catalyst program to force Mass Effect to not use it. You can increase your frames from around 20 fps. You don't really notice a dip in quality. It's probably something to do with Nvidia gameworks Reply 1 Join the discussion!

This is a travesty. Mass Effect Andromeda's character creator is the most restrictive and disappointing of any modern Bioware game, in a game series where character customisation is incredibly important to many players.

On Monday, Nektar shares rose more than 42 percent after the company reported successful results from the latest clinical trials of its pain reliever, NKTR-181. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 20, 2017 at 3:20 pm | UPDATED: March 20, 2017 at 5:03 pm Top of the Order:   Pain? No Pain: In the Bay Area, all you have to do is walk out of your front door and you’ll trip over a tech company of some sort as you fall down toward the pavement. There are so many tech companies, from the classics (Apple, Intel, HP), to the relative youngsters (Google, Facebook, Twitter), to those that might be tech companies only because of the apps people use to interact with them (Uber, Lyft, Airbnb), that it would be easy to overlook some of the other industries in the region. Like pharmaceuticals.

Biz Break: Facebook, Twitter others could face huge fines in Germany for not deleting defamatory posts Well, Monday was a day for the pharma team to chalk up a win. And that win came from Nektar Therapeutics. San Francisco-based Nektar said it received positive results from a phase three clinical trial of something that sounds like the working title to a 1970s Steven Spielberg film: NKTR-181. What makes the drug promising is that NKTR-181 is an opioid that in its clinical trials has delivered relief from mild to moderate chronic back pain, but without much of the euphoria that comes with some similar drugs, which can potentially become habit forming. Nektar said Monday that the latest clinical trials were enough reason for the Food and Drug Administration to give NKTR-181 “fast track” designation for its eventual approval and sale. “Given the seriousness of the current opioid epidemic in the U.S. and the significant number of people battling chronic pain, we are committed to bringing this new molecule to patients and physicians as quickly as possible,” said Nektar Chief Executive Howard Robin, in a statement about NKTR-181’s successful clinical trial. That trial was enough to boost the confidence of Nektar’s investors, who on Monday sent the company’s stock up by 42.7 percent, to close at $22.11. You can bet Nektar’s shareholders were feeling no pain with a gain like that. Middle Innings: Is Uber Over Oakland?: Not entirely, but the ride-sharing giant isn’t going to have as big a presence in “The Town’s” downtown as had been previously thought. Uber confirmed to the Mercury News that, instead of the 3,000 employees it had been expected to put into the old Sears building in Oakland’s Uptown district, it will only move a few hundred workers into the facility and lease about half of the building’s 380,000 square feet. Of course, the way things have been going with executives departing from Uber, maybe the company won’t even need all the space its already has at his San Francisco headquarters? Globalization, Good! When Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks, it’s best to listen. After all, the guy only runs the most-valuable publicly traded company in the world and sits at the top of what is (arguably) the most-recognizable brand in the history of business. So, when Cook was in China this weekend, and delivered a speech in favor of globalization, it was sure to get some attention. Speaking at the China Development Forum, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cook said, “I think the worst thing would be to — because it didn’t help everyone — is to say it’s bad and do less of that.” Cook discussed globalization and other subjects during his speech, which surely wasn’t going to win him any fans with the Trump administration. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Monday. Movin’ on Up: Along with Nektar, gains also came from FireEye, Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, IXYS and Aviat Networks. In the Red: Decliners included SunPower, Accuray, Quotient Technololgy, Impax Laboratories and Servicesouce International. It was a pretty “meh” day for the nation’s major stock-market gauges. Want proof? The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index added just 0.5 points, to end the day at 5,901.53. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 8.8 points to 20,905.86. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also retreated, but only by 5.8 points, to finish at 2,373.47. Quote of the Day: ” It’s a double whammy for Wells Fargo.” — Ken Thomas, a Miami-based independent banking analyst. Thomas was speaking about Wells Fargo reporting a big drop in new checking accounts in February. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images Welcome to Last Week Was a Beta, our Monday look back on the big stories in tech last week. We were at SXSW in Austin, Texas, last week and thinking about the big trends in tech as soon as we reached baggage claim, because there was a guy there at a folding table promoting Ride Austin, a non-profit ridesharing app. Uber and Lyft checked out of the city shortly after last year’s events. Rather than download a new app, I opted for a taxi cab from the airport and it was easily the worst cab ride of my life. With so many tech reporters in Austin at once, the visit became a study in city life without Lyft or Uber. TL;DR: it’s fine. Lots of people wrote about ridesharing in Austin, but we liked Mashable’s take. The good folks over at Uber, though, don’t even have time to think about the Texas capital right now. We worried it might have been premature to refer to the world’s most highly valued unicorn as “beleaguered” last time, but it seems more than fair following this weekend’s announcement of the departure of the company’s president, Jeff Jones, after only six months. He was quoted by Reuters saying “that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride sharing business.” We all confirmed something down in Austin: no one is loyal to any ridesharing service. So the only way they can really compete is on price, and competition there has gotten so fierce that it doesn’t seem like money is getting made. The problem for Uber and Lyft is drivers. They need to pay drivers enough to make the work worth it, but they also need to keep fares low enough to hold onto customers. As our time in Austin illuminated, brand loyalty runs no deeper than a user’s reluctance to put their credit card into a new app. So what’s the solution? Self-driving cars, which we called inevitable, but that doesn’t mean they will get here in time to save the companies that pioneered ride-hailing. They might, however, return one of computing’s true giants to its ’90s glory. The chipmaker Intel made a $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, a suite of sensors for cars. Mobileye has been used in New York City taxis, Tesla cars and currently has gear inside the NIO vehicles we recently checked out. The AP did a nice roundup of companies worming into this industry, and there’s a lot of non-carmaker names on the list. Intel’s play looks similar to that of the electronics maker, Harman, who has bet heavily on autonomous vehicle accessories. The car market in the future could look a lot like the personal computer market of the past. Ford and Audi could one day be brands like Gateway and Dell once were, the sort that people take seriously, but not so seriously as companies such as Intel and Windows that build the stuff that worked inside those manufacturers’ chassis. Self-driving cars are just one of the many forms of robots that will one day take over all of life’s drudgery. Other robots where all over the news last week, as well. Techcrunch spotted a food delivery robot from Yelp out for a photoshoot. Imagine what basically amounts to rolling cooler showing up at your doorstep when you order Thai food. That day is coming. Y Combinator wants to take it a step further. They are looking for companies that want to further refine robotics in manufacturing. In particular, they want robots that can assemble and fix and other robots, as Techcrunch reported in another story. These machines only work well if they can connect to the internet though, which is why it will pay to move slowly into hackable hardware.  A huge indictment came down against Russian cybercriminals who broke into Yahoo and used stolen information to make money though a wide array of nefarious means. More to the point, a maker of smart vibrators announced a settlement after hackers demonstrated that the devices could be remotely turned on and off by third parties. A cautionary tale if ever there was one, but will it stop the tech bros of the world from lining up to buy the sensor-laden cock ring announced earlier this month for precisely tracking one’s amorous conquests? We doubt it. The robot overlords will be coming soon enough, but smart sex toys are still a dumb idea here in 2017. Don’t put the internet on your thing.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Kingston and Samsung are dominating the global SSD market Kingston and Samsung are dominating the global SSD market Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Channel, Featured Tech News, SSD Drives Over the years, the SSD market has become very saturated, with a ton of companies all competing for market share. However, it looks like we have three clear standouts based on global sales from 2016, with Kingston and Samsung  making up the two top SSD sellers worldwide. According to statistics put together by Forward Insights, a collection of ‘other’ companies claimed 30 percent of the global SSD market in 2016. Meanwhile single companies have been clamouring for the rest of the market share. Samsung currently claims a 21 percent share of the market, followed closely by Kingston with 16 percent. From there, other SSD makers have found themselves with single digits worth of market share, meaning Samsung and Kingston have really separated themselves from the pack. According to the analysts, a total of 63 million SSDs were shipped worldwide last year, with Kingston accounting for around 10.1 million units. This shows that Kingston has secured itself a place at the top of the SSD market, with 16 percent of overall sales. Speaking about this level of growth, Tony Hollingsbee, Kingston’s SSD business manager noted that the company’s channel partner relationships have gone a long way to helping the company grow its SSD business, since its first drive shipment back in 2009. KitGuru Says: It looks like Kingston has secured itself a position as a global leader in the SSD market, rivalled only by Samsung. How many of you are currently running a Kingston SSD?  Have you been happy with it? This post has been updated to correct an earlier claim that Intel held 30 percent of the SSD market.

Whereas rival solutions tend to favour garish designs that lack a certain level of attention to detail, the 14in Blade has the rare ability to look and feel like an Ultrabook while delivering the performance of a gaming machine. And it's testament to the sleek chassis design that, four years later, it still comes across as a modern and stylish piece of kit. Measuring a hair under 18mm thick and employing aluminium construction throughout, the frame is both svelte and strong and continues to position the Blade as one of the best-looking gaming laptops around. Finished almost entirely in black and garnished with a few elements of bright-green trim, it can be viewed as a MacBook on acid. Razer's design is a known quantity (and yes, it's still highly susceptible to fingerprints), but what makes the Blade particularly interesting is the way in which it has evolved over the years. Back in 2013 the launch model came equipped with a sub-HD display, a fourth-generation Intel processor, 8GB of memory and a 2GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 765M GPU. Fast forward to 2017 and the latest refresh, priced at £1,800, ups the ante with a full-HD screen, a seventh-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of onboard memory. Not bad for a portable system measuring 345mm wide and weighing less than 2kg (1.86kg, to be precise). The upgrades are all welcome additions and this time around there is a choice of display options. The entry-level spec includes a matte 14in IPS panel with a full-HD (1,920x1,080) resolution, but if you're willing to stretch the budget to £2,300, you can bag a 14in UHD (3,840x2,160) display with touchscreen capabilities. The former favours gaming at the native resolution and bodes well for battery life, but the latter will deliver greater clarity and is ideally suited to productivity. It's a shame Razer hasn't used this opportunity to shrink the large display bezel as this is one of few areas where the chassis is beginning to show its age. Elsewhere, it's the Blade we know and have come to appreciate. Stereo speakers positioned either side of the keyboard do a good job of belting out audio, albeit with little in the way of bass, and both the keyboard and trackpad are better-than-average for a compact gaming laptop. The keys still offer minimal travel and feel flat under the finger, yet the layout serves up no unwanted surprises and the RGB backlight is implemented particularly well. Each key is consistently lit and via the Synapse utility it's easy to customise effects, create macros and synchronise profiles you happen to have saved from other Razer products. The Synaptics trackpad also works well, with a large, responsive surface and two dedicated buttons. Connectivity is mostly well thought out. Blade's left edge houses a headphone jack, dual USB 3.0 ports (coloured in Razer green, of course) and a connector for the power supply. Over on the right there's HDMI output, another USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt 3. The latter provides compatibility with Razer Core external graphics, as well as any USB-C peripheral, and as you'd expect there's built-in Wireless AC (Killer 1535) and Bluetooth connectivity as standard. What's missing is an Ethernet jack and an SD card reader, and if you rely on a wired connection note that Razer doesn't include a USB-to-Ethernet dongle as part of the bundle. The hardware upgrades are evolutionary and both the CPU and GPU continue to be cooled by a combination of four heatpipes and dual exhaust fans. Noise, which we'll cover later in the review, remains a sticking point, and with only one M.2 slot, storage capacity can also be a concern. Razer's most basic £1,800 specification includes only a 256GB SSD - upgrading to 512GB increases cost to £2,000 and a 1TB model pushes the price up to a staggering £2,400. If you are going to be installing multiple games, the larger drives should be viewed as a necessity rather than an option. Given the premium, Razer needs to give Blade an aura of superiority and it gets some way toward achieving that goal through subtle touches that help elevate the overall experience. The display hinge, for example, has just the right rigidity not to wobble and yet can be opened easily with one finger. There's no bloatware in sight, the bundled power supply is a cute little unit rather than a typical brick, and if you're a fan of the Razer green you'll enjoy the Matrix-like appearance of the Windows command prompt. It's a seductive piece of kit, so let's see what this latest specification can really do.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Intel’s first 3D XPoint SSD has arrived Intel’s first 3D XPoint SSD has arrived Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Featured Tech News, SSD Drives This week, Intel officially launched its very first SSD to make use of its new 3D XPoint technology. This tech was first demonstrated back in 2015 and is faster/denser than any other type of memory right now. In all, it is said to be several hundred times faster than the NAND architecture in use today. The first SSD to make use of 3D XPoint is the Optane DC P4800X, which won’t necessarily excite consumers with its 375GB of storage, but it could be a game changer for data centres. The Optane DC P4800X is roughly five to eight times faster than many leading SSDs and should help fill the gap created by DRAM shortages. According to Intel, this drive is particularly ideal for “critical applications with aggressive latency requirements”. This makes sense, as 3D XPoint is built to offer extremely low latency while being built to last. In terms of read and write speeds, this SSD offers up to 2GB/s over a PCIe connection. It consumes around 14 watts under heavy load, making it very power efficient, another thing that is increasingly important for server farms and data centres. In all, Intel’s $1520 375GB drive offers a combination of high throughput, low latency and high QoS, while being built to endure and alleviate the bottlenecks data centres currently face. In the future, there will be a 750GB version of this available, along with a 375GB model in a U.2 form factor. Eventually. 1.5TB SSDs will also hit the market. KitGuru Says: This technology is excellent for data centres but won’t be of much use to consumers until prices come down and capacities go up. Still, 3D XPoint seems like quite the innovation, though it has hit the market later than initially hoped.

Samsung 950 Pro has 2.5 GB/s read and 1.5 GB/s write but it sure won’t cost 1500 dollars and has more capacity than 375GB. Rick Remember when SSD first came out. The prices were insane then now look at the prices Mat Bailie Sequential Read, sure. But real life workloads are more geared around Random Reads and Writes at low queue depths. This thing destroys every SSD available in that respect. Which is relevant in low latency transactional databases, etc. On a consumer desktop (measuring boot times, application load times, game load times, etc), this would just show the CPU as the bottle neck. Ricardo Dupree Somebody has been taking a few pages of the reply repertoire of the likes of Booyaboo2, to be or blah, Ironbunny Ionbunny, Trollmaster etc from the neighbouring site :”) . Plz kindly point me to a server config fitted with Samsung TLC 3DVNAND SSDs then. Last time I checked the professional server jockeys went for at least MLC based SSDs if not straight for SLC SSDs. And those puppies are nowhere nearly as cheap as Samsung’s EVOs and 950 series. Also, if I read and understood correctly Intel still has the option to play the stacking game with the 3DXPoint chips. Give it time; if we’re so quick to pull the trigger on NAND Flash SSDs as some, most notably the S|A shills, would do on 3DXPoint memory, SSDs would have never seen the light of day and we’d be still spinning rust now.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Mar 20, 2017 at 11:47AM Warren Buffet famously said that the best time to sell a stock is never. While not even the Oracle of Omaha strictly adheres to that rule, investors still should have an appropriately long time horizon for the companies they put their money into. At least three to five years is a minimum; a decade is better, and decades is best. Still, when companies make huge moves in a short period of time, it's worthwhile to see what the catalysts were that caused them to explode in value. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Chemours (NYSE:CC), and KEMET (NYSE:KEM) are three stocks that soared in value over the past year so that had you invested $3,000 in any one of them, you'd be looking at a $15,000 gain -- or better! Let's see why they made the moves they did. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. Advanced Micro Devices It was a long time coming, but Advanced Micro Devices posted its first adjusted profits in 2016. The last time the chipmaker was in the black, at least on a non-GAAP basis, was 2011, and after wandering in the wilderness for so long, it was a welcome homecoming. The basis for the gains was its ability to carve out a niche supplying chips for the gaming industry as the PC business declined. Early on in 2016, it signed a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment to license server chip designs for new processors for gaming consoles from Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, and it has recognized $88 million from the deal so far. A lot of the sentiment in favor of AMD has depended on the ability of its Polaris, Vega, and Ryzen (aka Zen) architectures to gain share in the GPU and CPU markets, as well as sign more IP licensing deals with customers. By doing so, it has once again emerged as a competitive second source to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which it's planning to challenge with its new Ryzen processors and Naples server chips.   However, the company is also reportedly willing to partner with its rival in a bid to take on NVIDIA. It will reportedly feature Intel's CPUs alongside its own GPUs in what can only be described as a case of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." There's still a lot of ground for Advanced Micro Devices to make up, but that seems to bode well for further gains in its stock, which has risen from well under $3 a share in March 2016 to over $14 a stub today. The 436% gain would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000 in just one year. Image source: Chemours.  Chemours Spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2015, performance chemicals specialist Chemours was seen as set up for failure from the beginning, with lots of debt and toxic assets its former parent wanted to shield itself from. The titanium dioxide market that had bolstered the balance sheets of DuPont, Dow Chemical, Kronos Worldwide, and Huntsman, the world's four largest producers of the white pigment, also imploded. However, though it initially lost 85% of its value in its first seven months as a separate company, Chemours has gone on to be a star performer. It did so by cutting expenses and its workforce, and by shedding or shutting non-core assets. In 2016, Chemours reduced costs by $200 million, improved operating cash flows by $412 million, and retired $385 million in long-term debt. While the TiO2 business it inherited from DuPont is still weak, the performance chemicals leader was still able to raise prices last year, showing it still possesses substantial power in the industry and allowing it to more than double its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins to $157 million. Shares of Chemours have gone from less than $7 each to over $33, a better than 400% gain that would have transformed $3,000 into more than $15,000. It still has some substantial risks ascribed to it, but it's a much better business than it was when it first hit the public markets. Image source: KEMET. KEMET The world's largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors and one of the biggest makers of multilayer ceramic capacitors used across automotive, communications, and military and aerospace industries, KEMET has been on the rise since the November elections, perhaps on the promise by President Trump of increased infrastructure spending that would dwarf the stimulus spending package of his predecessor. However, last month, KEMET's stock surged nearly 23% in one day after announcing it was acquiring NEC TOKIN, a Japanese manufacturer of tantalum capacitors, in which it had already owned a substantial stake. While the purchase brings new capabilities under KEMET's purview and enhances existing lines, there seems to be little reason for the outsized gains the deal generated. When KEMET originally took a stake in TOKIN, regulators had no problem signing off on the deal because there were no competitive concerns raised, and it would only increase KEMET's market share incrementally. Of course, that was a few years ago, and now KEMET will own the entire company, but the playing field does appear to have been significantly altered to warrant the outsized gain. Even so, KEMET's stock is up 440% over the past year, most of it since November, when it went from trading around $3.60 per share to today, where it stands north of $11 a share. That would mean it would have turned $3,000 into more than $16,000. Considering it had been trading sideways for much of 2016, those gains have largely occurred in about just four months' time, making its compounded growth rate really much larger.

During his opening statement at today’s House Intelligence hearing into Russia’s interference in the presidential election, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes knocked down President Donald Trump’s claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower before the election. Well, somewhat. While specifically stating that there was no wiretap of the Trump Tower, Nunes — who was on the Trump transition team — said that other surveillance may have occurred. “Let me be clear,” Nunes said. “I’ve been saying this for several weeks. We know there was not a physical wiretap of Trump Tower. However, it’s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against president trump and his associates.” Following Trump’s tweets about wiretapping, Nunes eventually came out and said there was no evidence to back up his claim. In an interview last week with Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, Trump indicated that he was talking about surveillance in general when he sent out those tweets, something that has also been pushed by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. With these comments, it appears Nunes is providing some cover for the president and it will be interesting to see if the White House latches on the them. Watch the clip above, via CNN.

Kontron’s 146 x 102mm “3.5”-SBC-APL” single board computer expands upon the 14nm “Apollo Lake” Atom E3900 series and Celeron N3350 system-on-chips with an SBC focused on security. Other 3.5-inch Apollo Lake SBCs include Portwell’s PEB-2773, Advantech’s MIO-5350 and PCM-9366, Litemax’s AECX-APL0, Aaeon’s GENE-APL5, and Avalue’s ECM-APL. 3.5″-SBC-APL (click image to enlarge) The 3.5″-SBC-APL is aimed at industrial production, medical, digital signage, point-of-sale, and point-of-information systems. Linux and Windows, including Windows 10 IoT, are supported. Kontron has previously released a Linux-ready mITX-APL Mini-ITX SBC based on Apollo Lake. The 3.5″-SBC-APL supports up to 8GB of DDR3L, and offers eMMC storage. Kontron’s spec sheet doesn’t say how much, but the block diagram lists a slim 64MB capacity. The 3.5″-SBC-APL has a relatively modest feature set compared to most of the boards listed above. For example, the SATA connection is 2.0 instead of the 3.0, and there are only two coastline USB 3.0 ports. A third USB 3.0 header is noted on the block diagram along with the dual USB 2.0 headers listed in the spec table. 3.5″-SBC-APL block diagram (click image to enlarge) Triple display support is available via DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI ports, as well as a dual-channel LVDS interface, but no resolution is listed. There are also dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and an RS-232/422/485 port, along with serial, GPIO, and audio interfaces. Full- and half-size mini-PCIe slots are available, as well as a SIM card socket for wireless expansion. The 12V, 0 to 60°C ready board is available with active and passive cooling solutions. The SBC is notable for offering a standard TPM 2.0 security chip, as well as support for Kontron’s Kontron Security Solution (“Approtect”) services. Specifications listed for the 3.5″-SBC-APL include: Processor — Intel Apollo Lake: Atom x7-E3950 — 4x cores @ 1.6GHz/2.0GHz, 12W TDP Atom x5-E3940 — 4x cores @ 1.6GHz/1.8GHz, 9W TDP Atom x5-E3930 — 2x cores @ 1.3GHz/1.8GHz, 6.5W TDP Celeron N3350 — 2x cores @ 2.3GHz, 6W TDP Memory — Up to 8GB DDR3L-1867 via 1x SODIMM; 64MB eMMC Storage — SATA 2.0 Display: DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI port LVDS (18/24-bit dual-ch.) Triple-display support Networking — 2x Gigabit Ethernet ports Other I/O: 2x USB 3.0 ports USB 3.0 header 2x USB 2.0 headers RS-232/422/485 port RS-232 interface Audio line-in, line-out, speaker-out via header (Realtek ALC269Q) GPIO Expansion — 2x mini-PCIe slots (1x full-, 1x half-size) Other features — TPM 2.0; Kontron Security Solution services Power — 12VDC + 4-pin internal input Operating temperatures — 0 to 60°C Dimensions — 146 x 102mm (“3.5-inch form factor”) Operating system — Linux, Windows 10. Windows 10 IoT   3.5″-SBC-E38 In the same press release that revealed the 3.5″-SBC-APL, Kontron announced a “cost-effective” “3.5″-SBC-E38” SBC that deploys a single-core Intel Atom E3815 “Bay Trail” CPU with 5W TDP. The board can drive up two independent displays and comes with three Ethernet ports, a SATA 2.0 port, and a half-size mini-PCIe slot. The 3.5″-SBC-E38 is further equipped with USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and audio I/O, and runs safely at 0 to 60°C. No photo, product page, price, or availability information were provided, and Kontron did not respond to our request for further details.   Further information The 3.5″-SBC-APL appears to be available now, with pricing undisclosed. More information may be found on Kontron’s 3.5″-SBC-APL and 3.5″-SBC-E38 announcement, as well as the 3.5″-SBC-APL product page.   Related posts: 3.5-inch Apollo Lake SBC hands you a sixpack of USB 3.0 Apollo Lake thin Mini-ITX board focuses on security 3.5-inch Apollo Lake SBC supports extended temperatures First 3.5-inch Apollo Lake single board computers appear Aaeon shows its first Apollo Lake COM Pico-ITX Apollo Lake SBC gives you expansion options Advantech’s first five Apollo Lake SBCs include Mini-ITX,… Fanless, thin Mini-ITX board taps quad-core Apollo Lake… Qseven COM offers Apollo Lake and a security chip Rugged Qseven module runs Linux on Apollo Lake (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

View All Posts On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly as investors pounced on bonds and dividend-paying stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, as did the S&P 500. The Nasdaq broke even and the Russell 2000 gained 0.4%. The leading sectors on Friday were utilities (+0.6%), telecom services (+0.6%) and materials (+0.5%). The benchmark 10-year Treasury note’s yield fell to 2.5%. Friday’s volume was higher due to “quadruple witching,” which is the expiration of almost every important class of options. This can cause unusually high volume and volatility but had little impact on Friday’s final numbers. Several economic reports were published on Friday, but the result was that total industrial production is weak, up just 0.3% year-over-year. But the Leading Indicators for February were up 0.6%, and the index is at a decade high. The conclusion is that this year, economic growth should improve. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20 points to 20,915, the S&P 500 lost 3 at 2,378, the Nasdaq was flat at 5,901 and the Russell 2000 gained 5 points to close at 1,392. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 2.3 billion shares with total volume of over 5 billion shares, and the Nasdaq crossed 3 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers outpaced decliners by 1.5-to-1, and on the Nasdaq, advancers led by 1.4-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE increased to 8,966, up from Thursday’s 6,342. The increase was due primarily because of the major options expiration day (quadruple witching). Click to Enlarge Following its high in July 2016, the Dow Jones Utility Average fell over 100 points or 14%-plus. It bottomed in November with hardly a whimper, but began to accumulate buyers in December, the start of what we can now clearly see is a bullish “V” formation. On Friday, buyers chased the attractive yields of this sector, triggering a “Golden Cross” (long-term bullish signal) and setting the stage for an attack on the July 2016 high at over 723. Conclusion: The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to gradually raise rates is not leading the market, but trailing it. The bond markets show similar accumulation. This upward move by higher-yielding investments is a prediction that barring an unforeseen event, the Fed will continue to raise rates. Thus, stock buyers should focus on securities whose management plans to increase dividends and stock buy-back plans, like our Trade of the Day, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). It is those stocks that, along with a strong growth record, will most likely lead the market this year. Today’s Trading Landscape To see a list of the companies reporting earnings today, click here.

Following a series of tweets about that appeared intended to try and change the topic away from wiretapping, Trump is on to a new topic: polls. It’s unclear what specific polls Trump is talking about but the one that must be most galling to him this morning is the Gallup poll that shows his approval rating at a record low. UPI reports: The Gallup daily poll, based on a three-day rolling average released Saturday, shows 37 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 58 percent disapprove. On Jan. 22, three days after Trump was sworn into office, Trump’s approval and disapproval rating was split 45 percent to 45 percent, respectively. On Feb. 21, about halfway through his first three months in office, 42 percent of Americans approved of Trump, while 52 percent disapproved, Gallup polls show. Though Trump’s approval rating reached a new low Monday, it has been among its highest levels since the beginning of March. On March 10, Trump’s approval was at 45 percent, 1 point shy of his high of 46 percent immediately after his inauguration. That number has since plummeted amid the fallout and subsequent investigation of comments he made accusing former President Barack Obama of tapping Trump’s phones at Trump Tower. Tweeted Trump: “Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox.” Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 In other news, the Liar in Chief claimed he had a full weekend meetings until alternate evidence emerged: photos revealing that he actually had a big golf weekend.

Video - House Intel Chairman David Nunes: Hard To Believe Gulen Behind Turkey Coup.(GP) The United State House Intelligence Committee chairman has said it is “hard to believe” that U.S.-based Turkish cleric is behind the military coup attempt last summer, questioning Turkey as a reliable ally. “I find that hard to believe,” David Nunes told Chris Wallace from Fox News when asked if cleric Fethullah Gulen is the architect of the coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Mr. Nunes added that the government of Mr. Erdogan is becoming very authoritarian and that Ankara, as a NATO ally, is “becoming more and more worrisome in terms of actually being a reliable ally.”Read the full story here.

The Jewish Press Home News & Views InDepth Blogs Judaism Sections A / V Radio Shows Video of the Day Cartoons InPrint Home InDepth Op-Eds New Israeli Milestone Reveals the Farce of the Guardian’s BDS Obsession InDepth Op-Eds New Israeli Milestone Reveals the Farce of the Guardian’s BDS Obsession By CAMERA - 22 Adar 5777 – March 20, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Photo Credit: wiki {Written by CAMERA intern Aron White and posted to UK Media Watch} This week saw a new milestone for Israel’s economy, as an Israeli start-up, Mobileye, was bought for $15.3 billion dollars by Intel, marking the largest ever deal for an Israeli company. Fortune Magazine, March 13th Advertisement It is hard to overstate the significance of the deal; the $1 billion sale of Israeli company Waze to Google in 2013 was considered a landmark moment, but that now looks like small fry compared to the Mobileye sale. As venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg wrote, this deal changes expectations and raises the bar, as Israeli entrepreneurs “now know they can build a $15 billion company in ten years.” Israel’s GDP is around $320 billion, so for two Israelis to create a company worth $15 billion, 5% of the country’s GDP, in just ten years, is simply staggering. This very significant story was not reported in the Guardian. This in and of itself is a little surprising, but not malicious or improper. What makes it noteworthy is that the pages of the Guardian feature much discussion and reporting about BDS, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement – but one wonders whether they are missing the real story. “Brian Eno refuses to let Israeli dance company use his music,” read a Guardian headline in September 2016. Is the decision of one British producer, with negligible economic impact, a more significant story than the multibillion dollar sale of the leading automotive technology company to the world’s largest chip producer? The Guardian features articles on Israel’s actions to counter the BDS movement, articles celebrating BDS successes, as well as opinion pieces discussing the merits and shortcomings of the movement. Is BDS the real story? Surely the real stories of Israel’s economy are the technology start-ups revolutionising every sector, from medical treatment to the “gig economy”, to cybersecurity. Staying up to date with the latest Israeli successes (were the Guardian to be interested in it) would actually be dizzying. One can find successes at every turn – this past September, Payoneer, an Israeli company revolutionising online payments raised $180 million in their latest funding round. In July 2016, a Chinese company bought Playtika, an Israeli gaming company, for $4.4 billion. In the chip-making sector, Mellanox bought Israeli company EZChip in February 2016 for $811 million. As Israeli technologies continue to have a growing impact on all our lives, the Guardian’s myopic focus on the BDS movement becomes almost comical. Guardian journalists drive to work with the help of Israeli route-navigating technology (and soon in cars automated by Israeli technology), sit down to computers powered by Israeli designed chips, write articles they back up on Israeli invented flash drives, or on the cloud, and are increasingly protected by Israeli cybersecurity – but produce article after article about the “success” of BDS. Israel will keep improving the lives of literally billions of people around the world, whether the Guardian covers it or not. But the pages of the Guardian are missing the real story; maybe they should check out some of the Israeli start-ups trying to improve the world of journalism, for some help.   Advertisement SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleThe Lifeguard Tower Hotel Next articleLinda Sarsour and the Interfaith Dialogue Fallacy CAMERA CAMERA, the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, is the foremost media-monitoring, research and membership organization promoting accurate, balanced coverage of Israel and the Middle East.

By Sarmistha Acharya March 20, 2017 12:44 GMT Microsoft recommends upgrade to Windows 10 Microsoft Technology giant Microsoft is blocking Windows 7 and 8.1 updates on Intel's seventh generation Core i3, i5 and i7 AMD's seventh generation processor (Bristol Ridge) and Qualcomm's 8996 processors. While trying to scan and download updates through Windows Update, error messages appear saying, "Windows could not search for new updates" and "code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error." As explained in Microsoft Knowledge based article the errors occur as the new processor generations require the latest Windows version. For those on Windows 7 and 8.1, Microsoft recommends updating the devices to Windows 10. In response to the matter a Microsoft spokesperson told the Forbes, "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon". From July onward the Intel Skylake processors will not support Windows 7 and 8, which means users will need to update to the latest operating system in order to receive further updates. However, Microsoft did not reveal how much it would charge users of Windows 7 and 8.1 devices after the free Windows update period gets over. But users can use Windows 7 and 8.1 product keys for Windows 10 installation. Last June Microsoft had assured users auto updates for Windows 10 will be easier to reject and not forced upon them after receiving complaints regarding the same.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation House Hearings On Russia, Wiretapping Set To Begin Today Share on Facebook Share on Twitter House Hearings On Russia, Wiretapping Set To Begin Today Posted at 8:45 am on March 20, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Buckle up. As the House Intel Committee hearings kick off today, the first few minutes could focus on President Trump’s claims that Trump Tower was wiretapped by former President Obama. FBI Director James Comey is expected to address the issue of wiretapping in the opening minutes, and his testimony is expected to contradict everything Trump has claimed.  Comey’s expected comments to the House Intelligence Committee will mark the U.S. law enforcement community’s first public response to President Donald Trump‘s continuing insistence that the Obama administration “wiretapped” or otherwise conducted surveillance of Trump’s presidential campaign. National Security Agency director Mike Rogers will also be testifying. “It never hurts to say you’re sorry,” a Republican member of the committee, former CIA officer William Hurd, R-Texas, advised Trump today, telling ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos that the commander-in-chief should apologize for his false statements, which have angered key allies such as Great Britain. The main purpose of the hearing is to determine if Russia did, in fact, interfere in the 2016 election, and to determine if any U.S. citizens helped them. Any actual collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia may be hard to determine. Trending Lying Democrats Gather on Capitol Steps to Celebrate 7th Anniversary of Obamacare Disaster Jim Jamitis There is apparently lots of smoke, but no actual fire has been discovered. But Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, the chairman of the committee -– one of several congressional committees looking into allegations of Russian meddling in the election -– insisted he has seen “no evidence of collusion” between Trump associates and the Russian government, noting that the only direct evidence of a crime he’s seen is the leaking of classified U.S. intelligence to reporters, including information about Flynn’s pre-inauguration contacts with Russian diplomat Sergey Kislyak. The Washington Post first revealed that, despite Flynn’s private denials, he had discussed Obama administration sanctions against Russia with Kislyak — a discussion captured by U.S. spy agencies eavesdropping on Kislyak. The Washington Post later revealed that now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had also met with Kislyak at least twice during the campaign. Sessions’ meetings were more in line with the course of work. Flynn’s contact may have been a bit more troublesome, especially in light of the fact that he misrepresented the nature of his conversations with Kislyak to Vice President Pence, and was subsequently forced to step down. Comey’s testimony will probably be limited on the subject of Russia to explaining why Russia would try and influence a U.S. election, as well as how they carry out the same campaign of confusion and interference in Europe, but there is a lot of anticipation that he will put the lid on any more questions, regarding the alleged surveillance of Trump. I’m looking for a swipe at WikiLeaks, myself. There are many who believe WikiLeaks is a tool for the Kremlin, even though founder Julian Assange denies it. Keep denying it, but it’s curious that your main (only?) target seems to be the U.S. and you leave nations like Russia and China alone. The hearings are expected to begin at 9am today.     Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Tags: James Comey Obama Wiretapping Russia Recent Stories ‘There Is No Plan B’: The House Votes Today on AHCA Caleb Howe 4 Reasons Devin Nunes’s Stunt Created More of A Mess Jay Caruso Pastor Tim Keller Too Conservative for Religious Award, Princeton Rescinds Kira Davis COMMENTS POSTING RULES  |  LOGIN TO COMMENT  |  REGISTER TODAY Trending 4 Reasons Devin Nunes's Stunt Created More of A Mess City of Boston and Hospital Violated Teen Girl's Human Rights, Hacker Who Fought for Her Faces 25 Years in Prison 'There Is No Plan B': The House Votes Today on AHCA CNN: Trump Folks May Have Possibly Coordinated with Russia, Sources Might Say.

READ STUDIES Computing on The Edge – Mobile Data Centers March 20, 2017March 20, 2017 by Josh Hamilton 52shares Computing on The Edge Every single day more and more data is produced, exchanged, processed, and transmitted around the world. The sheer amount of data processed every day is growing exponentially and by 2020 Intel has estimated that the average internet user will being consuming 1.5GB of traffic every 24 hours, while daily video traffic will have reached a staggering 1PB (1 Petabyte = 1000 Terabytes). The booming expansion of IoT devices, such as smart home technology and autonomous cars, is the driving force behind this monstrous growth prediction, with more and more data being collected and processed by every single device we purchase. When combined with the prospect of 5G technology and super-fast worldwide connections, data centers are already starting to groan at the thought of the massive strains that are likely to be placed on their processing capacity. And while data centres have already begun to upgrade to prepare for the onslaught of data and analytics, there is a new type of processing on everyone’s lips – Edge Computing. The idea sounds relatively simple, it is a distributed information technology architecture that allows client data to be processed at the “edge” of the network, as close to the source as possible. By utilizing the processing of intermediary and periphery servers, mobile services can get faster responses without putting stress on core network servers. Time-sensitive data can be processed at locally based intermediary servers, while data that is less time-sensitive can be sent to the cloud for big data analytics and long term storage. Sending massive amounts of raw data over a network can put huge strains on the network resources, so it does make sense to process data closer to its source rather than transmit it to a data centre and then back again. There have also been suggestions that smart devices could be designed to only transmit relevant data to further reduce the strain on networks as the volume of data increases over the next decade. For example, autonomous vehicles could monitor the oil level, or brake fluids, and then only transmit that data when the levels fall outside pre-set limit. Similarly, a Wi-Fi security camera could use edge analytics and only transmit data when a certain percentage of pixels change between frames. As IoT devices grow in processing power, each device could effectively become a mini data center. A self-driving car, which could well house up to and above 200 CPUs, “that’s a data center on wheels” commented venture capitalist Peter Levine at the Wall Street Journal’s CIO Network event in San Francisco earlier this month. He believes that a self-driving car will simply have too much data for it to be practical to constantly send it out to the cloud and back – especially since a self-driving car will need the data immediately! Then consider the vast field of other intelligent devices that will also be trying to use the cloud: “You will never have enough bandwidth and speed on the network between for that,” Levine declared. So each devices will deal with all of their own processing and storage, and send any relevant data to the cloud, which becomes like the brain for the system – analysing all the data and sending back what it learns to all the devices. So all the devices are able to learn not just from themselves, but from each other. “I can’t imagine there will ever not be a place for cloud computing,” Diana McKenzie, the CIO of Workday, told CIO.com. She envisions a future where cloud and edge computing work in tandem, complementing one another. Edge computing is likely to reduce the work that the cloud does at the moment, processing data for individual devices, and allow it to focus on big data analytics from fields of devices. The concept of edge computing is one that has become increasingly viable because of the sheer number of IoT devices being produced, the endlessly falling costs of computer components, and the advent of mobile computing. However, while there are numerous benefits to be had with using edge computing, there are several trade-offs that come along with the technology. It can reduce response time to mere milliseconds, as well as combat network latency and bottlenecks, but there are serious concerns regarding network security and licensing that need to be addressed before edge computing can be considered totally viable.

View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) — This designer and manufacturer of digital technology platforms was last reviewed by me on Nov. 16 when I recommended it as a buy “under $35” with a trading target at $40. Despite several successful trades during the year, the highest price since the last review occurred on Jan. 27 at $38.45, where it “double-topped” with the Oct. 5 high at $38.31. However, with the offer to purchase Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) at $63.54 per share and INTC’s decline to the mid-$30s, INTC’s high number of stock holders makes it attractive for another review. Despite “periods of lumpiness,” higher cloud investments, growth within “the Internet of Things” and increased demand for more powerful memory chips should benefit Intel. The company’s recent agreement to purchase MBLY, a leader in the research and development of advanced driver assistance systems, should help Intel cut prices while offering superior autonomous driving platforms. Standard & Poor’s anticipates that Intel’s cash flow will accelerate, which will enable it to raise its dividend and repurchase shares. The target for INTC is $41 and is based on a multiple of 13.9X 2018 EPS estimate of $2.94, up from EPS of $2.80 est. for 2017. INTC’s current dividend is $1.04, providing an annualized dividend yield of 2.95%. For the last year, INTC’s stock has advanced along a bullish support line. In November 2016 that line began to run coincident with the stock’s 200-day moving average. As noted above, the stock “double-topped” at about $38 in January and fell below the support line last week. However, on Wednesday it reversed up, with a CBR buy signal from my internal proprietary indicator. However, in order to confirm the reversal, it must regain the 200-day moving average now at $35.41. Thus, buy INTC at about $35 with a trading target of $41. A stop-loss order should be placed under the “CBR Buy” at $34.60. Click to Enlarge Tell us what you think about this article!

The Good The Dell XPS 15 has a beautiful, high-resolution and accurate broad-gamut display, and it incorporates the Nvidia GTX 1050 gaming GPU, which raises playtime performance in general-purpose laptops. The Bad The webcam is in a terrible location at the bottom of the display and the fan can get loud. The Bottom Line Powerful with a great screen, the Dell XPS 15 delivers solid gaming and affordable mobile workstation-class performance in a relatively compact package. 8.4 Overall Design 8.0 Features 9.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 8.0 Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Computers Laptops Dell XPS 15 (2017) Dell took what was arguably a best-in-class 15-inch Windows notebook and made it even better. It retains the line's terrific screen, premium build, svelte design and full feature set, boosting it for 2017 with the latest processors from Intel and Nvidia. It's more traditional and certainly a lot more staid than multipurpose hybrids models such as the HP Spectre x360, but it makes up for that with the power and features you can't really cram into a hybrid. I also think it eclipses the current (2016) MacBook Pro in most respects, including using it for photo and graphics work as well as gaming. If the choice is between the Mac's only standout features -- the clever Touch Bar and almost absurdly large touchpad -- and the Dell's far better features, specs and price, I'll take the Dell any time. Those features include a 4K touchscreen display with hardware calibration support, 100 percent Adobe RGB and most of the DCI-P3 coverage and excellent accuracy. Also included is a decent complement of connectors, an SD card reader and much stronger specs -- all for less money than the MacBook Pro. While it's a little bigger and heavier than the MacBook Pro, it's not so in any significant way. A bigger tradeoff is battery life, but that's a price you pay for more powerful components. And yes, the XPS runs Windows while the MacBook runs MacOS, but I'm not wedded to any particular operating system, though. While the 7th-generation Core processor probably contributes to better battery life, the real silicon standout for this model is the Nvidia GTX 1050 graphics processor. The 1050 is the lowest-end option in Nvidia's current notebook-processor line, incorporating its latest Pascal architecture. In addition to giving the system pretty solid gaming performance, Pascal has improved battery optimization over its predecessor. That's a huge boon for people who work in photo editing, design, 3D, video and other creative applications which use GPU acceleration, as well as the obvious gamers. While it's not as powerful as the last-generation, top-of-the-line 980M, those were generally used in gaming-specific systems. This class of notebooks usually used the 960M, and it's an improvement over that. However, the 1050 is also the only processor in the line that's not VR ready. And while the chip supports G-Sync, the XPS 15 doesn't seem to. I didn't notice any tearing (horizontal distortion across the screen when playing a PC game), though I believe it's already optimized internally for the laptop display. And I doubt G-Sync kicks in when connected to an external monitor, because the 1050 seems to communicate via the integrated graphics processor and G-Sync requires direct communication between the display as well as the chip. (If you disable the integrated chip, the Nvidia control panel claims it doesn't see the GPU, so you can't turn it on.) Penny wise The system seems quite expensive until you start thinking about what you're getting for the money, although the cheapest model looks like an exception. This year's crop of XPS 15 models incorporate 7th-generation Core i3, i5 or i7 processors. The entry model, a dual-core i3 with an HD (1,920 by 1,080-pixel) nontouch screen only comes with integrated graphics and starts at $999, It looks like a US-only option; in the UK you have a choice of Core i5 or or i7, and in Australia, only i7. If you don't need the wider color gamut and accuracy of the XPS' display or care about the speed boost of an SSD, you might as well go cheaper and get the more flexible Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 instead. It's slightly bigger and heavier, but it's a better value for the money. Once you start looking at models with the 1050 GPU, prices run from $1,250 (£1,350 or AU$2,500) to $2,550 (£1,800 or AU$3,700); if you want the 4K UHD display, you'll pay at least $1,650 in the US, £1,800 in the UK or AU$3,000 (Dell's Australia website is offering a further AU$450 off the 4K model as of this publication time). All of the 4K models incorporate a bigger 97Wh battery (compared to the standard 56Wh), which makes them about 0.5 pound/1.8 kilogram heavier -- our unit with the 4K display and 97Wh battery weighs 4.5 lbs/2kg. Dell doesn't offer a touch version of the HD display for the XPS 15, though, so you're out of luck if that's what you want. Dell XPS 15 (2017) Price as reviewed $2,075, £1,800, AU$3,000 Display size/resolution 15.6-inch, 3,840x2,160-pixel touch display PC CPU 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ PC Memory 16GB DDR4 SDRAM 2,400MHz Graphics 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Storage 512GB SSD Networking 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 Operating system Microsoft Windows 10 Home (64-bit) I think the cheapest configuration I'd recommend is the $1,450 (£1,430, AU$2,500) Core i7 with the HD display because of the combination of features and performance. Though if you're looking for the smallest and lightest performance Windows model in the 15-inch class, the XPS 15 is it for comparable configurations. With 4K, I think our $2,075 (£1,800, AU$3,000) test setup really is a sweet-spot model -- and it's a lot cheaper than the most closely configured MacBook, with a Radeon Pro 460 upgrade, at $2,900 (£2,790, AU$4,410).

The chip maker has unveiled the Optane SSD DC P4800X, a drive destined for the PCI Express or NVMe slots in servers. It only has 375GB of space, but its extremely low latency (typically under 10µs) and 2GB/s throughput means that it can serve as either a memory cache or storage. If you're involved in high-performance computing, online shopping or other categories obsessed with gobs of RAM and rapid turnaround times, this is theoretically your dream device. Intel also promises higher endurance than your typical SSD. The inaugural Optane model can withstand stresses normally associated with RAM, writing about 12.3 petabytes of data in its lifespan. You can get the drive right now if you're part of Intel's early shipping program, and there are promises of larger capacities (750GB and 1.5TB) and U.2 form factors coming later in 2017. Not that you're going to drop any of them into your gaming rig any time soon. The 375GB version costs a hefty $1,520 -- even if you could realistically buy one for home use, you'd get far more value out of a high-capacity conventional SSD. Optane won't be viable for mainstream PCs (outside of tiny capacities) until prices fall much, much lower.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor Rumor: AMD Working on 16 Core/32 Thread Ryzen CPU To Take The Performance Crown In The HEDT Spectrum By Usman Pirzada Mar 18, 2017 74Shares Share Tweet Submit A rumor has wafted up from the murky plains of Chiphell’s less reliable forums (via Overclock3d) and claims that AMD is working on a 16-core/32-thread CPU based on the Zen architecture. We already know of the Naples chip but that is part of AMD’s server spectrum and if there really is a 16 core chip in the commercial spectrum then it would be branded as a Ryzen part. AMD is allegedly working on a monstrous 16 Core/32 Thread Ryzen processor Here is a copy of the quote copied vis a vis from Overclockers: Related AMD Ryzen 5 Mainstream Processors Confirmed For April 11th Launch – 6 Core Ryzen 5 1600X To Cost $249, 4 Core Ryzen 5 1500X To Cost $189 Public knowledge by now but AMD has a new HEDT platform coming out in a couple of months. You’ll see more of it at Computex I believe. It’s a 16 core /32 Thread, quad channel behemoth. And it is insanely quick in the tests that Ryzen is already excelling at. So Cinebench, and all other related productivity programs. The gaming issues that were causing the Ryzen AM4 CPUs to behave erratically to say the least have been ironed out. It’s akin to a newer revision on a newer platform. This should be competing with the Xeon and of course 6950X Intel offers for $1700~$1800USD, but at about $1,000 USD if not less for some Skews. Coming soon. CPSs are pretty big physically, about twice the size of surrent 6950X CPUs and a bit more perhaps. And if you were hoping for pins, nope it’s strictly LGA! It’s NOT 8 channel, but Quad. Advertisement Will be a splendid competition between X299 and this AMD platform. Skylake-X is pretty good, not revolutionary but a meaningful step up in IPC and the clocks are pretty high as well. If Intel will have a 32 core part to compete on X299 remains to be seen, but the HEDT platform is going to change quite a bit in the next 4 to 6 months.? The Naples chip of course has been spotted multiple times on Zauba’s shipping database. The Summit Ridge platform is AMD’s mainstream platform with Zen architecture and 8 core dies. Naples on the other hand is the codename of the server platform; the very same platform which will be rocking Zen in 32 core flavors. This is not to be confused with the Zeppelin platform which will include a 32 Zen core/Vega based APU as well. The 32 Zen cores are tied together using AMD’s very own Coherent Fabric. The homegrown interconnect will support data rates of upto 100GB/s which is a lot faster than what the PCIe interface sustains (around 15GB/s). Not only that but latency has been reduced from 500ns to an unknown but allegedly smaller number. Related AMD Pinnacle Ridge CPUs and Raven Ridge APUs Detailed – High-Performance Pinnacle Ridge To Feature 8 Zen 2 Cores, Raven Ridge Comes With 4 Zen and 11 Vega GPU Cores Thanks to AMD’s lego-like build philosophy even Naples will actually be fabricated in an 8 core base design, with 16 and 32 core chips being produced in an MCM (Multi Chip Module) format. Up till now however, we had seen no real evidence (apart from the usual documentation) that such a monster processor was actually on the charts in the near future. The shipping entry was marked 20th June 2016 and lists the Naples Test Board. It is marked FOC which I assume stands for ‘Full Operational Capability’ meaning AMD has achieved this significant milestone in its Zen roadmap quite some time ago. Here’s the thing though, this very same lego-like build philosophy can allow AMD to roll out a 16 core variant in the commercial space as well, since both utilize the same socket, it really shouldn’t be an issue at all. In fact, yield theory dictates that AMD can roll out any number of cores from harvested dies from failed Naples chips (this includes 10 core, 12 core and yes even 16 core chips). Interestingly however, the rumor says that such an SKU might be based on the LGA socket – that would increase the difficulty of porting and conflicts with AMD’s current philosophy and is the one thing that makes me doubt the authenticity of this rumor. That is to say that AMD can easily roll out a 16 core Ryzen processor but its not going to be based on LGA – for that to happen, it will need to revamp everything from scratch and create a new socket (which this rumor dubs as the X399 socket).

We already knew that Microsoft and its hardware partners — namely Intel and AMD — will not provide official support for the newest generation of PC processors on operating systems released prior to Windows 10. “To achieve the highest confidence in the performance of our AMD Ryzen desktop processors, AMD validated them across two different OS generations, Windows 7 and 10,” said AMD with respect to Ryzen support. “However, only support and drivers for Windows 10 will be provided in AMD Ryzen desktop processor production parts.” Intel’s stance on the matter pretty much mirrors AMD’s comments. Microsoft is taking the drastic step of shutting down ALL access to Windows Update for Ryzen and Kaby Lake processors running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. This isn’t a matter of just missing out on driver updates to fully support the latest generation of processors on older operating systems — we’re talking about a complete blackout of Windows Update on all fronts.

(photo credit:JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH) A wide variety of subjects – ranging from “Jewish Misogyny in the 12th and 13th centuries” to “How to Reduce Salinity in the Kinneret” to “Artificial Intelligence in Games of Luck” – were tackled by high school students at the Intel-Israel Young Scientist Competition this week at Jerusalem’s Bloomfield Science Museum. The competition is the 20th in the museum’s 25 years. The competition for college scholarships reaches a higher level of difficulty every year, requiring greater levels of competence. Subjects are divided between environment and life sciences; history and social sciences; technology and computer sciences; and natural sciences and math. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. The teenage contestants appeared fully conversant with their projects, both theoretically and practically, when responding to questions from the judges. Some subjects were so distant from the Israeli high-school curriculum – such as “Conquests of the Mongolian Empire and their Influence” – that one might wonder what enticed the youngsters to investigate them. Others topics had practical repercussions, such as a device to make cardiovascular resuscitation more accurate and effective, and ways to introduce drugs into dental implants to make recovery faster. The winners will go abroad to compete in the Intel-International World Young Scientist Competition. With the $15 billion purchase of Israel’s Mobileye company on their minds, the youngsters must have looked forward to launching startups based on their own ideas. This year, 35 girls and 31 boys were named finalists. Winners will be announced on Tuesday. Relevant to your professional network?

The consumer drone hype is followed by the victory of the multicopters in the economy. Their abilities are growing as quickly as their areas of use. Intel is relying on unmanned flight models. Two German drone manufacturers (MAVinci & Ascending Technologies) have been purchased by the chip giant in the last few months. MAVinci from St. Leon-Rot produces surveying drones and their software. The Bavarian multi-rotor drone specialist Ascending Technologies (AscTec) is strongly represented in oil, gas, and energy management. Together with Intel, AscTec last developed the Falcon 8+A quadrocopter. This year at CeBIT a special Drone 2017 Park has been launched to educate consumers and business people. Drone 2017 CeBIT Show "Drones and unmanned systems on land and water have huge business potential," confirms Oliver Frese, director of Deutsche Messe AG. As a result, CeBIT is clearly expanding this subject field. "After the successful premiere in 2016, we created a top international event for technologies and solutions around unmanned systems with a focus on Unmanned systems and solutions ," explains the trade-fair organizer. About 100,000 visitors were interested in the offer in 2016. "Unmanned Systems & Solutions will be a visitor magnet in 2017 as well," Oliver Frese expects. The 2017 CeBIT focus in hall 17 consists of an exhibition, a flight show, and a conference. The Drone 2017 business opportunities are huge, the marketplace has extended over the past years. The focus is on business applications that currently stretch from logistics and measuring technology to agriculture and forestry, through the police and fire brigade, to trade and medicine. Potential future fields for the conference are the Internet of Things, big data applications, communication and infrastructure solutions, as well as research and development. Commercial drone business Matthias Beldzik, manager at Intel Germany, considers the drones "virtually flying computers that are smart and networked, and follow Moore’s law." This means that their abilities must continue to become more diverse, while they must continue to become smaller. "Drones in 2017 and beyond will be one of the great computing platforms of the future and will open up entirely new areas of innovation," says Beldzik in an interview with Gründerszene.de. "The year 2016 was the year of the consumer drone," Intel's manager says. "In the future we will see more being developed in the area of the commercial drone business." Camera equipped quadrocopters Chinese manufacturer Yuneec (hall 17, stand A54) is mostly looking at the field of emergency rescue as its main market. The company has made a name for itself with remote-controlled model airplanes and ultra-lightweight airplanes in the last 15 years. By now, its camera-equipped quadrocopters help the fire brigade, emergency squads, coast guards, and police forces to obtain an overview and overcome obstacles. Yuneec’s "Typhoon H" is deemed one of the best flying robots. It recognizes obstacles and can evade them independently. Globe UAV GmbH (hall 17, stand E26) from Delbrück does not use a classic remote control for its GUAV8 drone, but computer, keyboard, mouse, and the cell phone network. Within an operating radius of 30 km and a flight time of up to 60 minutes, the drone supplies aerial views and environmental data in real time. One example of effective work with the system would enable the operator, among others, to transfer video data to other mobile end devices (e.g., during police action). With its night vision function, the drone can also be used in the dark - e.g., to observe or to track. The police forces thus acquire an additional tool for following perpetrators. The thermal imaging camera can also help to recognize defective solar panels and wind turbines that have run hot, or to find missing persons. Professional control of drones Globe UAV drones can also be used for the maintenance of industrial facilities, pipelines, and power lines, along with forestry and agricultural areas. Spectair (hall 17, C08) considers itself a "pioneer in the flying robot industry." Since 2012, the service provider from Meerbusch has supported customers with project planning through to the professional control of drones and the preparation of raw data from aerial recordings. Spectair offers sensor and camera technology for the purpose of inspection, mapping, and surveying, for vegetation and environmental monitoring, and for film and photo productions. Spectair’s target is to become "the globally leading provider of drone services" and a market leader in the training of professional drone pilots.    Next  iPhone 2017 Edition RED    Previous  LG G6 preorder with free Google Home    News by brand:CeBIT    News by category:Drones    News by brand and category:CeBIT Drones Latest CeBIT announcements 2017 CeBIT Innovation Award Drones demo at CeBIT 2017 CeBIT 2017 Augmented Reality in vehicle development Edward Snowden Live-Conference at CeBIT 2017 CeBIT 2006 CeBIT 2006 without Sony CeBIT 2005 demonstrates stability at high level LetsGoDigital CeBIT 2004 coverage   Latest news headlines Google Android O Developer Preview New Honor 8 Pro phone Huawei Honor 8 Lite Oppo F3 Plus phone Samsung Mixed Virtual Reality at Six Flags Apple headquarters opens April 2017 128GB iPhone 7 Red Apple Clips app for iPhone and iPad Apple iPad 2017 tablet iPhone 2017 Edition RED Drone 2017 business at CeBIT LG G6 preorder with free Google Home 2017 CeBIT Innovation Award Drones demo at CeBIT 2017 CeBIT 2017 Augmented Reality in vehicle development       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Camera Mobile phones Rumors Premium Smartphones Smartwatches Tablets TV   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

JERUSALEM/BEIJING: China's economy may be 35 times larger than Israel's, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to use that to advantage during a three-day visit to Beijing as he looks to reorient Israel's economy toward Asia over Europe and the United States. A week after US chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation World’s Worst Surrogate Calls Monday’s House Intel Hearing “Red Baiting” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter World’s Worst Surrogate Calls Monday’s House Intel Hearing “Red Baiting” Posted at 7:00 pm on March 20, 2017 by Susan Wright Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Roger Stone. He’s that guy who eats his own toenail clippings on a dare, then gets upset when somebody calls him gross. Stone is the particularly noxious former Trump adviser who left Trump’s presidential campaign, after a series of inflammatory, racist comments on social media. He’s also the wart that won’t go away, as he has been a more shameless self-promoter than anybody on Team Trump could dream to be. And now he’s the guy who wants to clutch his pearls and play the outraged professional, after his name and some of his statements were brought up at Monday’s House Intel hearing into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. In a series of questions posed to FBI Director James Comey, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff repeatedly referenced some of Stone’s public statements during the campaign, specifically his contact with the hacker “Guccifer 2.0,” who has claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee last year. US intelligence officials believe Guccifer 2.0 to be a front for Russian intelligence. This shouldn’t be a shock to Stone. He has spoke openly about his contact with the hacker known as Guccifer. He’s bragged about it, even. Trending CNN: Trump Folks May Have Possibly Coordinated with Russia, Sources Might Say. Possibly. Patterico I actually talked about some of Stone’s braggadocio a couple of weeks ago. Now he’s making a loud noise because he was taken seriously. “Chairman Schiff is engaging in the worst kind of red baiting, fear mongering, it’s the new McCarthyism, and it’s mudslinging,” Stone said on SiriusXM radio’s “The Wilkow Majority.” “Any inference that my brief and now totally public exchange with Guccifer 2, who is alleged to be a Russian asset, is A) benign in its content, and more importantly, takes place at a time after the hacking and publication of the DNC documents by WikiLeaks.” I still can’t believe anybody is giving Stone a forum, but he continued: “This is does not constitute collusion,” he said. “I had no contact with Russians. This one has been manufactured by the intelligence service with an assist from Soros and Brock,” Stone added. “I’m not gonna stop fighting for Donald Trump, nor are they going to silence me. I am anxious to go to the committee. Let’s see if they can handle the truth.” If he was an actual friend of Donald Trump’s, he would shut up now. Trump should be really uneasy knowing this guy is heading into these hearings as his “advocate.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Tags: Donald Trump house intelligence committee Roger Stone Recent Stories ‘There Is No Plan B’: The House Votes Today on AHCA Caleb Howe 4 Reasons Devin Nunes’s Stunt Created More of A Mess Jay Caruso Pastor Tim Keller Too Conservative for Religious Award, Princeton Rescinds Kira Davis COMMENTS POSTING RULES  |  LOGIN TO COMMENT  |  REGISTER TODAY Trending 4 Reasons Devin Nunes's Stunt Created More of A Mess City of Boston and Hospital Violated Teen Girl's Human Rights, Hacker Who Fought for Her Faces 25 Years in Prison 'There Is No Plan B': The House Votes Today on AHCA CNN: Trump Folks May Have Possibly Coordinated with Russia, Sources Might Say.

Washington — Rep. Jim Himes on Monday said Connecticut natives Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign manager, and Roger Stone, a self-described Trump campaign consultant, are likely to be key witnesses as the House Intelligence Committee continues its investigation of Russian hacking and the U.S. elections. “I certainly would put him at the top of the list,” Himes, D-4th District, said of Manafort, a New Britain native. As far as Stone, who comes from Norwalk, Himes told reporters, ”He had a bizarre ability to predict what Wikileaks was going to do next.” Last summer, Wikileaks released hacked e-mails of the Democratic National Committee that may have hurt Hillary Clinton’s efforts to win the White House. On Monday Stone tweeted, “It’s only fair that I have a chance to respond 2 any smears or half truths about alleged ‘Collusion with Russians’ from 2day’s Intel Hearing,” Himes said he hoped for bipartisan agreement on the Intelligence Committee on a list of witnesses. The lawmaker was one of the most active members during a more than four-hour House Intelligence Committee hearing on Monday that featured FBI chief James Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers. At one point, he even got Comey to rebut a tweet that was sent out in real time by Trump during the hearing. Courtesy of Roger Stone Roger Stone The tweet said, “The NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral process.” Himes asked Comey, “Is that accurate?” Comey responded, “We’ve offered no opinion, have no view and have no information on potential impact because it’s never something we looked at.” Comey confirmed the FBI is investigating links and coordination that may have occurred between the Trump campaign and Russian hackers. Republicans grilled Comey and Rogers about efforts to uncover  who leaked information detailing former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn’s calls to the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. Democrats, meanwhile, pressed the witnesses on the investigation into Russian activity. Much of the questioning involved Stone’s admission that he was in contact with hacker Guccifer 2.0, believed to be a front for Russian intelligence, and had conversations with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Stone “played a role early on in his campaign but ended that role in August of 2015.” As far as Manafort, Spicer said,  he “played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time.” “I’ve run five campaigns, and I would say a campaign manager does not play a limited role,” Himes said. U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District Comey also said the FBI had no evidence former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, an accusation Trump made in an early-morning tweet in early March. Himes told reporters the wiretapping allegations hurt the credibility of the White House and the president. “How do we believe the president now when he says there’s an existential danger?” Himes asked. During the hearing Himes said Trump would attack anyone, including the cast of a Broadway hit — anyone, that is, but Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia. “He will attack the cast of Hamilton. He will attack Chuck Schumer. He will attack our allies Mexico, Australia, Germany. He will attack the intelligence community which you lead — associating you with McCarthyism and Nazism,” Hime said. But Himes said Russia and Putin are the “one person, and one country, which is immune, which is inoculated from any form of presidential attack, no matter what the behavior.” Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., urged the FBI to work quickly on its probe. “There is a big, gray cloud that you’ve now put over people who have very important work to do to lead this country,” he told Comey. “And so the faster you can get to the bottom of this, it’s going to be better for all Americans.” Tweet Print Filed Under: Politics Washington Donald Trump House Intelligence Committee Jim Himes Paul Manafort Roger Stone Russian hacking Trump campaign Wikileaks wiretapping About Ana RadelatMore by this author Ana is a longtime Washington correspondent who has won numerous awards, including from The Associated Press and Gannett, has written for more than a dozen newspapers, including USAToday; The (Jackson, Miss.)

Here's what investors need to know. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Mar 20, 2017 at 4:44PM After a strong showing late last week as the Federal Reserve opted to increase interest rates, the stock market was mostly flat on Monday, with major indexes fluctuating between positive and negative territory. But amid a flurry of encouraging analyst notes, there were a few individual companies that managed to buck the trend, and shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among those stocks that delivered outsized gains today. Let's take a closer look at what drove these unusual moves. AMD's new chips could offer a lift Shares of AMD climbed more than 7% as two optimistic analysts chimed in regarding the prospects of the company's new Ryzen 7 chips. First, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his buy rating on AMD stock, but also increased his per-share price target to $16 from $13. To justify his bullishness, Lipacis noted AMD's Ryzen 7 (which was launched on March 2, 2017) and Ryzen 5 (which will be available on April 11, 2017) processors should help the company take significant market share considering they offer comparable performance and more attractive pricing than similar chips from Intel. Lipacis further cited the potential for further share gains and revenue growth to come from the launch of AMD's more affordable Ryzen 3 processors later this year, noting they believe the company is still "in the early innings of its multi-year turnaround story." And AMD received more love in a separate note today from Susquehenna's Christopher Rolland, who maintained his own neutral rating on the stock but similarly increased his per-share price target to $12 from $9. Rolland outlined his belief that AMD is likely to exceed Wall Street's consensus revenue expectations in the coming quarter thanks to the Ryzen line's ongoing rollout, especially as sales to larger PC original equipment manufacturers like HP and Dell should commence as early as next month. Image source: AMD. Snap gets its first thumbs-up Meanwhile, after falling 27% over the past two weeks, shares of Snapchat parent Snap Inc. climbed as much as 4.7% -- but settled to gains of 2% at market close -- after the stock received its first buy rating, courtesy of Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak.  More specifically, Cakmak initiated coverage on Snap stock with a buy rating and price target of $25 per share, a healthy premium over Snap's current price just shy of $20 per share. But while Cakmak believes Snap should continue to outgrow its competition, he appeared to temper his enthusiasm by stating, "We recognize we are potentially giving too much credit for unproven skills in building a business, rather than just a product, but we see more to Snap than many suggest." With Snap shares having given up much of their initial gains following the company's IPO earlier this month, it's not terribly surprising to see Wall Street taking notice. NVIDIA is poised to sustain its stellar growth Finally, shares of NVIDIA jumped more than 3% on the day as Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated the graphics chip specialist's status on his firm's "Conviction Buy" list with a $130-per-share price target. Tari technically didn't boost his already positive opinion of NVIDIA, but he did express admiration for the importance of NVIDIA's off-the-shelf machine learning models and customer support after attending NVIDIA's Deep Learning Connect event in London last week. Moreover, Hari believes NVIDIA's planned strategic investments in the automotive, data center, and enterprise markets should be able to drive results similar to its successful core gaming segment. So even with shares having more than tripled over the past year, the analyst believes NVIDIA shares should have plenty more room to run. Steve Symington owns shares of Nvidia.

The news came during Comey's testimony alongside National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Roger before the House Intelligence Committee. The Hill's Katie Bo Williams has the story: The bombshell revelation puts an end to months of roiling speculation and frustration on the part of Democrats, who saw the director's silence as a double-standard after Comey's repeated disclosures in the FBI's investigation into Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonObama and Trump haven’t talked since inauguration Perez, Ellison start multistate ‘turnaround tour’ for Dems Watergate reporter on Russia: 'I’ve been saying for a while there’s a coverup going on' MORE's private email server. In a dramatic moment at the beginning of a hotly anticipated House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the U.S. election, Comey announced that he had been authorized by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to break bureau policy and publicly disclose the probe. ADVERTISEMENT "As you know our practice is not to confirm the existence of an ongoing investigation," he said. "But in usual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so." Read more here.

The Hill's Jordan Fabian has the story here. The White House also sought to distance itself from some former Trump campaign officials, claiming many of them did not play a large role in the campaign. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said former campaign chairman Paul Manafort had only a "limited role." The Hill's Jonathan Easley has more on that here.

The Hill's Ellen Mitchell reports: Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis told reporters Monday U.S. Central Command (Centcom) is assessing reports of civilian deaths after a March 16 strike. Observer groups reported that at least 49 people were killed in the airstrike, which targeted a building near a mosque in the village of Al-Jineh in the northern province of Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the destroyed building belonged to the mosque and was part of the same compound. Davis said he had no information on whether the building was affiliated with a mosque. "We did not judge this to be a mosque," he said.

In a letter released Monday, the senators quoted Defense Secretary James Mattis's support for the program in arguing for additional visas. "Keeping our promise to those Afghans who meet the strict qualifications of this program is a strategic imperative as well as a moral one," they wrote. "During his confirmation process, Secretary Mattis noted that 'most of our units could not have accomplished their missions without the assistance, often at risk to their lives, of these courageous men and women,' and he pledged to work to ensure such individuals are not left behind."

The latest report found that more than a quarter of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) rolled over to backup centers, much higher than the Veterans Affairs Department goal of 10 percent. Further, the report said, none of the recommendations made in the original February 2016 report have been fully implemented. "Veterans are at a disproportionately high risk for suicide compared to the rate of U.S. civilian adults," Michael Missal, Veterans Affair inspector general, said in a statement. "The VCL is a critical effort to reduce veteran suicide for those who call in crisis. Therefore, it is imperative that VA take further steps to increase the effectiveness of VCL operations."

The Nasdaq composite index on Monday was the latest U.S. stock market benchmark to hit an all-time high as the bull market, which turned officially 8 years old this month, marches on. Many investors, strategists and traders believe the run will continue as dealmaking picks up, President Donald Trump's tax reform is enacted and earnings continue to improve. "The economic environment has improved to such an extent that the Federal Reserve appears to have greater confidence and commitment to its process of interest rate normalization," said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management. "After eight years of a recovery bull market, many investors (institutional and retail) who had stayed on the sidelines and away or light on equity exposure appear to be coming back into the market with some adding international exposure." The Nasdaq hit an all-time intraday high Monday as shares of Apple hit a new peak. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average are within about 1 percent of new highs hit earlier this year. The S&P 500 is up 251 percent since its financial crisis low close on March 9, 2009. To be sure, there are a growing number of bears on Wall Street, but most of the concerns don't center on a specific catalyst, but on ebullient sentiment that's led to above-average valuations in the face of rising interest rates. "Market valuations are still too expensive," said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies. "When the Fed hikes a third, fourth and even fifth time, performance starts to slip for the overall market." We'll get to the bearish reasons in just a bit, but let's look first at what's got the bulls so excited about the rest of this year. Bullish: Investment banking boom The Snap IPO hasn't worked out great for investors who bought after its debut but the shares are still 17 percent above their offering price. And the biggest technology IPO since 2014 is getting animal spirits flowing among bankers on Wall Street. There have been 23 IPOs so far this year, already triple the amount at the same time last year, according to Renaissance Capital. "Increase in IPOs means more stock 'currency' will be used for M&A, driving up the stocks of companies that can be acquisition candidates," said James Altucher, former hedge fund manager and current entrepreneur and author. "More IPO currency will be created this year than the past five years combined." And dealmaking is indeed showing signs of picking up with Intel's $15.3 billion offer for driverless technology play Mobileye a week ago. The purchase of the heavily shorted stock was a wake-up call for hedge funds placing bets against the stock market: there's still a lot of cheap capital out there looking to be deployed before rates go higher. As CNBC's Mike Santoli pointed out in his CNBC PRO column Monday, shares of boutique investment banks like Lazard, Greenhill & Co. and Evercore Partners are really perking up in anticipation this year in anticipation of an M&A boom. Bullish: President Trump While more extensive tax reform is likely, the bulls argue there is plenty of room for President Donald Trump and Congress to err. All they really need to do is approve some form of repatriation tax cut, the bulls say. ﻿S&P 500 members have $2.4 trillion stashed overseas that could potentially come here if taxes are lowered on overseas profits, according to Strategas Research Partners. "A deemed repatriation is part of all four major tax options that will be sent to the President when deciding upon a plan," wrote Daniel Clifton, policy analyst at Strategas, in a note last week. "We would not be surprised if $1 trillion was returned back to the U.S. that could be used for investment, job creation, share repurchases, dividends, M&A, and to pay down debt." Some bulls believe that even without any tax reform, it's enough for market confidence and multiples that we are entering at least a four-year period of deregulation. "I am still bullish," said Jim Iuorio, trader at TJM Institutional Services. "The real story isn't so much the appearance of Donald Trump as it is the absence of President Obama. Toward the end he became the regulation president." Bullish: Earnings growth For the quarter ending this month, S&P 500 earnings are expected to increase by 10 percent, more than the 6 percent profit growth last quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Earnings in the technology sector, the group that has lifted the Nasdaq to records this month, are expected to jump 16 percent this quarter, according to S&P. If stock prices ultimately follow earnings, these are good numbers for the bulls. This is a "transition from an interest rate-driven to an earnings-driven secular bull market," wrote Jeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, in an email. "The profit lows came in 2Q16." The bears argue stock prices are moving too high relative to earnings, raising multiples to historically high levels. The trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio has jumped to above 21 times from 16.7 in February of 2016, according to Oppenheimer. "The indices are determined by the biggest companies," said Altucher. Apple "is trading at just 13 times earnings." Bearish: Everyone's too bullish Many of the bears keep citing that bullish sentiment has gotten too high. They argue that when everyone's bullish, there's no one left to buy and so a bull market ends. "We are currently experiencing multi-decade high extremes of optimism, and we view this euphoria as a warning sign," said Brad Lamensdorf, short seller and newsletter writer, in his Lamensdorf Market Timing Report. The number of bulls in the oft-cited Investors Intelligence newsletter survey reached 63 percent in February, the highest since 1987, a contrarian sell signal for many. "The bull market is not over, but a correction is coming," said Jim Lebenthal of Lebenthal Asset Management. "Investor sentiment surveys have very high levels of bullish respondents, and they have for a few months now. That usually presages a decline." Bearish: President Trump As often as President Donald Trump is cited by the bulls, he is cited by the market bears. "The market is in consolidation phase awaiting progress on fiscal policy while nervous about President Trump's ability to maintain the support of the Republican majority in the face of his lack of prioritization as to what is important (fiscal policy) and what is not (wiretap allegations)," said Stephen Weiss of Short Hills Capital Partners in an email. Bearish: Rising Rates The bears believe that low interest rates have been the primary driver of this bull, allowing companies to borrow cheaply to buy back their own stock and making ballooning multiples acceptable on a relative basis. Now that the Fed is in an interest rate hiking cycle, with moves to shrink its balance sheet likely on the horizon, the bears believe the run fueled by cheap money is over. But Eddy Elfenbein, manager of the AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF, points out that real rates (interest rates minus inflation) are still low. The "median Fed member sees the range for fed funds rates to be 2 percent to 2.25 percent by the end of 2018," said Elfenbein citing the latest Fed "dot plot" data. "They also see inflation at 2 percent. That means real rates will remain negative (and next to negative) for nearly two more years." "That's the strongest point in the bulls favor," he said.

Things just got more bizarre today, when White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer tried to mitigate damages from the hearing by saying Manafort played a “limited” role Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Elizabeth WarrenElizabeth WarrenSenate nixes Obama-era workplace safety rule Five takeaways from Labor pick’s confirmation hearing Warren: 'No confidence' in Trump's Labor pick MORE (D-Mass.) says President Trump should focus on current problems rather than looking ahead to the 2020 election.  Warren has been floated as a potential Democratic White House contender, and Trump has said he'd love to face off against the liberal senator. “He wants to do his tweets, he wants to think about how big his [inauguration] crowd size was, he wants to think about what happens four years from now,” Warren said Monday during a town hall in Springfield, Mass. “What I’m thinking about is what Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTillerson to embassies: ID groups for tougher screening US probes Manafort’s banking: report America must improve defense against Russia's information warfare MORE is doing to this country today,” Warren added. "That’s what really, really has me up and working hard.” ADVERTISEMENT Warren slammed Trump’s impact on the middle class two months after he entered the Oval Office, saying he's "delivered one gut punch after another to hardworking" American families. “The whole reason I ever ended up in politics is because I wanted to fight for working families and this is the fight I am in every single day,” added Warren. Trump said in an interview broadcast last Saturday that Warren launching a presidential bid against him would be “a dream come true.” “I think she’d lose so badly,” he said on Fox News’s “Watters’ World." "I think she hurt Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonObama and Trump haven’t talked since inauguration Perez, Ellison start multistate ‘turnaround tour’ for Dems Watergate reporter on Russia: 'I’ve been saying for a while there’s a coverup going on' MORE very badly.” “I watched those speeches — the anger, the hatred, in her heart — and I said, ‘Ya know, she’s really bad for Hillary,’” Trump added of Warren’s work as a campaign surrogate for Clinton last year.

During today’s House Intel Committee hearing, Democratic Congressman Denny Heck said that the evidence they’ve all heard today leads him to conclude that Russia “had help from the inside”: …that this was in part an inside job from U.S. persons, willing American accomplices or terribly naive ones, or probably both, who helped the Russians attack our country and our democracy. “We’re not indicting anyone,” he added, “we’re merely laying out some of the evidence and the facts, dirty though they may be.” Heck spoke at some length about how this is about patriotism and not party, before circling back to talking about “the use of U.S. persons of influence, whether through active collusion or coordination or naive acquiescence — we don’t know yet the full extent.” He singled out people like Roger Stone and Michael Flynn in particular before declaring that “the attack didn’t end on election day.” Heck’s question to James Comey and NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers was to explain to him and the American people “why we should care” about these Russian efforts.

The FBI said just before the election that that material — emails discovered on the computer of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner — did not change the bureau's recommendation that there should be no charges.  Comey confirmed during the hearing on Monday before the House Intelligence Committee that the bureau is investigating Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. The FBI is also investigating any links or coordination between Russia and President Trump's campaign.  Many on Twitter were quick to joke in light of the hearing that Conway's tweet "did not age well."

The controversy swirling around former national security adviser Michael Flynn over his ties to a Turkish businessman who clearly hired him to lobby on Turkey’s behalf is a further example of how inept Turkey is at promoting itself. Summary⎙ Print Though the pro-government Turkish media continues to studiously ignore the affair, the US media is busy probing former national security adviser Michael Flynn's ties to a Turkish businessman who hired him to lobby for Ankara. Author Amberin Zaman Posted March 20, 2017 The retired general conceded in a filing with the Justice Department that a $500,000+ deal he signed with Turkish entrepreneur Ekim Alptekin prior to taking office “could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey.” By all accounts, it did not benefit Turkey at all. The affair has spurred a slew of unfavorable articles in the American media probing Flynn’s relationship with the businessman and his Dutch-registered company Inovo. It's not just Flynn who's come out looking bad. Alptekin initially denied that the contract was for lobbying, saying it was mainly to do “geopolitical analysis.” He still denies any ties to Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party or receiving any money from the Turkish government to pay Flynn. The Turkish government is known to use a slush fund called the Ortulu Odenek to finance propaganda against its perceived enemies. For years, these foes were Armenians and Kurds. Today, the government's top target is the Sunni cleric accused of masterminding the botched July coup. The largely pro-government Turkish media has determinedly ignored the Flynn affair, but the American press continues to dig up further details of Flynn’s Turkey ties. The findings squarely contradict some of Alptekin’s earlier statements. The New Yorker's account of a Sept. 19 meeting arranged by Alptekin between Flynn, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law, hardly fit Alptekin’s characterization of the assignation. In a March 10 interview with Al-Monitor, Alptekin called the meeting a “last-minute thing.” Flynn was flanked by former CIA Director Jim Woolsey and Brian McCauley, a former FBI agent. The Turks “sought, among other things, Flynn’s assistance in maligning Fethullah Gulen, a self-exiled cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, whom Erdogan blamed for the attempted coup,” The New Yorker reported. Alptekin told Al-Monitor he had reclaimed $95,000 from Flynn because the lobbying component of the contract was “never executed.” Flynn Intel Group had paid lobbying and public relations firm SGR $40,000 to work on a project that included designing a bizarre Monopoly-inspired graphic depicting Gulen as the “Mula Mullah” whose secret organization had “mastered the game of political and economic influence.” Alptekin told Al-Monitor he found the graphic “ridiculous” and that he shared it with contacts via WhatsApp “for a laugh.” Similarly, an op-ed penned by Flynn for The Hill that was meant to vaunt Erdogan and Turkey and discredit Gulen also failed to please Ankara. In the Nov. 8 essay, Flynn called Gulen a “shady Islamic mullah” and likened his organization to the Muslim Brotherhood. He was apparently unaware that Erdogan is a big supporter of the Egypt-based movement. Flynn’s efforts with Congress seem to have been just as unsuccessful. The Daily Beast revealed in a March 17 report that Flynn Intel representative Bijan Kian had met with House Homeland Security Committee staffers to convince them to back Turkey’s demands to extradite Gulen. “It was a sloppy, uncompelling presentation,” a congressional staffer familiar with the substance of the exchange told the publication. In his latest piece, The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross, who has been at the vanguard of reporting on the Flynn Turkey scandal, drew unwelcome attention to hacked emails allegedly belonging to Albayrak that were published in December by WikiLeaks. They include alleged exchanges with Halil Danismaz, the former president of the Turkish Heritage Foundation, a New York-based outfit that overtly promotes the Turkish government. In the messages, Danismaz is seen proposing various lobbying strategies in a PowerPoint presentation and talking about paying endless fees to influential American journalists in exchange for burnishing Turkey’s image. Ross noted, “While the Turkish government has questioned the legitimacy of the emails, WikiLeaks provided what’s called a DKIM verification for emails sent by Gmail showing they have not been altered or edited." Turkish officials have denounced the emails, which were illegally obtained by the Turkish hacktivist collective Redhack and published last October, as manipulated. Three Turkish journalists who either downloaded or reported on the contents of the emails were jailed in December, further swelling Turkey’s bloated population of incarcerated media professionals.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Israeli Tech Firms Revving Up Engines for Self-Driving Cars By Josef Federman PUBLISHED: MARCH 20 2017 As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. "In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more," said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. "Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye." She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion's annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister's Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel's only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is "ripe for change." He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. "What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in," he said. Israel has long billed itself as "Startup Nation" for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. "This is far from a one-day or one-week story," Granoff said. "This is going to be a story for the next 10 years." Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google's more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. "The deal confirms Israel's global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies," said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. "The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups." There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel's autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. "This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak," he said. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

It's Harder for a Plane To Vanish 4. Galileo Satellites Hit by Anomalies 5. Qualcomm Drones Learn as They Fly Next Article > Google Maps Already Tracks You; Now Other People Can, Too By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 22 2017 Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family -- the latest test of how much privacy people are willing to sacrifice in an era of rampant sharing. The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long -- anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser's toolkit," she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn't as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called "Find My Friends" on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. "We don't feel like we are changing the game," said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they're still sharing their location, a step that Glenn said may help anyone who didn't know an abusive partner was still following them. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Intel To Buy Mobileye for $15.3 Billion Next Article > President of Embattled Uber Leaves After 6 Months on Job By Olga R. Rodriguez PUBLISHED: MARCH 20 2017 Jeff Jones, president of the embattled ride-hailing company Uber, has resigned just six months after taking the job, the company confirmed Sunday. In a brief statement, Uber didn't say why Jones left. "We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best," it said. Jones told the tech blog Recode, which first reported his resignation, that his values didn't align with Uber's. "The beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride sharing business," he said in a statement. Jones is the latest of several high-level executives to leave the San Francisco-based company. Last month, a top engineering executive, Amit Singhal, left Uber five weeks after his hire was announced. He allegedly failed to disclose that he'd left his previous job at Google because of a sexual harassment allegation. Ed Baker, Uber's vice president of product and growth, resigned earlier this month. So did Charlie Miller, Uber's top security researcher, who left to join Didi, China's larger ride-hailing company. Jones' departure comes days after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said the company will hire a chief operating officer who can help write its "next chapter." Jones had left Target, where he was chief marketing officer, to join Uber in September. Uber has been hit by several controversies, including allegations that it routinely ignores sexual harassment. A recent video showed Kalanick profanely berating a driver who confronted him about steep cuts in Uber's rates. Uber also acknowledged it has used a program to thwart authorities who have been trying to curtail or shut down its service in cities around the world. The company also has faces challenges in court. Waymo, a self-driving car company that used to be part of Google, last month sued Uber in federal court, alleging betrayal and high-tech espionage. The complaint accuses Anthony Levandowski, a former top manager for Google's self-driving car project, of stealing technology now propelling Uber's effort to build an autonomous vehicle fleet. Uber denied Waymo's claims, calling them "a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Photographer: Olivier Douliery/Abaca Press/TNS WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey took the extraordinary step on Monday of announcing that the FBI is investigating whether members of President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Comey’s remarks before the House Intelligence Committee created a treacherous political moment for Trump, who has insisted that “Russia is fake news” that was cooked up by his political opponents to undermine his presidency. Comey placed a criminal investigation at the doorstep of the White House and said agents would pursue it “no matter how long that takes.” Comey also dismissed Trump’s claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor during the campaign, a sensational but unfounded accusation that has served as a distraction in the public debate over Russian election interference. The New York Times and other news organizations have reported the existence of the investigation into the Trump campaign and its relationship with Russia, but the White House dismissed those reports as politically motivated and rallied political allies to rebut them. Comey’s testimony on Monday was the first public acknowledgment of the case. The FBI typically discloses its investigations only in the rare circumstances when officials believe it is in the public interest. “This is one of those circumstances,” Comey said. Counterintelligence investigations are among the FBI’s most difficult and time-consuming cases, meaning the cloud of a federal investigation could hang over the Trump administration for years. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that the President Vladimir Putin of Russia personally ordered a covert effort to hurt Hillary Clinton’s chances and aid Trump. That included the hacking of political targets including the Democratic National Committee and releasing embarrassing emails through the website WikiLeaks. Comey said the FBI was “investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.” U.S. officials have said that they have so far found no proof of that, but current and former officials say they have uncovered evidence that Trump’s associates were in repeated contact with Russian officials — including people tied to Russian intelligence. Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump, has acknowledged communicating with Guccifer 2.0, an online persona believed to be a front for Russian intelligence officials involved in disseminating hacked Democratic emails. Stone has denied that there was anything improper about the contact, and he was one of many, including political operatives and journalists, to communicate with the hackers. Last July, the month that WikiLeaks began releasing the hacked emails, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, visited Moscow for a speaking engagement. Page has declined to say whom he met there, but he has said they were mostly scholars. Michael Flynn, a Trump campaign adviser who went on to be his national security adviser, was paid more than $65,000 by companies linked to Russia in 2015, including an American branch of a cybersecurity firm believed to have ties to Russia’s intelligence services, according to congressional investigators. Flynn was forced to resign after misrepresenting his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Democrats listed those Russian connections and others as they painted Trump as a candidate who adopted pro-Russia views and courted Russian interests. “Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence?” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the committee’s top Democrat. “Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated.” Trump began the day with Twitter posts denying any collusion with Russia and criticizing leaks of classified information about the investigation. By midday, the White House was citing Comey’s testimony to suggest that members of the Obama administration had coordinated leaks against Trump. Republicans made similar allegations on Capitol Hill, using their questions to Comey as a way to criticize the news coverage about the Russia investigation and chastise government officials who speak anonymously to journalists. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the committee, has said that rooting out those leakers is a priority. “We aim to determine who has leaked or facilitated leaks of classified information so that these individuals can be brought to justice,” he said. The White House has insisted that there is nothing left to investigate about Russia and has instead asked Congress to look into Trump’s claims that he was wiretapped. Trump made those allegations in a flurry of Twitter posts early this month. The White House has stood by those claims even in the face of conclusions from all corners of the government that they are false. “I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,” Comey said, adding that the Justice Department also had no evidence.

As every year, it is a big event that gathers the greatest collection of companies and people in the mobile industry. This year was no exception, as MWC was the meeting grounds for our industry and an opportunity to see what’s ahead. Although there was a lot of coverage of smartphones and devices, cloud solutions, NFV/SDN network solutions, 5G, and content delivery, I noticed one theme in particular that stuck out: the maturing and rapidly expanding solutions around the connected world. From smart cities to connected cars and autonomous vehicles, to smart homes, to connected medical devices, and the list goes on. Some of the highlights of connected world solutions from different companies at MWC included: AT&T’s smart cities, telematics, connected healthcare/medical devices and other data communities that will leverage their Indigo Platform and run on their SDN network. Ford highlighting their City of Tomorrow, which included their CARR-E spare tire transport devices. Verizon introducing their Exponent IoT Platform available to other service providers for Smart Communities, Connected Homes, Smart Utilities, and Telematics. Intel highlighting their new chips with embedded 5G capabilities, which will be available in future BMW models for instant connectivity and as a platform to build telematics and autonomous vehicle applications. City of Taiwan with FarEastOne highlighting their Smart City initiative that covers functions like Water Disaster Management, Community Health, Smart Transportation, Smart City Operation, and Management Center, Mobile Education Platform, and Mobile Commerce Ecosystem. What was interesting about all the connected world solutions at MWC this year was how illustrative they were on the core principles that are needed in this newly connected world of digital ecosystems: All solutions need to work with each other across an expanding ecosystem of partners and environments. They need easy interoperability across solutions. All solutions need the ability to grow with new expanded functions beyond their initial starting point. The connected world will need to run on a system of trust across ecosystem partners and consumers. These core principles consistently highlight the need for open source technologies that can support repeatable and sustainable solutions with a strong sense of collaboration across ecosystem partners. If we look at the development of smart cities, each city has its own priority of what function to start with (emergency flood services vs. transportation management vs. community health services, etc.). Each smart city will develop and prioritize functionality based on their needs but will need to interact with connected cars, connected homes, connected medical devices, and with other smart cities to allow its citizens and merchants to best leverage its facilities. Although each smart city is different, they all need a framework that allows expansion, growth, and interoperability with other ecosystems. The connected world runs on data: from the movement of data across multiple edge devices to the collection and correlation of data for intelligent decision-making. The need for managing data movement and analytics at the edge and accumulated data analytics for intelligent actions has driven the use of open source NiFi for managing data movement and open source Hadoop for big data actionable intelligence across the new connected world ecosystems. We are seeing a greater use of Hadoop-based solutions (including HDFS, Yarn, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Hive, Hbase) that incorporate machine learning for the collection and correlation of massive amounts of data that are generated and processes in the connected world to drive intelligent actions and contextually aware real-time decision making. It allows smart cities and connected cars to aggregate data across the different functional component data sources to identify new insights and drive intelligent actions to respond to the ever-changing environmental conditions. We are also seeing NiFi and MiNiFi (for smaller devices) based solutions used extensively in the connected world for the collection and distribution of data from multiple devices to support the ecosystems for smart cities, connect cars, connected homes, connected medical devices, and other connected world solutions. NiFi has the advantage of easily managing the data movement across a very large set of diversified devices with bi-directional data flow and the ability to track data lineage across the end-to-end ecosystem. This has allowed the ever changing connected world solutions to have the flexibility to change at their required pace. It has also supported the need for trust across the connected world ecosystem through real-time traceability and event level providence, allowing consumers and partners in the connected world ecosystems a level of confidence of where their data has gone and how is it being used. This will be a continued theme in 2017 as the connected world will need greater interoperability across ecosystems and data analytics across a diversified set of data sources and devices will drive greater real-time decision making for functioning smart cities, connected cars, connected homes, connected medical devices, and other parts of the connected world. I look forward to seeing how next year’s Mobile World Congress will reflect the accelerated adoption of the connected world. We may even see all exhibitor solutions connected together in one connected world model.

(TSMC), a major chip supplier to Apple, is set to decide on opening a U.S. plant next year, according to Reuters. TSMC, which is the largest contract chipmaker, supplied chips for Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 7. Read: Samsung vs. Apple: SK Giant Suppliers Doubt iPhone Display-Embedded Touch ID The chip company had previously said it had not ruled out the idea of opening up a facility in the United States, however, a spokesperson told Reuters recently TSMC “won’t make a decision until next year.” The company makes 65 percent of its revenue from the U.S., but said there would be downsides to building a plant in America. "We would sacrifice some benefits if we move to the States. But we have flexibility in Taiwan. If an earthquake happened for instance (in Taiwan), we could send thousands of people here as support, whereas it's harder in the States," the spokesperson said. The comment draws from a previous experience. In February 2016, an earthquake struck Taiwan and affected the company months before the release of the iPhone 7. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reports the chipmaker will decide on opening a U.S. plant in the first half of 2018 and is considering investing $16.41 billion on the facility. Read: iPhone 8 Release Rumors: New iPhone Will Come With 'Gentler' Curved OLED Display TSMC’s consideration of opening a U.S. plant comes after previous reports pointing to Apple’s interest in Intel, especially after President Donald Trump criticized American companies for manufacturing their products overseas (Intel is based in the U.S.). Previous reports say Apple could switch to Intel chips for its 2018 iPhone generation. Foxconn technology Group, another Taiwan-based company and Apple supplier is also looking into opening a facility United States. Last December, the company confirmed to International Business Times its exploration of an expansion in the U.S. However, the company’s chairman, Terry Gou, raised uncertainties over the plans earlier this month because he wasn’t sure U.S. officials could work quickly enough to attract foreign companies like Foxconn to build large plants in the states.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Qualcomm declares Snapdragon processors aren’t ‘processors’ at all Qualcomm declares Snapdragon processors aren’t ‘processors’ at all By Joel Hruska on March 20, 2017 at 11:15 am Comment Qualcomm acknowledges that “processor” is an accepted and broadly used generic term for a wide range of products, including ASICs, CPUs, DSPs, GPUs, MICs, and probably at least a few others. It also admits that we already have a term to describe microprocessors that integrate a wide range of functionality, including Wi-Fi, I/O, cellular radios, cache, and memory controllers. We call that an SoC (System on Chip). Nevertheless, Qualcomm no longer feels that term is big enough, either. Its argument is below: The Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Platform takes our offerings beyond a single chip. While the single processor form factor is truly a system-on-a-chip (SoC), housing custom technology like an integrated modem, CPU, GPU, and DSP, there is a lot more going on outside of the chip that is designed to ultimately support a wide variety of devices. Technologies from the RF Front End — without which your mobile device wouldn’t be able to acquire a signal, make a phone call, or surf the web — to Qualcomm Quick Charge, the Qualcomm Aqstic audio DAC, Wi-Fi (802.11ac and 11ad), touch controllers, and finger print technology, are all engineered to work together with the SoC to deliver a superior and smooth user experience. With the Snapdragon mobile platform we can now articulate the value that we provide to a device manufacturer — from developing algorithms for great pictures and videos, to making sure that the battery is long lasting. More importantly, the word “platform” will be used to explain the combined key user experiences — camera, connectivity, battery life, security, immersion — that these essential technologies are designed to deliver. And these experiences are not just for smartphones anymore, but are applicable across verticals such as automotive, IoT, and mobile PCs. There’s some precedent for this kind of rebranding effort. When Nvidia launched its Tegra 2 smartphones, it attempted to rebrand Tegra products as “super phones” rather than the already-common “smartphone.” It was a blatant attempt to use marketing to position a device as somehow superior to other smartphones on account of being labeled differently, as opposed to actually being better. It was also never clear how the branding was supposed to scale — if devices based on Tegra 2 are “super phones,” and devices based on, Tegra 3 or Tegra 4 are “super tablets,” powered by “super chips,” how did any of this help customers make decisions about which products to buy? I’d argue it didn’t. The other example is from farther back in time. Intel launched its Centrino brand in 2003, as an ostensible way of promising end users they’d receive better battery life, better performance, and better wireless network connectivity than they would if they used a non-Centrino solution. Centrino-branded systems all required an Intel processor, chipset, and wireless solution. But while there are historical parallels to the current situation, what Qualcomm seems to be going for is much more aggressive. It’s one thing to take CPU and graphics and declare these are essential to your product’s value offering. It’s another entirely to claim you’re changing your own brand conversation by including things like an RF Front End, Qualcomm’s Aqstic sound tech, touch controllers, or finger print technology. While I don’t want these components to suck, I also don’t spend much time worrying about whether my phone packs the latest version of Aqstic. Then the company goes further, claiming that by referencing a “platform,” they’re explaining key user experiences around cameras, connectivity, battery life, security, and whatever Qualcomm is referring to when it says “immersion.” A solution to Qualcomm’s antitrust problem, long-term product scaling I can only think of two good reasons for Qualcomm to make a redefinition like this. First, the company has come under heavy fire from antitrust regulators and other companies around the world for its licensing practices and patent royalty rates. Second, we’re reaching a point of diminishing marginal returns in smartphone performance. It’s not as easy as it once was to wave a hand and deliver 20-30% improved performance year-on-year. Either way, by declaring Snapdragon a platform, Qualcomm can also claim to always have improved the product, even if the improvements themselves are marginal. After all, when you include things like software and your RF front end in the definition of your “platform,” then you’re rarely going to run out of ways to showcase your innovations to the public — and you don’t have to explain exactly how this Snapdragon is better or different than the old Snapdragon. Remember, the high-end products are all Snapdragon. Come to think of it, this does remind me of another company — Microsoft, and its “Everything is Windows 10 always and forever now” position. It wasn’t great then, and it isn’t great now. Mostly it just confuses people. And with all due respect to Qualcomm, which makes great products and technology in general, it’s hard to see how this move is positive for anyone but the company’s legal and marketing teams. It’s not better engineering, and it’s not better for customers.

Officials investigating the matter have said they believe Moscow had hacked into Democrats' computers in a bid to help Mr Trump's election bid. National Security Agency director Michael Rogers later told the committee that the intelligence community stands behind its January assessment that it is highly confident Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of electing Mr Trump. Mr Rogers said that his agency is working to provide congress with the material it needs to investigate the intelligence agencies' findings. Both Mr Comey and Mr Rogers said they have no evidence or intelligence that Russian cyber actors changed vote tallies in key states during last year's poll. They both said they have no evidence that any vote tallies were changed in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina or Ohio. Mr Trump took to Twitter before the hearing began, accusing Democrats of making up allegations about his campaign associates' contact with Russia during the election. He said Congress and the FBI should be going after media leaks, and maybe even Hillary Clinton, instead. Mr Trump also suggested, without evidence, that Mrs Clinton's campaign was in contact with Russia and had possibly thwarted a federal investigation. What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 Update 2.59pm: Mr Comey told the US House Intelligence Committee: "This work is very complex, and there is no way for me to give you a timetable for when it will be done." Earlier in the hearing, the chairman of the committee contradicted an earlier assertion from Mr Trump by saying that there had been no wiretapping of Trump Tower. However, representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican whose committee is one of several investigating, said that other forms of surveillance of Mr Trump and his associates have not been ruled out. National Security Agency director Michael Rogers will also address the hearing later. Mr Trump tweeted: "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 Update 2.47pm: FBI director James Comey has confirmed the agency is investigating possible links and co-ordination between US president Donald Trump's associates and Russia. Update 2.41pm: There was no physical wiretapping carried out on Trump Tower, but it is possible that "other surveillance activities" were used against US president Donald Trump and his associates, the chairman of the US House intelligence committee said. California representative Devin Nunes spoke at the opening of the committee's first public hearing on Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The Republican said the committee has seen no evidence to date that officials from any campaign conspired with Russian agents, but will continue to carry out investigations into the issue. House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes: No "wiretap of Trump Tower," but "still possible" other surveillance of Trump may have taken place pic.twitter.com/xq21G4msxX— PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) March 20, 2017 He also said the committee will investigate who has been leaking classified information about investigations into Russia's interference. Mr Nunes said he hopes the committee's hearings will result in a "definitive report" on Russia's involvement in the presidential election. Earleir: US president Donald Trump has accused Democrats of making up allegations that Russia interfered in last year's election, and said US Congress and the FBI should be focusing on media leaks instead. His tweets came just hours before a potentially politically damaging hearing in which FBI director James Comey and National Security Agency director Michael Rogers plan to testify over allegations of Russian hacking and whether there were any connections between Moscow and Mr Trump's campaign. Mr Trump tweeted today: "The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!" "The real story that Congress, the FBI and others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!" James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 A hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, one of several congressional panels probing allegations of Russian meddling, could allow for the greatest public accounting to date of investigations which have shadowed the Trump administration in its first two months. The two most senior members of the House intelligence committee said yesterday that documents the Justice Department and FBI delivered late last week offered no evidence that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower, the president's New York City headquarters. But the panel's ranking Democrat said the material offers circumstantial evidence that American citizens colluded with Russians in Moscow's efforts to interfere in the presidential election. "There was circumstantial evidence of collusion; there is direct evidence, I think, of deception," California representative Adam Schiff said on NBC's Meet the Press. ''There's certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation." Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the committee, said: "For the first time the American people, and all the political parties now, are paying attention to the threat that Russia poses. "We know that the Russians were trying to get involved in our campaign, like they have for many decades. They're also trying to get involved in campaigns around the globe and over in Europe." The Senate Intelligence Committee has scheduled a similar hearing for later in the month. It is not clear how much new information will emerge on Monday, and the hearing's open setting unquestionably puts Mr Comey in a difficult situation if he is asked to discuss an ongoing investigation tied to the campaign of the president. At a hearing in January, Mr Comey refused to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation exploring possible connections between Mr Trump's associates and Russia, consistent with the FBI's long-standing policy of not publicly discussing its work. His appearances on Capitol Hill since then have occurred in classified settings, often with small groups of representatives, and he has made no public statements connected to the Trump campaign or Russia. But Mr Comey may feel compelled to respond to Mr Trump's unproven Twitter assertions that former president Barack Obama ordered a wiretapping of Trump Tower during the campaign. Congressional leaders briefed on the matter have said they have seen no indication that that is true, and Mr Obama's top intelligence official, James Clapper, has publicly called the claims false. The US justice department's disclosure on Friday that it had complied with congressional demands for information regarding Mr Trump's wiretapping tweets could allow Mr Comey to avoid questioning by simply saying that the representatives already have the information they requested. Yet any lack of detail from Mr Comey will likely be contrasted with public comments he made last year when closing out an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices and then, shortly before election day, announcing that the probe would be revived following the discovery of additional emails.

Business Home LBoard Kit Siang to address ‘missing’ posters issue tomorrow FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US As part of Asia pivot, Netanyahu pushes Israeli hi-tech in China Reuters | March 20, 2017 Bilateral trade has been hovering at around US$8 billion for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to US$3.3 billion in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way. BEIJING: China’s economy may be 35 times larger than Israel’s, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to use that to advantage during a three-day visit to Beijing as he looks to reorient Israel’s economy toward Asia over Europe and the United States. A week after US chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel’s high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8 billion for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel’s exports to China have tripled to $3.3 billion in 2016, with technology – from cybersecurity to agri-tech – leading the way. Half the investments in Israeli funds in 2015 involved at least one Chinese investor, and 40 percent of funds raised by Israeli venture capital firms came from Chinese backers, according to the Economy Ministry. “Israel is pivoting towards Asia in a very clear and purposeful way,” Netanyahu said last month in Singapore, which he visited along with Australia. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Israel in the summer, underpinning the Asia trend. While the European Union remains Israel’s largest trading partner, Asia is steadily closing the gap and politically it tends to put far fewer demands on Israel than the EU does. Matan Vilnai, Israel’s former ambassador to Beijing, said China’s interests in Israel were almost purely economic. The Chinese leadership seeks to learn from Israel’s culture of high-tech innovation and doesn’t push beyond that. “It’s very simple: technology, technology, technology,” he told Reuters. Chinese firms are driving major infrastructure projects in Israel, including Tel Aviv’s metro system and new Mediterranean ports in Haifa and Ashdod. A deal for 6,000 Chinese construction workers to come to Israel was signed earlier this year, with the possibility of extending it to 20,000. Ilan Maor, Israel’s former consul-general in Shanghai and the managing partner of Sheng BDO, a business advisory firm, said he thinks China’s leadership is keen to limit discussions with the Israeli delegation to economics, even if Beijing has become more outspoken on Middle East issues. “The place (Netanyahu) can make a significant contribution is opening the door to more trade, moving forward to free trade, and making a clear message that we want Chinese investment,” he said. The countries are negotiating a free-trade agreement, although it remains unclear how far advanced talks are. From Netanyahu’s point of view, while China and Israel may be vastly different in terms of population, physical size and resources, there is a strong fit: while Israel innovates, China concentrates on mass marketing and commercialization. “Given the basic infrastructure of initial and secondary development – airports, sewage lines, water – once you’ve done that, the way to go up and up and up is to constantly improve your products and services and utilities with technology,” Netanyahu told Chinese business leaders in Beijing. “We are your perfect junior partner for that effort.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

A recently revised service document has now surfaced that seems to indicate Microsoft may be getting ready to enforce that policy that was originally announced last year. According to that updated support document, Microsoft will block any Windows 7 or 8.1 machine that is running the latest processors from AMD, Intel , or Qualcomm from getting security updates for the OS. Computerworld states that one potential message to users of Windows 7 or 8.1 systems that have newer processors inside might see reads, “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” A possible error code that computers running new processors on these older OS versions might see is 80240037. That error code will be seen when Windows 7 or 8.1 machines running a 7th gen processor from Intel, Qualcomm or AMD try and download security updates. This would include processors like Kaby Lake, Bristol Ridge, and the Snapdragon 820 series. Presumably this would include AMD Ryzen processors as well. As for why these machines will be blocked from getting security updates, Microsoft has stated that getting Windows 7 and 8.1 to run on these processors is “challenging.” This led Microsoft to decide only Windows 10 would support these newer processors and to shorten Windows 7 support. Windows 7 will be supported on 6th gen processors like Intel Skylake processors until July 17, 2017. Terry Perry So what i have Never loaded SP 1 or Newer for W-7 and still play ALL the Games.

House Republicans plan to vote on their Obamacare replacement on Thursday, as you might have heard. But that doesn’t mean they’re done tweaking the measure. Speaker Paul Ryan said on “Fox News Sunday” that GOP lawmakers were looking at boosting the subsidies for buying health care for people in their 50s and 60s, as our Ian Kullgren reports. (This was also the word coming out of a Friday conference meeting on the American Health Care Act.) Story Continued Below Meantime, President Donald Trump and his administration are starting to warn conservatives to get in line. WHICH ALSO MEANS: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) likes to talk about how tax reform and health care can run on parallel tracks, but work on Obamacare has understandably pushed taxes to the backburner. Ways and Means Republicans have barely gotten into the topic recently, according to one of them who spoke to Morning Tax on Friday. Instead, the lawmaker — who didn't want to be named, in order to more freely discuss the situation — said that the broader GOP debate over the party’s Affordable Care Act replacement had trickled down into committee meetings. More on the Republican state of mind: Trump said recently that he wanted to deal with taxes before health care. So why didn’t that happen? Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that it’s because of all the promises the GOP had made to repeal Obamacare. “It's a heavy lift? Yes. Do you need to sometimes hit the bad news and the heavy lift first? I think so,” Blackburn said. (The implication here is that tax reform is at least easier than replacing Obamacare. Morning Tax might be parochial on this, but we’re guessing tax reform will be plenty hard, if it happens.) SPICER’S TIMELINE: Sean Spicer doesn’t think it will be long until the administration and Congress will be able to really focus on tax reform, according to an interview the White House press secretary gave Ireland’s Sunday Independent. "We are going to have tax reform after we get health care completed … I think we are looking at late spring to summer," Spicer said, via Reuters. (We’re guessing Spicer doesn’t think tax reform can actually be finished by late spring.) WHILE WE’RE WAITING … : Corporate America wants a tax overhaul, but it’s not just going to sit on its hands while Washington gets its act together. In fact, multinationals are using their stash of offshore cash — which they’re hoping to get a lower tax rate on sometime soon — to buy up some foreign companies, Bloomberg reports. That includes Intel, which just a week ago said it would pay $15 billion to buy an Israeli company, while Johnson & Johnson said it’d pay double that for a Swiss outfit back in January. And there’s probably more where that came from: “No one wants to wait for the tax change,” said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, who helps run American mergers and acquisitions for UBS. “If you’re going to wait for that or time your deal around that, you can’t.” WELCOME TO MONDAY, where we’re still recovering from this weekend’s NCAA Tournament action. Perhaps a more important development: It’s also 101 years since something called Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was published. What’s going on out there?

LET’S GET RUNNING: The American Made Coalition, the group of big exporters and other companies supporting the House GOP tax blueprint, has taken the big leap — by putting a commercial on the television airwaves. The spot, which first went up Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” argues that a tax overhaul along the lines of the House plan would stem the tide of jobs leaving the U.S., by evening out the treatment of exports and imports. Still, the spot also doesn’t seem to make the case that tax reform alone would cure everything. “For years, lights have been turned out in American factories. Lights that likely won't be turned on again,” the script from the ad says, before adding: “Support tax reform and create 1.7 million new American jobs.” The advertisement will continue to run through April 9 in the Washington metro area on cable stations like CNBC, Fox Business, Fox News and MSNBC. Other moving pictures: The group opposing the House plan also has a new video, though one that you shouldn’t expect to see on the television any time soon. Americans for Affordable Products’ new video has more of an edge to it, asking viewers whether they trusted retail (and other) chief executives more than Brady on the potential impact of a border adjustment. Also new from the anti-side, and with a pretty catchy name: “Deplorables Against a Consumer Tax Hike.” It’s not on television either, but the group from Tea Party Nation and other organizations on the right is starting to run digital ads — targeting about a dozen House Republicans, including Brady, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. (Though we do have to wonder: Would a wife at her kitchen table complaining about higher prices at the grocery store really refer to “crony capitalists?”) ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Tax simplification should be the cornerstone of tax reform, with an emphasis of simplifying our outmoded tax code to accommodate today’s modern families dynamics. This Monday, March 27, Tax Foundation and ITFC will bring together today’s leading tax policy minds to shed light on this complicated topic. Learn more: http://bit.ly/2n7ELgJ ** THE FLIP SIDE ON THE IRS BUDGET: Sure, the IRS took less of a hit from the first Trump budget than even some of the president’s fellow Republicans expected. But Howard Gleckman at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy argues that another year of asking the IRS to do more with less would still be a bad development. (And to be clear, there’d likely be plenty of Republicans who’d be interested in even deeper cuts than $239 million, even after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested the cuts might have gone too far.) “Collecting revenue is only part of what Congress asks the IRS to do. The tax agency also runs a big part of the nation’s safety for the poor through refundable tax credits such as the earned income credit and the child credit. It is partially responsible for managing the Affordable Care Act’s system of credits and penalties for individual health insurance,” Gleckman wrote, noting that the GOP’s proposed replacement for Obamacare would also give the IRS full oversight of insurance subsidies and adding: “No one should expect the IRS to do the increasingly complex job Congress demands with a budget that is nearly one-fifth smaller than it was in 2010.” INTERNATIONAL NEWS CHINA DAWDLES ON THE PROPERTY TAX: Economists think China might want to follow the U.S. in this respect — instituting a property tax. And yet the topic didn’t come up at this month’s National People’s Congress, The Wall Street Journal reports. The case for a property tax: “For many Chinese families, owning a home is one of few options to build wealth, driving buying frenzies as people rush to purchase before prices soar. Imposing costs on homeowners through a property tax is seen as a way to tame such speculation, while also helping fund local governments.” TALK ABOUT GRASSROOTS ENERGY: The Lebanese prime minister got empty water bottles thrown at him on Sunday while trying to calm protesters about proposed tax increases, Reuters reports. About 2,000 protesters gathered in Beirut’s Riad al-Solh Square, where some of them also shouted “thief” at the prime minister, Saad al-Hariri. Lebanese lawmakers have already raised some taxes, including a one percentage point hike in the sales tax, and are expected to consider even more soon. The Lebanese government wants to increase wages for public employees. STATE UPDATE CALIFORNIA GOES AFTER THE MID: California lawmakers, seeking to spur more affordable housing in a state not known for it, have a new target — owners of vacation homes. A new proposal would strip home owners of their mortgage interest deduction for a second home and, according to the Mercury News, “channel the gains — at least $220 million annually, according to initial estimates by the state Franchise Tax Board — to a state affordable housing program. Supporters say that would cover the cost of creating 3,000 new units of affordable housing, and it could leverage $600 million to $1 billion in additional federal housing dollars.” QUICK LINKS Washington Examiner points out that Alan Auerbach, lead advocate for border adjustability, advised John Kerry’s presidential campaign. Eric Trump calls the leak of his father’s tax returns “dangerous.” Palm Beach, Fla., mayor suggests the city might have to raise taxes because of Trump’s visits to Mar-a-Lago. UBS “very pessimistic” about the prospects of a settlement with France over tax fraud. The U.K. might have to lean on spending cuts to make up for a scrapped plan to raise taxes on the self-employed. The big box “dark store” debate heads to Wisconsin. DID YOU KNOW? The actor Keanu Reeves was born in Beirut. ** A message from Intuit Tax and Financial Center: Tax simplification should be the cornerstone of tax reform. Both the new Congress and the new administration have stated their deep commitment to enacting meaningful tax reform in 2017. It’s important that tax reform includes an emphasis on simplifying our outmoded tax code to accommodate today’s complex family situations. Can it be done in a way that’s both efficient and equitable? This Monday, March 27, Tax Foundation and Intuit Tax and Financial Center will bring together some of today’s leading tax policy minds to shed light on this complicated topic.

A week after US chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8bn for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to $3.3bn in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way. Half the investments in Israeli funds in 2015 involved at least one Chinese investor, and 40pc of funds raised by Israeli venture capital firms came from Chinese backers, according to the Economy Ministry. "Israel is pivoting towards Asia in a very clear and purposeful way," Netanyahu said last month in Singapore, which he visited along with Australia. Indian President Narenda Modi will visit Israel in the summer, underpinning the Asia trend. While the European Union remains Israel's largest trading partner, Asia is steadily closing the gap and politically it tends to put far fewer demands on Israel than the EU does. Matan Vilnai, Israel's former ambassador to Beijing, said China's interests in Israel were almost purely economic. The Chinese leadership seeks to learn from Israel's culture of high-tech innovation and doesn't push beyond that. "It's very simple: technology, technology, technology," he told Reuters. Chinese firms are driving major infrastructure projects in Israel, including Tel Aviv's metro system and new Mediterranean ports in Haifa and Ashdod. A deal for 6,000 Chinese construction workers to come to Israel was signed earlier this year, with the possibility of extending it to 20,000. Ilan Maor, Israel's former consul-general in Shanghai and the managing partner of Sheng BDO, a business advisory firm, said he thinks China's leadership is keen to limit discussions with the Israeli delegation to economics, even if Beijing has become more outspoken on Middle East issues. "The place (Netanyahu) can make a significant contribution is opening the door to more trade, moving forward to free trade, and making a clear message that we want Chinese investment," he said. The countries are negotiating a free-trade agreement, although it remains unclear how far advanced talks are. From Netanyahu's point of view, while China and Israel may be vastly different in terms of population, physical size and resources, there is a strong fit: while Israel innovates, China concentrates on mass marketing and commercialisation. "Given the basic infrastructure of initial and secondary development - airports, sewage lines, water - once you've done that, the way to go up and up and up is to constantly improve your products and services and utilities with technology," Netanyahu told Chinese business leaders in Beijing. "We are your perfect junior partner for that effort."

Green asked the question in a letter originally published in Hebrew in Haaretz, the Israeli daily. He said he's scheduled to be here in Israel for academic conferences in June and October, and that during his last trip he gave 15 lectures. Green is modest; he doesn't explain how prominent he is in the American Jewish community as a rabbinic educator, theologian, and scholar of Jewish mysticism. He does, however, say that he will not use wine from the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba for kiddush, the blessing over wine on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. There are grounds to believe that products of settlements are tainted by theft, he writes with careful understatement. In his letter, he encourages others to follow his practice. That is, he openly encourages boycotting the products of a settlement. So, he asks, is he now barred from entering Israel? That's the implication of the law recently enacted by the Knesset, which says that no visa of any kind will be given to a would-be visitor who has called for a boycott of Israel, or who “has committed himself to take part in such a boycott.” And this also applies to any form of boycott of Israeli settlements. So, Green asks, should he cancel his trips? Since I lack his awe-inspiring restraint, I'll rephrase this question to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the lawmakers of his right-wing coalition: Are you for real? Do you get that you just legislated our very own travel ban, one that obligates you to deny visas not just to BDS supporters, but also to everyone like Rabbi Arthur Green—supporters of Israel who, out of real concern for the country's character, will not buy settlement products? Do you realize how just plain embarrassing this is going to get? Let's work our way through the law's absurdities. To start, it treats the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign as if it were a serious threat to Israel. The recent sale of the Israeli high-tech firm Mobileye to Intel for $15.3 billion—the latest and largest acquisition of an Israeli start-up by an international tech giant—hints at how silly this is. The mainstay of the Israeli economy is high-tech, with innovations tangled into everything you use. An effective consumer boycott of Israel would start with its supporters throwing their phones in the nearest lake and continue with them swearing off all that is digital. This isn't going to be a thing. On the other hand, sanctions by foreign governments would be serious business. The best way for Israel to avoid those is to reassure its Western allies and trading partners that inside Israel proper, democracy is flourishing, while the future of the occupied territories is a policy disagreement among friends. A law banning foreign visitors based on their political statements and affiliations doesn't say much for democratic norms. For a BDS activist, getting some press on being turned back at the airport because of her political opinions is likely to be much more useful than wandering around the occupied territories snapping pictures of roadblocks and settlements. The law itself aims to erase distinctions between Israel and the occupied territories. It fits the Israeli right's stance that opposition to settlements is pretty much the same as hostility toward Israel's very existence. This is both a mindset—Netanyahu and his allies really do see the settlements as integrally part of Israel—and a political tactic. It tars critics of government policies as enemies of the state. It creates bogeymen. The liberal majority of American Jews generally opposes settlement, as polling shows. That doesn't mean that lots of U.S. Jews actively boycott settlements—assuming they run into settlement products that they can avoid buying. (It's not as if there's a boutique wine from a settlement vineyard in every American liquor store.) But my guess is that the new law will cause more U.S. Jews to boycott settlements, and to say so publicly. Green's letter won't be an isolated case. So by legislating against settlement boycotts, the right-wing majority in the Knesset has actually promoted them. From my perspective, that's the one positive thing that can be said about the law. But it's not what the law's authors had in mind. This brings us to another folly: Any attempt to enforce the law is likely cause one PR disaster after another, as prominent Diaspora Jews get stopped at Ben-Gurion Airport and pushed onto return flights It's much more likely that the law will be enforced sporadically or not at all. Perhaps the line allowing the interior minister to grant an individual boycotter a visa under special circumstances will be applied to virtually everyone. The law could well be a dead letter, whose only effect will have been to highlight the kind of protest it's ostensibly meant to prevent. So why bother with such a law, and why now? The answer to the first half of that question is that the Israeli right has historically had a penchant for grand gestures and declarations, especially ones that strike a pose of defiance. As for the timing, the answer is pretty clear: Donald Trump. Since January, discussion of U.S.-Israel relations has quite reasonably focused on the new regime's attitude toward settlement-building and peace efforts. But this is too narrow a perspective. For years, the Israeli right has been trying to chip away at democratic rights through legislation. One impediment has been fear of the American reaction. The fear is gone. In early February, the Knesset passed a law allowing the government to expropriate private Palestinian land on which settlements had been built. It violates basic property rights as enshrined in international law. The bill was held up in the last days of the Obama administration, then quickly passed after the change of power in Washington. Next came the law barring entry to boycott advocates. It's not as if anyone expects a strong message from Washington in 2017 against a travel ban that flies in the face of fundamental rights. As for relations with liberal American Jews, that's clearly not on Netanyahu's list of concerns. Neither is having the new law actually accomplish anything. The point is the statement: The world (except for the White House) is against us, but we are defiant. With the rise of Trump, the paranoid style is in full control in Israeli politics.

By DiversityInc Staff / March 20, 2017 BASF SE (No. 24 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced that the companies will collaborate to develop one of the world’s largest supercomputers for industrial chemical research at BASF’s Ludwigshafen headquarters this year. Based on the latest generation of HPE Apollo 6000 systems, the new supercomputer will drive the digitalization of BASF’s worldwide research. “The new supercomputer will promote the application and development of complex modeling and simulation approaches, opening up completely new avenues for our research at BASF,” said Dr. Martin Brudermueller, Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF. “The supercomputer was designed and developed jointly by experts from HPE and BASF to precisely meet our needs.” The new system will make it possible to answer complex questions and reduce the time required to obtain results from several months to days across all research areas. As part of BASF’s digitalization strategy, the company plans to significantly expand its capabilities to run virtual experiments with the supercomputer. It will help BASF reduce time to market and costs by, for example, simulating processes on catalyst surfaces more precisely or accelerating the design of new polymers with pre-defined properties. “In today’s data-driven economy, high performance computing plays a pivotal role in driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence,” said Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “We expect this supercomputer to help BASF perform prodigious calculations at lightning fast speeds, resulting in a broad range of innovations to solve new problems and advance our world.” With the help of Intel Xeon processors, high-bandwidth, low-latency Intel Omni-Path Fabric and HPE management software, the supercomputer acts as a single system with an effective performance of more than 1 Petaflop (1 Petaflop equals one quadrillion floating point operations per second). With this system architecture, a multitude of nodes can work simultaneously on highly complex tasks, dramatically reducing the processing time. “Customers are always looking for systems that deliver the best performance at the best total cost of ownership,” said Barry Davis, General Manager, Accelerated Workload Group, Intel. “Intel Omni-Path Architecture is specifically designed to deliver outstanding performance while scaling cost-effectively from entry-level high performance computing clusters to larger clusters with 10,000 nodes or more – offering a significant advantage on both fronts.” Developed and built with HPE, the new supercomputer will consist of several hundred computer nodes. The supercomputer will also leverage HPE Apollo Systems to give customers simplified administration efficiencies and flexibility to match their solutions to the workload.

The Crosshair VI Hero is ASUS's current top offering for the AMD AM4 platform and uses AMD's X370 chipset. The X370 chipset and Ryzen CPU ecosystem is no longer similar to that of Intel, or anything we have seen before.   The chipset, be it X370 or B350, are IO extensions of the CPU, they are basically South Bridges without system management capabilities. Things such as the BIOS and HD audio connections, which have almost always been on another chip, are now integrated into the CPU. In fact, the one reason the motherboards require a chipset is to authenticate the CPU and provide secure operation. AMD even has chipsets that have almost no IO, such as the X300, that allows overclocking and multi-GPU capabilities.     If you want multi-GPU capabilities, you have to go with an X series chipset. The Crosshair VI Hero is the result of a long line of ROG based products on the AMD side of things. They are designed to be the best overclockers and are loaded with the latest ROG features. The Crosshair VI Hero was launched on March 2nd and has since taken multiple world records. It's also one of few motherboards with an external clock generator, which is required for FSB/BCLK/bus speed adjustment.   Let's take a look at what ASUS has to offer for your high-end Ryzen rig.     Specifications     The Crosshair VI Hero offers USB 3.1 on the rear IO and through an internal type-C header, 12 USB ports on the rear IO, Intel LAN, high-end audio, multi-GPU support, eight SATA ports, M.2, and even two RGB headers.     Pricing   The Crosshair VI Hero costs around $255.

By Teresea Hanafin Globe Staff  March 20, 2017 What's it like outside? Sunny, high 40s and low 50s. Spring officially arrived at 6:29 a.m. EDT. It's the moment when the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth's axis and Earth's orbit around the sun are aligned in such a way that the planet's two hemispheres are receiving the sun's rays equally, creating about the same amount of sunlight and darkness everywhere -- the vernal equinox . For the Southern Hemisphere, it's all downhill now, since it will be tilted away from the sun for the next six months. But we're sittin' pretty, facing the sun, days growing longer until the summer solstice June 21. There's promise in the air. Hey, sport: The Celtics host the Washington Wizards, a team that's breathing down their necks in the Eastern Conference and against whom the Cs have a 1-2 record this season (7:30 p.m., CSNHD and 100.7 FM). The Celtics suffered an embarrassing loss to the 76ers yesterday, 105-99.

Will that kill the deal? Will Comey's testimony show that Trump is lying? FBI Director James Comey testifies publicly at 10 a.m. before the House Intelligence Committee about two main issues: whether former President Barack Obama had candidate Donald Trump illegally wiretapped at Trump Tower, as Trump has maintained for two weeks, and the status of the FBI's investigation into Russia's attempt to influence the presidential election -- including whether any members of the Trump campaign were involved. Comey is unlikely to give any details about the Russia investigation if it is still underway -- he may not even acknowledge there is a probe. Both the chairman of the Intel Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, and former national intelligence director James Clapper have both said they have seen no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. But the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Adam Schiff of California, says there is circumstantial evidence, whatever that means. Advertisement At any rate, Comey is expected to say there was no Obama-ordered wiretapping or surveillance of Trump in New York. The story there will be how Trump reacts; several Republicans have already said he should apologize to Obama. HA! Those Repubs are such cards. Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the NSA, will testify as well. One guy not on the House's list is Roger Stone, an informal adviser to Trump who used to work on the campaign. But he is in the crosshairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe. They asked him not to destroy any paper or electronic records he has that could be relevant to the investigation into the Russian funny business. He's the guy who communicated with both Julian Assange of Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0, an election hacker the US believes is a front for Russian intelligence. Trump at 6:35 a.m.: "James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!" Trump at 6:49 a.m.: "The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!" It's going to be one of those days. Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 11 a.m., with Democrats still smarting from the GOP's refusal to even hold a hearing for Obama nominee Merrick Garland. But they have to tread carefully: If they filibuster, and the GOP exercises the so-called "nuclear option" -- changing the Senate rules to require a simple majority of 51 votes rather than 60 -- it will be a lot easier for Republicans to approve a far more conservative Supreme Court nominee if another vacancy comes up. The Dems apparently have five main lines of questioning for Gorsuch, according to Politico: Contraception and Obamacare, his defense of the Bush policy of housing detainees at Gitmo, judicial independence under Trump, workers' rights, and his lack of deference to how federal agencies interpret laws. Trump meets with a real billionaire, Bill Gates, today; Gates is upset about Trump's budget blueprint, which slashes foreign aid, including to global health agencies. As Gates wrote in an essay in Time magazine: "These projects keep Americans safe. And by promoting health, security and economic opportunity, they stabilize vulnerable parts of the world." Not so sure how private-sector, tablet-toting "ambassadors" with fake smiles in Boston's T stations will make the trains run on time or feel less like cattle cars, but MBTA officials believe privatizing customer service will save $8.3 million a year. The current service people won't lose their jobs; they will fill vacancies as subway operators or do other jobs. The T's fiscal board discusses the plan today. There's a fight shaping up on Beacon Hill over who will oversee the state's legalized marijuana industry. The committee set up to shape policy holds its first public hearing at 11 a.m. Meanwhile, Treasurer Deborah Goldberg, the state's top regulator, has already started setting up a bureaucracy to handle the job, according to the Globe's Joshua Miller: She has budget plans, organizational charts, names of potential Cannabis Control commissioners, and lists of companies to track sales. Some legislators think she's jumping the gun before the committee has even met. Others don't believe she should be the sole oversight authority; they are proposing that several elected officials fill that role to dilute any one person's power. A little weed would mellow everybody out. The state Legislature's House and Senate Ways and Means Committees holds a public hearing at Worcester State University at 9 a.m. to get input from various agencies such as the judiciary, Office of Campaign and Political Finance, and the Ethics Commission. State social workers will be on the march through Boston today. About 800 of them will gather at Faneuil Hall, walk to the State House en masse around noon to reassemble in the Great Hall, then spread out to lobby legislators on issues affecting them.  France holds its first televised debate among its presidential candidates, and the hot topics are immigration, security, and the economy. A centrist, Emmanuel Macron, is leading in the polls, but the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, is close behind.      Finally, on this day in 1934, athlete extraordinaire Babe Didrikson pitched one inning of exhibition pro baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics against the Brooklyn Dodgers. No hits, one walk. Two years before, she had set world records in the javelin throw, 80-meter hurdles, high jump, and baseball throw at the AAU championships, then went on to the Olympics in LA that same year. She qualified for five events, but could compete in just three because, you know, she was a girl. She set a world record in the javelin throw and a world record in the 80-meter hurdles. She tied with another competitor in the high jump, but the judges didn't like her head-first style, so gave her the silver instead. In high school in Texas, she excelled at basketball and track. In 1933, in her 20s, she decided to take up golf for the first time, and completely dominated the sport, winning 82 tournaments and helping to start the LPGA. When asked how a "girl" could hit a golf ball so far, Babe said one of my favorite quotes: "Just take off your girdle and swing." Words to live by. Wikimedia Babe Didrikson dominated women’s golf, a sport she didn’t take up until her 20s. Thanks for reading. Jimmy Breslin said, "Rage is the only quality which has kept me, or anybody I have ever studied, writing columns for newspapers." And folks, if you really want to swing, don't stop at the girdle.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Yogi Adityanath Trivendra Singh Rawat Virat Kohli Donald Trump Narendra Modi Home World As part of Asia pivot, Netanyahu pushes Israeli hi-tech in China Shares1 Mon, 20 Mar 2017-06:26pm , Reuters China's economy may be 35 times larger than Israel's, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping to use that to advantage during a three-day visit to Beijing as he looks to reorient Israel's economy towards Asia over Europe and the United States. A week after U.S. chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, Netanyahu wants to enlarge Israel's high-tech presence in China while encouraging further Chinese investment in Israel, where infrastructure and construction projects are growing apace. More than 100 technology executives have joined Netanyahu on the visit, with meetings planned with Chinese business leaders. Bilateral trade has been hovering at around $8 billion for the last few years, but over the past decade, Israel's exports to China have tripled to $3.3 billion in 2016, with technology - from cybersecurity to agri-tech - leading the way. Half the investments in Israeli funds in 2015 involved at least one Chinese investor, and 40 percent of funds raised by Israeli venture capital firms came from Chinese backers, according to the Economy Ministry. "Israel is pivoting towards Asia in a very clear and purposeful way," Netanyahu said last month in Singapore, which he visited along with Australia. Indian President Narenda Modi will visit Israel in the summer, underpinning the Asia trend. While the European Union remains Israel's largest trading partner, Asia is steadily closing the gap and politically it tends to put far fewer demands on Israel than the EU does. Matan Vilnai, Israel's former ambassador to Beijing, said China's interests in Israel were almost purely economic. The Chinese leadership seeks to learn from Israel's culture of high-tech innovation and doesn't push beyond that. "It's very simple: technology, technology, technology," he told Reuters. Chinese firms are driving major infrastructure projects in Israel, including Tel Aviv's metro system and new Mediterranean ports in Haifa and Ashdod. A deal for 6,000 Chinese construction workers to come to Israel was signed earlier this year, with the possibility of extending it to 20,000. Ilan Maor, Israel's former consul-general in Shanghai and the managing partner of Sheng BDO, a business advisory firm, said he thinks China's leadership is keen to limit discussions with the Israeli delegation to economics, even if Beijing has become more outspoken on Middle East issues. "The place (Netanyahu) can make a significant contribution is opening the door to more trade, moving forward to free trade, and making a clear message that we want Chinese investment," he said. The countries are negotiating a free-trade agreement, although it remains unclear how far advanced talks are. From Netanyahu's point of view, while China and Israel may be vastly different in terms of population, physical size and resources, there is a strong fit: while Israel innovates, China concentrates on mass marketing and commercialisation. "Given the basic infrastructure of initial and secondary development - airports, sewage lines, water - once you've done that, the way to go up and up and up is to constantly improve your products and services and utilities with technology," Netanyahu told Chinese business leaders in Bejing. "We are your perfect junior partner for that effort." (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

For more details and to purchase your ticket visit wiredevent.co.uk The world is full of big figures, but this one is more shocking than most. $600bn (£483bn) is lost every year from global trade as a result of “maritime fraud” - when goods go walkabout from ships during transactions. And this is just one tiny part of the global business of trade. Add it all up, and there are likely trillions of dollars lost to fraud each year. A coalition of companies, coders and charities believe they have a solution: the blockchain. ADVERTISEMENT Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started WIRED Horizons 07 Nov 2016 “The blockchain can do for transactions what the internet did for information,” says Arvind Krishna, senior vice president at IBM overseeing the company’s involvement in the Hyperledger project, a new fabric for the blockchain to be used in a range of industries, including healthcare, shipping and government services. The blockchain itself is a decentralised electronic ledger, with duplicate copies on thousands of computers around the world. It cannot be altered retrospectively, meaning authentication and ownership is easier to certify and less vulnerable to fraud. The diamond industry is a great example of the power of the blockchain. A diamond's origin can be rapidly lost as it exchanges hands over the years. But Everledger, a global digital registry for diamonds, powered by the blockchain, was founded in 2015 to help prevent this. READ NEXT Mobile-only bank N26 hits 300,000 customers Mobile-only bank N26 hits 300,000 customers By Alexandra Simon-Lewis The Hyperledger project is an open source, open governance group allowing anyone who signs up as a legitimate member to participate. IBM got involved in the middle of 2015 and during the initial stages its engineers were the driving force behind the lion’s share of the work. That has now changed to include significant involvement from the London Stock Exchange, Cisco and Intel. It has seen IBM partner up with more than 100 other companies to try and iron out the levels of distrust in the world’s transactions. “For the first time with blockchain, we have a way of a transaction happening where both people can trust each other; that the information they put in cannot be changed or altered once the network has accepted it.” Subscribe to WIRED ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT TransferWise partners with digital-only Starling Bank TransferWise partners with digital-only Starling Bank By Lee Bell By ironing out the fear of fraud, not only could the blockchain prevent money disappearing from business: it could also open up those businesses to a new range of people. “When you have this inherent lack of trust in the world, you create third-party intermediaries – but the fact you have these means there’s extra cost and friction in business,” says Krishna, who will be speaking at WIRED Money 2017. That extra cost and effort to engage with third parties means that smaller businesses are often excluded from bigger deals. “A little farmer in a little country has no way of getting into the supply chain for McDonalds because it’s too expensive,” Krishna says. “But if a blockchain allows them to participate that means they can make a bit more revenue.” IBM In all, 50 IBM workers are involved in the Hyperledger project. “It’s a big investment from us,” Krishna says, and mimics their involvement in a similar open source computing project in the late 1990s: Linux. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT WIRED Money 2017: The Startup Stage WIRED Money 2017: The Startup Stage The Linux Foundation hosts the Hyperledger project, and hopes that the distributed ledger format of the blockchain will allow transactions to be carried out on computers with a level of trust and accountability that is too frequently missing from modern-day trade. That trust should extend not only to business-to-business interactions, but customers too. “In retail, when it comes to the provenance of the goods I’m buying, I really want to know they came from a certain manufacturer,” explains Krishna. The Hyperledger will allow consumers to see where their bananas or flatscreen TV has come from through an indelible, inalterable record in the blockchain. In healthcare, the number of different health systems involved in many countries outside the UK means there’s a mass of information, some of which can get lost in translation. The Hyperledger aims to counteract that. In government, passports and official ID could be held in the blockchain, cutting down on identity fraud and providing a better, stronger database of records. And in the financial services industry, securities clearing and settlement of foreign exchange can benefit from permanent records that can’t be fudged. “In all of these, blockchain is literally going to change the way the world works,” says Krishna. ADVERTISEMENT In early March the first practical example of the Hyperledger came to fruition. In partnership with Maersk, IBM launched a blockchain solution that helps manage the paper trail of tens of millions of shipping containers traversing the world’s seas – accountable for 90 per cent of goods in global trade. It aims to help cut down on maritime fraud, and to eat into the cost (estimated to be around 20 per cent of the cost of physically transporting the goods) of processing documentation for each container. Of course, for those outside the WIRED universe, the idea of the blockchain and the Hyperledger remain abstruse concepts. “Today, when you mention it most people look for an explanation,” says Krishna. But give it time and it’ll become better known. “When we talked about the internet back in 1993, it was the same. It was only this thing a few people understood. Then within five years it went from being an esoteric term reserved for nerds and the cognoscenti to being a word that was presumed everyone knew what it means.” WIRED asks if we’re using that analogy, where we are with the blockchain right now. Krishna replies right away: “1994.” So we probably have four or five years before the massive explosion, the great switch on, the blockchain equivalent of the great dial-up roll out? “Correct,” says Krishna. “But as we’ve seen with other things, the world moves fast. It might not take five years.” View Event WIRED Money 2017 WIRED Money Business Blockchain IBM Share this article RECOMMENDED How the blockchain could make you thousands through car shares and selling electricity How the blockchain could make you thousands through car shares and selling electricity By Alex Tapscott Technology 25 Aug 2016 Brexit 'opportunism' could save Softbank billions on ARM deal Brexit 'opportunism' could save Softbank billions on ARM deal By James Temperton Softbank 18 Jul 2016 What will doctors of the future look like?

Moving forward one year, and a lot has changed. The arrival of AMD Ryzen CPUs and the X370 chipset, and the Z270 from Intel, so it was about time for Ballistix to update their Sport LT DDR4 RAM. The updated version comes with a small boost, from 2400MHz to 2666MHz. Other than that nothing else has changed. They continue to be available in red, grey, and white, also they come in two sizes, 4GB and 8GB, in single kit, dual kit, and quad kit. You can also still get the 2400MHz RAM. At the time of writing this review the 4x4GB kit will cost you €174 if you live in the EU or 151 US Dollars if you are in the USA. As always prices are here as a reference, so expect to see different ones at your local stores or e-tailers.

Last week TAG Heuer unveiled the new generation of a $1650 (R21000) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit. This week Swatch Group chief executive Officer Nick Hayek also announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers in the middle of the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. Share this story Swatch’s approach differs from LVMH. A staff member of LVMH  demonstrates a new Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 model watch after its presentation in Brunnen, Switzerland recently.Photo: Reuters Price They’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers - who often don’t wear any watches, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15000.  Swiss watchmakers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel - Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines - have stayed out of the smartwatch market. Read also: Swatch takes on Apple, Google The releases represents a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont chairperson Johann Rupert has said his brands planned to make only “intelligent watchstraps” and putting electronic functions into the watch case created a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution”. TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra $1650 that can swop the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Failures Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and last month Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Smartwatches from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a $17000 luxury version of the Apple Watch, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IDC estimates that 19.8million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a forecast of 28.3million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9percent last year while shipments at Samsung rose 39percent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches last year, says the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19months of declining exports. This week Swatch forecast a rebound in US and European markets. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got less than than 10percent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch last year. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he says. Otherwise, they risk lower-priced timepieces undercutting their sales.  Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Disgraced former SABC executive in line for top job 2 Black woman, you're on your own 3 Former Miss SA forces couple to apologise for 'monkey' slur 4 #ORTamboHeist: Lambo owner is no thief, says lawyer 5 PICS: London attack death toll rises to 5 Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Israeli storage and data management solutions company Reduxio Systems has raised $22.5 million of its Series C financing in a round expected to reach $32 million. The round, which was led by London-based C5 Capital, more than doubles the capital invested in the company, and will fund continued innovation and global marketing of Reduxio's software-defined storage platform. RELATED ARTICLES Hybrid storage co Reduxio Systems raises $15m All previous investors, including Jerusalem Venture Partners, Carmel Ventures, Intel Capital and Seagate Technology participated in this financing round. C5’s investment will complement the existing investor group with a specialist focus on cloud infrastructure and cyber security, as well as a strong network that will enhance Reduxio’s growing ecosystem of channel sales and technology partners. Reduxio CEO Mark Weiner, CTO Nir Peleg, and VP R&D Amnon Strasser founded the company in 2012 at the JVP Media Quarter in Jerusalem. The founders are all former employees of storage solutions start-up Exanet, which was acquired by Dell Inc. in 2010, after a dispute between investors. The company has 80 employees of which 50 are in its Israel offices in Petah Tikva. Reduxio also has offices in San Francisco. Weiner said, “The future of data storage and protection lies in delivering high performance, easy-to-use solutions designed for the rapidly coming era of hybrid IT – this is precisely why we started the company. Reduxio’s next generation architecture was purpose-built to address this challenge. Our vision and focus align perfectly with C5’s vision, and we welcome their unique expertise to the Reduxio team. This latest round of funding will allow us to continue our exponential growth to meet the needs of our rapidly growing customer base.” C5 Capital partner and new board member of Reduxio Marcos Battisti said, “Now and again, investors encounter a top team in a new company with the potential to seriously disrupt a market. Reduxio is clearly one of those companies. Reduxio’s technology is reshaping the storage space as we know it. Its software-defined storage technology is built on top of truly unique and ground-breaking IP that provides tangible benefits to on premise, hybrid, and cloud-based customers. Its solution is also being widely seen as one of the key tools to fight the growing threat of ransomware attacks. My partners and I are very proud to be invested in a company as unique as Reduxio.” Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on March 20, 2017 © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2017 5 Comments View comments in rows Update by email about comments talkback POST Comments Your name Please insert your name Content Your comment Thanks You comment was recieved and soon will be published.

Apparently, these ARM chips are quite good at their jobs and Microsoft might try converting entire categories of workloads over. All around the world the tech press has speculated on whether or not Windows on ARM will be showing up in on-premises datacenters. In doing so, they've completely missed the point. Cutting to the heart of it, it doesn't actually matter if Microsoft releases Windows Server for ARM. Windows isn't the future and even Microsoft knows it. The upcoming availability of SQL server on Linux is all the proof we need that the game is over and, in the data centre at least, Microsoft didn't win. Quite frankly, there's nothing wrong with that. Legacy x86 Windows applications have been a millstone around the neck of the entire industry for ages now and its long past time they were relegated to a niche and left to quietly slip away into the night. What's interesting here isn't that Microsoft managed to take its existing code base, strip out some of the cruft and compile it on ARM. What's interesting is what Microsoft's experiment unlocks outside the Windows ecosystem. SBSA The key to the future of ARM servers that came out of the Microsoft ARM reveal is perhaps the most under-reported piece of information from the event. Microsoft's Windows Server for ARM distribution is able to run on both Cavium's ThunderX2 and Qualcomm's Centriq, both 64-bit ARM-compatible SoCs. This is possible because of the Server Base System Architecture (SBSA) specification undertaken by ARM in 2014. This means that - for server-based ARM chips at least - hardware can be talked to using a generic ARM ACPI driver. In essence, we now have ARM chips that have the important bits of standardization that allowed the x86 ecosystem to grow, flourish and dominate the server space. This is huge. SBSA is the real threat to Intel. This is what can and will allow every flavour of Linux, BSD and whatever else to run on ARM CPUs with minimal fuss or headache. SBSA allows for operating systems and advanced ARM hypervisors that can work across platforms provided by multiple vendors. SBSA allows for an entire extended ecosystem of hardware components and peripherals to work with ARM servers without having to go to a vertically integrated monopolist and beg them for inclusion into their ecosystem. Microsoft buying enough ARM servers to start making noises about converting significant portions of their data centre operations over is the match that starts the fire. If hardware suppliers are going to keep making SBSA-based ARM chips, there has to be enough of a market to make it worth their while. Microsoft is an entire hardware market all on its own. Without anyone else jumping in and buying up chips, Microsoft likely consumes enough servers to make it worth these two manufacturers continuing to develop and iterate their products. Of course, Microsoft isn't the only buyer of these chips and they won't be the only one buying in serious bulk either. Beyond Windows If a large enough market for these chips develops to keep chip-makers iterating designs and cranking out wafers then we're off to the races. Windows on ARM in our data centres is simply not required for this SBSA-based ARM chips to be a success. In fact, it may hinder more than it helps. Windows on ARM failed miserably when Microsoft tried to use it with Windows 8. Microsoft envisioned a next-generation operating system free of the cruft of the past, including pesky things like end-user control over their operating system or devices. By naming their first go at modern ARM clients "Windows", however, end users expected all their old applications to work as they did on their x86 PCs. They also expected the same UI, level of control over their OS, so on and so forth. Microsoft's embrace of ARM servers is its opportunity to break from all that. Maybe all it does is release "Windows Server for ARM" and name it something else. Maybe it takes the time to get truly radical and pull one of its experimental post-windows OSes out of mothballs and give the world something worth using. Microsoft's choices regarding Windows 10 have ruined the brand name, and there's no need to carry any baggage or expectations forward to this new platform. Let Microsoft's cloud team have their way and let legacy x86 Windows applications migrate into Microsoft's cloud. They can sit there forever, just like mainframes have in many organizations, and the rest of us can move on. I, for one, hope this is the path it takes. I'm cautiously optimistic that there might even be someone within Microsoft bold enough to suggest it and politically empowered enough not to lose their job for doing so. It will be interesting to see what happens. A similar question hangs over the open source community. Timothy Prickett Morgan at El Reg's sister site The Next Platform reports that the development versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS 7 and Canonical Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 are all certified to run on Qualcomm's Centriq. Presumably, they'll work just fine on systems based on Cavium's ThunderX2 as well. So the Linux portion of this ARM server revolution has already begun. What's unknown is if they'll take this opportunity to start over. It's time for a new generation of servers without the 30-year-old applications or the need to support hardware, drivers and access methods that haven't been used in 30 years. We've been bringing up an entire generation of "web native" developers who are all about writing applications without the crutch of platforms past. Maybe, now that they've cut their teeth on public clouds and containers, they're ready to reinvent our data centres, one ARM at a time. ® Tips and corrections 106 Comments More from The Register Update or shut up: Microsoft's choice for desktop Skypers Mac and Windows Skype users given until March 1st to modernise themselves 57 Comments Microsoft ups Surface slab prices for Brits.

Recently, we reported that Xiaomi is working on its next tablet - Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 for which the company showcased a teaser of its upcoming Mi Pad tablet in the official Taobao pages as well. Now a new report has surfaced online in China which has revealed more details about the upcoming tablet. As per reports, there will be two Mi tablets which are named as Mi Pad 3 and Mi Pad 3 Pro. The Mi Pad 3 tablet will come with a 7.9-inch display with an unknown resolution and will feature 4GB of RAM. For internal memory, the Pad 3 will come in 64GB and 128 GB variants. It will run on Android 7.0 Android Nougat operating system. The report also reveals the expected pricing of the Mi Pad 3. The 64GB variant is expected to be priced at 1299 Yuan which is approximately Rs 12,307 while the 128GB variant is priced at 1599 Yuan which is approximately Rs 15,149. The Mi Pad 3 Pro tablet will come with a bigger screen size of a 9.7-inch display with unknown resolution. It will be powered by Intel 8750 processor which is coupled with 4GB RAM.

X Dublin placed 19th in list of world’s ‘smart cities’ Irish capital found to be slowest-moving of major cities compared in bank report Mon, Mar 20, 2017, 05:53 Laura Slattery Congestion: Dublin traffic moves at less than 5.5kph in peak periods, data suggests. Photograph: David Sleator         Dublin ranks 19th in an index of “smart cities” by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which forecasts that the market for “smart” technology and infrastructure used in the world’s most advanced urban areas could expand to $1.6 trillion (€1.49 triliion) by 2020. The market for disruptive technologies in industries from energy to security and mobility is $1 trillion in size today, the bank estimates. The investment bank lists more than 250 publicly quoted companies – including “highly” exposed stocks, such as IBM, Intel and Cisco Systems – that are poised to benefit from the rise of smart cities. In a new report, designed as a “primer” for investors who want to explore smart cities as an investment theme, the bank said it anticipated fast growth for technologies such as 5G telecoms networks, artificial intelligence, building automation, cleantech, cybersecurity, electric and self-driving vehicles, the internet of things, sensors, surveillance and voice assistants. Singapore smartest The report ranks Singapore, London, New York, Paris and Tokyo as the world’s smartest cities, with Dublin sandwiched between Auckland and Sydney in 18th and 20th place. Income varies significantly across the world’s largest 300 metropolitan economies, the report also notes. Dublin ranks 19th in terms of the highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, with GDP valued at $63,600 per capita. The Swiss city of Zurich was in first place with a GDP of $82,410 per capita, according to Brookings Institution figures quoted in the report. Dublin also ranks 25th on the UN-Habitat’s City Prosperity Index, a tool to compare cities “on the prosperity path”. ‘Slower than a horse and cart’ However, the Irish capital is the slowest-moving major city, the report notes, citing INRIX 2016 Traffic Scorecard data that found its traffic moves at just 7.5km per hour during congested periods, with peak hour speeds of 5.5 km per hour, “slower than a horse and cart”. ADVERTISEMENT Some 55 per cent of the world’s population now lives in cities, and this figure is expected to grow to 70 per cent by 2050. Cities themselves are becoming denser. But, as a phenomenon, cities are a mass of contradictions. While urbanisation has been a major positive factor in the economic development of countries, the rise of megacities also poses and exacerbates problems such as air pollution, crime, energy waste, homelessness and traffic congestion. A recent UN-Habitat report also concluded that three-quarters of the world’s cities have higher levels of income inequality than two decades ago.       Topics: Bank of America Merrill Lynch Cisco Systems IBM Intel Dublin(IE) Read More Electric Picnic contributed €36m to Ireland’s economy Warnings as G20 financial leaders drop free-trade pledge Only constant on display from Trump and May is incompetence US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin moves to ease trade fears Scotland’s independence not economically viable this time around An Irish/UK ‘powerhouse plan’ is required in wake of Brexit NTMA raises €500m at cheapest rate ever for Irish bonds Iceland bids farewell to capital controls, says 'hallo' to new risks Will Italy be next to reverse out of the EU?

Follow Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter Most Viewed on the Web Popular on Twitter Receive Our Daily Headlines   HOME | Sports (Click here for more) House Intel Committee Chair: No Proof Yet of Trump Campaign Plot with Russia WASHINGTON  The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Devin Nunes, said on Sunday that he has seen no proof of any alleged plot between the election campaign of President Donald Trump and Russia during the run-up to the 2016 vote. In an interview with Fox News, Nunes was asked directly if he had seen any evidence of any collusion between Trumps campaign and the Kremlin with the aim of interfering in the November election to favor the magnate. Ill give you a very simple answer: No, responded Nunes, who added that so far no evidence of collusion has emerged. Nunes remarks come one day before the first public hearing in Congress on alleged Russian interference in the election, in which Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in a stunning upset. The hearing will take place before the committee the congressman chairs, and scheduled to testify, among others, is FBI Director James Comey. The House Intel Committee is the body tasked with investigating supposed Russian government interference in the election, and Trump has asked that his claim of alleged illegal wiretapping of him by his predecessor, Barack Obama, also be included in the probe. To date, Nunes and Senate Intelligence Committee leaders have said that they have no evidence that the Obama administration intercepted the communications to and from Trump Tower, where Trump lived and worked during the election campaign. The Department of Justice last Friday delivered a dossier to the House and Senate Intel Committees containing information about Obamas alleged spying on Trump. In that regard, Nunes insisted in his Fox interview that, just as he said some days ago, that he still has seen no evidence of any telephone wiretapping, contrary to Trumps unprecedented and controversial claim. Nevertheless, the president has remained firm in his accusation and on Friday, going so far during a White House press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to repeat it.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

By Ian Allison Updated March 20, 2017 07:21 GMT IBM Blockchain is open for business with the announcement of security enhancements within its cloud environment to coincide with the release of Hyperledger Fabric version 1.0. IBM is also announcing a blockchain-based KYC and digital identity system with SecureKey and a number of Canadian banks, as well as partnership with Beijing Energy-Blockchain Labs to deploy the first carbon assets development platform based on Hyperledger Fabric. The announcements are being made at InterConnect, IBM's annual 20,000-strong cloud and cognitive developer bonanza in Las Vegas. Jerry Cuomo, head of blockchain at IBM, pointed out that blockchain networks were only as safe as the cloud infrastructure they resided on. "For that reason, IBM's High Security Business Network is built on the industry's most secure infrastructure, IBM LinuxONE. "Secure services containers help guard against privileged user threats and tamper-resistant cryptographic keys ensure the highest levels of encryption for sensitive data," he said. A few weeks ago Hyperledger Fabric was promoted by Linux Foundation from incubator state to active state and is now at version 1.0. The IBM Blockchain is being refreshed to include Fabric version 1.0. Cuomo said the High Security Business Network, which underpins the IBM cloud environment, can be thought of as a sub-brand like Intel Inside. He said this can involve physical hardware-based security modules; one of the rules of deployment could be that everyone must keep their crypto keys in a vault, for example. "It's like a handshake. There is a governance rule that says, when you join our network you are going to put your keys here and if your keys aren't in there then you can't run on this network," said Cuomo. In detail, the IBM Blockchain security offering meets the industry's highest Evaluation Assurance Level certification of EAL5+, found in highly regulated industries such as government, financial services and healthcare. It features secure service containers to protect all code throughout the blockchain application, effectively encapsulating the blockchain into a virtual appliance and denying access even to someone with the highest level of security credentials. Tamper-responsive hardware security modules protect encrypted data for storage of cryptographic keys. These modules are certified to FIPS 140-2, the highest level of security certification available for cryptographic modules. Cuomo added: "With some security systems, if you are tampering with the vault it will record it in a log. That's like the lower levels of support. But in the case of higher levels of support, if the system is being tampered with it will shut it down within your environment; it will turn your system into a brick and disable all operation for your piece of the network. "You want to make sure members are using physical security as well, like your software stack won't boot unless it matches a fingerprint of all of the other software stack users in that network. "This is where the cloud can actually help. We are trying to make running blockchain on a cloud more intuitive and actually flip it around and say, you should always run it this way. "It is another dimension to the security model. One is the security of the ledger, and the second is the security of environment in which the ledger is running. We are not leaving any stone unturned." IBM also announced new governance and open-source developer tools for IBM Blockchain that make it easy to set up a blockchain network and assign roles and levels of visibility from a single dashboard. They help network members set rules, manage membership and enforce compliance once the network is up and running. Once setup is initiated, members can determine the rules of the blockchain and share consent when new members requesting to join the network. In addition, the deployment tool assigns each network a Network Trust Rating of 1 to 100. Cuomo said the reputation score will inform prospective members of a network how trustworthy and reliable that network is, and also provides hints about how to make it more trustworthy and reliable. "There will also be policies such as who is allowed to invite new members to come in. One policy is that the founder can have a dictator condition. It can make sense for one company in the business network or a government institution, like a department of motor vehicles, that is more trusted than the others. "Or you may have more democratic policy, so it has to be a majority of the members vote yes. The more democratic your policies, the higher your trust score. It's early days still but these are some of the things we have learned by having some of these real networks running on IBM Blockchain." IBM and SecureKey blockchain identity system IBM Blockchain and SecureKey's digital identity and attribute sharing network, which will go live later in 2017, allows consumers to better control their identifying information and instantly verify their identity for new bank accounts, driver's licences or other utilities, said a statement. The system is being tested by a number of Canadian banks, including BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, RBC, Scotiabank and TD. The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) and the Command Control and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analytics (CCICADA), are also invested in the project. Reducing carbon emissions in China Beijing Energy-Blockchain Labs and IBM are breaking ground by helping enterprises in China foster carbon asset development, also known as CER (Carbon Emission Reduction) quota issuing. Following a proof of concept in late 2016, a beta version of the carbon trading platform on blockchain will be released in May. Energy-Blockchain Labs and IBM intend to commercially offer this platform later this year, keeping pace with China's unified national carbon market opening. Regarding the Energy-Blockchain Labs project, Cuomo said it was another fortuitous example of the Hyperledger Project's reach in building a worldwide community. "The folks in China they are members of the Hyperledger Project. If it weren't for that, I don't think we'd have ever met them, let alone team up with them to work on a project."

Even before the dust around the disclosures settle down, U.S. companies responded to the data breach, demonstrating their nimbleness and dynamism. The Case In Brief Last week, WikiLeaks released the first part of a series of leaks code named "Vault 7," with the first part termed as "Year Zero." The publisher indicated in the leaks that the CIA had used sophisticated software tools to break into smartphones, computers and TVs. The companies whose products were compromised included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000 (OTC: SSNLF). Intel Springs Into Action Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s security unit McAfee announced the release a detection tool for EFI rootkits following the WikiLeaks revelation. ICYMI we released a detection tool for EFI rootkits after last week's #WikiLeaks dump. Details here: https://t.co/44GodO19uJ via @pcworld — McAfee (@McAfee) March 15, 2017 A rootkit is a software designed to conceal any compromise on an operating system. It works by empowering the viruses and malware to pose as necessary files, thereby avoiding detection by antivirus software. EFI, or extensible firmware Interface, is a new firmware standard for operating system that supports fast PC startup, bootable GPT hard drive and large capacity more than 2T. It runs before the operating system and initializes the various hardware components during the boot process. Therefore, a malicious program hidden inside the EFI can inject malicious code into the OS kernel, helping to restore any malware removed from the computer, a report in PC World explains. The WikiLeaks disclosure mentioned an OS X implant called DerStarke, which consists of a kernel code injection module called Bokor and an EFI persistence module called DarkMatter. The CIA Embedded Development Branch document leaked by WikiLeaks also refers to another implant called QuarkMatter. Others Scramble To Cover Up A SBS report, quoting Czech anti-virus software maker Avast VP Sinan Eren, said the company had sought from Apple and Google privileged access to their devices to offer fixes for known bugs. "If we can drive a paradigm shift where mobile platforms don't shut off access, we'll be better able to detect when hackers are hiding in a mobile (phone)," Eren was quoted as saying.

Evolution Media China and Shenzhen Capital Group Co Ltd led the round. PRESS RELEASE Shenzhen, China, March 16, 2017 – Makeblock Co., Ltd, the STEM education and robotics startup, today announced it has closed a $30 million Series B round at a $200 million valuation led by Evolution Media China and Shenzhen Capital Group Co., Ltd. The new investment brings Makeblock’s total funding to over $36 million. The funding supports Makeblock’s expansion into new markets, as well as further product development and diversification of STEM education hardware, software and curriculum resources for educators, children and hobbyists. With the infusion of capital, Makeblock will expand its global footprint with new offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, North America, Japan, and the Netherlands. Currently, Makeblock is available in more than 140 countries with 1,600 channel partners, and 20,000 schools and educational organizations implementing Makeblock’s products into their educational curriculum. “We’re excited to support Makeblock at this pivotal point in their growth as they continue to elevate STEM education to a new level” said Jason Ding, President at Evolution Media China. “STEM education is the next industry to experience deep disruption, following in the footsteps of the mobile, IoT and virtual reality industries. Over the past few years, Makeblock has been leading the charge in creating practical products for STEM education in the classroom and at home, and we believe this is just the beginning of their path to transforming education.” Since 2016, Makeblock experienced significant growth, expanding its workforce to over 300 employees worldwide. Makeblock will use this latest round of funding to invest in further STEM/STEAM education distribution, global expansion, and the development of new initiatives built upon its most recent work with Microsoft, Intel and beyond. The company will also be expanding its retail reach in the coming months, deepening its partnership with Barnes & Noble and SoftBank to put Makeblock products in more stores across the globe. “Creation is happening everywhere at an explosive rate. From schools using Makeblock to teaching STEM concepts, to tech giants like Microsoft, Intel, Apple Education tapping Makeblock to unleash creativity in the classroom, down to parents at home trying to aid in their child’s education, the true power of Makeblock as a platform is to inspire creation,” said Founder and CEO Jasen Wang, “Our goal is to get Makeblock in every school, every home, every creative space to give anyone, at any age the ability to be a creator or inventor.” In addition to international expansion, the funding will support the launch of Makeblock’s first annual robotics competition later in 2017, which will encourage students to compete with their creative projects using Makeblock’s construction platform. This competition is in support of Premier Li Keqiang’s “Thirteenth Five Year Plan” on education announced in 2016. Makeblock’s latest award-winning product, Airblock, a modular STEM drone that raised $830,000 in December 2016 on Kickstarter, will be available for purchase in retail stores starting May 2017. On March 8, Makeblock also announced its new product Neuron via Kickstarter – a programmable electronic blocks platform for open-ended gadget building.

Quigley expects no bombshells at Intelligence hearing U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill. (pictured in February 2016), doesn't expect bombshells or deeply classified information to emerge from Monday’s long-awaited House Intelligence panel hearing into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. | Sun-Times file photo Lynn Sweet @lynnsweet | email Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter  Sign-Up Follow @lynnsweet Don’t expect big bombshells or deeply classified information to emerge from Monday’s long-awaited House Intelligence panel hearing into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election — and other related possible spying. That’s according to Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., the only member from Illinois on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which is holding its first hearing about Russia’s role in the 2016 contest. FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers will testify on-the-record under oath starting at 9 a.m. Chicago time as President Donald Trump deplores as “fake news” stories suggesting potential links between people in the Trump orbit and Russia. I caught up with Quigley on Sunday on what might occur at the Monday session as he was boarding a plane to fly from Chicago to Washington. Quigley has been on the Intel panel for two-and-a-half years. The potentially sprawling congressional probe is “far more extensive than people are imagining,” Quigley told me. OPINION Follow @lynnsweet He said the most important question to ask is “was there collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians?” Quigley said Russians should be taken in the broad sense — the official Russian government and other actors. QUIGLEY’S OTHER TAKES . . . On whether secrets will be revealed on Monday: “It’s important to say this. This is an open hearing (in contrast to closed sessions where classified material is discussed) so these guys aren’t going to reveal some big secret. “This is an ongoing investigation. It’s going to be awhile and I suspect that what we are going to see Monday is more of a framing of this — the scope of the investigation rather than some earth-shattering thing.” At the most, what might be learned on Monday? “You will see Comey rebut the notion of wiretapping of Trump Tower,” the allegation Trump made in a series of tweets two weeks ago. The chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has said there is no evidence of a Trump Tower wiretap. Quigley agrees with the GOP chairman on this one. GOP focus at the hearing: Republicans “will focus their concerns about leaks” surfacing in news stories about the Russians and the election. Quigley’s best guess: The GOP members may go down the road of pushing Comey and Rogers to explain “How do these leaks happen? How are we investigating them and how do we prevent them in the future? Democratic focus: Democrats’ lines of inquiry will be about Russian’s possible collusion with “with the Trump political campaign and how do we prevent this from happening in the future.” “. . . You will see individual members from the Democratic side focus on individuals involved with this issue.” Those in the Trump orbit: Democrats likely will raise questions about Russian links and could include, Quigley said, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, former NSA chief Mike Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Quigley’s bottom line: “I am just looking for a thorough, thoughtful, bipartisan, bicameral investigation that gets to the facts wherever they lead us.” “. . . There is a lot of work involved, but we are going to get to the bottom of this.” The Senate Intelligence Committee, also run by Republicans, is also looking into the matter of Russian interference in the election. Does Quigley know secrets? “I suspect everyone on the Intelligence Committee has been briefed on things that are not publically known.” Tweets by @lynnsweet # House Intelligence hearing U.S. Rep.

Photo: CFP  Students from a rural primary school in East China's Jiangsu Province won the qualification to participate in the final of a robotics competition in Columbia, but they could not afford the costs for attending the event. The school decided to give up the opportunity on Tuesday, after local education authorities noted that robotic competition is not a project that they could support. The incident shows that disparities between rural and urban education still exist, experts said, and the country has vowed to bridge the gap. Lack of funding The team of four students from Jing'an Primary School in Rudong county, Jiangsu, won the first place in robot jousting in RoboRAVE Asia 2017, which was held in Beijing in February, Jiangsu-based Modern Express newspaper reported on March 12. They beat rivals from professional clubs and elite schools in big cities of countries like China, Japan and India. "I just wanted to broaden the children's horizon … and never thought we could win a place in the final," said Wang Yafei, a mathematics teacher in the school who was leading the team. RoboRAVE Asia 2017 is part of Intel's RoboRAVE, an International robotics competition for teams of students from elementary school, high school and beyond high school to test their design skills in one or more events, according to the competition's official website. Winners of RoboRAVE Asia would be qualified to attend the RoboRAVE International 2017 to be held in Medellin, Colombia in May. However, the Jing'an students have to give up the opportunity to attend the event in Colombia because their school and families could not afford the cost - 43,000 yuan ($6,235) for each child, said the Modern Express. The report soon sparked heated discussion online, with many people appealing to the authorities to help fulfill the dream of the children. However, on March 13, the Rudong educational bureau said that the competition was not on the list of "competitions high school and primary school students could participate" released by the Jiangsu provincial education department in 2017. "As we neither approved nor agreed with them joining (this competition), how can we support them financially?" a Rudong educational official told thepaper.cn on Tuesday. Passion for science It was not the first time that the robotics teams in Jing'an had won the first place in national or international competitions, nor the first time they had to give up the chance to go further. Jing'an High School has given up the chance to join the RoboRAVE International twice, the Modern Express reported. "We have become used to that," Yuan Xiao, a teacher from Jing'an High School, told the newspaper. According to the Modern Express, the robotics society in Jing'an Primary School was founded in 2015 by Wang. Now the society has more than 20 children who attend trainings on Friday and Sunday. The costs for joining the competitions in the past years were mainly covered by students' parents. But this time, 43,000 yuan is roughly equal to the annual income of a village family, according to the Modern Express. Jing'an Primary School's case also highlights the imbalance in the education resources available in rural and urban areas, Hu Xingdou, a professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday. China will carry out reforms to integrate compulsory education in urban and rural areas and improve education in rural areas, according to a circular issued by the State Council in July 2016. The reforms are set to reduce educational gap between urban and rural areas and coordinate compulsory education with urbanization at the county level by 2020, further improving the quality and balance in compulsory education, according to the website of the Chinese government. "It is a great pity these rural students cannot fulfill their wish. China has vowed to build a creative nation, and the key is to foster the creativity of children," Hu said. "It is not to say that the education department should pay for any interest of students, but robots and artificial intelligence have become the trend of science and technology education globally, which could change the world, so the government should support these kinds of projects," Hu noted. | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

By Necta Casiple on March 21, 2017 12:35 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Apple | Rumors are rife that Apple is holding an event this spring, but until now, we haven’t seen any invites rolled out yet. With a few days left until the month ends, the possibility of a quiet release for the company’s new products increases by the day. While the said event could happen anytime in the next two weeks, hints are all pointing that the surprise launch will happen tomorrow. Is there a MacBook 2017 and iMac 2017 release announcement? MacRumors discovered that Apple’s system status page indicates that the Apple Store will close for maintenance tomorrow morning from 3 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. This could mean nothing but merely a scheduled maintenance. However, it’s worth noting that the latter time is when Apple usually issues press releases for announcements, including new products. There might be a strong possibility that once the site comes back on, a new product will already be there. Apple also traditionally takes down its online store for a few hours when there are new products arriving. The downtime allows landing pages and purchasing options for those devices. Combine this coincidence with the speculation about its product updates that has been circulating on the rumor mill for a while now, some fans definitely cannot help but be suspicious. If our instinct is correct, what would Tim Cook and the company release tomorrow? The MacBook 2017 line is one to consider. Macbook 2017 According to MacWorld, the Cupertino-based tech giant didn’t update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, which saw the launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. After that event, Apple discontinued the 11-inch MacBook Air, a move that highly suggests that the 12-inch MacBook could fill in the Air lineup’s shoes as its consumer-oriented Mac laptops. And since the 2015 version was launched during the company’s spring event, we’ll hopefully see this year’s version introduced at the same schedule as well. However, there’s still a chance that we won’t. The site notes that Apple only revealed the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro, and new Apple Watch straps at its spring event last year. Instead, Apple quietly launched the new MacBook a few weeks later in April 2016. If we don’t see it at its spring event, we can anticipate that the 2017 MacBook will see a similarly quiet launch not long after. Apple iMac 2017 The iMac is also due for an update. Rumors have it that the company will utilize AMD’s latest RYZEN chips for the iMac 2017 instead of Intel’s i7 chips. Apart from exceeding Intel i7 in a CPU performance benchmark, AMD’s new chips also agree with Apple’s shift to focus more on the economy of energy consumption than maximum performance. If we’re lucky, we might see its newest version in the spring event too. Otherwise, it’ll probably launch during the WWDC 2017 on June 5 to 9. Other good guesses would be updated iPads and spec-bumped version of the iPhone SE. But then again, these are all but confirmed, so everyone should take them with a grain of salt. Update: As anticipated, Apple released a new range of devices and accessories today, but the MacBook 2017 and iMac 2017 were not included. Among the new items that hit Apple’s online store earlier this morning were a new 9.7-inch iPad, red iPhone 7, iPhone SE storage bump, Apple Watch bands, and iPhone cases. 9Also Read: MacBook Pro 2017 Release Update: ARM-based Laptops To Appear This Year?

Turner calls Comey hearing 'highly speculative' By Jason Kurtz Updated 9:59 PM ET, Mon March 20, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Turner: Ball in Trump's court on Obama apology Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Turner: Ball in Trump's court on Obama apology 05:54 (CNN)On a day that saw FBI Director James Comey testify before the House Intelligence Committee, Erin Burnett made the issue the focus of her evening news program by welcoming a man who was in the room as the testimony was given. Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio is a Republican member of the Intelligence Committee, and cautioned anyone from forming opinions based solely on what Comey shared Monday morning. 9 things we learned from the Comey hearing "I think it certainly is highly speculative and people shouldn't be jumping to conclusions," said Turner, referencing in particular Comey's revelation the FBI is investigating potential Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. "This is an important issue and it does need to be addressed, but it certainly shouldn't be played out in the media." GOP @RepMikeTurner tells @ErinBurnett discussions of possible Trump-Russia collusion are "highly speculative" https://t.co/6Bn4kYfeVs— OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) March 20, 2017 Monday's hearing also touched on President Trump's claim that his Trump Tower phone lines had been tapped by former President Barack Obama, which Comey said didn't happen. In light of that, the "OutFront" host asked Turner about Trump's next move. "Do you think that President Trump should apologize, that he should retract the accusations that he made, which frankly were personal, they were alleging that President Obama had done something criminal?" Burnett asked her guest. "Should he apologize?" Read More "At this point ... the ball's in his court," he replied. "We've had the FBI director say that there's been no evidence ... the ball's in the President's court to explain what did he mean ... by this tweet, and why is he saying that." JUST WATCHED Electronics banned from cabins on some flights Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Electronics banned from cabins on some flights 01:41 Meanwhile, it's also worth noting that Turner's live CNN interview came after breaking news on the global terror front, as it was revealed that electronics larger than mobile phones may be banned from certain incoming US flights originating in the Middle East. Intel from Yemen raid may be tied to a ban of electronic devices on some US-bound flights, @Rene_MarshCNN reports https://t.co/svtTVyQb04— OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) March 20, 2017 Noting that he hadn't yet been briefed, Turner said the new ruling seemed sensible. "There has been some concern for some time about electronic items being used to hide explosive devices and their threats to airline traffic," Turner told Burnett. "This is all about getting the intelligence we need, applying it to the type of protections and interventions that we can do, and then trying to lessen that threat and this certainly sounds like it could be part of that."

On the accusation of wiretapping, Comey did not even provide a fig leaf for the White House. In addition to asserting that the FBI has no evidence to support the wiretapping charges, Comey noted, “The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets.” The one-two punch from the FBI director made for a rough day for Trump and his aides.  On Twitter, MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough called it “the worst day of Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTillerson to embassies: ID groups for tougher screening US probes Manafort’s banking: report America must improve defense against Russia's information warfare MORE’s presidency.”   The White House was quick to create distance White House press secretary Sean Spicer took to the lectern in the press briefing room in the afternoon as Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers were still testifying on Capitol Hill. Spicer’s briefing was notable for the vigor with which he sought to put distance between the White House and the figures around whom speculation about Russian ties has swirled. The effort was undermined, however, by Spicer’s insistence that one of those people, Paul Manafort, played “a very limited role” in Trump’s presidential bid.  In fact, Manafort became campaign chairman in May last year and effectively ran Trump’s campaign between June and August. Spicer’s assertion drew negative comments from a number of prominent reporters, both on Twitter and on cable news, where the networks covered the events intensely throughout the day. Spicer also took a verbal swing at “hangers-on around the campaign,” which appeared to be a reference to Carter Page, whose level of involvement with Team Trump remains unclear. Page, sometimes described as a campaign adviser on foreign policy, took a trip to Moscow last summer. Concrete details are scarce, and speculation is intense about that trip. Trump loyalists have long been scathing about Page, but the push against Manafort — and to a more modest degree against controversial GOP consultant and longtime Trump friend Roger Stone — has only set the media’s antennae twitching with the sense that something big is around the corner.   Republicans want to make leaks the real story While Democrats pushed their belief that there was something nefarious going on between the Trump campaign and Russia, Republicans stuck equally ferociously to insisting that people with access to classified information were leaking it to damage the new administration.  Rep. Trey GowdyTrey GowdyIntelligence chairman sparks storm with Trump briefing FBI Director Comey hearing a dud for Democrats THE MEMO: Five takeaways from Comey’s big day MORE (R-S.C.) was especially passionate on that topic. At one point, Gowdy appeared to suggest that reporters who published classified information should be prosecuted. Even Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), who is generally seen as a more moderate figure than Gowdy, asserted, “I’ve never seen such a sustained period of leaks.”  Several Republican members of the panel seemed disquieted by how the controversy involving Michael Flynn came into the public domain. Flynn resigned after the shortest tenure ever as national security adviser when it emerged that he had misled Vice President Pence about the nature of phone conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. More broadly, however, there seemed to be an attempt to bolster the White House narrative that there is a “deep state” working to undermine the president.  “The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!” the president tweeted on Monday morning.   Comey won’t be easy to sully The Trump administration can’t have been happy with Comey’s testimony, but so far it is resisting any impulse to go on an all-out attack against him. The first question Spicer faced at his briefing — from Jonathan Karl of ABC News — was whether the president still had “complete confidence” in the FBI director. “There’s no reason to believe he doesn’t at this time,” Spicer replied. While hardly a rip-roaring endorsement, those words underline the trouble the White House faces. Comey famously earned the ire of Democrats in the closing stretch of last year’s presidential campaign when he announced that the bureau was investigating newly discovered messages possibly related to its investigation into Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonObama and Trump haven’t talked since inauguration Perez, Ellison start multistate ‘turnaround tour’ for Dems Watergate reporter on Russia: 'I’ve been saying for a while there’s a coverup going on' MORE’s use of a private email server while secretary of State. Some in Clinton’s orbit believe Comey’s announcement cost her the election. Whether that is true or not, Team Trump would have a near-impossible task in trying paint Comey as biased against it.   The White House is under a cloud Near the end of the day’s proceedings, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) told Comey he had put “a big gray cloud” over the White House. Nunes, who worked on Trump’s transition team, appeared to be expressing dismay at that reality. But both parties would accept it as a fact. The political dynamics have changed now that the FBI investigation is public knowledge.  The White House can expect to face questions on a daily basis about the probe, while the media attention on what Comey’s agents are finding, and about whom, will be feverish. The Memo is a reported column primarily focused on Donald Trump’s presidency. Tags Hillary Clinton Barack Obama Donald Trump Trey Gowdy   View the discussion thread.

Tails 3.0 Anonymous LiveCD Gets Third Beta Release with Important Security Fixes GO The Tails Greeter received the most attention Mar 21, 2017 00:41 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  The developers of the Tails amnesic incognito live system announced the availability of the third Beta release of the upcoming major Tails 3.0 operating system, which will be based on the soon-to-be-released Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" OS. Filled with a bunch of important security fixes, Tails 3.0 Beta 3 is here about one week after the release of the second Beta milestone. It includes all the updates that have been released upstream in the Debian Testing repositories, which will soon become Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch." However, the Tails Greeter appears to be the component that received the most attention in this new Beta release, as it comes with a bunch of new keyboard shortcuts, namely Ctrl+Shift+N for accessing the Tor network settings, Ctrl+Shift+M for accessing the MAC spoofing settings, and Ctrl+Shift+A for setting an administrator password. Additionally, users will be able to use the Alt key to access the accelerators in the main window, and it looks like it finally makes the "Formats" settings work as designed. Other than that, Tails 3.0 Beta 3 removes support for the I2P anonymizing network, as promised by the Tails devs when they announced the release of Tails 2.11. The X11 guest utilities for VirtualBox are now present Those of you who want to use Tails on a virtual machine created with the popular VirtualBox virtualization software from Oracle will be happy to learn that the Tails 3.0 Beta 3 release re-introduces the X11 guest utilities that should make the clipboard sharing and shared folders features work again. This Beta of Tails 3.0 also comes with an updated graphics stack based on the latest X.Org Server display server using the modesetting driver by default, which should improve support for some Intel GPUs. It also automates the migration of KeePassX databases from the Tails 2.x series for the new format used by KeePassX 2.0.x. Check out the full changelog if you're interested in all the bug fixes implemented in this Beta of Tails 3.0, and don't hesitate to download the Live ISO images from our website if you want an early taste. Keep in mind that some know issues remain in the Beta 3 milestone, so study them on the release notes before testing. #Tails 3.0 Beta 3#Debian 9#Debian Stretch#Linux distribution#Anonymous Live CD subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Mesa 17.0.2 Brings Improvements to Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan Drivers openSUSE Tumbleweed Users Get Linux Kernel 4.10.3, GNOME 3.24 Coming Soon Koozali SME Server 9.2 Linux Distro to Be Based on CentOS 6.8, RC1 Out Now Mesa 13.0.6 Is the Last in the Series, Users Encouraged to Move to Mesa 17.0 Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    Tails 3.0 Beta 3 released Other Linux Distros Clonezilla LiveCD: A Debian-based Live CD that allows you to clone hard disks without installing any software GoboLinux: A free Linux operating that is quite different from other similar operating systems OSMC (formerly RaspBMC): An Open Source and free Debian-based Linux distribution that brings XBMC to Raspberry Pi Univention Corporate Server: A server Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux and designed for big corporations Escuelas Linux: A free, open source, easy-to-use and feature-rich educational GNU/Linux operating system Rockstor: A free, Open Source, powerful and smart NAS (Network-attached storage) solution.

For would be Andromeda adventurers the new drivers are recommended for performance and for the added Nvidia Ansel screenshot support. Mass Effect: Andromeda is the highly anticipated fourth outing for the Mass Effect franchise. This latest instalment takes action-RPG story-led sci-fi gameplay fans several hundred years ahead of the events that unfolded in the original trilogy - and the best experience will be on the PC, of course. Nvidia crows that the action in the PC version of Andromeda boasts "higher-fidelity effects, higher framerates, and support for higher resolutions". Indeed Mass Effect Andromeda on PC has support for 4K gameplay and vibrant scenes enhanced by HDR colour. With the latest game ready driver gamers should enjoy an optimal experience in their RPG passage. Those who enjoy taking screenshots might especially welcome the new driver. With Ansel support for Andromeda you can 'snap' plenty of great alien scenes as the picture above testifies (there's more on the Nvidia GeForce blog). The recommended hardware spec for gameplay at 1080p includes an Intel Core i7-4790 or AMD FX 8350 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, or GeForce GTX 970. Higher resolutions are playable with faster GPUs and SLI configurations (thanks to the new SLI profile). Mass Effect: Andromeda launches on 21st March in USA, and 23rd March in Europe. Rock Band VR If you thought the 378.92 WHQL drivers were all about being game ready for Mass Effect: Andromeda - think again. Rock Band VR (Oculus Rift ) will allow you to take to the virtual stage from 23rd March and this driver is game ready for it. In this musical VR game you can play your guitar controller, and possibly other instruments, in a live concert in front of virtually thousands of your NPC fans. Check out the video below. Other new stuff in 378.92 WHQL are; updated SLI profiles for: Dead Rising 4, and Deus Ex: Breach. Meanwhile, quite a few known issues remain, mainly for Windows 10 users. For the full release notes check out the official Nvidia PDF.
