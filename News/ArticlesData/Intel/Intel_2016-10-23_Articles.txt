According to the company, the 17th Intel Capital Global Summit gathers nearly 1,000 entrepreneurs, investors and technology business executives who will help create the future of technology. Among the distinguished speakers are Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, PayPal Chairman John Donahue, and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. This morning, representatives from all 12 startups were sharing their insights on stage during four panels, see below a brief overview of their technology. I met a few of them, and I will publish a few articles with more details regarding their particular products and technologies. Autonomous Machines Robotics and automation is becoming more and more present in our lives since computing power, cloud services and artificial intelligence and machine learning new algorithms have been developed. Autonomous driving became one of the trendiest topic this year at CES in Las Vegas, and we expect to see more of that in 2017. The first panel session was made of 3 companies in the field: Chronocam (Paris, France) develops a new kind of computer vision sensors and systems inspired by the human eye. According to CEO and co-founder Luca standard computer vision technologies found in smartphone or surveillance systems take a sequence of pictures and analyze one after the other to understand what is going on in a scene. Chronocam, does it differently, knowing that the human eye is only reactive to what is changing, the startup is trying to create “an image sensor that mimics the biologic eye, that leads to a very fast reaction time which is independent from lighting conditions” said Co-Founder and CEO Luca Verre. The company’s mission and goal is to “set a new standard in computer vision based on our technology” stated Verre, at the end of his speech. Embodied (Pasadena, California, U.S.), Co-founded by the former CTO of iRobot, maker of Roomba, CEO Paolo Pirjanian, the company is focused on robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Embodied is developing “life-like interactive characters to focus on something that will be very helpful, unfortunately since the company is in stealth mode I cannot talk about specific applications, but I can tell you it will be companion robots that will help our families and children to be nurtured and improve their quality of life” said Co-Founder and CEO Paolo Pirjanian. Since the tech is in stealth mode we did not learn too much about Embodied’s product except that it is based on the last 15 years of research that Paolo Pirjanian’s partner has been doing in the University of South California around socially assistive robots that “help elderly with Alzheimer, dementia all the way to children with development disabilities” said Pirjanian. Thanks to former iRobot CTO’s years of experience in consumer robotic, this complex R&D that “provides care” will be packaged in an affordable robotic product that could appeal to consumers. I am very curious to see those robots once they will be ready to launch, and see how they will be really useful for families! Perrone Robotics (Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.) provides software and solutions that make it easier and faster to build mobile autonomous robotics applications. “We create a software platform for autonomous vehicles and robots, and we call it Platform Max and we like to say that MAX is to robots what Windows is to computers or Android to smart phone, it enables customers to create more rapidly complex robotics applications.” Stated Foundr & CEO Paul Perrone. Data and Connectivity Eazytec (Jiangsu, China) is a smart city developer and service provider with proprietary core firmware (BIOS) technology. Bill Lu, Vice President, EazyTec was on stage to present the company, which provides solutions, among others, for monitoring water and air in China, using IoT technologies. Grand Chip Microelectronics (aka Kangxi Communication Technologies) (Shanghai, China), is a “fabless” company that delivers high-performance and affordable connectivity solutions for WLAN, Wi-Fi or cellular platforms and IoT. While on stage, CEO Ping Peng recommended to talk to him during the Global Summit if you are interested to know more about his technology. Paxata* (Redwood City, California, U.S.) is a self-service business information platform for both the business consumer and IT. With Paxata, business analysts, data engineers and data scientists can convert raw data to information ready for business efficiently. Based on a patent-pending, machine learning, natural language processing and semantic text algorithm technology built on a distributed architecture which enables massive scale. According to Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer Nenshad Bardoliwalla, “90% of the raw data was created in the last 11 months, and yet there is a very few folks in enterprise who can take that raw data and turn it into valuable contribution,Paxata mission is to take raw data and allow anybody in an organization and convert it into meaningful information”. StealthMine* (Sunnyvale, California, U.S.) a startup still in “stealth mode” according to CEO Vikrant Karvir, that let’s enterprise applications run on encrypted data. So “even if your underlying storage, network, compute, operating system or data platform is breached your application and your application data will be secure” said Karvir. Sports and Health CubeWorks* (Ann Harbor, Michigan, U.S.) creates the next-gen minuscule computers that measure a few millimeters and will enable the first autonomous wireless sensing platforms. Kinduct* (Halifax, Canada) delivers cloud-based data and analytics software for sport organizations, military and public safety units, healthcare providers, and wellness institutions. Aggregating data from multiple sources into a single actionable platform, Kinduct enables its customers to provide better care and better recomendations. K4Connect* (Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.) is a software platform that leverages IoT, sensing and mobile devices by integrating them into a single dashboard in senior living communities, to create smarter, healthier and happier environments for patients and families. I met with the company after the press conference, I will publish more details on the K4Connect software. Virtual Reality Dysonics* (San Francisco, California, U.S.) provides a software / hardware solution to professionals to capture and render 360-degree sound in real time, for VR live streaming experiences. Stay tuned, I have met Dysonics Co-Founder and CEO Robert Dalton Jr. and he told me a lot more about his technology. InContext Solutions* (Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) develops cloud-based virtual reality solutions for manufacturers and retailers, to help them simulate new services and products in VR before going to production.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 24, 2016 at 5:07PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently reported that its data-center group -- DCG for short -- saw revenue increase by 10% year over year during the third quarter. However, its operating profit for this business unit -- that's revenue less cost of goods sold and operating expenses -- dropped a bit. An enormous chip, known as an FPGA, manufactured in Intel's 14-nanometer tech. Source: Intel.  Intel's explanation for that drop ultimately boiled down to greater product manufacturing costs and increased investments in the business -- likely in the form of higher research and development spending. There appears to be interest in a more in-depth explanation of those higher manufacturing costs. Here's my take.  What affects chip manufacturing costs? At a basic level, chip manufacturing costs are impacted by two major factors: The cost of the silicon wafers upon which the chips are printed. The size of the chip being produced. The number of good chips that come off those wafers (also known as manufacturing yields). New manufacturing technologies usually require additional processing steps to reduce chip size and improve performance. This means that investors can count on wafer costs moving up with each generation. However, just because wafer costs continue to rise doesn't necessarily mean that chip costs must go up. New manufacturing technologies also tend to allow companies to cram more transistors -- which is what a chip is made of -- into a given area. There are 18 cores in this chip. Intel's 2017 server processors will have up to 28. Image source: Intel.  The goal of these area reductions is to reduce the chip area by more than the wafer cost increases, enabling a cost-per-transistor reduction. This allows a chip designer to build a more feature-packed chip for the same cost as a prior-generation product or a similar chip at a lower cost. However, even if the first two factors combine to deliver what should be lower-cost chips, manufacturing yields can throw a wrench into that. If, on a mature process, 90% of the chips produced are salable, while on a new process only 25% of the chips produced can be sold, then even if the new process gives a 20% cost-per-transistor improvement, a chip on the older process will cost less than the same chip built on the newer process. The Intel server chip margin connection In the table below, I have included the chip sizes for both Intel's prior-generation server processors manufactured in a 22-nanometer process (Haswell), as well as the company's latest generation 14-nanometer server processors (Broadwell). Chip Configuration Haswell Server Die Area (mm^2) Broadwell Server Die Area (mm^2) Area Reduction (%) Small chip (LCC) 354 246 30.5 Middle chip (MCC) 492 306 37.8 Large chip (HCC) 662 456 31.1 Source: SemiAccurate, Tom's Hardware.  Notice that the area reduction generation over generation for these parts ranges from 30% to about 38%. Intel Executive Vice President Stacy Smith once told investors that the wafer cost increase in moving from the 22-nanometer technology to the newer 14-nanometer technology would be about 30%, so it's no surprise that Intel aimed to reduce the chip areas by around 30% to offset the increased cost per area. So what does this have to do with Intel's server chip margins? As discussed above, the new chips appear to be designed to be no more expensive to manufacture than their predecessors. In a situation where manufacturing yields on the older-generation chips and the newer-generation chips are at parity, Intel's margins should be roughly flat to slightly up (in the case of that MCC chip). However, since 14-nanometer yields appear to be meaningfully worse, the 14-nanometer chips wind up being more expensive than the prior-generation 22-nanometer products. This ultimately leads to the lower margins that Intel suffered from in bringing those new chips to market. As manufacturing yields improve on Intel's 14-nanometer technology, its manufacturing costs should come down, ultimately helping to boost margins higher. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Home Consulting Advertise Contact & About Archive Price Lists (deprecated) Frisky Gen-Z’s to battle boomer Intel by Robin Harris on Monday, 24 October, 2016 The internalization of storage is spawning another war – this time in memory interconnects. From Anandtech: This week sees the launch of the Gen-Z Consortium, featuring names such as ARM, Huawei, IBM, Mellanox, Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix and Xilinx, with the purpose of designing a new memory semantic fabric that focuses on the utilization of ‘on-package and storage class memoryʼ (HMC, phase-change, 3D XPoint etc) at the hardware level. Let’s unpack that. A bunch of companies, not including Intel or Microsoft, wants to build a standard for using memory as storage. The semantics refer to the limited instruction set that the new bus will use – reads, writes, load, store, put/get – for block-based storage class memory. Further, they plan to scale the interconnect from nodes – inside the server – to racks. The consortium has lofty goals: Memory media independence. Enable any type and mix of DRAM and non-volatile memory (NVM) to be directly accessed by applications or through block-semantic communications. High-bandwidth, low-latency. Efficient, memory-semantic protocol supporting a range of signaling rates and link widths that scale from 10s to 100s of GB/s of bandwidth. Multipath. High signaling rates (up to 112 GT/s), and traffic segregation so services and applications may be isolated. Scalability. From point-to-point to rack-scale, switch-based topologies. Oh, yeah. Cheap too, uses existing form factors and cables. This all sounds great. But here’s the kicker: Gen-Z supports a wide variety of component types including processors, memory modules, FPGAs, GPU / GPGPU, DSP, I/O, accelerators, NICs, custom ASICs, and many more. Processors? And Intel isn’t on board? Micron, of course, is Intel’s partner for 3D XPoint, and, if you look at the ownership of their JV, is in charge. But I think they want to keep Intel happy. The StorageMojo take Hurrah for Gen-Z! I like what they’re trying to do, even if the Gen-Z everywhere and anywhere over anything message threatens to fragment the effort into a dozen or more “standard” but incompatible implementations. Give people a lot of options and they’ll take ’em. Even though they will rarely all choose the same ones. The larger issue is that the consortium members don’t want to surrender storage class memory to Intel’s tender mercies. And that I support too. But on-chip interfaces to SCM will be way more performant than off-chip. The Gen-Z Gang of Eight faces an uphill fight, at least in x86 land. OTOH, Intel may face anti-trust scrutiny if they are too aggressive in locking out competing technologies. I’ll make some popcorn. This will be fun to watch. Courteous comments welcome, of course.

But 2017's looking up – there'll be loads of IPOs, beams Intel Verizon boss: Yahoo! email hack 'is a big deal to us', we'll decide new price next month Intel throws the ball long with sports, VR and IoT cash injections Intel has launched a new group to cozy up to pro-sports, aimed at working with the major leagues to introduce the next wave of technology from virtual reality to data analytics, tracking and image capture. The new Intel Sports Group was announced Monday by Wendell Brooks, president of Intel's venture capital arm, Intel Capital – alongside a raft of investments in 12 companies amounting to $38m. Some of those companies will be directly involved in the "digitization" of sport, something that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said would amount to "the biggest change in sports in decades." Key in that shift is the hot topic of virtual reality. Among the investments Intel has made – typically as the lead investor in a round of funding – are: A number of companies working on image capture, including super-fast video as well as 3D and VR. A company specializing in 3D audio. Several wireless sensing and analytics companies. Chronocam, based in Paris, works from the fact that the human eye tends to only store information, or at least focus its attention, where there is movement. By doing the same, the company hopes to be able to create new vision sensors and systems that provide a more human visual experience than current systems – and one that works much faster. The result could be the ability to experience the visceral rush of, for example, scoring a touchdown, without it feeling like a simulation or lacking sufficient clarity or resolution. Dysonics is doing for hearing what VR cameras are doing for vision. The company demoed its multi-direction microphone (with eight mics in a 360-degree container) and software that allows sound to move about as you move your head. The end result is that it can put you at an event, especially a live one, in a way that is more realistic and hence more engaging than anything currently available. "Audio is roughly 50 per cent of your experience at a live event," argued its CEO Robert Dalton Jr. "When it comes to 360-degree content [ie, VR], that can be 60, 70 even 80 per cent of your experience." At the other end, CubeWorks unveiled tiny sensors – tiny enough to be placed under your skin – that can sense everything from movement to pressure. Grand Chip Microelectronics (aka Kangxi Communication Technologies) is working on a next-generation wireless tech that will provide longer range as well as faster and cheaper data transfer. And Kinduct offers data and analytics software for sports organizations (as well as health, public safety and military) that provides insights into how to improve and understand performance and movement. Taken together, all these new technologies have the ability to capture and recreate physical events in a way that could bring the user closer than ever to having the experience of sitting courtside during a real basketball match, or eventually even racing down the touchline on the way to winning the Superbowl – live as it happens. "This has the ability to fundamentally change user experience in the world," said Brooks. As to why Intel is interested in getting involved in all these emerging technologies, Brooks – an avid sports fan – pointed out that every one of these devices would be tied back to the data center and to the cloud. Intel Capital has typically invested the same amount of money, but in double the number of companies. Brooks, who has been at the company less than a year, said he hopes to invest more in fewer companies as a way to "add value on a different vector." Or in other words, make specific things happen faster with greater payoff. This year, the bulk of that approach appears to be in the brave new world of immersive entertainment. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register Intel taps baton, tells the IoT orchestra to tune up Chipzilla updates dev environment for Thing connectivity Intel's new chip targets industrial IoT The E3900 family doubles performance 20 Comments Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 28 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

The funding comes from lead investor Intel Capital, along with iBionext, Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH, 360 Capital, CEAi and Renault Group. Chronocam will use the investment to continue building a world-class team to accelerate product development and commercialize its computer vision sensing and processing technology. The funding will also allow the company to expand into key markets, including the US and Asia. Chronocam's proprietary approach leverages the company's deep expertise in computer vision technology, sensor design and neuromorphic computing, which mimics the human brain. The Chronocam method uses innovative data capture techniques to greatly improve performance, dynamic range and power efficiency of cameras in a wide range of applications. "Conventional computer vision approaches are not well-suited to the requirements of a new generation of vision-enabled systems," said Luca Verre, CEO and co-founder of Chronocam. "For example, autonomous vehicles require faster sensing systems which can operate in a wider variety of ambient conditions. In the IoT segment, power budgets, bandwidth requirements and integration within sensor networks make today's vision technologies impractical and ineffective." "Chronocam's unique bio-inspired technology introduces a new paradigm in capturing and processing visual data, and addresses the most pressing market challenges head-on," Verre continued. "We are well-positioned to capitalize on this significant market opportunity; and we appreciate the confidence demonstrated by our investors as we roll out our technology to an increasing number of customers." "The world is becoming increasingly connected and intelligent. And computer vision is a key enabler of this trend, particularly for the automotive industry and Internet of Things," said Wendell Brooks, senior vice president at Intel and president of Intel Capital. "Connected machines can quickly and accurately visualize their environment and act on that data in real time, for example, bringing the potential to protect lives with safer roads. We look forward to helping Chronocam bring the next generation of smart machine vision systems to market." Chronocam Chronocam is developing a unique, bio-inspired and self-adapting approach to the need for visual sensing and processing in autonomous vehicles, connected devices, security and surveillance systems. Its innovative vision sensors and systems replicate the functioning of the human eye and address the limitations of conventional vision sensors by enabling real time sensing of the relevant dynamic scene context and acquiring only what is necessary. The result is that Chronocam's vision solutions set a new benchmark for computer vision performance with unprecedented speed, dynamic range, sensor level video compression and power efficiency, at the same time. Based in Paris, Chronocam is a venture backed company with investors including 360 Capital, CEA Investissement, iBionext, Intel Capital, Renault-Nissan Group, and Robert Bosch Venture Capital.

What To Know Now About Wearable Tech International Business Times 10/24/2016 Alexandra Suarez © Provided by IBT US The world of wearable tech, as we know it, is growing and consistently pushing the existing boundaries between technology and what we wear. What began with fitness trackers, smartwatches and other tech-driven accessories, has since blossomed into wearable technology that can measure, monitor and report on our health, now, from the very fabric of our clothing. Popular Searches Audi AG AUDVF ▼ 656.20 -11.30 -1.69% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS ▼ 56.71 -4.18 -6.86% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% Aptose Biosciences Inc APTO ▲ 0.9300 +0.0300 +3.33% Wearable tech has been the hot topic of the year with brands like Fitbit. The fitness tracking brand pulled ahead of Apple and Samsung as the top purveyor of leading wearable devices.  Fitbit recently reported first-quarter net income of $11 million on $505.4 million in revenue. As consumers’ response to tech has varied, from the unfavorable (Google Glass) to the hopeful (VR Goggles), the question remains: How will the consumer respond to the meteoric developments in the world of wearables? “It’s this convergence of really figuring out how you integrate technology in a visible way, yet it’s meaningful to the consumer. Every brand has a unique consumer,” Sandra Lopez, vice president of strategic relationships/business development for Intel’s New Devices Group, told The International Business Times at the 2016 Fashion Tech Forum, which was held in Brooklyn Oct. 13. Founded by CEO and consultant Karen Harvey, this was the conference’s third year and played host to innovators in the wearables space, from Sandra Lopez, Intel's vice president of wearables, to Paul Dillinger, Levi’s vice president of global product innovation.  Lopez has championed Intel’s bite-size module device, Intel’s Curie Module, and formed partnerships with fashion brands like Baja East, Hussein Chalayan and Oakley to integrate the device, a mix of software and hardware, into their accessories, making virtually any piece a wearable. Lopez said the success of wearable pieces lies in how each brand harnesses the technology to make it work for consumers. And “one size” does not fit all.  “It’s personal. I firmly believe that the people who are not using their Fitbits and put it in their drawer three months later, it probably wasn’t for them to begin with. “As a technology company, there is not one solution for everybody,” Lopez added. “We’re all different. Bringing relevant experiences and multiple experiences is going to be the key to success.” In 2016, there is no shortage of brands and companies that have delivered to bring consumers those “relevant” and continued experiences. From wearable, tech-driven fabrics to mood, health and wellness trackers, here are 10 brands and products that are redefining “wearable tech” to bring consumers smart, intuitive experiences through technology.  Tech Fabrics: Garments that feature “smart” fabric will be the washable, everyday answer to the wearable tech accessory. Google and Levi’s teamed up on Project Jacquard, which was first announced in May and champions garments made from yarns that can interact directly with digital devices and smartphones.  Using integrated GPS and electronics that are washable, Wearable Experiments also debuted a line of pieces that connect wearers to experience, or “human/computer” interaction. The company released a sports jersey, aptly named the Fan Jersey, prior to the Super Bowl that transmits haptic vibrations, allowing fans to feel vibrations based on real-time plays during the game. The company also released leggings called the Nadi X. The tights are made with the same technology as the jersey, but assist the wearer in correcting form during a workout.  Module-Based Wearables: Intel’s Curie Module is an example of a device that could be incorporated into a variety of products to make them wearable. In the past year, Intel has partnered with fashion brands to integrate the module into a variety of pieces. A partnership with Oakley saw the release of a modified pair of Oakley Thump sunglasses, which allows the frames to speak to the wearer. And a collaboration with designer Hussein Chalayan during Fashion Week in September saw the debut of Curie Module-powered glasses that gather biometric data to monitor breathing, heart rate and brainwave activity.  Fitness and Wellbeing Trackers: Fitness trackers have had some of the highest success rates in the wearable tech space, and when it comes to fitness, Fitbit products have consistently hit the mark. Its new Charge 2 wristband uses a PurePulse Heart Rate feature that tracks heart rate and can better track caloric burn. Stress and overall wellbeing are kept in check with Vinaya’s Zentawearable, a pioneering piece in “emotion technology.” Zenta builds a profile of the wearer by tracking sleep, stress, emotional states and overall mood. The Zenta wristbands can be pre-ordered on the brand’s Indiegogo page and are expected to ship beginning in March.  VR Goggles And Glasses: With the advent of mainstream VR technology, consumers can expect to see many iterations of VR goggles debut soon. One of the most buzzed-about products is the Oculus Rift, which is expected to debut later this year. The goggles can plug in through USB or DVI ports and the consumer model is said to use 2160-by-1200 resolution, Warable reported. The Samsung Gear VR goggles are available now and connect to Samsung’s smartphones, making them compatible and user-friendly.  Pet Tech: Pets are in on the wearable action, too. Wearable devices that track and monitor pet health have claimed a space in the wearables category. Brands include Whistle, which tracks a pet’s location and daily activity, and PetPace, a “smart collar” that monitors a pet’s vital signs, activity and behavioral patterns.  “Enviro-trackers”: Devices that not only measure personal health and well-being, but monitor surroundings and the environment will be another coming wearable trend. Tzoa revealed its “enviro-tracker,” which hooks directly to garments and uses internal sensors to measure and report temperature, air quality, atmospheric pressure and UV exposure. Using the data, the device can help the wearer determine where there’s fresh air and indicate locations on a real-time environmental data map that shows where there is air pollution. Tzoa’s enviro-tracker currently is available for pre-order.  Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from International Business Times Can A Crowdfunded Telescope Photograph An Earth-Like Planet?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: What to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 10 event on October 26th 7 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Oct 26, 2016 at 10:50 GMT3 weeks ago It’s time for another big Microsoft event. The software giant is holding a software and possibly hardware event on October 26th in New York, where the company is expected to talk about the future of Windows 10 and a lot more. Unlike Apple or Google events, there haven’t been many leaks about what exactly Microsoft will reveal at its upcoming event. But there has been a few rumors about Microsoft’s upcoming announcements, so here’s a list of what to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 10 event later this month: The future of Windows 10 Microsoft’s main focus at the event will be on Windows 10, and that’s not anything surprising. The company is calling the event a Windows 10 event, so expect most things to be related to Windows 10’s future. But what exactly is Windows 10’s feature? It’s “Redstone 2”. At the event, we expect Microsoft to give us a sneak peak at some of the biggest features coming to Windows with Windows 10 Redstone 2. Microsoft has already released a couple of Windows 10 Redstone 2 builds to those on the Windows Insider program — however, most of these builds do not include a lot of big new features. While we aren’t sure what exactly Microsoft will be revealing from Windows 10 Redstone 2, expect Microsoft to talk a lot about productivity-oriented features, gaming on Windows 10, and of course, the Universal Windows Platform. According to recent leaks, Microsoft plans on adding a feature which lets users sync files, screenshots, or just regular text across all of their devices. For instance, if you share a Word document from your Windows 10 computer, you will be able to access it from your Android smartphone. The feature is reportedly called Bundle, and it’s essentially Microsoft’s OneClip service which never saw the light of the day last year. Another feature Microsoft might talk about at the event is the return of OneDrive Placeholders. At Ignite 2016, the company gave a sneak peak at how OneDrive Placeholders worked, and we’ll likely see more details on the feature’s return at this event. In addition to these, Microsoft should talk a lot about Xbox and gaming on Windows 10. While we aren’t sure what exactly the company will reveal at the event, but we suspect Microsoft will talk about some upcoming improvements coming to the Windows Store and Universal Windows Platform for games. As for the Xbox, Microsoft will likely give us a sneak peak at some of the upcoming features to make Windows 10 work even better on the Xbox. It is worth noting that Microsoft could be working on a brand-new File Explorer for Windows 10, but we doubt Microsoft will talk about that in the event as the new File Explorer is very limited at the moment. If the company doesn’t talk about the new File Explorer at the event, we’ll likely see it at Build 2017 which should be even more exciting. As you can see, we don’t really know much about what Windows 10 Redstone 2 features Microsoft will reveal at the event. Whatever it is, it should be quite exciting to see Microsoft’s plans for the future of Windows 10 at the event. In case you are wondering, Microsoft will possibly release the Windows 10 Redstone 2 update for free sometime in March 2017. Surface AIO Microsoft will introduce the new Surface All-In-One at the event, and that’s not a surprise at all. Rumors about the Surface AIO started all the way back in June, and we have had quite a few leaks about the device very recently. According to reports, the Surface AIO will come in at three different sizes. The first variant will pack a 21-inch Full HD display, but the other two will come with 4K displays: one of which will be 24-inch, and the other will be 27-inch. There aren’t many details about the other specs of the Surface AIO, but we suspect Microsoft will pack the latest Intel Kaby Lake processors in the Surface AIO, and Windows Hello should also be present on the device. Along with the Surface AIO, Microsoft will introduce new Surface-branded accessories for the Surface AIO. The company is expected to introduce two different keyboards and mouse. The first one will be the ergonomic keyboard and mouse. And the other one is the minimalistic keyboard and mouse which will be very similar to the Microsoft Designer Desktop Keyboard & Mouse. Images of the minimalistic keyboard and mouse leaked recently, and they look just fine: The actual design of the Surface AIO is still unknown, but it should look similar to most other All-In-One devices. Of course, Microsoft may have one or two surprises for us on the Surface AIO, so that will be quite exciting to see. Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book upgrades It’s been more than a year since Microsoft introduced the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. And before we go any further, you should know that Microsoft isn’t going  to reveal the Surface Pro 5 or Surface Book 2 at this event. However, the company might announce some refreshed hardware for the existing Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book for those who can’t wait for the Pro 5 and Book 2. Firstly, Microsoft will potentially upgrade the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. The new Kaby Lake processors aren’t very different from Intel’s Skylake processors, but they are expected to improve performance in 3D graphics and add native USB 3.1 support. Additionally, these processors will also improve 4K video playback performance. Along with upgrading the processors, Microsoft may also upgrade the GPUs inside the Book (and maybe the Pro 4) which will also be quite interesting to see. But what about the Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5? Well, these two devices won’t be introduced at this event. Microsoft will likely introduce them in 2017 when the company officially releases Windows 10 Redstone 2, and we’ll have more info about these devices then. At the moment, all we know about the devices is that they will also Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. More importantly though, the Surface Book 2 reportedly doesn’t include the controversial hinge gap — so you might want to wait for the Surface Book 2. Microsoft HomeHub Another interesting thing Microsoft may introduce is “HomeHub”. Now, we don’t know anything about what the HomeHub actually is, it could be a Windows 10 Redstone 2 feature or a new device from Microsoft. So the next few paragraphs about the HomeHub are pure speculation: HomeHub is mostly likely a Windows 10 Redstone 2 feature. HomeHub was first mentioned in a Windows 10 Insider Preview Build, and it could be a feature which lets users share devices within the same network. Another guess is that HomeHub could be Microsoft’s take on devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. In this case, HomeHub could be a device which you can put in your kitchen or anywhere in your house, and be able to ask Cortana questions, set reminders, etc. This would actually make quite a lot of sense as Microsoft’s Cortana is the only personal assistant that is available on most of the popular operating systems. For example, if you set a reminder with Cortana on the HomeHub, you will be able to access it from your Windows 10 PC, Android phone, iPhone or Windows Phone — however, devices like the Amazon Echo can’t do this. Once again, there aren’t any details about what the HomeHub actually is. We’ll have to wait until the event to see what Microsoft’s HomeHub is, so keep an eye out for that, too. Others There is some other minor stuff which Microsoft might reveal at the event. Firstly, we may finally see the official launch of Alcatel’s Idol 4S with Windows 10 device — we exclusively reported about the device back in February 2016, and some more information about the device emerged recently. As we reported, the Alcatel Idol 4S will include a 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED display, 64GB of internal storage, 4GB of RAM, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (or 821), Quick Charge 2.0, and it will be exclusive to T-Mobile in the United States. The device will also come with a virtual reality headset which allow users to experience virtual reality on their Idol 4S. Skype Teams is another major product from Microsoft which we exclusively reported about recently. Skype Teams is essentially Microsoft’s take on Slack, but it will be highly integrated with other Microsoft services such as OneDrive, Office 365, and Skype. Skype Teams will boast most of the features you’ll find on Slack, but it will be a much better alternative for businesses who work with Office 365. Microsoft may talk about Skype Teams at the October 26th event, but there is a good chance it may not show up at the event — instead, the software giant may launch it on its upcoming Office event which is happening on the 2nd of November. As usual, there will be some announcements related to HoloLens. We don’t know what Microsoft may talk about at the event, but our guess is that there will be some stuff related to the Windows Holographic Shell — which allows users to use Windows Holographic (aka the HoloLens OS) on their virtual reality headset via their Windows 10 PC. Windows Holographic Shell is expected to arrive next year, presumably with Windows 10 Redstone 2 — so there is a very good chance of Microsoft providing more details about the feature at the event. And lastly, the firm is also going to show off some Windows 10 devices from its partners such as HP, Dell, Samsung, ASUS, etc. …and that’s about it. October 26th will certainly one of the most interesting days of the year if you are a Microsoft fan. We’ll be covering the event live from New York City, so make sure to keep an eye on the site!

Trying The Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Patches On Linux 4.9 With A Core i7 6800K Broadwell-E Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 24 October 2016 at 09:29 AM EDT. 30 Comments Last week the Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 patches were updated for the Linux 4.9-rc1 kernel. While it won't be mainlined until Linux 4.10 at least, I decided to try out these TBM 3.0 / ITMT patches with a Core i7 6800K Broadwell-E CPU. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Technology is designed to boost single-threaded application performance by moving the most critical workloads to the fastest core. TBM 3.0 is complementary to TBM 2.0. Those unfamiliar with it can find details at Intel.com. While CPUs with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 have been shipping for months, there hasn't been any mainline support yet. But I patched an otherwise 4.9-rc1 vanilla kernel with these patches and enabled CONFIG_SCHED_ITMT for having a kernel with the needed support. The Core i7 6800K used for testing has a 3.4GHz base frequency, 3.6GHz turbo frequency, and a Turbo Boost Max Tech 3.0 frequency of 3.8GHz. The ITMT appears just short for Intel Turbo Max Technology. The TBM 3.0 support on a supported kernel can then be toggled via /proc/sys/kernel/sched_itmt_enabled. In early benchmarks done though of (mostly single-threaded) workloads, there wasn't any real difference found in performance. Anyhow, will try more TBM 3.0 patches once the patches are deemed ready for mainline and ideally by then will be able to get access to more Turbo Boost Max 3.0 processors. 30 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel is licensing Visa’s encryption technology so data security can be built in at the hardware-layer of chipsets, ensuring payment data originating from devices such as computers, mobiles and IoT devices will be encrypted. The deal — announced at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas today — will also mean hardware-level data, in the form of a secure device code, can be provided during the 3D Secure authentication process, enabling merchants and issuers to decide if a cardholder is shopping from a recognised payment device and so distinguish between good and bad transactions. Intel Online Connect will be embedded in the new 7th Gen Intel Core processors and will work with the existing 3D Secure protocol and the upcoming 2.0 version, which EMVCo is expected to release this year. ‘Building the bridge between physical and digital worlds’ NFC World’s Rian Boden is at Money2020 in Las Vegas and spoke to Visa’s SVP of risk and authentication products, Mark Nelsen “A huge focus for our announcements and our work has been building that bridge between the physical and the digital world. A lot of these devices we know will have security flaws, because that’s just the nature of software. There’s going to be two components of our partnership with Intel. BRIDGE BUILDER: Visa’s Mark Nelsen “One is around encryption within the chipset itself, so that if you load a payment credential into a connected device, the data is encrypted within that device itself. So if a criminal happens to find some vulnerability, gets into that device and tries to get at any sensitive data, the data that they will get will be encrypted and it won’t be usable. “The other partnership is around what we would call device authentication. Today, often at times what issuers and merchants will do is when you buy something from a device, they’ll use software to figure out what type of operating system it is, where is the device and they’re using these software attributes to determine how safe is this device. “Today, we primarily use software to do that, so with the Intel partnership we’re going to use hardware. Within the chipset, it’s going to trade basically a genuine identifier that we can then use to say, ‘this came from an authentic, Intel-powered device and this is a known device. It gives us more confidence that I’ve seen this device before, it’s a legitimate device, I can now more confidently approve transactions that are originating from that device itself’.” Mark Nelsen from Visa says the rise of connected devices opened up “new entry points for hackers” and required a “new level of coordination between players in payments, technology and computing”. Intel’s Rick Echevarria adds: “Intel 7th Gen Intel Core processors make the online shopping experience hassle free and provide security that is built in to the hardware.” LEARN MORE — Topics: 3D Secure, Authentication, Chipset, Encryption, Intel Core, Intel Online Connect, Internet of Things (IoT), Las Vegas, Mark Nelsen, Money20/20, Rick Echevarria, Security Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Featured partner: Get NFC World's email newsletter The top industry headlines by email, every Wednesday.

Intel Sends In First Graphics Driver Changes For Linux 4.10 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 24 October 2016 at 07:02 AM EDT. 9 Comments We're only up to Linux 4.9-rc2 but as usual Daniel Vetter has already prepared a pull request of drm-intel-next to begin staging Intel kernel graphics/display driver changes for Linux 4.10. Among the work staged in this pull request for DRM-Next include support for the GVT device model, compression support for GPU error states, HDMI 2.0 support for Skylake / Broxton, updated DDI programming for Kabylake, reset improvements, watermark fixes, DisplayPort fixes, and a range of other work. The early GVT device model support is needed for para-virtualization support for Intel GPUs with Xen and KVM. There will still be more Intel i915 DRM pull requests expected for the Linux 4.10 merge window while this early pull can be found via the dri-devel list. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Home Industry Tech One Apple iPhone 7 is eight times slower than the other; here are ways to ensure you don’t buy the wrong one One Apple iPhone 7 is eight times slower than the other; here are ways to ensure you don’t buy the wrong one With the launch of the latest version of iPhone, Intel made its foray into the Apple brand. The iPhone 7 comes in two variants: the Intel modem version and the Qualcomm version, one of which is slower than the other. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: October 24, 2016 2:42 PM According to a recent study, it was found out that iPhone 7 which has the Intel version, is giving a much slower performance than the device equipped with Qualcomm’s model. (Source: Reuters) With the launch of the latest version of iPhone, Intel made its foray into the Apple brand. The iPhone 7 comes in two variants: the Intel modem version and the Qualcomm version. According to a recent study, it was found out that iPhone 7 which has the Intel version, is giving a much slower performance than the device equipped with Qualcomm’s model. According to the tests, data studies showed that the storage of the 32GB model was 200Mbps slower than the 128GB version of the iPhone 7. The 32GB variant showed around 40Mbps, whereas the 128GB model showed more than 300Mbps, which is around eight times faster. Some of the results showed the devices with the Intel chip scored somewhere between 30 and 75 percent poorer than the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus devices on the 4G network which means poorer reception and slower speeds which are probably a worse reception than the iPhone 6S. As it is, users generally blame network operators during signal drops on their smartphone devices or during slower data speeds, but according to these tests, at times it is not the fault of the network provider alone. While this is a shame for both Apple and Intel, none of them has commented so far on the findings. As for the users, they should be careful while buying the device; here is how to make sure, you choose the faster one: Check the Model Users need to check the Apple website for specifications. They have manufactured two variants of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to Intel and Qualcomm models. Consumers should check at the back of the devices, for the model number. The Model A1660 and Model A1661 means that the devices have a Qualcomm modem. While, Model A1778 and Model A1784 are powered by an Intel modem. Check the network provider In many countries, especially in the US, network carriers also sell the iPhone devices. Modem makers and carriers generally work closely to achieve it. For example, Sprint and Verizon trade the Qualcomm-powered iPhone, while T-Mobile and AT&T do the Intel-equipped iPhone. Qualcomm has been a long time supporter of Apple, at least much longer than Intel so inevitably it has more to offer its customer in various ways. It remains to be seen, where does the new relationship between Apple and Intel go. Please Wait while comments are loading...

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 7 units with Intel modems are slower than Qualcomm ones Apple iPhone 7 units with Intel modems are slower than Qualcomm ones By Bindu Nair - Oct 24, 2016 Apple introduced a lot of changes in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus lineup, with the handsets dual cameras and lack of a headphone jack taking up most of the attention. However, there was a much less noticeable transformation going on under the hood with the arrival of Intel modems for the very first time. Instead of outfitting all iPhone 7 models with Qualcomm wireless chips like it’s been doing for years, Apple decided to partner with Intel for some of them. The deal was regarded as a triumph for the latter given its relatively weak presence in the smartphone business. Unfortunately, a new report by Cellular Insights finds that the Qualcomm modem is much faster than the Intel one. The publication bought a number of iPhone 7 Plus units for testing and set up a rig to simulate real-world conditions, finding that the two performed well when there was a strong LTE signal. Also Read: 32GB iPhone 7 is 8x slower than 256GB model The division arose when the publication dropped the signal strength. Intel’s data speed supposedly became much slower and failed to keep up with Qualcomm’s rate. The results show a consistent 30% difference in terms of speed between the two across multiple bands. If the results are accurate, iPhone 7 owners with the slower Intel modems might have to deal with slower speeds in places with spotty coverage and weak signals. To figure out if you’re one of them, you’ll have to take a closer look at the small print on the back of your handset. If it says Model A1778 or A1784, you have an Intel-powered iPhone 7. If it says A1660 or A1661, then you’ve got yourself a Qualcomm-running one. Another dividing factor is the carrier you chose. Verizon, Sprint and SIM-unlocked units contain the latter, while T-Mobile, AT&T and Telstra pack the former.

Rohit KVN   October 24, 2016 10:19 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Does your Apple device have Intel or Qualcomm modem? Here’s how to find out. In Picture:Apple iPhone 7Reuters Last year, we witnessed the iPhone 6S series chipgate fiasco. Now in 2016, Apple has landed in another controversy with regard to the use of modems in iPhone 7 series. In 2015, Apple, in a bid to speed up the production of the iPhone 6S series, sourced A9 CPU units from TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and Samsung. But soon after the launch, it came to light that the devices having processor chips from TSMC gave 2-3 hours more battery life than the one manufactured by the South Korean partner, resulting in public outcry.

Here's how to find out This time, the controversy is related to the LTE speed. Popular consumer technology site Cellular Insights conducted benchmark tests on LTE connectivity on the iPhone 7 series, revealing that Apple had used two modems, one made by Intel and another by Qualcomm in the new handsets, depending on the type of network carrier (for locked phones) and region of sale. What has startled many is that the iPhone 7 series with Qualcomm modems outperformed Intel modems by 30 percent in overall performance in terms of network connectivity. People who have already bought the new iPhone 7 series with Intel modem cannot be helped as there is no workaround to increase network connectivity speed unless they exchange or buy a new one with Qualcomm modem. Here's how to identify the iPhone 7 series with Intel modem: Apple fans who are planning to buy the new iPhone 7 series can check whether the device has Qualcomm or Intel modem inside, based on the model ID printed at the back of the device or the pack. Apple iPhone 7 series with Model ID: A1660 and the 7 Plus with Model ID: A1661 come with Qualcomm modem.

Corrales Comment News Reporting as if Democracy Matters Home Welcome to Corrales Comment Publication Dates Subscribe CC Advertise! Ad Rates Archived Articles CALENDAR COP21 Reporting From Paris N.M. House District 23: Republican Incumbent Paul Pacheco of Albuquerque Challenged by Corrales Democrat Daymon Ely Details Published: 23 October 2016                    Paul Pacheco, Republican                                Damon Ely, Democrat Former Sandoval County Commissioner Daymon Ely was pretty much outside the political arena while his wife, Cynthia Fry, served as N.M. Court of Appeals Judge. Since she retired in December 2015, he’s back. Ely has been campaigning over the past year to unseat the Republican holding the House District 23 seat, retired Albuquerque police officer Paul Pacheco. An attorney in private practice, Ely proudly points out his specialty is suing other lawyers. “For the past 20 years, the majority of my work has been litigating against lawyers.” After serving on the County Commission from 2000 to 2004, Ely said he was happy to get out, especially as he and Fry dealt with her serious illness, now passed. “I never thought I would do this again,” he recalled of his re-entry into political campaigning. Ely said he knew he had to run for the legislature as a change agent when he realized his son could not find work in New Mexico, a situation all too common for young professionals who must leave to pursue careers. “That’s at the core of why I’m running,” he explained. “We should be rocking and rolling, taking advantage of the state’s unique strengths. “The problem has to be the lack of good governance.” While crime is certainly a big issue for all voters, the Democrat feels Pacheco fails to see the big picture. “He focuses on crime, and that is important,” Ely said. “But as the economy has gotten worse, we will continue to experience more crime. To focus on crime is missing the big picture.” For  him, the top four issues are jobs and the economy, education, crime and  behavioral health care. He expects to make his views heard on those topics even as a new member of the legislature’s lower house. “I have a talent for stirring the pot. That’s what we  need: to stir the pot.” While he served on the Sandoval County Commission 12 years ago, Ely led negotiations with Intel when it sought a $16 billion industrial revenue bond package to expand operations at the site between Corrales and Rio Rancho. It was said to be the largest IRB deal in U.S. history, and, as an attorney on the County Commission, Ely was at the center of those negotiations which were estimated to have saved Intel $2 billion in taxes. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXIII No. 15 September 25, 2004 “$16 Billion IRB Approved.”) “It was a good deal for Sandoval County,” Ely insists. “And contrary to what some critics say, the County did not give Intel a nickel. It brought us a lot of good paying jobs.” And although many of those jobs have since vanished due to factory automation and downsizing, Intel still employs more than 1,500 in good jobs, the candidate points out. “Compare that to the 30 to 50 jobs that are supposed to come from the recent IRB for Facebook.” Ely said he was aware of concerns about industrial chemical emissions from Intel and some residents’ health complaints. “I live right down the hill from Intel,” he pointed out, “and I know that we can’t sacrifice people’s health.” The Democrat was born in Philadelphia, but his family moved to Arizona shortly thereafter.  He was a history major when he graduated from Arizona State University in 1979. He earned a law degree there in 1982, the same year he moved to the Albuquerque area. Ely did labor law and contract work for a law firm and then set out on his own in 1989. “I’m the leading lawyer in the state who sues lawyers… which I love.” He’s convinced it is past time for a change in the way economic development is done in New Mexico. “We’re the only state in the Southwest that’s losing population. This is not a healthy economy, so we have to look at the reasons for that. The path we’ve been on for years is not working. The idea has been that we need to compete with other states; ‘let’s do tax cuts and get to the lowest common denominator, and that will attract business.’ It hasn’t worked. “So we have to start trying something new. We have to focus on our strengths and our weaknesses. Rather than compete for the lowest common denominator, where —if we got close to landing a business with good paying jobs — Texas would suddenly throw in a bunch of money and wipe us out. “Why not be the solar capital? Or the wind capital?  Or the water management experts? Or the center of trade, which is something that Republicans love to talk about so we could work across party lines.” Expanding film credits could also have a huge role, he said. He also likes the concept of developing an “inland port” in New Mexico taking advantage of Albuquerque’s international airport and the railroads. “Trade is our history and also our future.” “So the question is, where does the money come from to do that? How does government act as a catalyst? The answer is that, while we are out of money in the operating account by $600 million-plus, we have other funds, such as the $15 billion permanent fund and the capital outlay fund.” He wants to make better use of the “slush fund” for the governor and legislators and to increase transparency on how that $2.5 billion is used. “That is not a transparent fund; everybody knows it, but nobody’s doing anything about it. There’s no way to know how much of that is already committed or spent. It is all done behind closed doors. That’s a lousy way to run government and open to corruption. “My first job will be to make that transparent,” the candidate said. Ely would like to establish a stable source of revenue to fund public education, create a bipartisan commission for  legislative re-districting and legalize recreational marijuana use. “We spend lots of money locking people up for marijuana. Those same people, if they crossed the state line into Colorado, wouldn’t even be arrested.” Ely pointed out he has been endorsed by the N.M. Conservation Voters Alliance.   Paul Pacheco Republican Perhaps his signature piece of legislation over the past four years was the N.M. drivers’ license bill related to undocumented immigrants. Paul Pacheco points to his role as the political “ping-pong ball” to negotiate a bipartisan compromise that finally passed both houses of the legislature and was signed by the governor. He points to that long-running effort as proof of his ability to work across party lines. Undocumented immigrants living in New Mexico get an ID card, but not a regular driver’s license. “I am a problem solver,” he said. “I don’t just talk the talk, I’ve walked the walk. If it’s a good idea, no matter who  introduced it, I’m going to support it.” The top issues on voters’ minds are  crime, economic development and education, he said. Pacheco closed out 27 years with the Albuquerque Police Department in 2010 when he decided to run as representative for N.M. House District 23, in which he is the incumbent. But in 2010 he lost in the Republican primary to Dave Doyle.  He secured the party’s nomination for the same seat two years later, and defeated Corrales challenger Marci Blaze in the general election November 2012. When Pacheco retired from APD to run for elective office, he and his wife started a drug and alcohol rehabilitation business which they continue to operate. In his support for education, the representative has appropriated about $81,000 over four years for the Ask Academy in Rio Rancho —which led to conflict of interest charges since his brother, an architect, worked on a project for that school. “My brother was a subcontractor for remodeling at the school,” the candidate explained. “The project was handled by Rachel Matthew Homes and they hired my brother in 2012.” All of his appropriations for Ask Academy, a science, engineering and technology oriented school, were after that: $32,000 for library equipment in 2014; $24,000 for land and facilities; and $25,000 for renovations in 2016, he explained. Pacheco said he did not know about his brother’s involvement as a subcontractor until much later. “When I found out, I told everybody my brother was the architect.” The candidate said he is a ‘big proponent of working hard and doing the right things for the right reasons.” Working in the legislature was an “eye opener. Anyone who thinks they are going to go up there and change things single-handedly doesn’t understand the reality. Just on the House side, we have 70 individuals. Trying to obtain a majority of those individuals is a very, very difficult thing to accomplish, so you have to be able to work in a bipartisan manner, which sometimes is easy and sometimes it is  not.” He thinks he has a reputation for working in a bipartisan manner. “I sponsored the Assisted Outpatient Treatment bill with Democratic Senator Papen to give the mentally ill services and treatment. She asked me to co-sponsor in the House because she knew I had been a police officer and a crisis intervention officer working with mental health consumers. We got that passed in both houses and signed by the governor.” He said the bill sets up a pilot program to serve the mentally ill in Roswell and Albuquerque. “It’s the beginning of trying to get more resources diverted to the mentally ill so that our police officers will stop running into these individuals and getting into violent confrontations. I will continue to work with Senator Papen to address the problem of the mentally ill.” Closely tied to that effort are problems resulting from drug and alcohol abuse. “As you know, my wife is in recovery, so I am a big proponent of drug and alcohol treatment. I sponsored a bill with Representative Stapleton, who’s a Democrat, last session to provide money for drug and alcohol treatment in Albuquerque. That bill didn’t fare as well, but it died in  House Appropriations because of the money situation. “I work in a very bipartisan manner. I don’t care if you’re an “R” or a “D.” He hears a lot of talk about not working with Republicans or with Democrats. “That’s a very, very immature and ignorant way of looking at it. People are tired of gridlock.” As a former police officer, the candidate is also well positioned to carry crime-related bills.  He was in favor of re-instating capital punishment during the recent special session of the legislature and expects it will come up again in the next session. “We’re the only western state that doesn’t have the death penalty. The vast majority of people in New Mexico want the death penalty back for the murder of a police officer or children or a murder involving special circumstances such as kidnapping, rape or torture. “And again, it’s not that everybody would deserve that, or that everybody would be charged with it. It’s just another tool in the toolbox, and I voted for it. The bill made it out of the House but the Senate did not vote on it.” Pacheco carried the new “three strikes” bill to increase penalties for repeat offenders. “For three violent felonies, you would do life.” He asked for a study which revealed that life imprisonment would not fill all jail beds. Of the 11,600 violent crimes committed from 2000 to 2015, 550 committed a second violent offense, and of those just 59 committed a third. “What you have is a small number of extremely violent predators committing an inordinate amount of violent crime. Those are the ones we are trying to target for a  life sentence.” The “three strikes” law passed the House in the special session, but was not voted on in the Senate. The candidate thinks getting tougher on criminals will boost prospects for economic development. “We’re the third most violent state in the country. Business people thinking about relocating or starting up here are asking ‘What’s going on with your crime rate?’” Another economic development inhibition comes from excessive taxes and burdensome regulations, Pacheco feels. “We have tremendously smart people, but they cannot grow their business because of our rules and regulations. “We need to change our tax situation and our regulations so that business people are not so confused that they get discouraged.” In addition to continued work on crime-related issues and education reform, Pacheco wants to change issuance of handicapped parking licenses. Now those  licenses can only be issued to individuals,” he pointed out. “But what about the vans that serve those people?  The vans should have those permits also. I’ve been trying to fix that for the last two years.” Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

What began with fitness trackers, smartwatches and other tech-driven accessories, has since blossomed into wearable technology that can measure, monitor and report on our health, now, from the very fabric of our clothing. Wearable tech has been the hot topic of the year with brands like Fitbit. The fitness tracking brand pulled ahead of Apple and Samsung as the top purveyor of leading wearable devices.  Fitbit recently reported first-quarter net income of $11 million on $505.4 million in revenue. As consumers’ response to tech has varied, from the unfavorable (Google Glass) to the hopeful (VR Goggles), the question remains: How will the consumer respond to the meteoric developments in the world of wearables? “It’s this convergence of really figuring out how you integrate technology in an invisible way, yet it’s meaningful to the consumer. Every brand has a unique consumer,” Sandra Lopez, vice president of strategic relationships/business development for Intel’s New Devices Group, told The International Business Times at the 2016 Fashion Tech Forum, which was held in Brooklyn Oct. 13. Founded by CEO and consultant Karen Harvey, this was the conference’s third year and played host to innovators in the wearables space, from Sandra Lopez, Intel's vice president of wearables, to Paul Dillinger, Levi’s vice president of global product innovation.  Lopez has championed Intel’s bite-size module device, Intel’s Curie Module, and formed partnerships with fashion brands like Fila for Baja East and Hussein Chalayan to integrate the device, a mix of software and hardware, into their accessories, making virtually any piece a wearable. Lopez said the success of wearable pieces lies in how each brand harnesses the technology to make it work for consumers. And “one size” does not fit all.  “It’s personal. I firmly believe that the people who are not using their Fitbits and put it in their drawer three months later, it probably wasn’t for them to begin with. “As a technology company, there is not one solution for everybody,” Lopez added. “We’re all different. Bringing relevant experiences and multiple experiences is going to be the key to success.” In 2016, there is no shortage of brands and companies that have delivered to bring consumers those “relevant” and continued experiences. From wearable, tech-driven fabrics to mood, health and wellness trackers, here are 10 brands and products that are redefining “wearable tech” to bring consumers smart, intuitive experiences through technology.  Tech Fabrics: Garments that feature “smart” fabric will be the washable, everyday answer to the wearable tech accessory. Google and Levi’s teamed up on Project Jacquard, which was first announced in May and champions garments made from yarns that can interact directly with digital devices and smartphones.  Using integrated GPS and electronics that are washable, Wearable Experiments also debuted a line of pieces that connect wearers to experience, or “human/computer” interaction. The company released a sports jersey, aptly named the Fan Jersey, prior to the Super Bowl that transmits haptic vibrations, allowing fans to feel vibrations based on real-time plays during the game. The company also released leggings called the Nadi X. The tights are made with the same technology as the jersey, but assist the wearer in correcting form during a workout.  Module-Based Wearables: Intel’s Curie Module is an example of a device that could be incorporated into a variety of products to make them wearable. In the past year, Intel has partnered with fashion brands to integrate the module into a variety of pieces.  A collaboration with designer Hussein Chalayan during Fashion Week in September saw the debut of Curie Module-powered glasses that gather biometric data to monitor breathing, heart rate and brainwave activity. Baja East and Fila partnered for Fashion Week to debut a footwear line that also used Intel's Curie technology. The connected shoes can "track and interpret fitness data" for the wearer.  Fitness and Wellbeing Trackers: Fitness trackers have had some of the highest success rates in the wearable tech space, and when it comes to fitness, Fitbit products have consistently hit the mark. Its new Charge 2 wristband uses a PurePulse Heart Rate feature that tracks heart rate and can better track caloric burn. Stress and overall wellbeing are kept in check with Vinaya’s Zenta wearable, a pioneering piece in “emotion technology.” Zenta builds a profile of the wearer by tracking sleep, stress, emotional states and overall mood. The Zenta wristbands can be pre-ordered on the brand’s Indiegogo page and are expected to ship beginning in March.  VR Goggles And Glasses: With the advent of mainstream VR technology, consumers can expect to see many iterations of VR goggles debut soon. One of the most buzzed-about products is the Oculus Rift, which is expected to debut later this year. The goggles can plug in through USB or DVI ports and the consumer model is said to use 2160-by-1200 resolution, Warable reported. The Samsung Gear VR goggles are available now and connect to Samsung’s smartphones, making them compatible and user-friendly.  Related Stories Wearable Tech Takes On Air Pollution The Quirkiest New Wearables Pet Tech: Pets are in on the wearable action, too. Wearable devices that track and monitor pet health have claimed a space in the wearables category. Brands include Whistle, which tracks a pet’s location and daily activity, and PetPace, a “smart collar” that monitors a pet’s vital signs, activity and behavioral patterns.  “Enviro-trackers”: Devices that not only measure personal health and well-being, but monitor surroundings and the environment will be another coming wearable trend. Tzoa revealed its “enviro-tracker,” which hooks directly to garments and uses internal sensors to measure and report temperature, air quality, atmospheric pressure and UV exposure. Using the data, the device can help the wearer determine where there’s fresh air and indicate locations on a real-time environmental data map that shows where there is air pollution. Tzoa’s enviro-tracker currently is available for pre-order.    Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Intel Cache Allocation Technology / RDT Still Baking For Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 23 October 2016 at 11:32 AM EDT. Add A Comment Not mentioned in my earlier features you won't find in the Linux 4.9 mainline kernel is support for Intel's Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) but at least it was revised this weekend in still working towards mainline integration. Cache Allocation Technology is about letting an OS/VMM restrict cache allocation to a defined subset of cache. Making use of Cache Allocation Technology can allow for more cache to be available for higher priority applications and the defined CAT subsets can be dynamically changed. Intel has been working on Cache Allocation Technology for Linux going back to 2014. The fifth version of these CAT patches were published on Saturday. It appears CAT requires Haswell CPUs and newer. Adding this code to the kernel is just over two thousand lines of new code. The work involves adding a "resctrl" (resource control) file-system derived from kernfs and the new functionality is exposed via the CONFIG_INTEL_RDT_A Kconfig switch, short for the Intel Resource Director Technology Allocation support, with the functionality being provided by the new intel_rdt driver. More details via the Linux kernel mailing list. Documentation on the user-space interface via this patch.

It has created more than a hundred IoT labs across universities and runs prototyping and innovation challenges. Kishore Balaji, Director, Corporate Affairs, South Asia, spoke to BusinessLine about all of this, including an example of a challenge run in collaboration with Reva University. He also explained how PPP models can fuel the change that India needs to adopt considering that all current trends suggest IoT hitting the peak by 2020. Excerpts: What has Intel’s approach been in its education initiatives for India? We have three pillars. One to do with basic digital literacy for people who can, therefore, participate in the digital revolution. The second is how do you get the teachers and students to use technology and innovate, and the third is how do students in the higher education system gain skills to innovate. Over the past fifteen years in India we’ve been working with the higher education pillar, but the essence has now changed. How has that change shaped your higher education initiatives? Fifteen years ago, we would work with top tier colleges to see how skill can be enhanced but over the past 5-6 years with the ecosystem getting vibrant, we’re now cutting across different tiers of institutions and working with them. The context too changes — five years ago, we would’ve worked in embedded technologies. Since last year, we’ve moved to the IoT space to align with our corporate strategy. What concrete milestones have you reached with your IoT focus? Early last year, we enabled more than 100 institutions to have an IoT lab. But besides giving them the infrastructure and investing in student as well as faculty development, we looked at a way we can give them a platform to get recognised. So students bring in their ideas, show their prototypes and we help them with the process of mentoring and rapid prototyping. Our engagement with Reva University, for example, is a point in time activity. The final showcase of student tech creation from our 100 IoT centres will take place in November. 50 teams get a chance to refine their prototypes and we’ll pick the top 10 next month. These students are at the undergraduate level. What’s the commercial opportunity for Intel India as you help fuel innovation at that level? Before we talk about our slice of IoT, it’s important to understand where the industry is going. We’re at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution which will likely open the doors for cyber-physical-biological coming together of things. And this wave of growth will hit its peak around 2020 and by then it’s estimated that you’ll probably have around 3 or 3 ½ trillion connected devices which is about 20 billion today. Now that creates an opportunity for all — for Intel, for the industry, for the country, for students. While this is the first year of operating our 100 IoT centres at one scale, we would see it improving from this year going forward. Don’t we need effective PPP models to accomplish faster rate of change and innovation in India? We’re now living in an era where PPP is more successful than in the past, and we also see there’s a real desire to collaborate among both industry and government. The role of enterprises or MNCs is to spot trends, and create models, structures and proof points for the ecosystem partners to see through. With more ecosystem partners joining in, then academia or start-ups and mentor networks, change becomes systemic and systemised.

Rowland Elementary School Breakdown • Students: 433 • Mascot: Roadrunner • School colors: Blue and white • Vision: Achieving Excellence for Every Student in Every Classroom, Every Day Background on Rowland Elementary • The school was founded in 1966. • Named after W.C. Rowland, the director of pupil personnel and accountability for the Victoria school district. • Originally built on the edge of town in a pasture and called the Rowland Rabbits because of the large number of jackrabbits. • In the early 80's, the mascot was changed to the Roadrunner. • Mission: To provide rigorous and relevant instruction for the community of learners by fostering best practices while focusing on results and relationships. Former Rowland Elementary School students are paying back their alma mater with a $25,000 gift. The school was presented a check Oct. 3 for $25,000 by Best Buy Victoria and Intel during the Score with Intel Core annual event. Best Buy stores compete in the event to help improve the quality of sales interactions and build Intel advocacy in the store, according to a news release. Stores that win can donate money to local schools of their choosing. Best Buy's philanthropic goal is committed to giving youth hands-on access to the tech education and tools they need to be successful in school and in their future careers, said General Manager Richard Favata. "Best Buy is elated to provide Rowland Elementary a check for $25,000 because many of the Blue Shirts who work here attended Rowland as students, and we're excited to see what $25,000 can do to give the school tech updates for the 21st century," Favata said. Rowland Elementary principal Tammy Garza said the school plans to use the money in ways that will benefit all students and staff. "We took in staff suggestions and got a variety of responses," she said, explaining she wanted to include everyone. The school is looking to purchase an industrial-sized fan for its detached gym because it has no air conditioning. Garza also wants to hire an artist to do updates on the artwork outside the building that will feature the school's mascot, the Roadrunner. Also being considered are updates to the track and additional items that will benefit the teachers, such as iPads and electronic pencil sharpeners, she said. "We are looking to see how far this money will go," Garza said. She said the award benefits the students because the money allows the school to purchase beyond its budget. The award is a positive for the community as well because her school was selected by former students, Garza said. "What that tells me is that Rowland holds a warm place in their hearts," she said. "Getting the award was a bonus to the teachers and recognizes the hard work of Rowland."

Speaking at Intel Capital's Global Summit in San Diego on Monday, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said that the breach last month, which saw 500 million people's email accounts compromised, was "a big deal. A big deal to Yahoo! management and a big deal to us." He said that experts pulled in by Yahoo! to dig into the forensics of the hack were "well into it," and the results were expected "in a few weeks." He added that Verizon's staff were also involved and were following the situation closely. He dismissed the notion that Verizon could walk away from the deal however – something that the company's general counsel had publicly pondered earlier this month – saying that the acquisition of Yahoo! was "a part of our digital strategy." He did lend weight to the suggestion that Verizon is going to ask for a significant discount on its agreed $4.8bn purchase, however. Once the investigation was over, "then we can make a determination" as to the purchase price, McAdam said, adding: "The impact on the overall deal will be decided in the next few weeks." Time Warner As for the other big acquisition news – AT&T's proposed $85bn purchase of Time Warner – McAdam was sanguine. "I wasn't surprised at all," he said when asked about his first reaction to the news. "If anything, since Fox made an offer for Time Warner, I was surprised that it took this long." He contrasted AT&T's "traditional media route" with Verizon's digital media approach and said that the acquisition made sense both for AT&T and for the broader market, dismissing criticism that the purchase could create companies with too much market power. "The criticism leveled at the deal reminds me of 1998/9," McAdam said, "when we were starting to roll up wireless companies and people said companies would get too big, and have too much power. Well, that was completely backwards. I don't think we would have invested as much in 3G or 4G without that scale." He did foresee some concern and opposition from content providers to the deal, but argued that unless there was some vertical integration, we wouldn't see the necessary "disruption and innovation" in the market. 5G The rest of the time, McAdam waxed lyrical about the advantages of the next generation of mobile phone technology – 5G. The introduction of 5G opens up all sorts of new possibilities, he noted, telling one story about how, over a 5G connection, Verizon execs were able to drive a remote car around a track. "When we switched back to 4G, no one could get it around the first curve," he noted. 5G will provide much greater bandwidth and much lower latency – making it ideal for a new generation of devices from virtual reality to autonomous cars to smart city technology to drones – but due to it using a much higher frequency, data cannot travel as far. McAdam thinks of 5G as "wireless fiber" and said that Verizon's big focus was on how to provide it to people without having to directly connect up their homes. "Half the cost of fiber to the home is inside those four walls," he noted. "So if we can come out 200 meters, we can save half the cost." Verizon is trialing 5G base stations from 200 feet to 2,000 meters away from homes. He sees the technology as bringing "more disruption to the cable industry," and didn't rule out Verizon becoming a cable provider. The other big advantage of 5G to the mobile industry, he said, is that it doesn't require pulling out old equipment. "When we moved from 3G to 4G, we had to replace all the hardware," he noted. "But 5G is an overlay." ® Sponsored: Boost business agility and insight with flash storage for analytics Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register Ofcom kicks off 5G auction consultation But what about the delayed auction for more 4G capacity? 5 Comments BT and Nokia slink off together, muttering about 5G tech Operators join hands for laboratory love-in 8 Comments GSMA: 5G at risk if governments don't get their acts together Spectrum uncertainty giving mobe industry the chills 2 Comments What's 5G?

VR audio startup Dysonics closes Series A led by Intel Capital Posted Oct 24, 2016 by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber will deliver up to 5 free flu shots and a free care pack to users If you had the chance to watch the second episode of the new season of Black Mirror, you won’t take much convincing when people tell you how important realistic 3D audio is to immersing you in a virtual reality/mixed reality experience. Dysonics is a startup in the VR audio space looking to build the hardware and software workflows that give VR content creators high-fidelity solutions to bringing top-notch audio into their content. Today, the company closed a Series A investment led by Intel Capital with participation from Rawah Partners.The investment was shared as part of a broader Intel Capital announcement disclosing $38 million in new investments across 12 frontier tech companies including Dysonics. The amount of funding for this specific investment not disclosed. The company had previously raised a $750k seed round in 2012 from Rawah to get the company up and running. Dysonics has a few products out right now, including a head-tracking system called RondoMotion, aimed at bringing head-tracked 360 audio to regular headphones and RondoMic, a high-fidelity all-in-one microphone array capture system. Right now, the company is working with LA-based Radiant Images to handle rentals of the RondoMic. The RondoMic is definitely a product geared towards professional use. First off, the thing is the size of a watermelon and has a carbon fiber shell so it’s pretty apparent that this device means serious business. The RondoMic utilizes eight custom Telefunken M60 FET microphones (the high-end mics retail for about $600 a pop). Dysonics CTO Bob Dalton estimates the RondoMic could likely sell for something above $10,000, but specified that the company largely intends to focus on rentals with this particular version. As Dysonics grows, Dalton tells me it’s looking to looking to grow its market potential outside of solely focusing on high-end professional users and embrace the high-end consumer markets with devices that come in different shapes and sizes but still produce compelling high-quality 360 audio capture. Virtual reality audio is a bit of a wild space at the moment. Despite major presences from established audio giants like Sennheiser and Dolby, there really haven’t been too many standards established. With the high-end high-fidelity hardware the company is making, it would be easy to frame Dysonics as hardware company, but Dalton is weary with that classification. The real growth potential for the company is with its end-to-end VR audio solution. Rondo360 is an application and set of plug-ins that works across digital audio workstations to process binaural audio and make handling 360 audio much more seamless. The system is agnostic to your channel configurations or hardware, meaning it plays nice with most people’s go-to setups. “The world of VR audio is pretty fragmented at the moment,” Dalton told me. “The market is kind of open to new solutions that can solve a lot of these problems in terms of the overall fidelity, the realism of the experience, the distribution of the content and the performance on the playback side.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Dysonics Founded 2012 Overview The Dysonics team have been leaders in human audio perception and spatial sound capture and reproduction research for over 15 years.

Chronocam was co-founded and seeded by its Chairman Bernard Gilly and the iBionext team in 2014, after a maturation phase of 18 months. Located within the "Passage of innovation" in Paris, Chronocam will continue to leverage the support of the iBionext network throughout its development. Alexia Perouse, CEO Managing Partner of iBionext commented: "Initiated within our ecosystem two years ago, Chronocam is the fourth game-changing startup created and actively supported by iBionext. We have been looking very closely at the development of the company and were convinced about its potential for market disruption since the beginning. We are excited to witness the progress Chronocam has made so far and to invest massively in this new phase of growth." The funds raised will be used by Chronocam to continue building a world-class team to accelerate product development and commercialize its computer vision sensing and processing technology. The funding will also allow the company to expand into key markets, including the US and Asia. Chronocam's proprietary approach leverages the company's deep expertise in vision technology, sensor design and neuromorphic computing, which has led to several patents for its CMOS technology. The Chronocam method uses innovative data capture techniques to greatly improve performance, dynamic range and power efficiency of cameras in a wide range of applications. "Conventional computer vision approaches are not well-suited to the requirements of a new generation of vision-enabled systems: autonomous vehicles require faster sensing systems which can operate in a wider variety of ambient conditions; in the IoT segment, power budgets, bandwidth requirements and integration within sensor networks make today's vision technologies impractical and ineffective," said Luca Verre, Co-founder and CEO of Chronocam. "Chronocam's unique bio-inspired technology introduces a new paradigm in capturing and processing visual data, and addresses the most pressing market challenges head-on. We appreciate the confidence demonstrated by our investors as we roll out our technology to an increasing number of customers.

The app, available for Android and iOS will be discontinued from the 10th of November and any data that isn’t exported before that date will be lost. Intel writes on the page of the app, “If you are a current File Protect user or you have used File Protect in the past, please update the File Protect app and then export any files you wish to keep – from your vault to your mobile device. These files will be decrypted automatically. You must export your files before November 10th or you risk losing access to them.” Google Play shows the app is installed on 100,000 to 500,000 Android devices, owners of these devices risk losing their files if they don’t export their files before the 10th of November. Apple’s App Store doesn’t show on how many devices the app is installed. Users are warned on Google Play and Apple App Store pages but most of us don’t visit those pages anymore once an app is installed. As the app itself is pretty much set-and-forget, the notification in the app itself might also not been read by many users of the app before the deadlines expires on the 10th of November. New users of the app are immediately warned about the discontinuation of the app and Intel has disabled the import, protected photos, file share and cloud backup features. The Intel File Protect app could be used to encrypt files, photos and videos on a smartphone or tablet. The files could then also be synced to Google Drive and Dropbox. Another feature was ‘Quick Secure Snap’ which allowed pictures and video to be saved encrypted in the gallery. The app’s discontinuation is “part of any product lifecycle that helps to drive better user experiences”, Intel writes. The company adds that it will implement “what it has learned from File Protect in the development of future products.” Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: intel ios android Hackers obtained login data of hundreds of thousands uTorrent forum users Microsoft releases update to protect Internet Explorer and Edge users against drive-by-download attacks Cookie Policy Intel 750 1.2TB NVMe PCIe SSD Review TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 26 Oct 16 00:56 I don't see any reason why users couldn't keep using this app after it's discontinuation date. After all, what good does it do for users to not be able to decrypt their files after the fact? I'm going to take a guess and say this app is probably tied into some DRM nonsense, which in turn probably requires downloading code from a server to run. This is a very short-sited way of writing apps, and all-too-frequently results in frustrating situations like this one. IMHO anything that can be done without relying on internet servers should be done without relying on internet servers. It's the only way to make sure a random sever outage can't cause an app to cease working. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

Skip to content harishtheblogger Menu About Experiences WHAT GAMES DID TO ME! Posted by harish1996 on October 24, 2016October 24, 2016 One fine day, as I was reading a blog named “Screw Finding your passion” written by someone amazing . It caused me to think about my life and what I have been doing with it and I realised something special indeed. So I decided to share something about it .This is the 2nd part of my blog (How Games defined the Sessions of My Life – Part I), a hastily named one. I regret adding the part ‘ Part 1’ in it , and since it was so crappy that I didn’t care about doing the 2nd part anytime soon . But screw it; here i am with Part 2. If you have already read the first one, I assure you that this is not something similar.. So it all started with the Big Bang… Sorry (Too much Sitcoms recently). It all started when I was casually hanging out at my cousin’s friend’s place. With a very little knowledge about computer games then, I didn’t even know that computers can be used for playing (Considering that my current PC has 10 games, most of them which i have forgotten about), I got to see him playing some game in his PC. It took me a minute to realise that it was actually a game then. It had a small animated person walking with an axe in a vast land and reaching a tree to tap it for 10 seconds and carry timber like something to construct his building. ‘I was confused’ is an understatement. I wondered whether they had games like this!? Only after I started to get my concentration in it, I realised that it was indeed a war game, where we build our empire big enough to defeat the enemies. There was fighting at sea .. Ships throwing balls of flame at the each other .. both barely moving ..(Why cant it move when a ball approaches like that ?! ). At last, one ship survived. “Yes!!” My friend exclaimed! “That’s it? “, I asked. He laughed and continued. When the ship came to the land, he did some clicking to bring the same man with the axe and summoned him to the ship. The man started tapping near the ship ! Tap.. tap .. tap…. Voila! The ship’s HP is full now. I was too into the game that I didn’t realise that my cousin was waiting outside for me and my friend and he was screaming “ Dei ! Seekirama vandhu tholainga da ( Get the hell out of there man ! )”. I unhappily walked out and after a while asked the name of the game. He said it was “Age of Empires”. That stuck in my head for a very long time. It wasn’t long after that I again witnessed him playing. This time there was land warfare. Soldiers were severely injured. Now I asked “Kappala repair panna maari .. manushana repair panna yaaradhu irukaangala? (Is there a person to repair the humans like the one who repaired that ship?)”. He burst into laughter and said “itho ivan pannuvan paaru ipo!” pointing to an old man with a small stick ( A Monk ) . Miraculously enough the health restored. We were glad and went out to play (Sad! No? ). That session of gaming ended, but it planted a seed in my mind for more! This slideshow requires JavaScript. Play-Stations overtook . My Dear friend one day bought a PS-2. That sounded the death knell for his peace. I started hanging out at his place at odd times, but he was too kind to ignore all of that. There was a famous game called “Smack Down – Here Comes the Pain”. Due to the lack of memory cards, we could not save our progress. Once he bought that, we started playing the ‘Season mode’, which was boring for him. But for me, it was all I wanted .Little did I know that I was chasing a particular genre of games-“Strategy”. Can anyone not remember this loading screen !? When we had PCs for the first time, it had Windows 2000, 64 MB RAM, Intel P2 (Ancient times!!) I had a name reverberating in my mind for 3 long years.“Age of Empires”. I desperately tried to get my hands on it, with little luck . But once I got that , I was in for a greater shock ! My PC doesn’t support AOE!! After some days , I moved on and met my friend who had an amazing PC with 1 GB RAM ! The games he played was too much for me to even know the name! So I got a CD which he was sure that it didn’t work anymore. When I put that CD in my PC, Shock! It worked for me .I installed all the programs in it. And started trying out the first game at 3 pm! The game was “SIMS 2”. A Version of Sims 2 First of all, I was amused to see a game actually working in my PC. But then, I played..played ..and played until the PC went off on its own at exactly 12 AM ! That was the last day that I saw my PC in ‘ON’ condition that year, and it was only March! Yes I blew some fuse off in my PC due to overuse. My thirst for AOE , got quenched when the same friend bought a laptop . The first thing i did without his knowledge was to install Age Of Empires . For some days , it remained like that before the day he found out that i was playing a different game after all ( So close we were…) . As Usual , my friend doesn’t like those stuff and is a hardcore action lover . So he obviously hated games where all the action we can get was 2 persons making sounds like ting..cling..ting..cling.. with their swords as if they were fighting or something .He was unpleasant with the idea , but didn’t want to hurt me , so allowed me to play in his laptop while he tried to like that game ( which he never did ) . But Sadly all madness leaves you once you have an overdose . I was playing so much , so that i finished the game off in 5 days ( It was quite small for a game like AOE ) .I quite had enough of Age Of Empires for now . So i quit playing that in his laptop . The next checkpoint of my gaming life is when i bought ( or was gifted ! ) a PC , a better one . With 512 MBs of RAM and Intel P4 . Now i knew very well due to the computer knowledge i obtained by spoiling the Operating System of my friend’s laptop , that my PC now can support AOE ! ( Don’t wonder how i got something unrelated from that ! ) .But i didn’t rush , because anyway i don’t have the rage i used to have . So i ran into another game called ‘Simcity’ . One look of the gameplay , and i knew that this is my next addiction .The fact that Simcity 2 was a game made in 1980s never deterred me . For me the graphics didn’t matter . All that mattered was the tiny population reacting somewhat exactly like they would to in real life . It was like being a real life Mayor . Seriously , anyone even remotely thinking of taking up a political role , should give it a try . There are always something to do , even though it seems like i sat there for more than 4 hours simply ( Isn’t that what political persons do ?) . When i told about these games to my friends , they wondered how a person from 21st century can actually find it interesting to play games like that . Because all they liked was “Grand Theft Auto”s , “Freedom Fighter”s and “Assasin’s creed”s , that they couldn’t even imagine playing DOS graphics games anymore .Like all the good things i had , i gave myself an overdose of all Simcity versions that my PC can handle ( 1,2,3,4 etc. ) and now again i was bored . This slideshow requires JavaScript. I still don’t know about internet , so i am in for greater surprises . I thought ‘Simcity’ , ‘AOE’ , ‘Sims’ came under the same genre – “Strategy” . The next stop was when i got Internet ( a Broadband ) . In the mean time , too many things changed . I changed two phones ; My PC now had 4GB RAM , AMD A8 ; My Dearest Friend left for France; Sachin had retired and Osama died ..I had found a ‘somewhat AOE match’ in Clash of Clans , but somewhere i felt the void . The mainstream strategy element was missing .The 2nd thing i did with my internet was install DOTA-2 . DOTA 2 I have seen my friend ( another one ) play DOTA and he reportedly played it for more than 8 hours , that he looked hideous on the morning of the next day ( Same madness ! ) . I knew that it was my next evolution . It was pretty easy for me adapt to game style of DOTA since i already had similar controls experience in Age Of Empires ( Considering some of my friends taking a month to get a hang of the controls ) . But the biggest difference here was , you controlled one person and only one !! This surprised me initially because i am used to control 200 troops in AOE at a time , So i felt a lot different playing it . But due to the incredible competitiveness of online play ( Remember i never played online AOE , since i never had an original version and an internet ! ) , it was a lot difficult and fun when compared to AOE . Gradually it turned to madness . More friends joined me and easily surpassed my expertise ( ) and when life seemed smooth enough , The 5th semester results came .. GPA of 7.56 down from 8.46 .. Shit ! I thought the fun took a toll on my education and quit DOTA for like 2 months . In those 2 months , i was infecting the world with a lot of my statuses in facebook so much that , Anna University decided to stop that by getting my GPA back to 8.46 in the revaluation result ( True incident , 0.9 increase almost gave me and my friends a heart attack ! ). Now that i assumed that DOTA has nothing to do with my education , i started again ! By then , all my friends who i introduced to DOTA , have become professionals with MMR ( Match Making Rating ) 1200+ , while i barely managed to get my MMR to 445 . Now to even play ranked with them , i have to get my MMR up by 600 !! So interests waned , i sought for others ! That’s where i found another one . ‘Transport Tycoon’ . It was yet again the same story as ‘Simcity’ . It was then that i found out that TT , Sims , Simcity came under a different banner called ‘Simulation’ . When i searched the similar games , i got the feeling that Po gets during KFP-3 .. “ Wow there are a whole world of them ! “ . In between Simcity and DOTA-2 , i grabbed an addiction called “From the Pavilion” . It inspired me so much , that i tried creating a ‘Cricket Simulation Engine’ using the C i know ! FTP made me learn a lot about MS Excel ( which i couldn’t during the 2 years of Computer Science at school ) , which gave me quite a name in college ! It was then i started to realise that after all games are not a complete waste of time. Evolution strikes again.. and i know that i don’t like “Strategy” games , i just liked the simulation elements in a strategy game . After that i was looking at a different direction . I am not going to drag this by explaining in detail about every game I have played since. Recently I have been playing a game called ‘Logis Tycoon’, which was too similar to games like ‘Transport Tycoon’ and ‘Simcity’. After this, I was deeply interested in programming games like that . But then wait … What is the use of pursuing games, Instead of studying Machines, Power System and some other thing I am worthless at ? So I just quit that though . Ever since I joined engineering, I have known that I have taken COC Human Resource Machine From the Pavilion OPEN TTD Logis Tycoon Evolution the wrong path , but still chose to pursue in that way. A lot of things I am good at, seemed useless at many junctures and the one thing I am not good at, seemed like my only option . I started blaming the syllabus, parents, myself for making me like this. After reading that blog, something felt right. Who told that something is not a viable option ? Passion is something that we don’t know the reason for liking and it is also the thing we are so good at, that we wonder how it can be otherwise. Whenever I heard the word passion, I have always thought about subjects, concepts, science, maths or programming and wondered how am I going to get along with it. I didn’t even consider the fact that games can be an option, before I let myself think deeply about my life that day. I have always been very enthusiastic about games. I play games all the time, but yet I don’t know what is my passion ! That blog really asked me so many questions that needed answers. The fact that I loved simulation and strategy games so much.. Does that make me a good decision maker? Or a good manager? I am yet to find out. But now I know what I am looking for! I seriously recommend everyone read that piece to get some insight about what are we looking at when we see ourselves! Thank You for tolerating!

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | October 24, 2016 -- 17:09 GMT (10:09 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Deep neural networks should enable a security system to detect visual anomalies. Chipmaker Movidius, recently acquired by Intel, is partnering with the Chinese video Internet of Things (IoT) firm Hikvision to build a lineup of smarter security cameras, the companies announced Monday. Using the Movidius Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit, the cameras will be able to run deep neural networks to perform high-accuracy video analytics on the cameras themselves. Such devices have typically relied on cloud computing power to run deep neural networks, but chipmakers and manufacturers expect to see an increasing amount of data processing happening on edge devices. Deep neural networks should enable a security system to detect visual anomalies like the arrival of suspicious packages or distracted drivers. "Advances in artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the way we think about personal and public security," said Movidius CEO Remi El-Ouazzane in a statement. "The ability to automatically process video in real-time to detect anomalies will have a large impact on the way cities infrastructure are being used. We're delighted to partner with Hikvision to deploy smarter camera networks and contribute to creating safer communities, better transit hubs and more efficient business operations." Intel announced just last month that it was acquiring Movidius, as it builds up its IoT unit. "We see massive potential for Movidius to accelerate our initiatives in new and emerging technologies," said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group, at the time. In August, Intel laid out its comprehensive 5G, IoT strategy at the Intel Developer Forum. The company demonstrated its commitment to powering edge devices with a demonstration of a smart streetlight, powered by Intel Atom processors. Microsoft continues its pivot to being all about cloud services It's not over for Windows and devices. But Microsoft's future is increasingly about the cloud and subscriptions, as its financials and corporate priorities show.

News & Analysis Movidius to Push AI at Edge of Network Surveillance camera deal with Hikvision Junko Yoshida 10/24/2016 11:00 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. — Movidius, a leading embedded computer-vision processor company, soon to be acquired by Intel Corp., has agreed with China’s Hikvision to penetrate artificial intelligence (AI) deeper into surveillance cameras. The deal put Movidius in a direct contact with Hikvision (pronounced high-K vision), a Chinese company not only known as a major factor globally in the surveillance market, but also for its expertise in advanced visual analytics. Movidius CEO In a phone interview with EE Times, Movidius CEO, Remi El-Ouazzane, said, “Deploying Artificial Intelligence at the edge [of the network] is becoming a massive trend.” Movidius, which has played a key role behind Google’s Project Tango, has been promoting its ultra low-power vision processing SoC in a number of embedded systems. The company has set its sights on accelerating the adoption of deep learning in a host of applications, including security cameras, drones and augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), as El-Ouazzane explained. Aside from an extended collaboration with Google in neural network technology, Movidius has been working with DJI, in Shenzhen, China, the world’s leading maker of drones and aerial cameras. Based on Movidius’ vision processor unit called Myriad 2, DJI earlier this year launched its Phantom 4 aircraft, with “the ability to sense and avoid obstacles in real time and hover in a fixed position without the need for a GPS signal,” as described by DJI. Ranked No.1 in scene classification at ImageNet 2016 The deal with Hikvision is geared toward driving Movidius’ embedded vision processor into the world of security cameras. Hikvision security cam Although running Deep Neural Networks has historically required devices to depend on additional computing power in the cloud, Movidius’ ultra-low power Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit can run advanced algorithms — like those developed by Hikvision — at the edge, inside cameras themselves, explained Movidius. Hikvision isn’t just a volume manufacturer of surveillance cameras. Its core expertise lies in the development of Machine Learning-based advanced visual analysis. In fact, Hikvision just last week won the “scene classification” category at ImageNet Challenge 2016.Organized by Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, and UNC Chapel Hill, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification in large scale signals. Other categories include object detection, object localization, object detection from video and scene parsing. According to Hikvision Research Institute, its researchers used "inception-style networks and not-so-deep residuals networks that perform better in considerably less training time." Sense, assess and decide Embedded systems, capable of actions such as “to sense, assess and decide,” will only grow further, explained Movidius CEO El-Ouazzane. Along with this growth, the industry has an increasing number of tech companies “trying to attack ‘Deep Learning’ from different layers and come up with new SoC platforms,” he observed. A case in point is ThinCI (pronounced Think-Eye), a startup just out of the closet. Considering the performance level required for neural network applications in a power-constrained environment, embedded vision processing needs a special, purpose-built architecture, El-Ouazzane explained. This trend is amplified by Moore’s Law which has recently shown signs of slowing down, he added. Common to all three applications — security cameras, drones, AR/VR — is the demand for improvements in power consumption, explained El-Ouazzane. But how exactly are neural networks applied to each of these applications?

The World War I-themed game is a team-based first-person shooter that is fun to play if you have the right hardware in your gaming PC. The problem for some is that Battlefield 1 has some pretty tough minimum and recommended system specifications published for both AMD and Intel/NVIDIA systems. Battlefield 1 Minimum PC Specifications: OS: 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Processor (AMD): AMD FX-6350 Processor (Intel): Core i5-6600K Memory: 8GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB DirectX: 11.0 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Hard-drive space: 50GB Battlefield 1 Recommended PC Specifications: OS: 64-bit Windows 10 or later Processor (AMD): AMD FX 8350 Wraith Processor (Intel): Intel Core i7-4790 or equivalent Memory: 16GB RAM Graphics card (AMD): AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB Graphics card (NVIDIA): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB DirectX: 11.1 Compatible video card or equivalent Online Connection Requirements: 512 KBPS or faster Internet connection Available Disk Space: 50GB Hold on to your hats folks! According to the minimum system specifications you’ll want to be running an AMD FX-6350 or an Intel Core i5-6600K processor and either an AMD Radeon HF 7850 2GB or a NVIDIA Geforce 660 2GB graphics card. The recommended specifications aren’t much easier on the graphics card as it is suggested you run an AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB or GeForce GTX 1060 3GB. Those are the latest discrete desktop graphics cards that both companies offer.  An Intel Core i5-6600K as the minimum spec for processors also just goes to show how intensive of a game Battlefield 1 is. “The Frostbite version used in Battlefield 1 is the most optimized yet, enabling us to push more content than we’ve ever done before,” said Per-Olof Romell, EA DICE director of technology. “Lots of improvement to the network code and servers simulating at 60Hz makes it the most solid Battlefield ever.” To put NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards to the test we benchmarked BF1 manually using Presentmon on the first 90 seconds of the first war story – Through Mud and Blood. We tested with DX12 enabled and GPU Memory Restriction disabled with the Ultra graphics quality preset. Battlefiled 1 does not come with a built-in benchmark, so you’ll manually have to benchmark this game title. Before we look at the numbers, let’s take a brief look at the test system that was used.

(NYSE: T)'s CEO Randall Stephenson were both guests at a dinner party hosted by Glenn Hutchins, a member of AT&T's board and co-founder of private equity firm Silver Lake. The conversation took place in August and ultimately led to AT&T's agreement to acquire Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX) for $107.50 per share. According to a Bloomberg report, Chernin and Stephenson talked about the media industry and ongoing trends, including the growth of online and mobile viewing, which threatens pay-TV operators, including AT&T's DirecTV. Stephenson credited Chernin with getting him to appreciate Time Warner''s vast library of content and that is when he began thinking that the two companies "could work together." Credit Suisse Downgrades Time Warner Citing Valuation Following Offer From AT&T A few days later, Time Warner's CEO Jeff Bewkes hosted Stephenson at Time Warner's headquarters near Central Park. The two executives were more than familiar with each other given AT&T $48 billion takeover of DirecTV which made the company one of Time Warner's largest distributors of its content. After three hours of talks, the executives realized that both of their companies' futures are intertwined. A merger for AT&T transitions the company into a media mogul with control over some of the world's most cherished assets in news and entertainment. The conclusions of the discussions were revealed to a total of eight people across both companies. Future meetings to discuss the merger where held in Washington and Nashville to maintain a higher degree of secrecy versus New York City. AT&T's executives referred to the deal under a code name "Lilly" and Time Warner's executives used the code word "Rabbit." "The more we talked about it, the more it fell into place, that there would be benefits that might be significant and might allow us to evolve the ecosystem faster," Bloomberg quoted Bewkes as saying.

I use one and I prefer it to my Mac Pro Trashcan. I personally like the ability to be able to upgrade my computer when new hardware comes to market like the new 10 series and Titan GPU's that Nvidia have introduced. If you do have a Hackintosh post your set up so other people who are thinking about trying it can see what works.

No major problems ever. However, i am starting to see a limit. Not because of the hardware but because of the OS. The fastest speed ram config, video card configs and some awesome motherboard features don't work. SLI is one. not being able to use built in network solution forces the use of a pci slot. you are partly restricted to macOS supported parts. I am getting close to go PC. But will probably still get the new mac pro if it's updates because i do need it on set.     #8   Marcus Friedlander View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Jun 2014 Location Los Angeles Posts 665 10-23-2016, 10:23 AM Very interested in this thread!

The need to stay competitive is the top reason why companies cited a shift in their R&D budgets towards software and services, and for good reason - according to the study, companies who reported faster revenue growth relative to key competitors allocated 25 percent more of their R&D budgets to software offerings than companies who reported slower revenue growth. -- The average allocation of R&D spending for software and services increased from 54% to 59% between 2010 and 2015 and is expected to grow to 63% by 2020. -- Meanwhile, the average allocation of R&D spending dedicated to product-based offerings fell to 41 percent (from 46% in 2010), and is expected to fall to 37% by 2020 (an overall decrease of 19% this decade). -- Average allocation of R&D spending on software offerings alone will increase by 43% by the end of this decade and R&D spending on services will gradually overtake investment in product-based innovation (39% vs. 37% by 2020). -- Global R&D spending on software offerings has increased by 65% between 2010-2015, from US $86 billion to $142 billion. "Many of the world's major innovators are in the midst of a transformational journey mostly driven by changing - and rising - customer expectations," says Barry Jaruzelski, innovation and R&D expert for Strategy& and principal with PwC US. "The shift is also being driven by the supercharged pace of improvement in what software can do, including the increasing use of embedded software and sensors in products, the ability to reliably and inexpensively connect products, customers and manufacturers via the Internet of Things (IoT), and the availability of cloud-based data storage. Companies will recruit less mechanical engineers and more data and software engineers to build their capabilities To support the development of software and services offerings, fewer companies will focus their R&D spending on the electrical and mechanical field. By 2020, the number of companies reporting that electrical engineers are their top employed engineering specialty will fall by 35 percent and the proportion of companies who expect that data engineers will represent their largest group of employed engineers will double from 8% to 16%. Jaruzelski says, "An increase in software and services, even in more traditional industries has created a shift towards hiring talent that can develop software and provide platforms to collect and analyse product-related data. The shift is already changing the way business schools think about their course offerings, and will have profound effects both on education and, more generally, on the future of employment." Regionally, companies in North America are making the strongest shift to software offerings-from 15 percent of total R&D spending in 2010 to 24 percent in 2020. While Asia remains the most product-centric region, with 44 percent of R&D allocated to product offerings in 2010, only falling to 40 percent in 2020. The automotive and industrial sectors are making the most aggressive push towards developing new software offerings. Among companies that made an acquisition during the past five years, the vast majority - 71 percent - were made to enhance capabilities in software (33%) or services (38%).

Updated: November 15, 2016 @ 6:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Life Entertainment Dining Buy & Sell AP Can Samsung Recover From the Galaxy Note 7 Disaster? newsfeedback@fool.com (Evan Niu, CFA) Oct 24, 2016 0 Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) official recall of the Galaxy Note 7 line earlier this month solidified the product as one of the biggest tech flops in recent memory. In this week's Industry Focus: Tech, The Motley Fool's Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu discuss what we know about the Note 7 explosions, how Samsung's stock has been affected so far, how the company might recover from this, and how much this might hurt the business going forward. On the other side, the duo take a look at some companies that could benefit as they take up Samsung's slack. A full transcript follows the video. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good. Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Oct. 14, and we're talking about the fiery mess that is the Samsung Galaxy Note. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going? Evan Niu: It's been a fun time to watch Samsung, considering I've been a longtime Samsung skeptic. Lewis: We're both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) guys, we're both iPhone guys, so I think it's been comforting for us to know that the phones in our pocket are not going to spontaneously combust any time soon, right? Niu: It's reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worried about my phone blowing up. Lewis: On today's show, we're going to give a little rundown on what's been going on with Samsung and the Galaxy Note line over the last month-plus, how that line fits into the company's smartphone segment, and the company's financials in general. Then, which companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and the recall of the Galaxy Note line. Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a little timeline on what's been going on? Niu: Sure. Galaxy Note 7 launched in mid-August. I think that was part of the deal -- Samsung was really wanting to beat Apple to market on timing, because, as everyone knows, iPhones come out in September. So, I think the company was really pushing toward the timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible to try to beat Apple to the punch. Which is kind of silly, because it's only a month difference. How much of a difference could that make? But, apparently, that was important to Samsung. I think that's partially what's led up to these problems, they cut corners or tried to do things too fast. Things obviously just weren't ready. Then, as we know, in early and mid-September, we started to see reports of Samsung Note 7 either exploding or catching on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In general, sometimes you hear stories about this happening. When you're using a third-party charger that's not up to spec, that can sometimes be the culprit. But these were the official chargers, the regular Samsung chargers you were supposed to be using.  So, Samsung does this huge recall, 2.5 million units. They think they figured out that it's the batteries that they sourced in-house from the Samsung SDI internal battery division. So, they do this recall. They leave all the other phones out there that have different batteries from third-party suppliers. They start replacing phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or two, the replacement phones are now catching on fire. (laughs) So, everything is a huge mess, and now they've made the call to officially kill the project altogether. That's a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it's this bad.  It's crazy, because in modern smartphone times, people take this stuff for granted. Before this one, you hadn't heard about an exploding phone, or a phone catching on fire, meaningfully, in years. At least, not at this scale, outside of isolated incidences, like the third-party charger thing I was talking about. But, you don't see this wide-scale type of thing happening. It's been years. I think most consumers have probably thought that companies have figured this out, but apparently they haven't. It's kind of crazy. Lewis: Yeah, still running into some issues on the tech side. This is, I think, brutally bad timing, given that the company is basically coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. It seemed like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the smartphone space. Earlier this week, when the company decided to go with the full recall, they also issued an update to guidance. So, we don't even really have to speculate as to what the financial hit might look like, we can look at exactly at what the company said here. They are now expecting third-quarter operating profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is roughly $4.6 billion, down from the original forecast of 7.8 trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there. Third-quarter revenue has also been revised down. It's now expected to be about 47 trillion won from the previous guidance of 49 trillion won. Niu: I think what's even more disconcerting about this whole thing is, Samsung still doesn't know what's wrong with the phones. They cannot figure it out. As recently as last week, there was a New York Times report that their engineers are still trying to replicate the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. It's one thing if they do this recall, they get the phones back, and they figure it out and presumably fix it. But, if they don't even know what's wrong, that's a huge question mark. It really calls to question all these other things about their future phones. I don't think any of their phones have had this type of problem, but going forward, unless they can figure this out and definitively say, "This is what caused it, and we have a solution ... " This is totally unrelated, but hilarious. They also had washing machines that are now blowing up. I don't know if you saw that. A couple weeks ago, there were reports -- because, Samsung makes everything, and they have these top-load washing machines, and those are now exploding. Clearly, it's a totally different thing, because those don't use lithium ion batteries like the phones do. But it's kind of like, what's going on with everything?! (laughs) Washing machines, too? Lewis: To layer on top of that, I think there are another couple reasons why this is a little bit different than your average product recall, or even food-safety-related issues, like what we've seen with Chipotle or Jack in the Box in the '90s. You talked about how they haven't been able to diagnose the problem, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the other products they have out there. I think one of the other issues is, there's a lot of confusion in the Galaxy line. You look out at Samsung's product offering, frankly, it's really hard to keep all their phones straight. They intentionally moved the Note to be on the 7 naming convention, to keep it consistent with the other offerings. Now, I think you're seeing people that aren't 100% sure which products are safe, and which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I forget which product, but it was one of their newer and higher-priced phones, that -- Niu: It was the regular S7. Lewis: Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the people who held those in their hands, if they were reading this notification, didn't need to worry about that. That's fine, but when you have a super fragmented offering, and a lot of the headlines are "Galaxy 7," and they're trying to distill it down to something like that ... Niu: Yeah. For average consumers who don't follow this stuff as closely as we do, they just see some headline about Galaxy something, 7 something. There's a Galaxy S7, there's a Galaxy S7 A, there's the Galaxy Note 7. There's so many, and they're all part of the Galaxy brand that Samsung has put so much money into building. They put tens of millions of dollars into building this brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, this one horribly botched product risks killing all that brand value. It's not uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing, advertising, kickbacks, commissions to retailers and all that, than it does on R&D. It puts a ton of money into this, and now, because they're unified, they're all getting dragged down. They're trying to contain this thing, like you said, notifications saying, "Your phone is safe." It sounds exactly like the phone is not safe. But, "The phone is safe, don't worry." Lewis: I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life cycles of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back in restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones, or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might decide to go over to something on the iOS side. Niu: Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out. Samsung is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard over the past 10 years to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modifications and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try to differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't actually good at that stuff. Their software is not very good. They're really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardware is having all these problems, there's really not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has been incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their one strength is now being called into question ... Lewis: People are going to go elsewhere. Niu: Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there's tons of really good Android phones out there.  Lewis: I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising to see some flight from the brand. One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season, and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics. To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at least ... Niu: And one of their most expensive, most profitable products, too. Lewis: Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that, as a business.  Niu: Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone makes all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of their flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to the iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has established itself as the phablet leader, and Apple now has the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty comparable, as far as giant phones go. Lewis: Yeah. I started briefly introducing what the company was expecting for revenue writedown and revised guidance. It looks like analysts were expecting the company to ship about 15 to 19 million units from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that into context, Samsung shipped between 75 million and 78 million smartphones last quarter. So, while this is a big deal, it's a fancy new line they were really trying to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their product mix, it's actually maybe about 10% or so. I don't think it's as big of a deal as people realize. Niu: I think the big difference is, a lot of Samsung's volume comes from these low-end, cheaper smartphones in places like India. They sell phones that are $50 to $100. They're not making a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which helps them keep their rank in the smartphone market. Like you mentioned, it's a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a non-holiday quarter, that's a ton of phones. But a lot of those are low-margin, low-value units versus these high-end phones -- that's where these companies make their margins. I think it has a leverage effect, in that it seems smaller in terms of units. But it had a pretty big impact on operating profits. Generally speaking, mobile is about half of Samsung's business, in terms of revenue and operating profit, roughly, before this whole thing. Mobile includes a bunch of things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobile segment itself is incredibly important to them. Within the mobile segment if you look at the margin profile within their mobile business, these high-end phones are quite important in terms of profitability. Those low-end phones get a lot of volume, but considering that Samsung is largely a hardware player, if they sell a low-end phone to someone, it's not like they're capturing that customer on to their platform like Google or Apple would be. They're just trying to sell the phone. So, I think it won't have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think, again, coming back to the brand, it's so damaging for the brand. That's something that's really hard to put a number on right now -- brand valuation. I think that's the bigger thing here. Missing out on one product cycle is one thing, if it's contained within this product cycle. But if there's lasting damage to the brand, they could be hurting for a long time. Lewis: I think that's why you've seen market reaction to this actually not be so bad. Short-term, if we're to take the company at the guidance that they're giving, and we look at the product mix, and they're able to hold the volumes on those other brands, the drop that we've seen makes sense. I think if you look back to when this story originally broke, the company was down about 4% or 5%, which really isn't all that crazy given that this is one of their most consumer-facing and high-profile lines. They do have so many other offerings in the smartphone market. If those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issue there. One of the things people might not realize about Samsung is, they're a little bit more diversified than your Apple, in terms of the different hardware arenas that they've planned. To give you an idea of their revenue mix, consumer electronics is about 22% of revenue, and that does not include smartphones. IT and mobile communications, as you said before, a little over 50% of revenue. Device solutions, which is the semiconductor and display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobile is the highest-margin business that they are in, and having a high-profile phone, a high-ASP phone (average selling price), being removed, might lead to some margin compression there. But if they're able to hold on the other brands, I think this muted reaction from the market makes sense. Niu: Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they can successfully pull off this crisis management. I think it's a good thing to kill those phones, definitely, especially when you don't know what's going on. You have to bite the bullet. Lewis: Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we're going to hit briefly on a couple companies that might be poised to benefit as Samsung goes into crisis mode. But before we do, what if you could help combat global climate change, and make money at the same time?

So, Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with this? Niu: I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung itself. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants -- Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Lewis: Can you explain what the Snapdragon does? Niu: Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most important pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix, they've improved their chips a little bit and got more competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple. If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out of the picture. Lewis: Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy. Niu: Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has gone to Intel -- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainly Apple. Lewis: Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to think -- Niu: Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're like, "highest Android switcher rates ever." I think that trend is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall here. As I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem, they benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), I think, is a big winner here too. They actually just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual-sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two years ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings; it was pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor raised fourth-quarter guidance, and that raised guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a pretty big winner here. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone business. Niu: Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said, "This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued," which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the customer and get these things off the market. I don't think there's going to be any damage to them. Lewis: I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are specifically in some of these devices and not others. But big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might pick up some incremental business here. Niu: Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock Android without all the third-party software and all this stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in the way that most companies in the space do. They're partnering with Verizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that, they're selling it online through the online store. But, it might surprise you how many people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store. Lewis: It becomes kind of a default decision, right? Niu: Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People that already know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like any other product in their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get these carrier relationships going, because the carriers want more control. It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is their lack of distribution. Lewis: It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might really see some importance swings in what goes on with their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR and negative brand association contained to the Note line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them long-term. If it does start to bleed into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a long time. Niu: Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's reason to think that-there might be another one. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice rally in Samsung sales. Niu: They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just crazy. Lewis: Anything else before I let you go, Evan? Niu: No, I think we hit it all.

Chronocam secures $15M to power its ‘biological eye’ computer vision system Posted Oct 24, 2016 by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story The Luminox XCOR 5261 Chronograph wants to send you (and your wrist) to space Not everything in our field of view at any given time is all that interesting; often, it’s only when something consistent changes that our eyes take notice. Paris-based Chronocam is looking to further develop this concept in the computer vision space with its new camera technology being optimized for autonomous vehicles. Today, Chronocam announced that it has picked up $15 million in a Series B funding round led by Intel Capital. Robert Bosch Venture Capital, iBionex, GmbH, 360 Capital, CEAi and Renault Group also participated in the round. The company had previously raised an $850,000 seed round. Computer vision is a space where Intel is continuing to make significant moves. Intel announced last month that it is acquiring computer vision VPU-maker Movidius, which has become popular largely for how well it does low-power on-device processing. The company’s RealSense team has also done quite a bit of work in building sensors for autonomous cars, drones and virtual reality systems. Computer vision companies are increasingly looking to take image processing back from the cloud and get everything happening on-device so that the data can be interpreted as quickly as possible. Chronocam is particularly great for this on-device processing because its systems grab nearly 20 times less data than a standard camera system. The camera works by analyzing the captured image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Most of the static information captured on devices isn’t really important until something changes. For autonomous cars, knowing everything about the scope, brightness and color of the sky isn’t important until there’s a sudden storm and hail is dropping out of the sky. “Conventional computer vision approaches are not well-suited to the requirements of a new generation of vision-enabled systems,” said Luca Verre, CEO and co-founder of Chronocam, in a statement. “For example, autonomous vehicles require faster sensing systems which can operate in a wider variety of ambient conditions. In the IoT segment, power budgets, bandwidth requirements and integration within sensor networks make today’s vision technologies impractical and ineffective.” Chronocam plans to package this computer vision technology into a full end-to-end system, which it hopes to ship next year.

The device “will include a screen, high-powered processors and outward-facing cameras” according to The Wall Street Journal.   Engadget is now reporting that Google’s VR headset integrates eye tracking technologies “to map out the real-world space in front of a user.” Google's VR headset “blurs the line between virtual and augmented reality.” Google's new VR headset is being designed to provide a better experience compared to the Oculus or HTC Vive . Though we don’t know too much about Google’s VR headset, it seems to be similar to Microsoft’s HoloLens. The report also confirms that Movidius, an AI company being acquired by Intel, will provide chips that will help in tracking motion. The new headset will also be separate from the company’s Daydream VR platform, but won’t require a phone to power it, according to Engadget’s sources. Related Stories Google Daydream View, Chromecast Ultra Available Now Google Guarantees 2 Years Of Android Upgrades For Pixels While we’re not sure when Google’s VR headset could be released, one Journal source says it could arrive later this year, with another source saying it’s still in early development and could potentially be scrapped entirely.  According to the Drum, FCC documents show Google’s device would have a broad range of frequencies, from 2.4 GHz to 5.8 GHz, and that it has a built-in radio similar to its augmented reality headset, Google Glass, which was discontinued in 2015. While the FCC documents have barely any details the device, Mike Jazayeri is one of the contacts on the filings. Jazayeri joined Google in 2005 and has previously worked on Cardboard VR viewer. Jazayeri is currently a director of product management on the team for Google’s VR group. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Engadget sources say Mountain View is working on a high-end mixed reality headset that would not require a smartphone like Daydream, or a computer like the Oculus Rift. Those familiar with the matter say the visor would feature eye tracking technologies and sensors to ‘map out the real world space in front of the user’ to provide positional awareness. This will be aided by AI chips provided by a company called Movidius, which is currently in the process of being purchased by Intel. The sources say that, much like the Microsoft HoloLens platform, Google will be able to offer mixed reality experiences with digital content shown within real-world visuals. Related: Is Daydream View setting a new standard for mobile VR? According to the report, the headset will differ from HoloLens in one key way; rather than project VR objects into the real world, Google wants to bring the real world into the VR experience. There’s no word yet on when we may hear an announcement from Google on this project. Thus far the company has declined to comment. The Daydream View headset, which is similar to the Samsung Gear VR, and will be compatible with a new generation of Android phones, is now available to pre-order ahead of shipping next month.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Machines with Brains October 24, 2016 Soon, police officers won’t need to pull you over if you’re caught texting while driving. An artificial-intelligence-enhanced speed camera will simply notify authorities directly. The machine vision technology company Movidius has teamed up with the Chinese security camera maker Hikvision to create smart cameras that can catch behavior such as leaving a suspicious package in a public place, driving while distracted by mobile devices, and break ins. Advanced visual analytics will also allow cameras to identify car models and detect seat belts. The partnership will debut a new line of cameras with higher accuracy than traditional computing techniques in China this week. (Movidius has announced its acquisition by Intel.) Both search giant Google and the world’s leading drone manufacturer DJI have relied on Movidius to enhance spatial awareness in virtual reality and engineer the sense and avoid features inside drones respectively. Movidius’s Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit (VPU) uses deep neural networks that learns patterns from massive amounts of data in order to identify features in a video or still image. Its computer vision lowers risk of false positives. Hikvision claims it has been able to achieve 99% accuracy in visual analytics with Movidius’s help. “Advances in artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the way we think about personal and public security” Movidius CEO Remi El-Ouazzane said in the company’s press release. “The ability to automatically process video in real-time to detect anomalies will have a large impact on the way cities infrastructure are being used.” The low-power VPU allows the advanced algorithms to reside inside the cameras themselves, and information processing occurs instantaneously, instead of requiring additional computing infrastructure in the cloud. This means that information only needs to be transmitted to a central server or human operator when a serious threat or violation is reported. Intelligent systems, such as smart cameras, are slated to grow at over 7% each year from 2015 to 2020, with revenues exceeding $2.2 trillion in 2020, according to the International Data Corporation. However, high levels of visual intelligence could pose a threat to privacy. The facial recognition used to discover missing persons and intruders could just as easily be manipulated by the government to surveil people.

The Galaxy Note 7 line has officially been axed. What does it mean for Samsung, and who could benefit from the fallout? Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 24, 2016 at 1:42PM Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) official recall of the Galaxy Note 7 line earlier this month solidified the product as one of the biggest tech flops in recent memory. In this week's Industry Focus: Tech, The Motley Fool's Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu discuss what we know about the Note 7 explosions, how Samsung's stock has been affected so far, how the company might recover from this, and how much this might hurt the business going forward. On the other side, the duo take a look at some companies that could benefit as they take up Samsung's slack. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016.

Wunder Capital: Do well and do good. Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast the dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, Oct. 14, and we're talking about the fiery mess that is the Samsung Galaxy Note. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Fool.com senior tech specialist, Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going? Evan Niu: It's been a fun time to watch Samsung, considering I've been a longtime Samsung skeptic. Lewis: We're both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) guys, we're both iPhone guys, so I think it's been comforting for us to know that the phones in our pocket are not going to spontaneously combust any time soon, right? Niu: It's reassuring. (laughs) I'm not worried about my phone blowing up. Lewis: On today's show, we're going to give a little rundown on what's been going on with Samsung and the Galaxy Note line over the last month-plus, how that line fits into the company's smartphone segment, and the company's financials in general. Then, which companies, if any, might benefit from some of the backlash and the recall of the Galaxy Note line. Evan, you want to get us up to speed, give us a little timeline on what's been going on? Niu: Sure. Galaxy Note 7 launched in mid-August. I think that was part of the deal -- Samsung was really wanting to beat Apple to market on timing, because, as everyone knows, iPhones come out in September. So, I think the company was really pushing toward the timeline of getting this thing out to market as quick as possible to try to beat Apple to the punch. Which is kind of silly, because it's only a month difference. How much of a difference could that make? But, apparently, that was important to Samsung. I think that's partially what's led up to these problems, they cut corners or tried to do things too fast. Things obviously just weren't ready. Then, as we know, in early and mid-September, we started to see reports of Samsung Note 7 either exploding or catching on fire, a lot of the time while they were charging. In general, sometimes you hear stories about this happening. When you're using a third-party charger that's not up to spec, that can sometimes be the culprit. But these were the official chargers, the regular Samsung chargers you were supposed to be using.  So, Samsung does this huge recall, 2.5 million units. They think they figured out that it's the batteries that they sourced in-house from the Samsung SDI internal battery division. So, they do this recall. They leave all the other phones out there that have different batteries from third-party suppliers. They start replacing phones. And now, all of the sudden, in the past week or two, the replacement phones are now catching on fire. (laughs) So, everything is a huge mess, and now they've made the call to officially kill the project altogether. That's a tough call to make, but you have to do it when it's this bad.  It's crazy, because in modern smartphone times, people take this stuff for granted. Before this one, you hadn't heard about an exploding phone, or a phone catching on fire, meaningfully, in years. At least, not at this scale, outside of isolated incidences, like the third-party charger thing I was talking about. But, you don't see this wide-scale type of thing happening. It's been years. I think most consumers have probably thought that companies have figured this out, but apparently they haven't. It's kind of crazy. Lewis: Yeah, still running into some issues on the tech side. This is, I think, brutally bad timing, given that the company is basically coming off its best earnings report in a couple years. It seemed like they had a ton of momentum, decent amount of growth in the smartphone space. Earlier this week, when the company decided to go with the full recall, they also issued an update to guidance. So, we don't even really have to speculate as to what the financial hit might look like, we can look at exactly at what the company said here. They are now expecting third-quarter operating profit to come in at 5.2 trillion South Korean won, which is roughly $4.6 billion, down from the original forecast of 7.8 trillion won. So, a decent amount of rollback there. Third-quarter revenue has also been revised down. It's now expected to be about 47 trillion won from the previous guidance of 49 trillion won. Niu: I think what's even more disconcerting about this whole thing is, Samsung still doesn't know what's wrong with the phones. They cannot figure it out. As recently as last week, there was a New York Times report that their engineers are still trying to replicate the problem, and they can't. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. It's one thing if they do this recall, they get the phones back, and they figure it out and presumably fix it. But, if they don't even know what's wrong, that's a huge question mark. It really calls to question all these other things about their future phones. I don't think any of their phones have had this type of problem, but going forward, unless they can figure this out and definitively say, "This is what caused it, and we have a solution ... " This is totally unrelated, but hilarious. They also had washing machines that are now blowing up. I don't know if you saw that. A couple weeks ago, there were reports -- because, Samsung makes everything, and they have these top-load washing machines, and those are now exploding. Clearly, it's a totally different thing, because those don't use lithium ion batteries like the phones do. But it's kind of like, what's going on with everything?! (laughs) Washing machines, too? Lewis: To layer on top of that, I think there are another couple reasons why this is a little bit different than your average product recall, or even food-safety-related issues, like what we've seen with Chipotle or Jack in the Box in the '90s. You talked about how they haven't been able to diagnose the problem, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in the other products they have out there. I think one of the other issues is, there's a lot of confusion in the Galaxy line. You look out at Samsung's product offering, frankly, it's really hard to keep all their phones straight. They intentionally moved the Note to be on the 7 naming convention, to keep it consistent with the other offerings. Now, I think you're seeing people that aren't 100% sure which products are safe, and which aren't. I saw news that they had to push notifications, I forget which product, but it was one of their newer and higher-priced phones, that -- Niu: It was the regular S7. Lewis: Right. That, those were not part of the recall, and the people who held those in their hands, if they were reading this notification, didn't need to worry about that. That's fine, but when you have a super fragmented offering, and a lot of the headlines are "Galaxy 7," and they're trying to distill it down to something like that ... Niu: Yeah. For average consumers who don't follow this stuff as closely as we do, they just see some headline about Galaxy something, 7 something. There's a Galaxy S7, there's a Galaxy S7 A, there's the Galaxy Note 7. There's so many, and they're all part of the Galaxy brand that Samsung has put so much money into building. They put tens of millions of dollars into building this brand over the past five or 10 years. And now, this one horribly botched product risks killing all that brand value. It's not uncommon for Samsung to spend more money on marketing, advertising, kickbacks, commissions to retailers and all that, than it does on R&D. It puts a ton of money into this, and now, because they're unified, they're all getting dragged down. They're trying to contain this thing, like you said, notifications saying, "Your phone is safe." It sounds exactly like the phone is not safe. But, "The phone is safe, don't worry." Lewis: I think one of the other things that makes this tougher -- and returning back from this a little tougher -- is the product life cycles of smartphones. You look at a place like Chipotle, fast casual, they're able to give away a ton of free product via coupons, Chiptopia, that kind of stuff, and get people back in restaurants relatively quickly, because meals are a routine purchase for people. Smartphones are not. You're buying a phone every two years. Once you get someone in an ecosystem, the likelihood of them staying there is a lot higher. So, I worry there's going to be this class of people coming onto smartphones, or maybe people that recently decided to make the switch over to the Galaxy line, specifically the Galaxy Note line, that they're second-guessing it, might go with another Android device, might decide to go over to something on the iOS side. Niu: Yeah. That's exactly the thing they need to figure out. Samsung is really good at hardware. Samsung has tried so hard over the past 10 years to get better at software, but of course, they have to get Android from Google, and they do their whole modifications and tweaks, this stuff they put on top of it to try to differentiate. But the point remains that Samsung isn't actually good at that stuff. Their software is not very good. They're really good at hardware. If all the sudden, their hardware is having all these problems, there's really not a good reason to buy a Samsung phone. Historically, their hardware has been incredibly well-made. But now, there's no reason. If their one strength is now being called into question ... Lewis: People are going to go elsewhere. Niu: Exactly. And, even if you want to stay with an Android, there's tons of really good Android phones out there.  Lewis: I think, to help adjust for this a little bit, Samsung is offering customers about $75 to trade in their devices for other Samsung models. That's a good retention effort. They might save some lost customers along the way. But it wouldn't be surprising to see some flight from the brand. One of the other reasons I think this is troubling is the timing in the calendar year. This is ahead of the holiday season, and it's the biggest time of the year for consumer electronics. To have to wipe out an entire product line ahead of the quarter where you're probably going to be doing 40% of your business, at least ... Niu: And one of their most expensive, most profitable products, too. Lewis: Yeah. That's rough, that's really hard to deal with that, as a business.  Niu: Yeah. This is the time, holiday shopping season. Everyone makes all their money here. And now, Samsung has to pull one of their flagship...the Note 7 has been a differentiator compared to the iPhone for a long time, because it comes with a stylus, it's bigger. It was like the posterboy for phablets. Samsung has established itself as the phablet leader, and Apple now has the 7 Plus, which isn't as big as the Note 7 and doesn't have a stylus. But other than that, it's pretty comparable, as far as giant phones go. Lewis: Yeah. I started briefly introducing what the company was expecting for revenue writedown and revised guidance. It looks like analysts were expecting the company to ship about 15 to 19 million units from Q3 2016 through Q1 2017. To put that into context, Samsung shipped between 75 million and 78 million smartphones last quarter. So, while this is a big deal, it's a fancy new line they were really trying to get some momentum behind, in the grander scheme of their product mix, it's actually maybe about 10% or so. I don't think it's as big of a deal as people realize. Niu: I think the big difference is, a lot of Samsung's volume comes from these low-end, cheaper smartphones in places like India. They sell phones that are $50 to $100. They're not making a lot of money on that, but they ship a lot of units, which helps them keep their rank in the smartphone market. Like you mentioned, it's a lot more than Apple, 75 million on a non-holiday quarter, that's a ton of phones. But a lot of those are low-margin, low-value units versus these high-end phones -- that's where these companies make their margins. I think it has a leverage effect, in that it seems smaller in terms of units. But it had a pretty big impact on operating profits. Generally speaking, mobile is about half of Samsung's business, in terms of revenue and operating profit, roughly, before this whole thing. Mobile includes a bunch of things, like tablet and these phones. But the mobile segment itself is incredibly important to them. Within the mobile segment if you look at the margin profile within their mobile business, these high-end phones are quite important in terms of profitability. Those low-end phones get a lot of volume, but considering that Samsung is largely a hardware player, if they sell a low-end phone to someone, it's not like they're capturing that customer on to their platform like Google or Apple would be. They're just trying to sell the phone. So, I think it won't have a huge impact on total volumes. But I think, again, coming back to the brand, it's so damaging for the brand. That's something that's really hard to put a number on right now -- brand valuation. I think that's the bigger thing here. Missing out on one product cycle is one thing, if it's contained within this product cycle. But if there's lasting damage to the brand, they could be hurting for a long time. Lewis: I think that's why you've seen market reaction to this actually not be so bad. Short-term, if we're to take the company at the guidance that they're giving, and we look at the product mix, and they're able to hold the volumes on those other brands, the drop that we've seen makes sense. I think if you look back to when this story originally broke, the company was down about 4% or 5%, which really isn't all that crazy given that this is one of their most consumer-facing and high-profile lines. They do have so many other offerings in the smartphone market. If those hold, there shouldn't be too much of an issue there. One of the things people might not realize about Samsung is, they're a little bit more diversified than your Apple, in terms of the different hardware arenas that they've planned. To give you an idea of their revenue mix, consumer electronics is about 22% of revenue, and that does not include smartphones. IT and mobile communications, as you said before, a little over 50% of revenue. Device solutions, which is the semiconductor and display panel business, 36% of revenue. The IT and mobile is the highest-margin business that they are in, and having a high-profile phone, a high-ASP phone (average selling price), being removed, might lead to some margin compression there. But if they're able to hold on the other brands, I think this muted reaction from the market makes sense. Niu: Yeah, I guess we'll just have to see if they can successfully pull off this crisis management. I think it's a good thing to kill those phones, definitely, especially when you don't know what's going on. You have to bite the bullet. Lewis: Absolutely. In the second half of the show, we're going to hit briefly on a couple companies that might be poised to benefit as Samsung goes into crisis mode. But before we do, what if you could help combat global climate change, and make money at the same time?

So, Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with this? Niu: I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung itself. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants -- Lewis: Can you explain what the Snapdragon does? Niu: Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most important pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix, they've improved their chips a little bit and got more competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple. If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out of the picture. Lewis: Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy. Niu: Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has gone to Intel -- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainly Apple. Lewis: Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to think -- Niu: Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're like, "highest Android switcher rates ever." I think that trend is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall here. As I mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem, they benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), I think, is a big winner here too. They actually just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan Semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual-sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only brought on Taiwan Semiconductor one or two years ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings; it was pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor raised fourth-quarter guidance, and that raised guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a pretty big winner here. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone business. Niu: Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said, "This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued," which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the customer and get these things off the market. I don't think there's going to be any damage to them. Lewis: I've seen [Alphabet's] Google thrown around in the list of potential winners as well. The idea is kind of similar with Apple -- they released the Pixel phone somewhat recently. Having a major potential competitor off the table bodes well for people giving that a shot. That's not going to be something that meaningfully contributes to the numbers for Google. I think, when you're talking about Apple and Google here, seeing Samsung falter and knowing that there might be a slightly larger bite of the smartphone market available to them isn't something that's thesis-altering. It's certainly interesting for some of the component manufacturers that are specifically in some of these devices and not others. But big picture, if you like Apple and Google already, stick with them. But don't buy solely on the idea that they might pick up some incremental business here. Niu: Yeah. The Pixel looks like a pretty good phone. Of course, it's Google's first phone, they designed the whole thing. They're outsourcing manufacturing, naturally, to HTC. But as far as them designing the phone itself, this is the first time that they're really doing the whole thing. It looks like a really good phone. I think, definitely, people that are not getting the Note 7 might consider the Pixel, because it's a pure Google phone stock Android without all the third-party software and all this stuff on it. But I think the biggest challenge there in terms of getting people to switch from a Note 7 to a Pixel XL or whatever the large one is called, it's really just about distribution. Google doesn't have distribution channels in the way that most companies in the space do. They're partnering with Verizon, which is the only carrier partner. Other than that, they're selling it online through the online store. But, it might surprise you how many people, when they need a new phone, they go to the carrier store. They just go to the retail store. Lewis: It becomes kind of a default decision, right? Niu: Yeah. And it makes some sense, because that's where they have the most selection, they can deal with all their plan stuff. I personally tend to buy things online, and I think a lot of people do. But, carrier distribution is an incredibly important channel for any phone maker. People that already know which phone they want they'll just go and buy that phone online. But a lot of people don't know, and they still like to shop around, like any other product in their lives, versus people like you and me are probably so loyal that it's not even a decision, it's just, when am I going to get my iPhone? But, for a lot of people, their phone breaks, or it's time for an upgrade, they just go to the carrier store and pick one. For the other carriers other than Verizon, Pixel's not going to be there, because Google is distributing themselves. It's harder for Google to get these carrier relationships going, because the carriers want more control. It's harder for Google to negotiate because they've never been a big player in the physical smartphone space. So I think the biggest thing that's going to hold them back is their lack of distribution. Lewis: It sounds like the rundown for investors here is, Apple, Google, possible beneficiaries. The people that might really see some importance swings in what goes on with their numbers are some of the component manufacturers like you talked about, Taiwan Semiconductor. My feeling is, for Samsung's business, if they're able to keep the bad PR and negative brand association contained to the Note line, then this won't be something that's really awful for them long-term. If it does start to bleed into the other products they offer, the S7 and things like that, it could spell trouble for their mobile segment for a long time. Niu: Yeah, the main thing is to figure out what the hell is going on with these things. Clearly, if they launch a phone next year and it has the same thing, that would thesis altering, two in a row. And, if they can't figure it out, there's reason to think that-there might be another one. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of consumers want them to know exactly what's going on and tell the public. Then we might see a nice rally in Samsung sales. Niu: They can't replicate this in their labs! It's just crazy. Lewis: Anything else before I let you go, Evan? Niu: No, I think we hit it all.

Read these and more hot technology news of the day in this dose of your 360 Daily. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge explodes while charging A Galaxy S7 Edge unit, said to be given to the user by Samsung in exchange for their Galaxy Note 7, reportedly caught fire automatically while charging. Images allegedly show that the S7 Edge, which was left for charging overnight, is completely totalled and beyond repair. This continues Samsung's bad streak with replacing the Galaxy Note 7 with other handsets. Meanwhile the company is also said to be offering to upgrade certain Note 7 users to next year's Galaxy S8 or Note 8.Apple's October 27 event all about laptops Apple will reportedly focus on the laptop range at its October 27 event, where the company is said to unveil updated versions of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro as well as the long-rumoured 13-inch MacBook. It is now being said that the company may not refresh its iMac lineup of desktops at the event. The new MacBook Pro is said to feature an Oled touch bar, Intel Skylake processors, Touch ID fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, and storage options up to 2TB.

Select users will also get a mystery box for each time slot; the box can include accessories, goodies, cases and covers, and even a OnePlus 3 smartphone. One winner will also get a week-long trip to London. Samsung Galaxy S8 launch delayed? Work on Samsung's next flagship smartphone, Galaxy S8, is said to be two weeks behind schedule as all of the company's engineers are focussed on figuring out the reason behind the spontaneous explosions of the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. This is said to put the launch of Galaxy S8 behind by two weeks, and the South Korean titan may not follow its tradition of launching the next S series model at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next year. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 price tipped ahead of Tuesday's launch While Xiaomi officially announced that it is hosting an event in Beijing on Tuesday to launch the Mi Note 2, a new leak  has suggested that the price tag of the smartphone will be $590 (Rs. 39,500). The smartphone is said to have a 5.7-inch QHD dual edge screen, Snapdragon 821 chipset, Android Marshmallow-based MIUI 8 software, 23-megapixel rear camera, and 12-megapixel front camera. New hack puts millions of Android phones at risk Researchers have discovered a new way that lets hackers take control of millions of Android devices. Hackers, using iPhones as well as other mobile devices, can supposedly exploit data on smartphones through memory chips and other physical parts embedded inside to gain root access using without any special permissions. The researchers claim that they have used the hack to root many LG, Motorola, Samsung, and OnePlus handsets. LG to end modular programme with LG G6 Next year's LG G6 flagship smartphone will reportedly mark the end of the company's modular experiment, which began with the G5. The report comes just a few weeks after company spokesperson Ken Hong said that it will not not ditch the "modular concept in the subsequent generation" of G-Series smartphones, despite the G5's performance in the market. Modular smartphones come with compatible mods that can easily placed or detached from the device for added functionalities; however, they face barriers such as learning curve with switching between accessories and high costs of modules. Instagram testing live video feature called 'Go Insta' Instagram is reportedly testing a live video feature in its Stories section for some users on the beta Android app in Russia. The users using the live video feature, at the time, appear at the top of the page with a red tag that reads LIVE. In order to start a broadcast, users simply have to click on a red button that says Go Insta.

Medical company to build in Fort Collins tech park Pat Ferrier , patferrier@coloradoan.com 6:14 p.m. MDT October 24, 2016 This rendering shows the proposed look of WilMarc Medical's office and warehouse space planned at the Harmony Technology Park in southeast Fort Collins (Photo: City of Fort Collins) 36 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE A Denver medical supply company that originally planned to move to Fort Collins will instead invest in growing a sister company here. WilMarc Medical, which makes fittings and tubing for medical devices free of polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC, plans to build 90,000 square feet of office and warehouse space at the 105-acre Harmony Technology Park east of Intel Corp. on Harmony Road. Fort Collins residents William and Marcia Coulson had planned to move their company, Eldon James Corp., from Denver to Fort Collins and had won nearly $1 million in tax credits from the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade last year to grow new jobs here. But Eldon James' sister company WilMarc "is growing faster than anticipated and we decided we needed to put our efforts into building an expansion facility for WilMarc," Marcia Coulson said. "WilMarc needed a facility now." Coulson has nearly 10 acres under contract at the northeast corner of Technology Parkway and Precision Drive in the technology park. DEVELOPMENT:  Major construction slows in Fort Collins According to plans filed with the city, WilMarc Medical plans to build 13,992 square feet of office space and nearly 80,000 square feet of warehouse space. Eldon James manufactures components, fittings and tubing used in three major markets — food and beverage, auto and industrial, and medical and pharmaceutical, Marcia Coulson said. Its owners found a growing market for PVC-free medical components and created WilMarc about three years ago. "There's a slow migration away from PVC because it's very inexpensive and easily available," she said. "Clean and green manufacturers are far and few between because it's more expensive than PVCs." However, health concerns over the use of PVC-based materials is creating a growth market for companies like WilMarc. "Many hospitals have created initiatives and joined coalitions to make certain the PVCs are removed from hospitals because they can affect the endocrine and reproductive systems if they come in contact with newborn baby boys," Coulson said. HOUSING:  306 more homes planned at Timberline and Vine In its first year, WilMarc is expected to double its workforce from 10 to about 20, Coulson said. It is currently leasing space in an office building at Harmony Technology Park, across the street from its proposed new home. An Eldon James expansion to Fort Collins is not off the table, but "we can only do so much in a day," Coulson said. "It's a pretty big process to get one building through the system. Fort Collins is still a strong consideration for expansion for Eldon James." The company had a presence in Loveland and Fort Collins until it moved to Denver in 2013. Prior to the move, Eldon James had planned to build a new facility in Timnath.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft’s Surface AIO could be called the ‘Surface Studio’ 2 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Oct 24, 2016 at 15:23 GMT3 weeks ago Concept Microsoft is expected to introduce the new Surface AIO at its Windows 10 event this Wednesday. The company’s Surface AIO will come in three different sizes, and it’ll likely boast Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Of course, the actual name of Microsoft’s Surface all-in-one device won’t be “Surface AIO” — instead, the device might be called “Surface Studio”. According to The Trademark Ninja, Microsoft filled a couple of trademarks related to Surface. First up, Microsoft registered a trademark for “Surface Laptop” which doesn’t mean much as the company is just protecting its brand just in case some other company introduces something called the “Surface Laptop”. Microsoft has also trademarked “Paint 3D” and that is likely the upcoming Paint app for Windows 10 which we reported about a few months ago. Now, a couple of other trademarks were filed recently — but they weren’t from Microsoft. The trademarks include “Surface Studio” and the “Surface Dial” which were filled by a fairly new Slovenian company. As The Trademark Ninja explained, the Slovenian company is likely related to Microsoft, but it is just a speculation for now. However, it would be quite odd if a new Slovenian company were to fight against Microsoft for these trademarks which makes the “Surface Studio” and “Surface Dial” devices much more interesting. Surface Studio is most likely the Surface all-in-one device, but we aren’t entirely sure what the Surface Dial is. It could be some sort of accessory for the Surface Studio, or it could just be another new Surface device from the firm. October 26th is only about 2 days away, so we’ll just have to wait until the devices are officially unveiled. We’ll be covering Microsoft’s October 26th event live from New York City, so make sure to bookmark our dedicated page for the event to stay up-to-date with the latest news!

If you don’t know a ton about Hikvision, a company based in Zhejiang, China is the world’s largest manufacturer of video surveillance cameras, owning about 30 percent of the global market for security cameras. Nearly 66 million security cameras are shipped every year so Hikvision is getting around 20 million+ cameras into consumer and enterprise hands every year. “There are huge amounts of gains to be made when it comes to neural networks and intelligent camera systems” said Hikvision CEO, Hu Yangzhong, in a statement. “With the Myriad 2 VPU we’re able to make our analytics offerings much more accurate, flagging more events that require a response, while reducing false alarms. Embedded, native intelligence is a major step towards smart, safe and efficiently run cities. We will build a long term partnership with Movidius and its VPU roadmap.” This deal with Movidius will begin with Hikvision optimizing certain cameras in its line with this technology with the goal of integrating the tech into the entire product line. Movidius’ computer vision tech should theoretically work on any type of security camera, regardless of how advanced its optics are, but Movidius CEO, Remi El-Ouazzane says that depth-sensing cameras specifically are really best-suited to capture accurate data using the company’s tech. Last mont, Intel announced that it had purchased Movidius. That deal will wrap up by the end of the year, but this deal with Hikvision was in the works long ago. Security cameras have long been a focus for Movidius, whose low-power VPU has been the darling of tech companies like Google looking to bring complex computer vision processing to their devices. Movidius has largely been looking specifically at drones, AR/VR tech, and video surveillance devices, hoping to add utility to the devices but also redefine the autonomy of the devices. With security camera, Movidius wants the devices to do more than record situations but to actively monitor what it is constantly seeing. “Ultimately, what we are all trying to do is get in a mode where you prevent things from happening,” said El-Ouazzane. Movidius is selling this tech direct to manufacturers and says that many of the video surveillance companies they’ve talked to are seeing this as an opportunity to pursue a SaaS business model whereby they add-on computer vision recognition for a monthly fee. The Myriad 2 will be initially be integrated into select product lines—the partnership has already yielded a product that is “ready for market.” Movidius also teased that it has several other deals in the works with leading video surveillance companies. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Movidius Founded 2006 Overview Movidius is a vision processor company that designs compact, high-performance, ultralow power, computational imaging and vision processing chips, software, development tools and reference designs.

He said to date 29 large companies in the country, including Sunway Group, Maybank Group, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Digi Telecommunications and Johnson & Johnson, are adopting FWA, up from 21 last year. Firms that adopted FWA also better retained their female employees and enhanced the involvement of disabled groups such as people with disabilities and special needs, he said, adding the Government also offered a range of initiatives to firms adopting FWA, including multiple tax credits. Nine companies bagged a LIFE@WORK 2016 award for making FWA a business strategy. Maybank Group won the Platinum Award, while other winners included Digi Telecommunications (Best Malaysian Organisation), Intel Malaysia (Best International Organisation), Johnson & Johnson (Best Lean Organisation), Gamuda Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (Best Incentive), Chong Chye Neo of IBM Malaysia (CEO Champion) and Sunway Group (Sutainable Practices) and Starbucks Coffee Co (Innovative Practices).

Blog Qualcomm-NXP: Another Testosterone-Driven Deal? Bolaji Ojo 10/24/2016 10:43 AM EDT  5 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Hard questions are arising. It comes back to finding the justification for this deal. Does this deal really make sense for Qualcomm? Acquisitions used to be closely guarded events held behind closed doors with severe penalties for any leakages to even news organizations. Not anymore. The semiconductor industry has known for several weeks now that Qualcomm Inc. wants to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductor N.V. A deal could be announced this week, turning Qualcomm overnight into the largest supplier of chips to the global automotive industry and the world’s third largest chip company behind Intel and Samsung. Talk of a Qualcomm-NXP deal comes in the wake of historic consolidation amid a sense of urgency to improve operational competitiveness in a maturing landscape. Initial speculations from a Wall Street Journal report were that Qualcomm would pay about $30 billion for NXP but the target’s market value has since shot up above $36 billion. Qualcomm, if it wants NXP, must now be ready to pay between $37 billion and $40 billion, according to analysts. Such an offer would eclipse the $37 billion Avago paid for Broadcom and the $30 billion SoftBank shelled out for ARM Holdings Plc. The price may not matter. Investors and shareholders have been applauding the news by jacking up both parties’ stock prices, and the deal could benefit both companies.   For its part, Qualcomm would get a much more diversified revenue base and expand its exposure to the more reliably predictable automotive industry and away from the fickle, though lucrative, consumer electronics market. (Source: Qualcomm) Whether hype may be pushing valuations today is a question few any longer ask in today’s exuberant, cash-flush corporate environment. American companies, especially, have hundreds of billions of dollars locked up in overseas accounts, yielding minimal returns. Bankers and analysts, too, are pushing for ever larger deals and encouraging companies to use cash hoards for acquisitions. In such an environment, hype and ego cannot be ruled out. It may even be evident in NXP’s market value, which has shot up more than 43 percent in the last year with a large percentage of the increase happening only since September 29. (Source: NXP) The deal could cap a long career for NXP’s president and CEO, Richard Clemmer, who at 64 years old has led or engineered some of the industry’s more interesting acquisitions and spin-offs. On the other hand, Qualcomm’s younger executives, Paul Jacobs (54), executive chairman, and Steve Mollenkopf, CEO, get to add an admirable record to their professional resumes. The Qualcomm-NXP deal is not any different from events in the larger economy, though. News broke last weekend that AT&T had struck a deal to pay $85.4 billion for Time Warner, more than double the value of what’s been projected as the semiconductor industry’s largest transaction. In today’s testosterone-infused world of mega-mergers and bloated executive egos, even the staid semiconductor market has gone into overdrive with its own raft of ever-larger deals that boggle the mind in both their complexities and the premium demanded by sellers and agreed to by buyers. Complex integration When the dust of the transaction settles, Qualcomm must deal with certain realities, top of which would be the complexities inherent in purchasing a European semiconductor supplier that is itself still assimilating a large acquisition. In December, NXP closed the $12 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductor, a North American automotive IC rival. The integration of Freescale into NXP continues even today, however, and will take years as the company noted in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: The Merger involved the integration of two companies that previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations. We are devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating the companies … We expect the full integration process to take several years, with the initial focus on management consolidation and process integration. Work streams are underway in all of our business lines and the support functions. Integration activities that likely will have a multi-year horizon include, but are not limited to, harmonizing brands, product and vendor selections, system integration and supply chain integration. Warning statements like the one above are usually buried in obligatory regulatory reports and do not figure prominently in public discussions. Qualcomm knows it must grapple with the difficult task of absorbing an enterprise with a vastly different business model operating in a different cultural environment and with a large presence in a market with starkly different dynamics. The company will also have to enter market segments where it has limited experience and initiate into a fabless manufacturing environment a company that has numerous production facilities spread all over the world. How will history judge this union and will the payoff for Qualcomm investors justify this investment?

I see your point. Definitely, the automotive industry is getting into the uncharted territory where the sales of their cars -- over the long run -- will decline. Qualcomm/NXP, however, isn't giving up. They want to be a player in the new kind of more software-driven, connected automotive market.

The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, (at)NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the (at)NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group -- or at least he -- sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet -- closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats -- that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ------ Bajak reported from Houston.

So here is what NOT to expect from Microsoft’s Windows 10 event: Surface Pro 5 and Book 2 Microsoft will be introducing the Surface AIO at the event — however, don’t expect to see a new Surface Pro or a new Surface Book device at the event. The Surface Pro 4 and Book are only about a year old, so it would be a bit pointless to introduce major upgrades to the devices at the moment. Therefore, we will likely see the new Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 arrive sometime in early 2017 alongside the release of Windows 10 Redstone 2. Needless to say, we don’t really know what exactly Microsoft will have up its sleeves for the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2. Microsoft will obviously pack Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors in these devices, and the design will likely get tweaked, too. Interestingly enough, Microsoft is allegedly dropping the hinge gap on the Surface Book 2 — which is something a lot of Surface Book users weren’t a fan of. Microsoft Band 3 There has been a couple of rumors and leaks about the Microsoft Band 3 recently. Unfortunately though, there probably won’t be any new Microsoft Band devices introduced this year. A Microsoft spokesperson recently confirmed that the company has no plans to release another Band device this year, stating: “We have sold through our existing Band 2 inventory and have no plans to release another Band device this year. We remain committed to supporting our Microsoft Band 2 customers through Microsoft Stores and our customer support channels and will continue to invest in the Microsoft Health platform, which is open to all hardware and apps partners across Windows, iOS, and Android devices.” Microsoft Band 3 reportedly included a waterproof design, EKG sensor, as well as a thinner design. It is still unknown why Microsoft decided not to launch a new Band device this year, and we aren’t quite sure if there will be any other Band device next year. Surface Phone There won’t be any Surface Phone at Microsoft’s Windows 10 event, and that is quite obvious. Microsoft is reportedly working on a Surface Phone, but the device may not see the light of the day until Spring 2017 or even 2018. Needless to mention, there aren’t any details on the Surface Phone’s hardware but we will likely start hearing about that sometime next year. Do keep in mind that this may not be 100% accurate, Microsoft may surprise us just like they did last year with the Surface Book. We’ll be covering the event live from New York City, so make sure to keep an eye on the site this Wednesday! Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

As rumored the new MacBook Pro will arrive in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes with an OLED touch bar (perhaps called the Magic Toolbar), Touch ID, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and a butterfly keyboard design. Our new predictions also include: (1) Intel’s (US) Skylake processor; (2) the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel; (3) a new option of 2TB SSD storage capacity; (4) adoption of a similar processor as Apple Watch to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models; and (5) a Type-C & MagSafe-like adapter rolled out by Apple or a third-party supplier, given positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. Kuo also says Apple will introduce a 13-inch Macbook. Its unclear if this is a larger version of the Macbook or if its a new MacBook Air. Recent reports have suggested that Apple plans to drop the 11-inch MacBook Air and just update the 13-inch version. Despite hopes that Apple would update the iMac and release a new 5K monitor, Kuo says they are not ready yet. We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent. Apple's 'hello again' Mac event is being held on Thursday at 10:00AM PT. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

(NASDAQ: AMD). The company posted its financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2016 (Q3 FY16) on October 20, 2016. The Chipmaker reported a second successive quarter of higher sales, bolstered by higher demand for graphics chips used in gaming consoles. Register with us now for your free membership at:&nbsp;http://www.activewallst.com/register/. Today, AWS is promoting its earnings coverage on AMD; touching on stocks like MSFT, SNE and BABA. Get our free coverage by signing up to: http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=AMD http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=SNE Earnings Reviewed For the three months ended on September 24th, 2016, AMD reported revenue of $1.31 billion, up 23% year-over-year from $1.06 billion, primarily due to record semi-custom SoC and higher GPU and mobile APU sales, partially offset by client desktop processor and chipset sales. The company’s revenue rose above analysts’ average estimates of $1.21 billion. For Q3 2016, AMD’s net loss widened to $406 million, or $0.50 per share, from $197 million, or $0.25 per share, a year earlier. The decline was driven by a $340 million Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) charge and a $61 million loss on debt redemption offset by increased revenue. The company reported Non-GAAP net income of $27 million, or $0.03 per share. AMD, the second biggest supplier of PC processors following Intel Corp., has reported four consecutive years of losses. Revenue by Discipline For Q3 FY16, AMD’s computing and Graphics’ segment posted revenue of $472 million, up 9% sequentially and 11% from Q3 2015. The improvement in sales was attributed to increased sales of GPUs, offset by decreased sales of client desktop processors and chipsets. The year-over-year increase was also driven by sales growth in client mobile processors. Client average selling price (ASP) decreased sequentially driven by lower mobile and desktop processor ASPs and was flat year-over-year. The company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment’s revenue surged 41% sequentially and 31% on a y-o-y basis to $835 million due to higher sales of semi-custom SoCs. Both Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE) have announced launch of new version of their consoles with AMD enabled chips. Microsoft introduced the Xbox One S and Sony announced a new version of PS4, as well as the PS4 Pro with support for 4K gameplay, both powered by AMD semi-custom SoCs. Operating-Metrics For Q3 2016, AMD’s gross margin was 5% down from 31% from Q2 2016 due to a $340 million charge related to the 6th amendment to the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Non-GAAP gross margin of 31% was flat quarter-over-quarter. The company reported operating expenses of $376 million, compared to $353 million for Q2 2016. Q3 2016 Highlights On October 14th, 2016, AMD announced a deal to provide its graphics processing units to Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA). Through the partnership, Alibaba Cloud plans to use AMD technology to help expand its cloud computing offerings and accelerate adoption of its cloud-based services. During the reported quarter AMD completed capital markets transactions that raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, before issuance costs, to lower overall debt, reduce interest expense payments, and further support growing business opportunities. Current Outlook For Q4 2016, AMD expects revenue to decrease 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%. The midpoint of guidance would result in Q4 2016 revenue increasing approximately 12% on y-o-y basis and 2016 revenue increasing 6% from 2015. Cash Flow &amp; Balance Sheet As of September 24th, 2-16, AMD had cash and cash equivalents worth $1.26 billion, up $301 million from the end of the prior quarter. The quarter-end cash balance includes approximately $274 million of net proceeds from recent capital markets transactions. Total debt at the end of Q3 2016 was $1.63 billion, down $606 million from the prior quarter as a result of the timing and execution of Q3 2016 debt reduction actions and due to bifurcation of the newly issued 2.125% Convertible Notes due 2026 into equity and liability components based on GAAP accounting regulations. Stock Performance Last Friday, the stock closed the trading session at $6.52, tumbling 6.32% from its previous closing price of $6.96. A total volume of 64.15 million shares have exchanged hands, which was higher than the 3-month average volume of 39.10 million shares. Advanced Micro Devices’ stock price advanced 2.35% in the last month and 88.99% in the previous six months. Furthermore, on a year to date basis, the stock surged 127.18%.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Samsung still clueless over Galaxy Note7 explosion; will it cause delay in Galaxy S8 launch? Investigations into Samsung's Galaxy Note7 explosions may push the launch of the Galaxy S8 to March. Rohit KVN   October 24, 2016 13:33 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Will Samsung Galaxy Note7 explosions cause delay in Galaxy S8 launch? In Picture: A customer tries out a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 at Seoul, South Korea, October 10, 2016.Reuters It has been over two weeks since Samsung killed the flagship phablet Galaxy Note7, as the replaced models started exploding in several regions. It is now being held that Samsung might have jumped the gun by suspending the sale and production of the Galaxy Note7, as it is yet to find conclusive reason behind the device's explosion.

Based on preliminary investigations, the company announced the global recall of 2.5 million units and commenced an exchange programme. However, within days of the re-launch of the Galaxy Note7 on October 1 in the United States, South Korea and China, replaced devices thought to be housing safe batteries also caught fire. Considering the severity of the issue, Samsung decided to permanently suspend the sale and production of the Galaxy Note7. More than two weeks later, Samsung is still struggling to find the cause of the explosion fiasco. The company has now signed up R&D engineers from the Galaxy S8 development division, the Wall Street Journal reported.  This move has apparently stalled the development of the Galaxy S8 series by almost two weeks. And if it fails to find any leads in the investigation, the new generation flagship smartphone may not get unveiled at MWC (Mobile World Congress) in Barcelona in February 2017. Samsung Galaxy S8: What we know so far Samsung Galaxy S8 is said to come in two variants, similar to the Galaxy S7 series — one having flat display panel and another with dual-edge curved screen. The major improvements expected in the Galaxy S8 are in terms of security, camera and RAM capacity. The company is expected to incorporate Iris scanner on the front, dual cameras (12MP+13MP) placed in parallel positions on the back and 6GB/8GB RAM. It is said to be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 or by 10nm (nanometer)-based Samsun Exynos processor, depending on the region of sale. Since Samsung is yet to find out the glitch in the Galaxy Note7, the company has reportedly asked LG to supply the batteries for the Galaxy S8. Watch this space for more updates.

According to Mac Rumors, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed a new research report predicting Apple’s plans for their upcoming event this October. Apparently, the analyst found viable data that provided enough basis for predictions on Apple’s “Hello Again” event on Thursday, October 27. hello again #apple #appleevent #helloagain #mac #macbook #macbookpro #macbookair #imac #macpro #macos #ipad #ipadpro #ios #ios101 © pic.twitter.com/VkIC4gRy9I — FabienW  (@FabienWannerOFF) October 19, 2016 The report indicated that Apple will be using the event to introduce a new MacBook Pro as well as a 13-inch MacBook which is most likely the rumored MacBook Air Kuo has previously predicted. Apple Event Predictions: Re-Designed MacBook Pro and MacBook Air According to Kuo, the Apple event on Thursday will showcase a redesigned MacBook Pro which would come in 13-inch and 15-inch variants with the additional features of an OLED touch bar, a Touch ID sensor, a USB-C port, and Thunderbolt 3 matched with its 2015 butterfly keyboard design. He also added a couple of other details into the report which you may find interesting. Kuo’s predictions put Intel’s Skylake processor under the hood of Apple’s MacBook Pro together with “the same panel resolution but better display quality and energy efficiency thanks to an oxide panel.” The MacBook Pro is expected to be much lighter and thinner than its predecessor. Kuo said it is also possible for Apple to adopt a similar processor powering the Apple Watch “to control the OLED touch bar more energy-efficiently in the new MacBook Pro models.” Potential #MacBookPro #OLED function row names incl. Magic Toolbar, Control Strip, Touch Bar https://t.co/3Al2c72CL4 pic.twitter.com/VByZE8m96O — AppleInsider (@appleinsider) October 20, 2016 Finally, he said that the Cupertino-based company might also include a Type-C and MagSafe-like adapter to take advantage of positive reviews for the MagSafe charging design. However, it is not sure whether Apple itself will be providing the adapter. Aside from MacBook Pro, Kuo also expects Apple to introduce a “13-inch MacBook” that is most probably Apple’s rumored MacBook Air that is updated to include USB-C ports. This device, according to another article from Mac Rumors, will reportedly be taking the entry-level slot of Apple’s laptop family because of its comparatively low price. RELATED ARTICLES New MacBook Air: What’s Next For Apple’s 13-Inch Laptop? 2017 Model Release Date, Specs And More New MacBook Pro 2016 Rumors: Release Date To Be Revealed Next Week Confirms Analyst MacBook Pro 2016: Apple Event In October, Release Date And Rumors New iMac 2016 Update Rumors: Release Date And Specs For Apple’s Latest All-In-One No iMacs Or Display Yet While Kuo is positive about the launch of the MacBook laptops on Thursday, he is not confident that Apple will be able to manage to introduce the highly anticipated iMacs and display. Apparently, the iMacs and Cinema Display are being developed but will not be finished in time for delivery should it be unveiled during this week’s Apple event. “We also expect Apple to launch new iMacs (21.5-inch and 27-inch) and Cinema Display (27-inch) in mid- 1H17. We cannot say for certain whether Apple will announce the new iMacs and Cinema Display on October 27 as the shipping schedule is not imminent.” Because of this, the analyst strongly believes that Apple will be scheduling the release of these devices during the first half of 2017 at the earliest. Previously, rumors emerged about the new iMacs slated for release in October 2016 based on a Best Buy leak about an advanced warning of imminent early release as reported by Apple Insider. What is interesting about this leak is the processor for Apple’s all-in-one which, based on the report, would most probably be Intel’s seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” Core i7 chip. Of course, there are speculations and predictions which cannot be confirmed if true unless we watch Apple’s “Hello Again” event at 1 p.m. ET on Thursday, October 27. Live streaming will be available via Apple’s official website.

No-one would lend him money to hire staff or pay for office space, so Idaresit spent eight months hustling the streets of Lagos, trying to convince clients his plan to help them develop online campaigns was a winner. “During those first eight months, I didn’t make a dime … I was demoralised. At some point I wondered if it was worth it,” Idaresit told Reuters by telephone from his Lagos office. It took a money-back guarantee before a baby products retailer gave Idaresit a break with a $250 contract to develop the shop’s online presence. Within two months, the retailer’s revenue began growing by $1,000 per month. Then it hit $100,000. Idaresit’s firm, Wild Fusions, is now a Google Adwords partner valued at $20 million, with revenues doubling year-on-year. It helps brands like Samsung, Unilever, and Ecobank develop online marketing strategies for African audiences. Wild Fusion’s struggles are typical for startups in Africa, as the world’s poorest continent wakes up slowly to the opportunities of technology. In other emerging markets like Asia and Latin America, a tech startup with a smart idea in a booming economy might expect to attract investor interest, especially if competition is slim. Business leaders and investors said the sector in Africa is held back by lower internet penetration as well as scarcity of early stage capital and a lack of management expertise. Many startups in the region are caught in a Catch 22 situation, said Churchill Mambe Nanje, who launched an online job search engine in Cameroon called Njorku. “To hire the best talent to develop a startup, you need capital. Finding capital is hard because you need to have a track record and a viable product but to get those, you need capital,” said Nanje, whose company has been profiled by Forbes Magazine as one of Africa’s best startups. INTERNET USE LOW Part of the problem for African tech startups is that internet use, despite mushrooming in the past decade, is low. Only 16 percent of Africa’s 1 billion people use the Internet, half the rate in Asia Pacific and below a global average of 36 percent, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) says. The information and community technology sector contributed just 7 percent to the continent’s GDP last year, according to an African Development Bank report. Economic gains from rising internet usage are likely to be strong. For every 10-percentage point rise in broadband internet penetration, economic growth increases by 1.4 percentage points, according to the World Bank. Experts say information and communication technology could help Africa overcome infrastructure inadequacies, satisfy rising consumer demand, boost regional trade and diversify economies, ending reliance on raw materials. But the problem is affordability. In its 2013 report, the ITU said that, though Africa has one the highest mobile broadband growth rates, services cost between a fifth and half of average income compared to just two to five percent in other developing countries. In South Africa, the strength of the tech sector reflects the country’s relative affluence. It has produced several billion-dollar companies, some of which have been snapped up by international tech giants. In East Africa, Kenyan tech has also seen rapid growth. One highlight is mobile money transfer system M-Pesa, launched by the country’s largest telecoms operator Safaricom. M-Pesa has enabled 67 percent of Kenyan adults to access banking. Its transactions total about $1 billion per month. Revenue from M-pesa rose 20 percent to 12.50 Billion Kenyan shillings in the first half of 2013. West Africa’s tech sector lags in terms of prominence and investment, experts say. It needs better and cheaper internet access and broader adoption of smartphones. In Ghana, a booming regional economy, the number of mobile phone subscriptions roughly equals the population but only 3.5 percent of the population is online, according to Kwaku Sakyi-Addo, CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications. DEVELOPMENT FINANCE The scarcity and costliness of finance also impedes success. Banks in Ghana can charge up to 28 percent interest for a business loan. Venture capital firms like Intel Capital, JPMorgan, Summit Partners and Rocket Internet have occasionally financed African ICT firms but business leaders said the sector needs much broader sources of finance. In Silicon Valley, startups can receive up to $2 million from a range of funders including venture capital firms, ‘angel’ investors and private equity houses, according to Marcin Hejka, a regional managing director for Intel Capital. Such a financial ecosystem does not yet exist in Africa, he says. Ghana’s Rancard, which distributes Gmail SMS services on 55 mobile networks in Africa and beyond, received funding from Adlevo Capital and Intel Capital but its CEO recognises it was one of the lucky few. “There are not enough early-stage tech venture capital funds available for Africa,” Kofi Dadzie said. One reason for the lack of funding is the risks investors face, said Maurizio Caio, founder of UK venture capital firm TLcom Capital. Few tech entrepreneurs in Africa have a long track record to attract investors, said Caio. Crucially, there are hardly any examples of investors successfully exiting via an IPO or a sale, partly due to underdeveloped capital markets across the region. One exception is Fundamo, a mobile financial services provider in Cape Town bought by Visa in 2011 for $110 million. Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria have companies that could be ready for investment, Caio said: “It’s earlier stage. It’s smaller stuff, which means riskier, which means even less capital for these guys and even more of a gamble.” INCUBATORS Experts say it is too soon to tell if African tech will rival other emerging markets but a concerted effort is being made to build an infrastructure to facilitate expansion. Kenya’s iHub started in 2010 with backing from Hivos, Google and Omidyar Network as a meeting place for entrepreneurs and investors. It has spawned around 50 companies. Another East African example is the Savannah Fund which offers $25,000-$500,000 to startups in exchange for equity. In Ghana, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology gives students one year of training by professionals from around the world who volunteer to teach software development and entrepreneurship. The best graduates get an extra year at a tech incubator in a house linked to the main campus by a rope bridge. “The vision of the institution is to create jobs and wealth locally here in Africa,” said its CEO Jorn Lyseggen. When the right idea with the right backing meets a hungry market, a start-up can grow fast, as the experience of Nigerian online retailers Jumia shows. Founded by two Nigerian Harvard Business School graduates, the business has benefited from Internet penetration in Nigeria of nearly 30 percent and a dearth of middle class retail outlets in the continent’s most populous nation. Jumia is growing at 20 percent per month, orders have jumped from $50-$100 per day to millions of dollars per month and it plans to expand beyond Nigeria, said Sacha Poignonnec, Co-CEO of Africa Internet Holding, one of Jumia’s backer. “The same way the mobile companies came in to leapfrog landlines, the same way mobile banking in East Africa is leapfrogging traditional banking, we see e-commerce as a way to leapfrog traditional brick and mortar retail here,” said Tunde Kehinde, one of Jumia’s founders.

Researchers at the State University of New York at Binghamton have identified a flaw in Intel's Haswell processors that allows malware to circumvent the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by using a side-channel attack on the Branch Target Buffer (BTB). ASLR typically protects the system from malicious attacks by randomizing the offset of program segments in virtual memory. Randomizing the offset prevents an attacker from learning the locations of code pages in the program's address space, which would allow an exploit to redirect the control flow and assume control of the application. Almost all operating systems for the desktop use ASLR, including Linux, Windows, OS X, and even on iOS and Android. The scheme attacks the BTB, which stores the history of branch addresses to optimize future branch predictions. As such, it stores the actual addresses that ASLR protects, and the code can ferret out the addresses by creating BTB collisions. The attack ultimately identifies the locations of the kernel and user-level applications so that it can use the data to assume control of the application/system. The researchers used a Linux-based PC with a Haswell processor to test the technique and were able to bypass ASLR in 60 milliseconds. The attack is likely widely applicable on the hardware side, as many processor architectures operate on similar principles. A wide spate of operating systems use ASLR, which broadens the attack surface. The attack is sophisticated (it isn't something that a script-kiddie could pull off), but the proliferation of state actors on the international stage, particularly for spying purposes and sabotage, could make this sort of attack yet another powerful tool in the hacking toolbox.     stevevnicks View Public Profile Find all posts by stevevnicks     (#2) er557 Master Guru   Videocard: 780ti sli, vanilla Processor: i7 5820k 3.5ghz stock Mainboard: msi x99s gaming 7 Memory: 32gb gskill 2400mhz Soundcard: sb Z PSU: zalman 1k gvm 10-23-2016, 12:19 | posts: 314 YAAAwwn...... moving along, nothing to see here critical flaw / shmitical shmow.....     er557 View Public Profile Find all posts by er557   (#3) stevevnicks Maha Guru     Videocard: MSI R9 390X Gaming Processor: i7 4770 Mainboard: ROG Maximus Hero VI Memory: 16g Corsair 1866 vengence Soundcard: Blaster Z PSU: Corsair RM850 10-23-2016, 19:33 | posts: 1,326 | Location: Suffolk Quote: Originally Posted by er557 YAAAwwn...... moving along, nothing to see here critical flaw / shmitical shmow..... move on if it don't apply to you, but do you speak for everyone nah, just ya self, not me ya don't, just thought I share info for people who would like to know. still if you like showing your arrogance your doing a stella job with post's like that, keep it up, good work and very informative of the type of arrogant chap you really are lol some mothers do ave em.     stevevnicks View Public Profile Find all posts by stevevnicks   (#4) mbk1969 Ancient Guru   Videocard: GeForce GTX 970 Processor: I7-4930 Mainboard: Asus p9x79 Memory: G Skill RipjawZ, 16GB Soundcard: Onboard + FiiO E17 PSU: 1000 W 10-23-2016, 21:50 | posts: 2,765 | Location: Moscow, Russia One thing is putting the test on the local machine (especially acting as administrator account) and another thing is injecting the code (to exploit mentioned flaw) remotely. Only kernel mode code has access to all CPU instructions, and I suspect that user mode code unable to do such things as BTB side-channel attack. Also note that ASLR in Windows can be turned off completely, and turned on either on system or process (opt-in) level.     mbk1969 View Public Profile Find all posts by mbk1969     (#5) thatguy91 Ancient Guru   Videocard: XFX RX 480 RS 4 GB Processor: i5-3570K Mainboard: Asrock Z77 Extreme6 Memory: DDR3-2400 2x8GB Soundcard: ALC898 + Microlab FC-730 PSU: Enermax Platimax 750W 10-24-2016, 06:38 | posts: 5,964 | Location: Australia It could possibly be fixed with a microcode update anyway, if motherboard companies are bothered updating their bioses if one does become available.

I am able to boot with the drive into the Windows install process, however, when I go to select my partitioned disk and hit next to begin copying files, I cannot because it displays this error: "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks." Now, I specifically partitioned the disk using Shift F10 and Diskpart because I do not want the 100 MB System Reserved partition for Bitlocker (or whatever). Sevenforums.com says if you do not want this partition, you need to have a fully partitioned disk to start the install on. (http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials...ndows-7-a.html) And I can vouch for this as I've done it multiple times over the years re-installing Windows 7 (when installing from the dvd). But it's not working here. AND if you go back into Diskpart and try to convert to GPT, you first have to wipe the drive with the 'clean' command, which results in an unallocated disk to install onto, and your back where you started, with the 100 MB System Reserved partition. Can somebody please help me out of this endless maze? I don't even know if the Gigabyte drivers will work yet as I've still not even gotten into windows mode, ....and I just...want...to...start...playing BF1.... edit: the new hardware I am installing to is an i7 6700 cpu, and Gigabyte GA-Z170x- UD3 board with 16GB Corsair Vengeance 3200 RAM.

That works - successfully converted to GPT disk. However, that results in an unallocated disk, which presents the original problem. So after typing convert gpt, I then type 'create part primary', and then 'format fs=ntfs quick', and finally, ' assign', then go back and refresh the disk in the prompt, the error at the bottom is no longer displayed (and the accompanying popup). But when I hit Next, it gives me: "Setup was unable to create a new partition or locate an existing system partition.

Anyways, ideally with modern systems it is designed for Windows 10 in mind, you boot straight with UEFI without using compatibility mode. Basically this means booting natively to 64-bit. Even though your new computer is UEFI, it allows the emulation of bios to boot in the old bios method and through to MBR. You can't really be upset too much by this, because your current computer is UEFI as well! You don't really want to set the disk up in MBR only mode. If you upgrade to Windows 10 later, and regardless of what you may think now you probably will, ideally you want it in GPT. If you boot Windows setup in UEFI, you have to install to GPT. If you boot Windows setup in bios mode, you can only install to MBR. In UEFI mode, all you need to do is copy the Windows files to the USB drive and it will boot (nice, hey!). For bios boot mode, you have to do set the installation media up the 'old fashioned' way. Now, back to the disk you are installing to. You set it up as MBR. You need to run clean on the SSD, run 'convert to GPT', and go from there. I would strongly recommend against setting the partitions up manually, just let Windows setup do it. Just keep in mind that you probably won't be able to get the most out of your new system with Windows 7.

If you upgrade to Windows 10 later, and regardless of what you may think now you probably will, ideally you want it in GPT. If you boot Windows setup in UEFI, you have to install to GPT. If you boot Windows setup in bios mode, you can only install to MBR. In UEFI mode, all you need to do is copy the Windows files to the USB drive and it will boot (nice, hey!). For bios boot mode, you have to do set the installation media up the 'old fashioned' way. Now, back to the disk you are installing to. You set it up as MBR. You need to run clean on the SSD, run 'convert to GPT', and go from there. I would strongly recommend against setting the partitions up manually, just let Windows setup do it. Just keep in mind that you probably won't be able to get the most out of your new system with Windows 7. First off, I agree, I don't want to set up in MBR only mode - in fact I don't care at all what mode the disk is, so long as I can set it up the way I've been doing it for the past 6-7 years. And if I do eventually decide (or am forced) to get W10, I will definitely not be doing it via upgrade; fresh install without a doubt. So the ease of that transition is not a factor for me. Now, when I do as you say, and convert to GPT, yes it will let me install to the disk, but then I will get the useless 100mb partition that contains my boot files, and I cant remove. I do not want that. I don't understand why I now HAVE to do it that way, when I never did before using this same exact process. And why the system doesn't even give a good reason why it won't work, simply, "Setup was unable to create a new partition or locate an existing system partition." I mean, what does that even mean?

Windows 7 is UEFI aware but not fully compatible with all features. Secure boot should be disabled and compatibility support module should be enabled.     mbk1969 View Public Profile Find all posts by mbk1969   (#13) nanogenesis Maha Guru   Videocard: MSI R9 390X 1178|6350 Processor: Intel i7-4930k @ 4.8Ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte X79-UD7 Memory: 32Gb 2418Mhz CR+KS Soundcard: PSU: Corsair TX850V2 10-24-2016, 10:18 | posts: 1,288 | Location: China Quote: Originally Posted by Brogan I've spent the last 22 hours trying to do that (set non-UEFI) with this BIOS.

Rufus gives me two options, a UEFI and non-UEFI. To be safe, just go with an NTFS partition, since GPT installation will never work from an NTFS partition.     nanogenesis View Public Profile Find all posts by nanogenesis   (#14) thatguy91 Ancient Guru   Videocard: XFX RX 480 RS 4 GB Processor: i5-3570K Mainboard: Asrock Z77 Extreme6 Memory: DDR3-2400 2x8GB Soundcard: ALC898 + Microlab FC-730 PSU: Enermax Platimax 750W 10-24-2016, 12:07 | posts: 5,964 | Location: Australia Basically this whole discussion is over 100 MB! I believe with UEFI you don't have a choice since that is where the boot information is stored. For the most part people could delete this with Windows 7 since most installations used MBR.

Took out the USB drive, put the disc back in, changed nothing in the BIOS settings.... formatted and partitioned it in Diskpart, refreshed the prompt and installed the OS with no issue, no MBR or GPT nonsense... using the method I have for years. No 100mb boot partition, no problem.

Picture taken April 22, 2016. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson A little over a year ago, Microsoft revealed the Surface Book, which the company claimed was the “ultimate laptop.” With another big event coming this week, the world is waiting in anticipation for an update on the Surface Book 2, which will only take the line of devices even further. The lower-end option of the original Surface Book, which sells for $1,899, has an Intel Skylake dual-core processor, Windows 10 pre-installed and Surface Pen compatibility. What truly set it apart from its competitors, however, was the detachable screen. By paying an extra $600, users could take advantage of the Nvidia discrete GPU as well. READ: Microsoft Surface Phone release date, news & update: Top specs & features fans would love to see The equation was promising, but there is definite room for improvement. As TechRadar noted, there are problems with the Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge, which forms a gap whenever the device is closed. The screen/tablet portion of the Surface Book -- called the Clipboard -- also has a weak battery. These issues will definitely be addressed by Microsoft in the next generation of the 2-in-1 Surface Book, especially the battery issue. The Clipboard had a standard battery life of just four hours on its own and eight hours while connected to the base. As one major selling point of the unit is its ability to be used as a tablet, the Redmond-based company will definitely be working to improve this. The publication states the the public can expect a better screen as well. The one on the current unit has a 3000x2000 resolution, so the upcoming Surface Book 2 could sport a screen with 3840x2160 pixel resolution. Furthermore, there have been rumours claiming that the Kaby Lake processor from Intel will power the unit, giving it support for 4K videos and 3D graphics READ: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, news & update: October launch a big possibility The potential of the device is exactly why the public is generally itching for the Surface Book 2. However, Microsoft has not officially stated that the unit will make an appearance during its event on Oct. 26.

Partially redacted minutes of the May 13 meeting were released to the Irish Independent under freedom of information laws. Three Intel executives met with Mr Mulligan and another official at the Jobs Department. They discussed the pre-existing Action Plan for Jobs and a department official noted Intel "see driving the broadband commitments as being a crucial issue". The Programme for Government commits to bringing next generation broadband to every house and business in the country by 2020. There have already been delays in the start of building work for the National Broadband Plan. A section of the minutes entitled 'costs/competitiveness issues' is mostly blacked out as it is said to be "commercially sensitive". One bullet point does note that Intel is "happy" with the quality of Irish graduates. The company could not tell the Government if there would be compulsory redundancies in Ireland on the back of global restructuring announced in April. The Intel executives said they expected them to be "largely voluntary" but it would depend on the uptake of the voluntary scheme around the world. A department spokeswoman confirmed it still did not have details of the precise number of redundancies here. An Intel spokeswoman said it had not publicly disclosed the number of redundancies made around the world "and will not be doing so". She said it employed about 5,200 people in Ireland. Intel is worth €1bn to the economy, according to a report by accountancy firm PwC quoted in the minutes.

Speaking at the company’s annual sports day in Hsinchu, TSMC chairman Morris Chang (張忠謀) said that the company will distribute the bonuses as a reward for employees’ contributions to the firm. More than 36,000 employees who started working for TSMC before May 31 will receive NT$12,000 bonuses, Chang said. Eligible employees include production line workers, engineers and technicians, as well as administrative personnel. TSMC posted a record profit of NT$96.76 billion in the third quarter, up 33.4 percent from the previous quarter and 28.4 percent from a year earlier. The company said it is counting on a pool of talented personnel and high-end technologies to stay competitive in the global market. Chang said TSMC will continue to focus on its contract chipmaking business and defend its No. 1 position amid intensifying competition from rival companies such as Intel Corp, Samsung Electronics Co and some Chinese firms. Chang said he has faith in TSMC’s efforts to develop the 10-nanometer process technology, which Samsung has also been developing. He said that TSMC is expected to surpass Samsung in the 10-nanometer process development by moving more quickly than the South Korean firm. TSMC last year launched the commercial production of chips using the 16-nanometer process technology and is to begin mass production of chips based on the 10-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of next year. The company is planning to start commercial production of chips by adopting the more advanced 7-nanometer process technology in the first quarter of 2018. Analysts said TSMC might dominate the global 7-nanometer market in 2018, increasing the odds that it will secure all of the orders placed by Apple Inc for new iPhone models to be unveiled that year. Chang said TSMC has been riding a wave of solid demand in the global smartphone market, adding that the company’s shipments could peak in the second and third quarters of next year after a slow season in the first quarter. As for China’s move to develop its own contract chipmaking industry by expanding production capacity, Chang said TSMC expects the competition to intensify, but due to its strong lead in advanced technology development, it will continue to dominate the global market. Meanwhile, Chang said the global economy is expected to improve next year, even though it is haunted by uncertainty from the UK’s exit from the EU, a possible rate hike by the US Federal Reserve and a slowdown in China’s economy. The IMF earlier this month forecast that the global economy will grow 3.4 percent next year after an estimated increase of 3.1 percent this year. This story has been viewed 1662 times.

Skip to content Tech Take Software technology explained – Alok Ashtikar Menu About Symmetric multi-processing, multi-threading and synchronisation explained alokashtikarOctober 13, 2016October 13, 2016Uncategorized Post navigation Previous Nowadays we have computers and phones equipped with multi-core processors. These computers can actually perform multiple computations in parallel. All the cores or processors share the same memory (RAM) and IO bus. The operating system is able to schedule work on different cores simultaneously. This is called symmetric multi processing (SMP). Programs take advantage of SMP. With the help of the operating system, the programs distribute computation to multiple cores, and bring down the overall execution time by a huge factor. The operating system, and programming language features play a huge role in making SMP available to programmers. The intension of this post is to delve deep and understand how the language features, operating system and hardware architecture enables use of SMP in applications. If one is already well versed in multi-threaded application programming, he/she may skip directly to “Understanding SMP hardware architecture“. Multi-threaded applications Each task that a process performs is a series of operations. The processing of these series of operations is called execution of a thread. A process can distribute tasks to multiple threads. It creates threads by calling a function exposed by the operating system. The operating system creates, manages and schedules threads. It does this for all the applications and services running on it. The operating system usually ends up creating a much larger number of threads than the number of cores on the computer. To be able to handle so many threads, each core has to serve multiple threads. The operating system assigns a thread to be executed on a core for some time, and then uses the same core for another thread. This process is called scheduling, and the duration for which a thread is assigned to a processor / core is called a time slice. When the time slice for a thread is over, it is pre-empted (taken off the processor) and put aside for scheduling. Whenever the thread gets another time slice for itself, it resumes from where it had been pre-empted in the last run. This post will cover the issues related to a single process using multiple threads. Applications use multiple threads mainly to: decrease effective time needed for huge computations increase responsiveness to external events such as: user input messages from other systems Such applications are called multi-threaded applications. Programming multi-threaded applications is considered challenging and rightly so. Many language features and operating system facilities try to abstract the details to simplify writing multi-threaded applications. Though it has helped application programmers, it also has a flip side: Due to improper use of these features and facilities, a large number of applications have turned out to perform worse than expected. Quite often, lack of true understanding has led to: undefined behaviour (crashes / memory corruption) hung processes (due to deadlocks) Sharing memory between threads The main reason for all the complexity in multi-threaded applications is that, the same data / memory location gets shared between multiple threads. Let us take a very simple task of incrementing a counter. Whenever an event occurs, we need to increment the counter. A simplified series of operations needed for incrementing a counter is as follows: Read the current value from the counter’s memory location Add 1 to the current value Write the new value to the counter’s memory location Let us say two events happen, and they are processed by our application in parallel. The process being multi-threaded, schedules the task of incrementing the counters on two different threads. The threads run on different processors simultaneously. Both of the threads execute step 1 above and see the value, say 998. They then add 1 to it and the new value happens to be 999. Then both want to write 999 to the memory location. Regardless of who writes first, in the end it would be 999 in the counter’s memory location. So instead of having 1000, we have 999. This is called a race, and it can be avoided using synchronisation features provided by the language or the operating system facilities. Synchronisation One of the synchronisation features is mutex (mutual exclusion). A thread locks a mutex, and until the thread unlocks it, no other thread can lock it. A mutex is typically used to protect a variable from data races. To avoid race in the counter example, lock a mutex before the read operation, and unlock after the write operation. Thus any one of the two threads gets to lock the mutex first. The other thread remains blocked. Once the counter is updated and written back, the first thread unlocks the mutex. This is when the second thread gets to lock the mutex and is able to proceed. By this time the counter is already updated by the first thread, hence the read by the second thread gets the incremented value. This provides the needed consistent behaviour. Programmers have to follow a discipline of using mutexes whenever they have to use variables that are shared between threads. Due to the simplicity of the counter example, one may be led into believing that using mutexes around all shared variables will solve all multi-threading related issues. There are two kinds of problems that arise: The process slows down. The process hangs. Slow down: If two threads are contending to get a lock on a mutex, the operating system or language makes sure that only one of them gets it. The other thread blocks. This causes only one thread to effectively proceed. In-spite of having multiple cores / processors on the system, it behaves as if it were single threaded. In fact if the application is single threaded, it could have avoided acquiring locks, and thus could have been faster! After all acquiring lock is some overhead even if there are no contending threads (it is an operation after all). Hence indiscriminately sharing all data between threads and thereby protecting it with mutexes would lead to slow down of the system. The process hangs: Let us say there are two variables which are protected using different mutexes. Now suppose there are two threads operating on the variables. The example below illustrates how two seemingly un-related functions get blocked indefinitely. thread 1 (function trying a swap) lock obj1
lock obj2 (blocked)
...
swap obj1 obj2
...
...
unlock obj2
unlock obj1 thread 2 (function incrementing objects) lock obj2
lock obj1 (blocked)
...
obj1 = obj1 + 1
obj2 = obj2 + 1
...
unlock obj1
unlock obj2 This is called a deadlock. This is an over simplification of code causing deadlocks. Usually industrial code is very complex, and huge. It is becomes extremely difficult to find deadlocks until they actually occur! Different synchronisation mechanisms There are features like Mutexes, Semaphores and Condition Variables and even more higher level of synchronisation techniques provided by languages and operating systems. A well written program will strive to improve through put of the program. It would parallelise functions using multiple threads. With locks being used while sharing memory between threads, it becomes important to acquire locks only when needed and unlock immediately after the need is over. Acquiring a lock is costly in a high performance system. To further increase the performance of the system, a programmer can make use of hardware instructions exposed by languages like C/C++. The programmer avoids locking a mutex. This completely alters the design of the system. The technique is called lockless programming. It is considered very advanced, and is best avoided by application developers. This post attempts to explain the basics of lockless programming. Lockless programming techniques are used by device driver writers, compiler writers. It is also used in ultra low-latency systems and in a few operating system kernel modules. From an application developer’s perspective, the only benefit of lockless programming is that there is no chance of a deadlock! Understanding SMP hardware architecture Modern hardware architectures have multiple cores / processors and often 3 levels of caches. The sample image below is a 2 level cache taken from Intel’s website, just to illustrate. To manipulate a variable in a thread running on say Core 0, it has to fetch the value of the variable from the system memory. The Core 0 actually manipulates the value in a register and stores the new value in the location of the variable. In essence the Core 0 is actually operating on a copy of the variable, not directly on the system memory. The steps needed for incrementing a counter: 1. load counter from system memory in C2 (C2 is location in L2 Cache)
2. load C1 from C2 (C1 is location in L1 Cache)
3. load R1 from C1 (R1 is a register in the processor)
4. R1 = R1 + 1
5. store R1 to C1
6. store C1 to C2
7. store C2 to location of counter in system memory The reason for these levels of caches is higher performance. It is much faster to load a value from L1 cache into the register compared to loading from L2 cache. Similarly the access to system memory is very slow compared to the L2 cache. Hence, the processors predict the data they might need, and pre-fetch those into the caches. Sometimes the predictions go wrong, so it has to drop the existing contents in the cache, and get the right ones. This is called a cache miss. In the example above, R1 could be the register eax of the x86 architecture. This register is 32 bits. So even if the counter happened to be an unsigned char, that is, just one byte (8 bits), R1 would load 32 bits. The remaining unneeded 24 bits next to the counter therefore get loaded in the register. Please bear this in mind, as the implication of this is elaborated later on. Optimisation by the processor Consider the following multiple lines which are unrelated, eg: 1. x = x+1
2. y = 100
3. pi = 3.14 It would not matter in which order the lines are executed. The processor exploits this and depending upon the proximity of the variables in the caches, executes the one which are closer first. This is called memory ordering. Quite often it even predicts conditional statements as well: 1. if(some_bool == true)
2.     x = x+1
3. else
4.     y = y+1 Whenever it predicts which direction the code is likely to flow, it would initiate executing based on the prediction even before the condition is evaluated. This is called branch prediction. This link provides the details: Intel processor’s branch prediction. There is a heavy cost associated with mis-prediction here, as a lot of work done by the processor needs to be thrown and other branch needs to be executed. This aspect is not being discussed / delved-into in this post. Optimisations by the compiler Even the compilers are intelligent enough to optimise the execution. The compilers quite often provide hints to CPU through instructions. Branch predictions can be influenced by developers by using appropriate macros in the code. The developer actually provides hints to the CPU on the likely result of a condition. The compilers often optimise poorly written code to get faster executions. (The code could be stylistically good, however from the processors perspective it could be poor.) Various levels of optimisations can be turned on while building the code. Sometimes these optimisations can become very aggressive in reordering instructions and cause various kinds of issues. Deeper understanding of data races Let us consider the incrementing counter example from the processor’s point of view again. If two threads were running the same code simultaneously on two separate cores we could easily end up in a situation where thread1 is executing step 5 above, while thread 2 is executing step 4. Thread 2 would have taken an older value of counter in the register R1. Thus we end up with a race, similar in nature as “Sharing memory between threads” section above. Another kind of race Let us now consider two seemingly unrelated lines of code: Thread 1:
1. x = result_of_this_function_call()
2. is_x_initialized = true The line 2 above possibly has been added by the programmer as a variable capturing if the line 1 has already been executed. The processor does not know this, nor does the compiler. The intent is in the programmer’s mind, and has not been explicitly indicated. The compiler does not understand English, and hence does not interpret the variable name to understand the intent. The memory ordering explained above will most likely  reorder the above piece of code. If that happens, the variable is_x_initialized will be set to true even before x has the value from the function. If the two variables were used only in one thread, there would be no issues because of such reordering. The impact of such optimisation becomes evident when there is another thread which is reading the value of is_x_initialized. Eg: Thread 2:
1. while(!is_x_initialized)
2.     do_something_else_and_wait_for_some_milliseconds()
3. do_something_with_x(x) Due to the optimisations explained above, the variable is_x_initialized could be set to true in Thread1 even before the value of x is set. Meanwhile Thread2 would come out of the loop, and execute do_something_with_x() with an “uninitialized” x. This is undefined behaviour. We don’t know what could have been the value of x when do_something_with_x is called. Apart from memory ordering optimisation of Thread1, there is another problem. For Thread2, the compiler can optimise as well! The compiler may optimise the code to look at is_x_initialized once, and decide not to look at it over and over again. This decision for such aggressive optimisation is justified as the loop is not modifying the value of is_x_initialized and we have not told the compiler that it can be modified by the processor or another thread. The aggressive optimisations happen when we turn on optimisations for release builds. Two outcomes are therefore possible: If is_x_initialized is true due to memory ordering of Thread1, the wait will never happen. If is_x_initialized is false, due to the compiler’s optimisation, it could never look for it again. Then the thread2 will loop indefinitely! How to solve this problem is explained later in the post. Language guarantees, compilers and processors Lets reflect upon the note above. Consider the lines of code below: 1. unsigned char counter = 0
2. char x = 'A'
3. counter = counter+1 It might just happen that counter and x are adjacent in memory. The memory layout for such a code could be: (each column represents 8 bits) counter x 0xFF 0xFF The processor loads the memory location (32 bits) as shown above into its register. The counter will get incremented by operating on the register, and then the whole 32 bits will get written back to the memory location. However, if x was updated by some other thread, it would get overwritten right? Surprise! It does not! This is because the language states that two unrelated variables should behave independent of each other. The language guarantees, and the compilers help keep sanity in a programmers life. Synchronisation through lockless programming Locks cost performance. Locks are best avoided, when performance is of prime importance. If some form of synchronisation is needed in these high performance systems, programmers prefer atomic operations. Consider the counter example. The counter can be implemented as an atomic integer. Whenever an increment happens all other threads can see the effect of this increment. The complete set of operations needed for READ, MODIFY, WRITE happen as one unit. This seems ideal. The atomics are implemented by making use of the processor instructions. No lock/unlock call is done. Hence using atomic operations one can be sure that the thread will make progress, and deadlocks cannot happen. The atomics exploit hardware instructions only as long as the atomic object is of the size of a WORD or less, i.e. the object fits in a register. All other atomic objects use locks to get the atomic behaviour. Also the memory ordering optimisations and compiler optimisations are prevented by using atomics. The atomic operations therefore prevent the problem of “is_x_initialized” being set before the actual initialisation of “x”. Simply make is_x_initialized an atomic variable to solve the above problem. Atomics are much faster than mutexes as they exploit hardware instructions. Faster than atomics Most of the modern hardware architecture support the notion of memory barriers. These memory barriers are used by C / C++ compilers to implement what are called the acquire and release semantics. These are not the same as the acquire and release of a mutex or semaphore. acquire semantics An acquire operation guarantees that the effect of that operation in a thread is seen by other processors before any subsequent operations in that thread. This means none of the subsequent operations in that thread will be optimised to be executed before the acquire operation. This is sometimes referred as “load acquire”. release semantics A release operation guarantees that the effects of all the operations prior the release operation are seen by other processors before the release operation. This means that memory ordering will not delay the effect of a prior operation beyond the release operation. This is sometimes referred as “store release”. acquired_and_release semantics This is a very strong fence. In this form, none of the operations before the acquire_and_release operation can be delayed beyond the acquire_and_release. Also none of the operations after the acquire_and_release operation can be ordered before this operation. consume semantics The consume is a weaker form of acquire, in which some of the subsequent operations can be performed before this operation. The operations which are inconsequential with regards to consume can be optimised to be performed before the consume! Using hardware instructions, these semantics are implemented by the compiler. They are known as barriers or fences. Atomics are implemented using the barriers. Needless to say, if these are exploited, a programmer can get performance better than using atomic variables. In a subsequent post, I will attempt to explain using these techniques for producer / consumer queues. Conclusion Under usual circumstances of application development, the techniques which exploit hardware instructions are rarely needed. For one or two modules in a huge system which demands very high performance do we ever need to exploit hardware instructions. In most cases of high performance systems, ensure that cache misses and acquiring locks is avoided. This yields satisfactory performance. The purpose of this article was to try to elaborate SMP, multithreading and advanced synchronisation techniques. Writing high performance software is a very huge subject, which is not covered by this post. I hope this post was as enjoyable, and informative enough to create interest and curiosity in exploring the techniques further. Like this: Like Loading...

One question if I may. > However, if x was updated by some other thread, it would get overwritten right? Surprise! It does not! This is because the language states that two unrelated variables should behave independent of each other. Any more info on how is this guaranteed by the compiler? Thx Reply alokashtikar says: October 24, 2016 at 11:22 am Thanks codeborgs! I had avoided discussing any particular language in the post, so that SMP can be discussed as a concept (technique). To discuss about compilers, we need to associate with a language. For further discussing this, we can look at C++. The C++ language specifies what is called a memory model. The memory model defines aspects such as what is smallest unit of memory that can be referred by a program. In case of C++ it happens to be a byte. It also defines rules like the one you are referring. There is a lot more to it, which can be seen in the ISO standard for C++. It is technically up to the compilers what they use to enforce the rule. A good compiler in this case would use memory barriers. Discussing the memory barriers and the memory model for any language is a very big subject, and a blog post is not enough for it. However, for an application developer, it is reasonable to expect that enforcing the memory model on any architecture would be done in the most efficient way possible, by a compiler. It would be better to not take matters into ones hands and try to optimise it further.🙂 Reply alokashtikar says: October 24, 2016 at 11:25 am isocpp.org Reply Mandeep says: October 31, 2016 at 3:56 am Nice post. The specific good thing is it explains how things are working internally in a simple way. Few things: a. You mentioned that how improper use of language facilities for threading can lead to worst performance. It would be nice to elaborate this or give some examples and will help programmers avoid mistakes. Though I would say it can be an article in itself. b. There may be other multithreading issues that can be covered as well? E.g. I heard is say we have a struct {int I; int j;} and 2 different threads Th1 & Th2 modify it. Th1 does I++ & Th2 does j++. each thread takes ‘t’ time. For multithreaded system total time shud be ‘t’ but it ends up to be 2t or even more. This can happen because whole struct gets inlined in a single cache and one thread when updates ‘i’ will invalidate the whole cache. I guess this would related to “Language guarantee” section but leads to lower performance? How to avoid such situation? More such issues if added to the article can be helpful. Reply alokashtikar says: November 2, 2016 at 4:15 am Thanks Mandeep! Yes in case of 64 bit builds the case you mentioned apply. And in that the language guarantees will push in barriers causing the slowness / degradation in performance. Regarding improper use of language features, some examples could be over use of locks, using semaphores where locks could be used. In case of C++ over use of shared_ptr. One more common mistake is using a central object / cache and locking it during the complete operation (function / across functions). Sometimes use of improper data structures also cause slowness, like using linked lists or tree data structures, where vectors and heaps can be used. These are some of the examples.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Monitor Your Computer’s CPU Temperature There are two groups of users worried about the temperature of their computer: overclockers… and pretty much anybody with a powerful laptop. Those things just cook you! So have you ever wondered exactly what temperature your CPU is running at? There are quite a few Windows programs that you can use to monitor the temperature. Here are two of our favorite options. For Basic CPU Temperature Monitoring: Core Temp The most important temperature to measure in your computer is the processor, or CPU. Core Temp is a simple, lightweight app that runs in your system tray and monitor’s the temperature of your CPU without cluttering it up with other stuff. It offers a few different options so you can customize it to your tastes, and even works with other programs like Rainmeter. Download Core Temp from its home page and install it on your computer. Be very careful to uncheck the bundled software on the third page of the installation! This was unchecked by default for me, but other users have noted that it is checked by default for them. When you run it, it will appear as an icon or series of icons in your system tray showing the temperature of your CPU. If your CPU has multiple cores (as most modern CPUs do), it will show multiple icons–one for each core. Right-click on the icon to show or hide the main window. It will give you a bunch of information about your CPU, including the model, speed, and the temperature of each of its cores. Take particular note of the “TJ. Max” value–this is the highest temperature (in Celsius) at which the manufacturer has rated your CPU to run. If your CPU is anywhere near that temperature, it is considered overheating. (Usually it’s best to keep it at least 10 to 20 degrees lower than that–and even then, if you’re anywhere close, it usually means something is wrong unless you’ve overclocked your CPU.) For most modern CPUs, Core Temp should be able to detect the Tj. Max for your specific processor, but you should look your specific processor online and double check. Every processor is a little different, and having an accurate Tj. Max value is very important, as it ensures you’re getting the correct temperature readings for your CPU. Head to Options > Settings to configure some of Core Temp’s more useful features. Here are a few settings we recommend looking at: General > Start Core Temp with Windows: You can turn this on or off; it’s up to you. Turning it on will allow you to monitor your temperatures at all time without having to remember to start it up. But if you only need the app occasionally, it’s okay to turn this off. Display > Start Core Temp minimized: You’ll probably want to turn this on if you have “Start Core Temp with Windows” on. Display > Hide Taskbar Button: Again, if you’re going to leave it running all the time, this is good to turn on so it doesn’t waste space on your taskbar. Notification Area > Notification Area Icons: This allows you to customize how Core Temp appears in your notification area (or system tray, as its commonly called). You can choose to display just the app’s icon, or display the temperature of your CPU–I recommend the “highest temperature” (instead of “all cores”, which will show multiple icons). You can also customize the font and colors here. If the icon is only appearing in the pop-up tray and you want to see it at all times, just click and drag it onto your taskbar. If you decide to show the temperature in the notification area, you may want to change the Temperature Polling Interval in the General tab of Core Temp’s settings. By default, it’s set to 1000 milliseconds, but you can move it higher if the blinking numbers annoy you. Just remember the higher you set it, the more time it’ll take for Core Temp to notify you if your CPU is running hot. Core Temp can do a lot more than this–you can head to Options > Overheat Protection to have your computer alert you when it reaches its maximum safe temperature, for example–but these basics should be all you need to keep an eye on your CPU temperatures. For Advanced Monitoring Across Your Entire System: HWMonitor Generally, your CPU temperatures are going to be the most important temperatures to monitor. But, if you want to see temperatures across your system–motherboard, CPU, graphics card, and hard drives–HWMonitor gives you that and much more. Download the latest version from the HWMonitor home page–I recommend the ZIP version, which doesn’t require installation, though you can also download the full setup version if you want. Start it up, and you’ll be greeted with a table of temperatures, fan speeds, and other values. To find your CPU temperature, scroll down to the entry for your CPU–mine, for example, is an “Intel Core i7 4930K”–and look at the “Core #” temperatures in the list. (Note that “Core Temperature” is different than “CPU Temp”, which will appear under the motherboard section for some PCs. Generally, you’ll want to monitor the Core temperature. See our note below about AMD temperatures for more info.) Feel free to poke around and see temperatures for other components in your system, too. There isn’t much else you can do with HWMonitor, but it’s a good program to have around. A Note on AMD Processor Temperatures Monitoring temperatures for AMD processors has long puzzled computer enthusiasts. Unlike most Intel processors, AMD machines will report two temperatures: “CPU Temperature” and “Core Temperature”. “CPU Temperature” is an actual temperature sensor inside the CPU’s socket. “Core Temperature”, on the other hand, isn’t really a temperature at all. It’s an arbitrary scale measured in degrees celsius designed to, in a way, mimic a temperature sensor. Your BIOS will often show the CPU Temperature, which may differ from programs like Core Temp, which show Core Temperature. Some programs, like HWMonitor, show both. CPU Temperature is more accurate at low levels, but less so at high levels. Core Temperature is more accurate and precise when your CPU get hot–which is when temperature values really matter. So, in almost all cases, you’ll want to pay attention to Core Temperature. When your system is idle, it may show impossibly low temperatures (like 15 degrees celsius), but once things heat up a bit, it will show a more accurate–and useful–value. What to Do If You Don’t Get a Reading (or Temperatures Look Really Wrong) In some cases, you may find that one of the above programs doesn’t quite work. Maybe it doesn’t match up with another temperature-monitoring program, maybe it’s absurdly low, or maybe you can’t get a temperature at all. There are a lot of reasons this could happen, but here are a few things to check: Are you looking at the right sensors? If two programs don’t agree, it’s possible–especially on AMD machines–that one program is reporting the “Core temperature” and one is reporting the “CPU temperature”. Make sure you’re comparing apples to apples. Core temperature is usually what you want to monitor, as we mentioned above. Make sure your programs are up to date. If you’re using an old version of Core Temp, for example, it may not support your CPU, in which case it won’t provide an accurate temperature (or possibly won’t even provide a temperature at all). Download the latest version to see if it fixes the problem. If you have a very new CPU, you may need to wait for an update to the program. How old is your computer? If it’s more than a few years old, it may not be supported by programs like Core Temp. We could write a book about monitoring CPU temperatures, but in the interest of keeping this easy to follow, we’ll leave it at that. Hopefully, you can get a general estimate of how well your CPU is being cooled. Monitoring your temperatures is good, and something everyone should check on once in a while. But if your computer is regularly overheating, there’s probably a deeper cause that you need to look into. Open up the Task Manager and see if there are any processes using your CPU, and stop them (or figure out why they’re out of control). Make sure that you aren’t blocking any of the vents on your computer, especially if it’s a laptop. Blow the vents out with compressed air to make sure they aren’t filled with dust and dirt. The older and dirtier a computer gets, the harder the fans have to work to keep the temperature down–which means a hot computer and very loud fans.

The installer for CoreTemp is very sneaky; it includes a default-ON selection for a game (something about building an empire) and it obscures the radio button between others. Look carefully - don't just click in a hurry. So I got it installed and ran it. Looked OK until I noticed three of my cores had a max of about 40ºC and the fourth had 73º as a max. Now I have been running Piniform Speccy for some time and have never before seen such an anomaly on this normally very well behaved HP Envy with I7-4770. So I tried to start Speccy to double check; this was early morning and I hadn't run anything that is at all processor intensive. But Speccy wouldn't load. OK, so now I'm getting a bit scared. Killed CoreTemp and uninstalled it; Speccy still wouldn't start. So I restarted (Windows 10 1607) and it hung on the word "restarting" for 3 minutes. Pressed power button and forced shutdown. Restarted and all is normal again, scanned with MalWareBytes and all is clean. Speccy runs and all cores are high 30sºC. Tried HWMonitor64 from the Zip; it's ok - I'll keep it around. My advice: avoid CoreTemp (YMMV). HWMonitor is OK so far, but I'm keeping Speccy too. October 23, 2016 Ashley Smith Same here. It Tried to sneak in crapware.

Elyse Betters25 October 2016VR Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's VR vision extends beyond Cardboard and Daydream. The company began embracing virtual reality a few years ago when it launched a Cardboard DIY headset with a viewer certification program. Then, in 2016, it introduced the Daydream VR platform, followed by a Daydream mobile VR headset that uses a smartphone for processing power. While those two projects should be keeping Google plenty busy, it hasn't stopped there. It is now reportedly working on a headset that doesn't need a smartphone or PC to power it (much like the Oculus Santa Cruz prototype headset teased in October). It's not limited to VR, either. It'll supposedly blend virtual reality with augmented reality, meaning it might function a lot like Microsoft's HoloLens headset. In other words, Google is being very ambitious. Here's everything we know so far about Google’s standalone headset. Keep in mind we're in early days territory here, so some of the finer details aren't yet known, but we'll continue to update this piece over time as more information about the headset surfaces. Google's VR/AR headset: What's it called? We currently don't know what Google's upcoming AR/VR headset will be called. A codename hasn't even popped up yet. Google's VR/AR headset: How will it work? All-in-one headset First of all, Google's virtual-reality headset will be more legit than Cardboard. The Wall Street Journal said Google is developing an "all-in-one virtual-reality headset". It doesn't require a secondary device, such as a smartphone, computer, or even a game console, meaning it would be one of the first headsets in recent history to power and display a VR experience all on its own. Even the $599 Oculus Rift relies on a PC. Keep in mind, Facebook-owned Oculus VR recently demoed a standalone prototype it's working on, which you can read all about here. Santa Cruz is basically a cable-free version of the Rift. From what we can tell, the form factor of the Santa Cruz looks nearly identical to the Rift, though it appears to have a motherboard/computer on board, which is roughly the size of a deck of cards, attached to the rear head strap. Like the Santa Cruz, Google's planned standalone headset should deliver a quality experience. It will feature a screen, high-powered chips, and outward-facing cameras. Google plans to use chips from Movidius, and the cameras will be able to track the motion of the user's head. It's worth noting this WSJ report from February 2016 followed news that Google named Clay Bavor as its VR chief. Google is working on a VR headset that doesn’t need a phone However, in July 2016, Recode claimed Google decided not to take on Oculus, HTC, and PlayStation. The company was said to prefer the mobile VR route instead and actually ditched its more ambitious plans for VR. Scrapping the standalone headset came at some cost, the report claimed, because around 50 employees were reportedly working on it as well as a VR operating system separate to Android. Google scrapped plans for own Oculus Rift VR headset Augmented reality As of October 2016, Google might be working on a standalone headset that's part virtual reality and part augmented reality. According to Engadget, the device will use sensors and feature integrated eye-tracking technologies and algorithms that let it "map out the real-world space in front of a user", essentially blurring the lines between VR and AR (which sounds a lot like Project Tango technology). Engadget said Google's upcoming VR/AR headset will work without a smartphone and offer an experience that's not as closed off as current VR headsets. It therefore might function like Microsoft HoloLens. Movidius, the computer vision company that Intel is acquiring, is once again rumoured to be supplying some of the components powering the headset. Google's next VR headset might ditch the phone and include AR Built-in radio In October 2016, new documents filed with the US Federal Communications Commission revealed Google is testing a prototype wireless virtual reality device. The documents asked for permission to conduct testing on the device with its employees, contractors, and developers. They also stated the new device would transmit across a very broad range of frequencies, from 2.4 GHz to 5.8 GHz. The Drum said this suggested Google's VR headset has a built-in radio similar to the Google Glass augmented reality headset that was discontinued in 2015. The documents also listed Mike Jazayeri as one of the contacts on the fillings. He joined Google in 2005 and previously worked on Google's Cardboard headset. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is now the director of product management for Google's VR group. Google's VR/AR headset: Is it a Daydream headset? No. The headset is being described as "high end" and will reportedly be separate from Google's Daydream mobile VR platform. Google's VR/AR headset: When will it be available? We currently don't know when Google's VR/AR headset will be available, but Daydream will start shipping in November in the UK and US. Google's VR/AR headset: How much will it cost? We currently don't know how much Google's VR/AR headset will cost if and when it launches for consumers.

Microsoft's October 26 Windows event is about to happen in New York, and this time the Surface-related news could take a different spin. We don't know what will happen at the event for certain, but we do know the focus is on the Windows operating system and its future. Here's what to expect, based on the the reporting of the web's two best-informed informed Windows insiders, Paul Thurott and ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley -- along with some less reliable rumors thrown in for good measure: The invite is enigmatic.Photo by Microsoft Do not expect to see Windows Phones or a new Microsoft Band. Do not expect much, if any, Microsoft Office news. That's because Microsoft has already scheduled an Office-centric event on November 2 (also in New York). Do not expect a Surface Pro 5 or Surface Book 2. That said, it wouldn't be impossible to see minor refreshed versions of the existing Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book -- both now a year old -- possibly getting updated to the latest Intel Kaby Lake processors. A new Surface all-in-one, codenamed "Cardinal," could be unveiled. It would ostensibly be a touch-screen iMac competitor. Windows 10 Holographic, an already-announced plan to unite Microsoft's mixed-reality HoloLens and Windows-connected VR headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, could be revealed in greater detail. Videos showing a new version of Microsoft Paint supporting 3D objects was recently leaked. It could be shown at the event as an example of how Microsoft is pushing towards greater 3D creation tools for that sort of "Holographic" environment. An Amazon Echo-like Home Hub has recently been rumored. Much like Echo and Google Home, the speaker would be powered by voice AI (in this case, Cortana). Microsoft's 2017 unveiling of its next console, Project Scorpio, could connect Windows and console gaming more seamlessly. We might not hear more on Scorpio, but Microsoft could announce other gaming moves for Windows 10. Microsoft's Windows event begins October 26 at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Watch it live in the video embedded above, or on Microsoft's site. CNET will be there covering it in-depth, so stay tuned.

That honestly sounds a lot like Google's Project Tango technology, but Engadget said Google's upcoming headset will work without a smartphone and offer an experience that's not as closed off as current VR headsets. It therefore might function like Microsoft HoloLens. Movidius, the computer vision company that Intel is acquiring, is reportedly making some of the headset's components. Not much else is known about the headset, but it will be separate from Google's Daydream VR platform, which you can read all about from here. We don't know what the headset will be called or what else it might feature.

According to a report stemming form Engadget, Google is working on a new headset that functions significantly differently from Daydream. This headset is designed to operate as a standalone device and won’t rely on the power of a smartphone, according to the rumours. The project also reportedly integrates eye-tracking technology with an algorithm that maps the real-world space in front of the user, similar to Microsoft’s HoloLens or the Sulon Q. The idea behind the device is to create a mixed-reality experience that combines virtual reality with augmented reality. The internal components for the headset are reportedly being provided by Movidius, a computer vision company that Intel recently acquired for an undisclosed sum of money. On the other side of the Google VR spectrum, Daydream is powered by certified Android 7.0 Nougat devices and is priced at $99.

But there’s still more in the making… Google’s long journey into the world of VR, initially started with the rather simplistic Cardboard experiment a few years back, has now reached a point where it could legitimately be included among the company’s agenda’s more serious focus points. And if Daydream doesn’t sound like enough of a big deal, chances are that a second, more premium and allegedly standalone headset will. According to Engadget, a high-end visor is indeed in the works at Mountain View, and it should be one powerful enough not to require a smartphone nor a computer to fully function. It will reportedly be a separate thing from Daydream, and focus on other technologies (on top of VR) such as eye-tracking and real world mapping, to create a mixed reality experience not too dissimilar from, say, Microsoft‘s HoloLens. Other sources say that soon-to-be-Intel-purchased AI company Movidius will supply some of the chips powering the headset, which will aid in tracking motion and positional awareness. Despite being similar in scope to Microsoft’s product, Google’s new headset will allegedly “blur the line between virtual and augmented reality — bringing the world into VR, rather than VR into the world.” Says the report: Earlier today, The Drum reported on a potential “wireless virtual reality” device that passed through the FCC’s approval process. Although the heavily redacted filings reveal very little, beyond some wireless capabilities, it does have Mike Jazayeri, director of product management for Google’s VR group, listed as a contact. We were unable to confirm whether the FCC-approved device, apparently for internal and partner testing, is related to the standalone headset plans. So what do you think about this? Are you excited at the idea of an even deeper push into the virtual/mixed reality by Google? Drop us a comment and let us know.

The Agile Consultant: Guiding Clients to Enterprise Agility-P2P Posted on 24.10.2016 at 19:25 in eBook, Ebooks by Fisherman Learn the agile philosophy of lean processes, incremental delivery, deep client participation, decentralized authority, and just-in-time planning to bring speed, creativity, empowerment and increased productivity to product development. This book is your guide to becoming the go-to advisor for the enterprise agile transition. Many organizations have brought in agile coaches and achieved great progress in software development productivity, only to find teams slipping back into old methods as they encounter enterprise resistance and dysfunction. The consultative skills required to engage at the enterprise level differ greatly from those needed to coach teams in agile practices. Agile coaches and consultants need to up their game to successfully partner with executives, managers, and PMOs to evolve from traditional methods to a lean, agile mindset. The Agile Consultant, by former Intel Worldwide Project Management Director and agile expert Rick Freedman, author of Amazon best-seller The IT Consultant, shows how to overcome transition challenges and move beyond team-level practice coaching to guide the entire organization to enterprise agility. Agile methods are displacing traditional, process-heavy project management techniques, and are poised to migrate from software development to the rest of IT, and to the entire enterprise.

The device, which has been rumored previously, functions differently from the Daydream VR headset that will soon ship to consumers. It works completely standalone without any smartphone attached. Additionally, Engadget now reports that the unannounced product integrates eye-tracking technologies and algorithms "to map out the real-world space in front of a user." The result is an experience that's less closed off than current VR headsets and "blurs the line between virtual and augmented reality." From the sounds of it, this merged reality concept seems to resemble that of Microsoft's HoloLens, though we know very little about Google's plans for this product and what features it will offer. The report reveals that some components powering Google's futuristic device are being provided by Movidius, the computer vision company that Intel is acquiring for an undisclosed sum. Daydream, built into Android 7 Nougat, is designed to deliver a VR experience similar to that of Samsung's Gear VR; you strap your phone into the comfortable headset, put it on, and the immersion begins. But it appears that Google executives might partially share the same philosophy as Microsoft, Magic Leap, and Apple's Tim Cook: some link with the outside world is essential. "There’s no substitute for human contact," Cook told BuzzFeed News earlier this month. "And so you want the technology to encourage that." Daydream VR is for total immersion, but Google's standalone headset could prove to be the company's longer-term bet. Google Glass is dead, but the dream behind it might not be.

The Linux Foundation Well, here we go again with yet another new technology with a name that doesn't tell us much about what it is: Hyperledger. Hyperledger is related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchains... but, what are these things? They sound like science fiction: I have plenty of Bitcoins, so let's go splurge on a nice evening at the Ethereum. Fortunately, Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of the Hyperledger Project explains these amazing new technologies in his LinuxCon North America keynote. Obviously, because this is a Linux and open source website, these things are all related to open source projects. Bitcoin is a distributed peer digital currency and a shared world ledger that records balances. Ethereum takes concepts from Bitcoin and expands them to build a decentralized computing platform that runs smart contracts. Both use blockchains, and Behlendorf explains what these are. He says, "People have started to focus on underlying technology within Bitcoin, within Ethereum, that sort of thing. That's something called a blockchain. The blockchain is actually not a dramatically new idea. It's a decentralized database that has multi-masters. Anybody can write to it. It's a ledger, and it's resilient to hostile actors. Somebody can try to corrupt the consensus-forming process of what's the next entry to write into the ledger, and the rest of the network would be able to recognize that and stop it." "This decentralized ledger is something that used to be core to thinking about how we might scale up database systems, and then we figured out to make the central single master kind of model work and scale up and then we forgot about it, until Satoshi. Until Bitcoin reintroduced this idea by helping us realize these different masters could represent different actors, different organizations, different individuals, perhaps even anonymously. Satoshi took this whole series of different ideas, including blockchain and this kind of decentralized database idea, and created a currency out of it, but in doing that he highlighted the potential to come back to this idea of distributed ledgers as this really interesting technology," he says. System of Record What might that be used for? According to Behlendorf, "the distributed ledger that keeps track of that is essentially the system of record. The source of truth in a community of participants. You could use that as a way to build an immediate settlement network for a bank where 20 banks might be writing into this ledger. Such and such traded with such and such, whatever, and then be able to go back and prove that actually all happened in sequence, and not be able to refute that certain things happened as well." Where does Hyperledger come in? Hyperledger is a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project, founded to address issues of code provenance, patent rights, standards, and policy. Behlendorf says, "A set of organizations started to place calls to Jim [Zemlin, the Executive Director of the Linux Foundation]. He started to host some conference calls, some face-to-face meetings, and those companies included very familiar names like IBM and Intel. They included some brand new types of companies such as Digital Asset Holdings and R3, and included some companies that had never previously engaged with the Linux Foundation before such as JP Morgan Bank." Hyperledger was launched in December 2015 under the framework of the Linux Foundation's collaborative projects framework. "The first code release happened in February. That code was called Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of this kind of private blockchain model where if you have a set of known named entities, 20 banks, or a government, and a regulatory agency, and NGOs and others who all want simply a shared distributed ledger, and want to be able to layer on top of that a smart contract platform," says Behlendorf. Watch Brian Behlendorf's keynote (below) to learn about this bleeding-edge technology that is bringing together an unlikely cast of participants, including JP Morgan Bank, Airbus, IBM, Intel, and various companies and open source developers all over the globe.

The expo is scheduled for April 5-7, 2017 in Las Vegas. As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand, Gartner predicts that by 2020, 25 percent of all cyber attacks involve IoT. As such, there is a critical overlap between physical devices and IT security, and Connected Security Expo @ ISC West is the only event dedicated to this area of increasing importance. The inaugural Connected Security Expo, which took place in April 2016 during ISC West in the Sands Expo, maintained a separate show floor and conference program. "Being a cloud-based, SaaS model business, System Surveyor found value in having our booth in Connected Security Expo @ ISC West," said Lisa Hugman of System Surveyor, a Connected Security Expo @ ISC West 2016 exhibitor. "It's helpful for the industry to note those companies which are bridging the physical and IT worlds, and having businesses such as ours grouped together in the Connected Security Expo helps. We were pleased with the quality and quantity of booth traffic." In 2017, Connected Security Expo will undergo several enhancements. First and most importantly, the exhibits will take place within the ISC West Exhibit Hall, making the experience much more convenient for attendees that are visiting both critical events. "The 'connecting' of Connected Security Expo to ISC West is in response to direct feedback from last year's attendees," explained ISC and Connected Security Expo Senior Vice President and General Manager Ed Several. "Feedback from last year's event was overwhelmingly positive from attendees, but as physical and IT security merge, it makes sense to keep this complementary content closer in physical proximity at the show." The 2017 event will also include dedicated education tracks within the SIA Education@ISC conference program. This unique content is programmed by a Connected Security Expo advisory board comprised of industry experts including Matthew Rosenquist, cybersecurity strategist at Intel Corporation. "Security and technology are intimately tied together," said Rosenquist. "Cyber is key to the future of physical security and yet if security breaks down, technology is undermined. Cyber and physical security are becoming more symbiotic every year." Confirmed sessions and speakers will be announced in December. For more information on Connected Security Expo or to secure an exhibit space or speaking slot, visit www.connectedsecurityexpo.com or contact Sherida Sessa at 203-840-5831 or ssessa@reedexpo.com.

These two chipmakers have moved in opposite directions over the past year. Is it time to sell the winner and buy the loser? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 24, 2016 at 11:29AM The past year has been a mixed one for chipmakers. Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR), often touted as a "pure play" on the Internet of Things (IoT) market, has fallen more than 40% over the past 12 months. But Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is best known for its GPUs, has surged more than 140%. Let's take a look at why Sierra slumped as Nvidia soared, and whether or not it makes sense to buy the former and sell the latter. Image source: Getty Images. Sierra Wireless' strengths and weaknesses Sierra is the world's largest manufacturer of 2G, 3G, and 4G embedded modules and gateways. These tiny chips connect objects to the cloud and each other, forming the fabric of the growing IoT market. The number of connected devices worldwide is predicted to double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion in 2020. Bullish forecasts like that propelled the stock to nearly $50 in early 2015. Unfortunately, sluggish enterprise spending, macro headwinds in certain markets, and competition from cheaper Chinese rivals caused the company's year-over-year sales growth to drop from double-digit to single-digit levels last year, before turning negative over the past three quarters. Analysts currently expect Sierra's revenue to rise just 0.5% this year, compared to 8% growth in 2015. Despite those challenges, Sierra's gross margin expanded 140 basis points annually to 33.8% last quarter -- indicating that its market-leading products were holding off the cheaper competition. Those margins should continue improving as Sierra scales up by acquiring smaller wireless connectivity players like Maingate, Mobiquithings, and GenX Mobile. Sierra's earnings are still expected to fall 34% this year on lower sales and higher operating costs, but might rebound 44% next year as those headwinds dissipate. Nvidia's strengths and weaknesses Nvidia is the world's biggest maker of high-end gaming GPUs. Dominating this market insulated Nvidia from the global slowdown in PC sales, since high-end gamers are generally more keen on upgrading their GPUs than business or casual users. Gaming GPUs still generate the lion's share of Nvidia's revenue, but it's also been expanding into adjacent markets like connected cars and data centers. Image source: Nvidia. In connected cars, Nvidia's mobile Tegra CPUs power infotainment and navigation systems. It also offers a "driverless supercomputer," the Drive PX platform, which helps automakers produce autonomous vehicles. In data centers, major partners like IBM are installing its high-end Tesla GPUs alongside their CPUs to boost machine learning and AI-related tasks. That's because GPUs, with their rapid floating-point calculations, often process those tasks faster than comparable data center CPUs like Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) industry standard Xeon chips. Nvidia's strength across all three businesses fueled its double-digit annual sales growth over the past three quarters. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise 22% this year, compared to just 7% growth last year. Earnings are expected to soar 71% this year, compared to a 4% decline last year. Those near-term numbers look solid, but Nvidia's sales and earnings are only expected to respectively rise 7% and 4% in fiscal 2018. That's mainly because the chipmaker's cross licensing deal with Intel, which feeds it $66 million per quarter in "free revenue", is set to expire in early 2017. What the valuations tell us Sierra Wireless' trailing P/E of 104 initially looks very lofty relative to its earnings growth, but its forward P/E of 18 looks more sustainable. Moreover, the stock trades at just 0.6 times its enterprise value of $328 million, which makes it a cheap buyout target for larger chipmakers looking to expand their presence in the IoT market. Nvidia trades at 44.5 trailing earnings, 35 times forward earnings, and about 6 times its enterprise value of $32.8 billion. Nvidia's P/E multiples might not look cheap, but they're actually much lower than the industry average of 75 for specialized semiconductor companies, and compare favorably to its aforementioned growth rates. Looking ahead, analysts expect Sierra's annual earnings to grow at an average rate of 16.5% over the next five years. This gives the stock a 5-year PEG (price-to-earnings growth) ratio of 1.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered "undervalued", Sierra doesn't look cheap relative to its earnings growth potential yet. Nvidia's annual earnings are expected to rise 23.7% during that same period, which gives it a slightly cheaper (albeit not undervalued) PEG ratio of 1.6. The winner: Nvidia It might be tempting to buy Sierra Wireless as a turnaround play on the Internet of Things, but the stock could remain under pressure if headwinds persist. Meanwhile, Nvidia has already had a great run over the past year, but its valuations suggest that it could still have room to run. However, investors should be mindful of the expiration of the Intel cross-licensing agreement, which could result in unfavorable year-over-year comparisons next year.

For more information on Converged Infrastructure A New Generation of IT Architecture Partner Offers However, officials with both spent those months laying the groundwork for how they would bring together their respective product portfolios. The results of all that planning is on display here this week at the Dell EMC World 2016 show, with executives unveiling new and enhanced products that merge offerings from both vendors only six weeks after the deal closed. All that was most evident in the IT infrastructure business, particularly around hyperconverged solutions and storage offerings, and in security. CEO Michael Dell and other executives stressed that this is no longer an issue of two vendors coming together. "We are already operating as one company," he said during his keynote address Oct. 19. It's an effort that was helped by the largely complementary nature of the product lineups from both companies, and the flexibility and agility that comes from being a private company, officials said. Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners took Dell private in 2013 in a $25 billion deal. Rob Enderle, principal analyst with The Enderle Group, said the amount of planning work that Dell and EMC officials did during those 10 months was unusual and enabled them to roll out these products so quickly after the deal closed. In most instances, companies involved in acquisitions tend to wait until the deal is completed before doing much of the planning work around products. The Dell-EMC deal was different, Enderle told eWEEK. "I've never seen it done before with a merger of any size, much less a merger of this size," he said. "The scope of this is unprecedented." Highlighting this was the work Dell EMC has done around its hyperconverged infrastructure offerings. The company is integrating the Dell PowerEdge servers into the VxRail and VxRack hyperconverged systems inherited from VMware from the EMC deal. Hyperconverged systems offer compute, storage, networking, virtualization and management software resources in a tightly integrated appliance that is easy to deploy and manage. Before the merger, the VxRail and VxRack systems used servers from original design manufacturer Quanta, according to Bob Wambach, vice president of product marketing for Dell EMC's Converged Plaform and Solutions Division. The company will continue offering appliances with Quanta systems for those customers that may still want them, Wambach told eWEEK. However, with the PowerEdge systems, the company can offer a broader range of VxRail configurations, address more workloads and bring hyperconverged solutions to smaller customers, he said. These new configurations are powered by Intel's Xeon "Broadwell" chips as well as VMware's vSphere and VSAN technologies, delivering 40 percent more CPU performance for the same price and all-flash nodes that offer twice the storage of previous versions. For storage-intensive workloads like data analytics and Microsoft Exchange, customers can use VxRail appliances based on the PowerEdge R730xd servers. Workloads that need graphics support can use configurations with the PowerEdge R730 systems that include GPU accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. In addition, Dell EMC is now offering an entry-level three-node model in a 3U (5.25-inch) form factor that can support up to 200 virtual machines and comes in at less than $45,000. It's aimed at smaller companies and remote or branch offices. Originally published on eWeek.

Rumors and reports suggest that the company is going to show off some new MacBooks and that really does appear to be the case as the company has registered trademarks for three new MacBooks in Russia. The trademark filings published today reveal that the company is preparing three new MacBooks that will be powered by macOS Sierra out of the box. According to reports, the new hardware has been identified by model numbers A1706, A1707, and A1708 in the trademark filings. The company doesn’t reveal any additional details about these notebooks aside from mentioning that the trademarks have been filed for “portable personal computers.” Reports suggest that Apple is going to show off a basic 13 inch MacBook later this week aside from new 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pro models. The company is expected to properly revamp the MacBook Pro lineup this time around with the latest processors from Intel, USB Type-C ports, Thunderbolt 3, and an OLED touch bar with a fingerprint sensor. Nothing can obviously be said for sure about these notebooks until Apple makes an official announcement, fortunately, October 27 isn’t that far off now. Filed in Apple >Computers.

16 Nov 2016 Local World Business Sports More firms urged to adopt flexible work arrangements Posted on 24 October 2016 - 11:01pm Last updated on 25 October 2016 - 12:13am KUALA LUMPUR: The government wants more companies to adopt Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA) to optimise their productivity and performance. "A study by Talent Corporation Malaysia Bhd (TalentCorp) has shown that organisations that adopt FWA have higher employee involvement and business productivity," Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan said when officiating the LIFE@WORK 2016 awards organised by TalentCorp here today. He said to date 29 large companies in the country, including Sunway Group, Maybank Group, Telekom Malaysia Bhd, Digi Telecommunications and Johnson & Johnson, are adopting FWA, up from 21 last year. Firms that adopt FWA also better retain their female employees and enhance the involvement of disabled groups such as people with disabilities and special needs, he said, adding the government also offers a range of initiatives to firms adopting FWA, including multiple tax credits. Nine companies bagged a LIFE@WORK 2016 award for making FWA a business strategy. Maybank Group won the Platinum Award, while other winners included Digi Telecommunications (Best Malaysian Organisation), Intel Malaysia (Best International Organisation), Johnson & Johnson (Best Lean Organisation), Gamuda Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd (Best Incentive), Chong Chye Neo of IBM Malaysia (CEO Champion) and Sunway Group (Sustainable Practices) and Starbucks Coffee Co (Innovative Practices).

Bolaji Ojo, EETimes 10/24/2016 10:43 AM EDT Hard questions are arising. It comes back to finding the justification for this deal. Does this deal really make sense for Qualcomm? Acquisitions used to be closely guarded events held behind closed doors with severe penalties for any leakages to even news organizations. Not anymore. The semiconductor industry has known for several weeks now that Qualcomm Inc. wants to buy Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductor N.V. A deal could be announced this week, turning Qualcomm overnight into the largest supplier of chips to the global automotive industry and the world’s third largest chip company behind Intel and Samsung. Talk of a Qualcomm-NXP deal comes in the wake of historic consolidation amid a sense of urgency to improve operational competitiveness in a maturing landscape. Initial speculations from a Wall Street Journal report were that Qualcomm would pay about $30 billion for NXP but the target’s market value has since shot up above $36 billion.

BGT, which is operated by leading terminal operator International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI), is Iraq's premier container and multi-purpose cargo handling facility at the port of Umm Qasr. This order represents the third port in the ICTSI group that uses JLT mobile computers, following major design wins at Baltic Container Terminal (BCT) in Gdynia, Poland, and Batumi International Container Terminal (BICTL) in Batumi, Georgia. BGT opened an extension to its facility on 12th October 2016, with the first container lifted by one of two new ship-to-shore cranes during the opening ceremony (https://www.porttechnology.org/news/basra_terminal_expansion_inaugurated?utm_source=Port+Technology+Newsletter&utm_campaign=a5fc5abc8e-PortTechnology_Daily12_10_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_89349292d5-a5fc5abc8e-234994513). Working with its key contractor and business partner Autepra (http://www.autepra.eu), JLT delivered 50 VERSO 12 rugged mobile computers prior to the opening of BGT's new facility. The computers are operated with new equipment including reach stackers, terminal tractors, and forklifts. All the BGT computers are used with the Navis N4 terminal operating system (TOS). In this part of the Middle East, temperatures can reach the extremes on a daily basis, so it's essential that the computers used can withstand this environment to ensure that operations keep running seamlessly. Any interruption in service, however small, can have massive knock-on effects on productivity. "Basra Gateway Terminal has one of the harshest operating environments for a port terminal in the world," says Sebastiano Cerneka, ICTSI's Head of IT for Europe and the Middle East. "This summer, we recorded a temperature of 53°C, the hottest in the Western Hemisphere. During that time the JLT VERSO 12 computers, which are not used in air conditioned environments, kept working. Being able to rely on JLT's VERSO 12 rugged mobile computers means we can continue to meet the needs of shipping lines and cargo shippers despite the extreme weather and temperatures we experience as a matter of course." "While the key challenge for the rugged mobile computers supplied to BGT is absolute reliability in extreme temperatures, seamless integration with the port's systems was also critical," points out Tomas Girdzevicius, CEO, Autepra. "Selecting JLT's VERSO 12 rugged mobile computers meant the temperature requirement could be met with a computer that's pre-certified as ready to work with the terminal operating system BGT was already using. Integration was therefore as quick and straightforward as possible." Equipped with  Intel® Atom Quad Core Series processors, the VERSO 12 computer is the latest generation of high-performance vehicle-mounted PCs from JLT that are developed from the ground up for use in the harshest environments and for business-critical functions. JLT's entire VERSO range has been validated as ready for integration into any shipping port or terminal running Navis N4.

LEAD How Building IBM's First PC Taught Me to Be a Better Entrepreneur The birth of the personal computer was the beginning of a new era for entrepreneurs. I was there, and I saw firsthand how entrepreneurs can really make all the difference. By Martin Zwilling Marty Zwilling is the founder and CEO of Startup Professionals, a company that provides products and services to startup founders and small business owners. @StartupPro Founder and CEO, Startup Professionals@StartupPro WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Way back in the early 1980s, I was privileged to be part of the original IBM PC development team, led by Don Estridge. He was a great leader, and one of very few who have been able to dent the barriers to real change in a large corporation. We struggled with the differences between intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, and I learned much about both. For example, even though we were leading an entrepreneurial effort within IBM, we found it a challenge to deal with the inbred mainframe culture, reverence for process, and accounting practices of a large company. Despite a valiant effort, we succeeded only briefly in putting IBM in the personal computer business--but our efforts changed my view of entrepreneurs forever. We all watched as several strong-willed entrepreneurs of the day, including Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Ed Roberts, without constraints, really drove the industry and changed the face of computing. For IBM, the personal computer was a paradigm shift from its big-business legacy, built with new technologies for totally new markets, and battleships turn very slowly. I've often asked myself why intrapreneurs like Don Estridge, and peers from CDC, Burroughs, UNIVAC, and Wang are not household names today. They had the huge financial and technical resources of a large company, and they had the right dreams, but they also had a set of challenges most entrepreneurs don't have to deal with. Some of the challenges faced by the personal computing intrapreneurs: Team members were not selected based on entrepreneurial acumen. Typically, team members had to be sourced internally, with their performance and credentials based on prior corporate assignments and relationships. No consideration was given to experience running a startup, breadth of skills, or even thinking like an entrepreneur. Partnering with outside entrepreneurial efforts was discouraged. The culture of a large technology company relied on internal development or large, stable, and proven external vendors. Dependencies on entrepreneurial efforts, like Microsoft and Intel, were frowned upon, no matter how innovative or relevant. Every such deal was an exception. Key operational and pivot decisions required corporate approval. Like startup investors several layers deep, parent company executives often demanded approval rights and exerted power without understanding the issues of starting a new business. Required pivots and budget changes were painfully slow and overanalyzed. Compensation and support carried the corporate burden rate. The burn rate was extremely high, with no one working for equity or deferred compensation. Legally and culturally, benefits, facilities, and work schedules for intrapreneurs had little flexibility. The alternative of an early spinoff from the parent with no return path was unthinkable. Measurements were set on internal objectives, rather than on market traction. In these enterprises, performance objectives were usually tied to internal processes, rather than beating competitors, customer acquisition, and revenue growth. This approach, when applied to a new venture, often actually inhibited progress and market penetration. A single-minded focus and commitment was hard to maintain. In a corporate world, a small effort like the IBM PC was just one of hundreds vying for attention and resources. It was easy for top executives to get distracted by the latest challenges or new opportunities. Intrapreneurs had a double visibility and selling challenge, both internally and externally. Corporate entities operated under strict competitive and accounting rules. For example, IBM was always under scrutiny for potentially impacting small competitors, equitable contracts, and meeting the reporting and disclosure standards for public companies. Internal legal reviews and required new processes were slow to finalize. Even with these extra challenges, the IBM PC was developed and delivered in 18 months--at that time faster than any other mixed hardware and software product in IBM's history. This was done while breaking all the rules for using outside vendors, and publishing all the interface specifications for the first time, leading to a booming after-market for external entrepreneurs. That experience helped me to understand the excitement, determination, and satisfaction of an entrepreneur, and it made me a better one when I later worked for and with several real startups in Silicon Valley. But like most current entrepreneurs, I'm still learning, and still anticipating the next round of technology and change. I still enjoy the journey as well as the destination.

Home / News / BMW CEO Announces New Key Strategy Pillars for… BMW CEO Announces New Key Strategy Pillars for the Company News | October 24th, 2016 by Gabriel Nica 0 Tweet As you may very well know, BMW decided to keep most of its Board of Management members in Munich during the Paris Motor Show at … As you may very well know, BMW decided to keep most of its Board of Management members in Munich during the Paris Motor Show at the beginning of this month to discuss about the fast changing future of the auto industry. For a company such as BMW, playing catch up is not an option and the management has to find a way not only to keep up but also to be on top of the wave of changes hitting the industry. A lot of people have also wondered what solutions their brainstorming meetings have squeezed out and little has been said about this topic so far. However, in a recent interview with Automotive News, Harald Krueger, the CEO of BMW announced that the company he is running now has four new key strategy pillars that it will be relying on in the near future. According to the aforementioned publication, Krueger, 51, who became CEO in May 2015, said the four key elements of BMW’s new strategy are: automated, connected, electrified and shared. “Our company has always driven progress in the industry through its technical innovations. Now, a new era of individual mobility is about to begin. We aim to become the leading tech company and innovation driver in the field of mobility,” Krueger added. In order to do that, the Germans have ongoing contracts signed with a variety of companies from around the world, including old enemies. For example, BMW together with Daimler and Audi are now co-owners of Nokia’s HERE Maps division, an acquisition without which an autonomous and automated future can’t even be taken into consideration. However, the core cooperation contract for BMW seems to be the one signed with Intel and Mobileye that will allow them to develop a truly autonomous car. Unlike other companies out there though, BMW considers that a standard needs to be established, one that would differentiate the solutions proposed by various car makers. In this regard, the work BMW, Intel and Mobileye will be doing will be shared on an open platform for autonomous driving to help bring together partners from various fields of expertise. Last but not least, this autonomous future will also bring something people have been waiting for quite some time from BMW: a new interior. As Krueger put it, “If you drive with an automobile that is highly automated, you need a new interior and feature connectivity because you may want to watch a movie during driving.” What that will mean for the BMW brand is hard to predict but let’s hope we won’t lose everything that we love in this process.

While Microsoft held a similar event last year in October, this year's show is expected to include less hardware, with more of a theme around 3D and creativity. That theme will extend directly to an expected Surface all-in-one device, and details on Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 software updates. For all of the details on what to expect we've put together a full preview of the event below. The event itself kicks off Wednesday, October 26th at 10AM ET / 7AM PT. As always, you'll be able to follow along with our live blog for immediate updates on Microsoft's announcements. Windows 10 updates Microsoft's big focus with this event is Windows 10. The software giant is planning two major updates to Windows 10 next year, and the first is expected to arrive in March. That's less than six months away, so we're expecting Microsoft to detail most of the new additions coming to Windows 10 early next year. Some new features are already being tested with Windows Insiders, including new trackpad changes that allow Windows 10 users to fully control and customize gestures on a trackpad. Microsoft is getting close to offering customization on the level of the BetterTouchTool for macOS, and it's a welcome change after years of trackpad neglect on the Windows side. Microsoft hasn't started publicly testing all of the new features that are coming early next year, though. There's a F.lux-like feature arriving that will reduce blue light in Windows 10, alongside a new "HomeHub" feature that is designed to help control smart devices. Microsoft is also bringing its Holographic shell to Windows 10 PCs, and we've yet to see exactly how that works on desktop and laptop PCs. Surface all-in-one PC The big news from Microsoft's event will be a new Surface device. While Microsoft has typically launched tablets and laptops under the Surface brand, its new all-in-one device will be an attempt to reimagine the desktop computer. Microsoft is expected to unveil an iMac competitor, but with a few twists. True to Microsoft's form of surprise hardware features with Surface devices, the all-in-one Surface device is expected to include a large display (24- or 27-inch) that will use a hinge to lay flat on a desk. This could make the all-in-one a lot more like the original Surface table device, and it will be interesting to see what software Microsoft uses in this flat mode. Expect to see touchscreen and stylus support, and a focus on being able to create 3D objects and Holograms with Microsoft's new Surface hardware. Microsoft patent hints at potential all-in-one PC "Get ready to get creative," said Microsoft's Windows and devices VP Yusuf Mehdi on Twitter recently, referencing the October 26th event. Microsoft's own event invite also includes "imagine what you'll do," suggesting that this entire event will be about creativity. That creativity has been largely limited to a stylus and touchscreen on desktop PCs, but devices like HP's Sprout have attempted to push into new areas of 3D scanning. If Microsoft is serious about HoloLens and 3D object creation, then an Intel RealSense camera on its Surface desktop PC would make a lot of sense. If Microsoft does add such a camera, then how it uses it could be the most creative aspect of this new Surface device. Microsoft is also expected to unveil new Surface PC accessories, including a keyboard and mouse set that leaked in FCC filings recently. 3D and creativity Microsoft's creativity focus will also extend beyond just hardware. A new Microsoft Paint app leaked recently, providing an early look at how Microsoft is overhauling its famous paint app for a Windows 10 era. The new app is designed to be a Universal Windows app with pen- and touch-friendly features, and the ability to create 3D objects. The 3D objects feature is key, and it appears to be the main focus of the app. Twitter user WalkingCat discovered launch videos for the new Paint app, and references to a "Beihai 3D ecosystem" alongside 3D versions of Skype and PowerPoint. It appears that Microsoft is building some type of 3D ecosystem, with Windows 10 at the center of how it all interacts across multiple devices. October 26th could be a good time for Microsoft to start detailing its 3D ambitions. HoloLens and Xbox A focus on 3D wouldn't be complete without HoloLens. We're not expecting to hear about the next version of Microsoft's headset, but it's clear the company is planning to let others create their own HoloLens headsets. Part of that will involve the Windows Holographic shell appearing on Windows 10, and the ability to plug headsets directly into this environment through a Windows 10 PC. Microsoft has only teased how this works so far, without providing a full demonstration of exactly how it imagines 3D holograms will improve the Windows 10 experience on a PC. We're expecting to see some demonstrations around the interaction between a virtual or augmented reality headset and Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft is focused on the idea of mixed reality experiences for both VR and its own AR headset, and it needs to demonstrate why this matters for VR headsets and beyond. Microsoft will also likely discuss its cross-platform gaming efforts for Windows 10 and Xbox. We've seen Xbox Play Anywhere, but there's still a lot of work to be done to combine gaming across the two platforms. While Microsoft is planning to release its new Project Scorpio console next year, we're not expecting to hear any significant updates on Scorpio or a console unveiling at the October 26th event. Microsoft's own Amazon Echo Microsoft is preparing to launch a "HomeHub" feature in Windows 10 to control smart internet-connected devices, but rumors have also emerged of a separate "Home Hub" device with Cortana. Windows Central reports that Microsoft has an Amazon Echo competitor ready to unveil on October 26th, with Cortana built-in. The voice-activated speaker is said to include the ability to store files on the device, and respond to questions just like Alexa. If Microsoft does reveal such a device then it will be up against strong competition from Amazon's Echo devices that have integrated hundreds of third-party apps and features. Google has also unveiled its Home device, and Apple is rumored to be working on its own Siri-powered hardware. Microsoft's own Cortana-powered device will have to do more than just answer questions. No Microsoft Band 3, Surface phone, Surface Pro 5, or Surface Book 2 Microsoft has killed off its potential Band 3 hardware, so don't expect to hear anything about new fitness hardware. Likewise, any new phones from Microsoft will not appear at this event. Microsoft has downscaled its phone operations, and it's still not clear if the company will even create a Surface Phone. Microsoft is also expected to refresh its Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices early next year, so don't expect to see any updates to either device on October 26th. There had been rumors of Kabylake refreshes for Microsoft's Surface tablets, but the main focus of Microsoft's event this week will be the company's new Surface PC.
