Packing rather outdated specs but performing at par with the best machines available on the market, the premium-priced devices attracted both acclaim and criticism from conventional users and die-hard Apple fans alike. If rumors are any indication, however, this year would be a completely different story, as the MacBook Pro 2017 is speculated to address several issues that were prevalent on the 2016 MacBook Pro. One area where the MacBook Pro 2016 definitely lagged in was its processor. Shipping with 6th-generation Skylake chips, the MacBook Pro 2016 was quite underpowered compared to rivals that were already on the market. For the MacBook Pro 2017, however, Apple seems intent on ensuring that the upcoming flagship laptop would feature the best and latest processor that Intel has to offer, according to a TechRadar report. Thus, while the Cupertino-based tech giant took its time, it seems that 2017 would finally be the year when Apple would embrace Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors. Switching to Kaby Lake processors would give the MacBook Pro 2017 a necessary speed boost, especially since the laptop itself is designed for professional users. After all, the MBP line has always been geared towards power users, and previous iterations of the laptop have succeeded largely in this respect. With Kaby Lake processors, Apple would not only be catching up to the competition, it would finally make the MacBook Pro 2017 a device that is worthy of its name. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The rumored Kaby Lake upgrade for the MacBook Pro 2017 also opens up the possibility of a 32GB RAM option for the upcoming devices. One of the most disappointing aspects about the 2016 MacBook Pro was the fact that its most premium configuration topped out at a modest 16GB RAM, which is adequate for conventional use but severely lacking when the device tackles professional-grade graphics-intensive applications. With a 32GB option for the MacBook Pro 2017, Apple would be able to address this issue, finally offering a noteworthy configuration for the brand’s loyal power users. Apart from the MacBook Pro 2017’s Kaby Lake processor and 32GB RAM option, rumors are also high that the upcoming laptop would be packing a far superior battery pack than the 2016 model, according to a Gotta Be Mobile report. Despite promises from Apple that the 2016 MacBook Pro would last long hours away from a power outlet, complaints of poor battery life immediately saturated forums about the 2016 MacBook Pro after its release. Apple eventually addressed these problems in an update, but the current MacBook Pro’s battery life still leaves much to be desired. With the MacBook Pro 2017, Apple is expected to improve the device’s power consumption. This would already be made possible by Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, which consume significantly less power than the 2016 model’s Skylake chips. Intel, for one, has stated that its 7th-generation chips are capable of true 4K playback for up to 9.5 hours. Since Apple is known for optimizing its product’s software and hardware, the idea of the MacBook Pro 2017 having battery life that goes beyond 10 hours is very plausible. Considering that the MacBook Pro 2017 would mostly include incremental upgrades from the 2016 model, speculations are high that the device would come with one particularly unique feature that would justify the model’s release. With this in mind, speculations are high that the time might be right for Apple to debut a sharper display for its flagship laptop model. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Apple debuted the Retina display years ago when it released the iPhone 4, and since then, the Cupertino-based tech giant has remained as the standard in the industry when it comes to screen resolution. Over the years, however, Apple has seen its rivals meet and exceed its displays, and today, the MacBook Pro’s Retina screens are nothing special when compared to those utilized by its rivals. Considering that a pin-sharp display is one of the MacBook Pro’s trademark features, speculations are high that the 2017 model would debut a Retina 2.0 display, a superior screen resolution that would exceed the best that the tech giant currently offers. Details about the MacBook Pro 2017’s display are scarce, but speculations are high that the device might feature a 3,200×1,800 QHD+ panel, which would be a significant upgrade over the current model’s 2560×1600 resolution. Despite being seldom refreshed, the MacBook Pro is one of Apple’s strongest brands, and it shows in the current-generation devices’ sales. Since its launch, the laptop, even with its outdated internals, limited RAM and battery life issues, remains as one of the most competitive products in the portable computing world. With the MacBook Pro 2017, however, Apple has every chance to make its flagship laptop not only worthy of its name but worthy of its reputation as well.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsMSFT Stock: Microsoft Takes Aim at Intel’s Server Dominance MSFT Stock: Microsoft Takes Aim at Intel’s Server Dominance The server market has just gotten a bit more competitive. March 11, 2017 WSP Ever since we can remember, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) seems like the only brand that comes to mind when it comes to server chips or PC processors. That may soon change, however. As announced by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), its Azure cloud system may soon be running on servers built with ARM-designed processors. Apparently, they have developed a Windows OS version specifically designed to work with ARM processors. Although the processors are not yet available to customers and Microsoft itself isn’t even actually running the processors yet, the chips are currently being tested for a variety of applications including big data analysis, machine learning, search and storage. If everything works out as hoped, Microsoft’s ‘gamble’ on these more power-efficient and less costly chips might pay off handsomely for them. ARM is better known for their mobile processors. But since the company was purchased last year by Japanese Telecom and Internet firm SoftBank, it started working aggressively on more than just mobile phone chips. Among its new ventures are chips for supercomputing applications, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and of course, the kind that can potentially challenge Intel’s domain — server chips. While it is not yet entirely clear how extensively Microsoft intends to adopt ARM chips, vice president of Microsoft’s Azure cloud division Jason Zander says that they are making a ‘significant commitment’ to use ARM’s new silicon server chips. “We wouldn’t even bring something to a conference if we didn’t think this was a committed project and something that’s part of our road map,” he explained to Bloomberg. Zander was obviously referring to the 2017 Open Compute Project U.S. Summit in Santa Clara, California. After being so used to all of their data centers running on Intel x86 processors, Microsoft ‘surprised’ everyone on opening day by demonstrating a Windows Server running on ARM processors.  The demonstration basically confirmed that Windows OS is no longer exclusive to Intel x86 chips. Now, Windows OS customers have a new option for running a Windows Server — ARM chips. Microsoft worked with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Cavium Inc (NASDAQ:CAVM), both of whom design motherboards that use ARM chips. Qualcomm has its Centriq 2400 processor (with 48 cores) while Cavium has its ThunderX2 ARMv8-A (with up to 54 cores). Both designs are based on Microsoft’s Project Olympus which was introduced last year as the company’s open source data center server design. While Intel has clearly established a stronghold on the server front, and this isn’t really the first time that they are being challenged, it’s the first time that they may actually be threatened as chip makers have somehow caught on and are now showing signs of being seriously competitive. Knowing Intel, they aren’t about to take the situation sitting down. Which means we may be seeing more improved processor chips in the near future as challengers and the reigning industry leader strive to outdo each other. And that will be good for us customers. After all, the effect of competition brings product quality as well as lower prices.

Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, also paid a behavior analysis firm operated by two former FBI agents. Flynn disclosed that information to the Justice Department earlier this week when registering as a foreign agent for the Turkish government. It is unclear what services Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, sought from the retired intelligence officials. Flynn Intel’s filing, made under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, is notable for its detail and timing. Flynn was fired from the Trump White House last month in a row over phone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador in December. Flynn Intel’s foreign agent disclosure reports show that it waged a public relations and congressional outreach campaign as part of its work for Inovo BV, which is owned and operated by Ekim Alptekin, the head of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council (TAIK) with ties to the Turkish government. Alptekin also coordinated a meeting between Flynn and two high-ranking Turkish government officials in New York City on Sept. 19. On that same day, Flynn, Trump, and then-Sen. Jeff Sessions met with Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Maximize Your Linux Laptop’s Battery Life Laptop manufacturers spend a lot of time tuning their device drivers for Windows battery life. Linux usually doesn’t get the same attention. Linux may perform just as well as Windows on the same hardware, but it won’t necessarily have as much battery life. Linux’s battery usage has improved dramatically over the years. The Linux kernel has gotten better, and Linux distributions automatically adjust many settings when you’re using a laptop. But you can still do some things to improve your battery life. Basic Battery-Saving Tips Before you do anything too complex, adjust the same settings you would on a Windows laptop or MacBook to maximize battery life. For example, tell your Linux laptop to suspend—this is what Linux calls sleep mode—more quickly when you’re not using it. You’ll find this option in your Linux desktop’s settings. For example, head to System Settings > Power on an Ubuntu desktop. Screen brightness can affect battery life dramatically. The brighter your display backlight, the worse your battery life will be. If your laptop has hotkeys to change screen brightness, try them—they’ll hopefully work on Linux, too. If not, you’ll find this option somewhere in your Linux desktop’s settings. It’s available at System Settings > Brightness & Lock on Ubuntu. You can also tell your Linux desktop to turn off the screen more quickly when it’s inactive. The laptop will use less power when its screen is off. Don’t use a screensaver, as those just waste power by making your computer do more work and leaving the display on. You can also disable hardware radios you don’t use. For example, if you don’t use Bluetooth, you can disable it to gain some more battery life. Head to System Settings > Bluetooth to disable Bluetooth on an Ubuntu desktop. If you’re not using Wi-Fi, you can save a bit of power by disabling that, too. On Ubuntu, head to System Settings > Network and enable “Airplane Mode” to disable Wi-Fi and other wireless radios. Remember that what you do with the laptop is also important. Running heavier software and using more CPU resources will cause your laptop to use more battery power. For this reason, you may want to look at a more lightweight desktop environment, such as the Lxde-based Lubuntu instead of the Unity-based main Ubuntu desktop. Install Proprietary Graphics Drivers (If You Need Them) If your laptop has integrated Intel graphics, congratulations. You shouldn’t need to worry about power management issues with your graphics drivers. Intel graphics aren’t the fastest, but they have excellent open-source driver support and “just work” out of the box. If your laptop has NVIDIA or AMD graphics, however, you may need to do some work to decrease power consumption. The worst case scenario is a laptop with NVIDIA Optimus or AMD’s switchable graphics. Such laptops have two different GPUs. For example, an NVIDIA Optimus laptop will have both a more powerful, battery-draining NVIDIA GPU and a less powerful, battery-friendly Intel GPU. On Windows, where this is properly supported, the laptop is designed to use the Intel graphics until you play a game, when the NVIDIA graphics kicks in. When you install a Linux distribution on an NVIDIA Optimus laptop, your laptop will use the NVIDIA graphics all the time by default, draining your battery. You’ll need to install NVIDIA’s Linux drivers and set up Optimus—look for the nvidia-prime package on Ubuntu—to make things work properly. On some laptops, you may also be able to enter the BIOS or UEFI firmware settings screen and disable your discrete GPU to force Linux to use only onboard graphics without any additional tweaks. Even if you don’t have a dual-GPU, switchable graphics setup, you may benefit from installing the proprietary NVIDIA or AMD graphics drivers. They may enable access to power-saving features that don’t work in the standard open-source drivers. Check if Your Battery Needs to Be Replaced If you’re struggling with battery life, it’s possible you need to replace your laptop’s battery. All batteries will deteriorate over time, gradually holding less power than they did when they left the factory. For example, on Ubuntu, you can open the Power Statistics application from the Dash. Look at the “Laptop battery” section. “Energy when full” is how much power your battery can currently store when it’s fully charged. “Energy (design)” is how much power your battery could originally store when it’s fully charged. Divide “Energy when full” by “Energy (design)”, multiple the result by 100, and you’ll get a percentage. For example, in the screenshot below, we’d do the following math: (44.8 / 54.3) * 100 = 82.5% This means the battery currently holds 82.5% of its original capacity. That’s not too bad. You won’t be at 100% unless you just purchased a new laptop. But if it’s low—under 50%, for example—and you aren’t getting much time out of your battery, you may just need to replace the battery. If you don’t have the Power Statistics application on your Linux distribution, you can get this information via a few terminal commands. Open a Terminal window and run the following commands: cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_full

cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_full_design Divide the first number by the second number and multiple by 100 to get the percentage of the battery’s original capacity. For example, for the screenshot below, we’d do the following math: (5901000 / 7150000) * 100 = 82.5% This means the battery is currently at 82.5% of its original factory capacity. Advanced Battery-Saving Utilities That’s all the low-hanging fruit. There are many low-level tweaks you can make to slightly affect battery life, but they’re generally a lot of work for not much payoff. There are a variety of tools that promise to help you with your battery life, but they’re less useful than they once were a few years ago. Linux distributions automatically configure various settings to function well on laptops. Intel’s open-source PowerTOP utility will examine your system and see how well various power-saving features are enabled, even providing some suggestions for how to reduce your system’s power consumption. It’s a command-line tool, so you’ll need to run it from there. You’ll usually find it in your Linux distribution’s software repositories. For example, to install and run PowerTOP on Ubuntu, you’d open a Terminal window and run the following commands: sudo apt install powertop

sudo powertop --calibrate If you’re really struggling and need more battery life, you can install TLP. It’s designed to be a single package of aggressive battery life tweaks. It’s available in Ubuntu’s software repositories as well. Just install it and restart your system—that’s it. TLP automatically starts at boot and enables its default power-saving tweaks. For example, TLP will more aggressively suspend USB devices, park your hard drive’s heads, and throttle your CPU. These may not be ideal tweaks if you already have solid battery life on your Linux laptop, but they may be helpful if you’re struggling to squeeze more battery time out of your system. For example, to install TLP on Ubuntu, you’d run: sudo apt install tlp You can then restart your system and TLP will automatically start at each boot. To avoid restarting immediately, you can launch it by running: sudo tlp start You probably shouldn’t mess with TLP if you’re happy with your laptop’s battery life. But it’s a good last-resort option that beats manually enabling all these aggressive tweaks. There are other tools like TLP, but you can only use one at a time. They change most of the same settings under the hood. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Chris Hoffman is a technology writer and all-around computer geek.

Guru3D.com » News » AMD Previews Naples - The 32-core Server Processor with 8 channel memory AMD Previews Naples - The 32-core Server Processor with 8 channel memory by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 03/07/2017 08:11 PM | Source | 23 comment(s) AMD today took a significant step into the server and datacenter market and is releasing some info on their upcoming high-performance CPU for servers, codenamed "Naples". This is going to be a real game-changer in that segment of the market as it does everything Intel does, but better and with more of everything. Designed to disrupt the status-quo and to scale across the cloud datacenter and traditional on-premise server configurations, "Naples" delivers the highly regarded "Zen" x86 processing engine in industry-leading configurations of up to 32 cores. These 32-core processors can handle 64 threads. Basically Naples is a two-socket server chip pitted against Intel's Broadwell-EP-based Xeon E5 V4 range. AMD's chip is "have more of everything." Naples has 32 cores and is capable of 64 simultaneous threads, eight memory channels, supporting up to 2TB RAM per CPU and 128 PCIe 3.0 lanes.  These setups will get eight memory channels, and everything can be doubled up on a compatible server motherboard. That's 64-cores SMT and 128 threads with up-to 16-channels of memory. That memory can run 2400/2677 MHz per channel. The memory controller is also capable of using bigger than 16GB DIMMs and in total you could fit 4 TB of DDR4 memory. The Naples processor (well SoC) connects to whatever you need it through over a 128 high-speed I/O-lanes mostly Gen 3. This means you could connect 4 GPU's, 12 NVMe-SSD's and some fast 10 GigE Ethernet ports to go along with it. When you couple two processors in SMT, the IO is shared though and 64 lanes will be used for the interconnect in-between the two Naples processors. Each Naples processor has four Zen based 8-core dies interconnected. --- Superior memory bandwidth and the number of high-speed input / output channels in a single-chip further differentiate "Naples" from anything else in the server market today. The first processors are scheduled to be available in Q2 2017, with volume availability building in the second half of the year through OEM and channel partners. "Today marks the first major milestone in AMD re-asserting its position as an innovator in the datacenter and returning choice to customers in high-performance server CPUs," said Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager, Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business unit, AMD. "'Naples' represents a completely new approach to supporting the massive processing requirements of the modern datacenter. This groundbreaking system-on-chip delivers the unique high-performance features required to address highly virtualized environments, massive data sets and new, emerging workloads." The new AMD server processor exceeds today's top competitive offering on critical parameters, with 45% more cores1, 60% more input / output capacity (I/O)2, and 122% more memory bandwidth3. "It is exciting to see AMD back in the server conversation with a new CPU and a sound strategy for why it is the right processor for the modern datacenter and the cloud computing era," said Matt Eastwood, senior vice president, Enterprise Infrastructure and Datacenter, IDC. "Looking at the product details announced today, it sounds like a compelling combination that will give IT buyers a unique new option to consider when making their next upgrade." "Naples" features: A highly scalable, 32-core System on Chip (SoC) design, with support for two high-performance threads per core Industry-leading memory bandwidth, with 8-channels of memory per "Naples" device. In a 2-socket server, support for up to 32 DIMMS of DDR4 on 16 memory channels, delivering up to 4 terabytes of total memory capacity. The processor is a complete SoC with fully integrated, high-speed I/O supporting 128 lanes of PCIe 34, negating the need for a separate chip-set A highly-optimized cache structure for high-performance, energy efficient compute AMD Infinity Fabric coherent interconnect for two "Naples" CPUs in a 2-socket system Dedicated security hardware  AMD will deliver two presentations on its datacenter strategy and upcoming products this week during the Open Compute Summit.

Intel will still rule pro segment. the ball is in AMD's hands... but isn't sure they will get the point here. schmidtbag Maha Guru Posts: 1352 Joined: 2012-11-10 #5403309 Posted on: 03/07/2017 09:02 PM Seeing how good Ryzen is for professional-grade tasks, I'm sure Naples will be a massive threat to Intel. The Opteron 6300 series was pretty competitive for their time and was hundreds of dollars cheaper than the competing Intel. Naples is competing with CPUs that will likely be thousands of dollars more expensive. Saving over $1000 per CPU is a big deal for companies.

From what i understand, companies that buy this kind of hardware are more concerned with other metrics like pure performance, performance/watt, energy consumption and software licenses costs. This doens´t mean that the actual cpu being cheaper than the ones from Intel doesn´t matter because it does. It just means that companies are more worried with other things. But the important thing is that Naples seems good enough for AMD to gain some server market, something that AMD really needs because of the huge margins of server cpus.

Logan Booker Mar 13, 2017, 9:45am ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories cpus hardware pc ryzen windows windows 10 Share Image: AMD A new architecture from a processor vendor is always going to snag the attention of hardware lovers and their magnifying glasses. AMD's Zen, found in its freshly stamped Ryzen line is the current target and amongst all the numbers, testers have discovered something interesting; a discrepancy in the Ryzen's performance and Windows 10. But which party is to blame — if any? AMD always falls under more scrutiny than Intel, which is unfortunate, but expected. When you've played second fiddle for so long, there's a massive expectation for each new product to be "the one", the silicon jewel that restores the company to its former glory. Yes, the Athlon days are well and truly behind us, but AMD is packed with smart cookies; there's every chance one day it'll knock one out of the park. That's not to say Intel is by any means perfect. It's the king of the CPU hill, but that unchallenged position appears to have translated into relaxing its QA processes. Bugs with the company's chips have started to pop up with increasing frequency and although they've had little bearing on consumers, they are worrying nonetheless. Today, however, it's AMD under the spotlight. Allyn Malventano over a PCper, after hearing about some odd numbers from Ryzen, decided to do some digging. Here's an explanation of the issue: Initial reviews of AMD's Ryzen CPU revealed a few inefficiencies in some situations particularly in gaming workloads running at the more common resolutions like 1080p, where the CPU comprises more of a bottleneck when coupled with modern GPUs. Lots of folks have theorized about what could possibly be causing these issues, and most recent attention appears to have been directed at the Windows 10 scheduler and its supposed inability to properly place threads on the Ryzen cores for the most efficient processing. PCper even went so far as to cook up a custom app to see just how Windows was managing its threading workloads. Malventano's investigation is peppered with more graphs than a marketing PowerPoint by Microsoft's Excel team, but taken together tell an interesting story: Information from this custom application, along with the storage performance tool example above, clearly show that Windows 10 is attempting to balance work on Ryzen between cores in the same manner that we have experienced with Intel and its HyperThreaded processors for many years ... it validates that Windows 10 is correctly enumerating the core structure of Ryzen and thus the scheduling comparisons we made above are 100% accurate. Windows 10 does not have a scheduling conflict on Ryzen processors. The conclusion suggests that there is a problem, one AMD itself is looking into, but it doesn't involve Windows 10. Well, the scheduler anyway. Maybe not the definitive answer some might be looking for, but it does mean testers can start looking into other areas. AMD Ryzen and the Windows 10 Scheduler — No Silver Bullet [PCper] Comments iamskip @iamskip Mar 12, 2017, 1:34pm This video provides an interesting insight about what causes the problem, and says using a NUMA scheduler (similar to how windows manages dual socket xeon boards) will prevent threads spilling over between each Ryzen CCX unit, and hopefully reduce the issues we are seeing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40h4skxDkh4 Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Mar 12, 2017, 2:50pm Are you sure? Seems like they're pretty certain it's a scheduler issue. http://windowsreport.com/amd-ryzen-performance/ Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 12, 2017, 5:41pm The article is badly worded, "Microsoft has officially acknowledged this issue and confirmed is working on a fix." To be more clear, what Microsoft did was acknowledge the issue existed and would look into it, no confirmation of working on anything or even that any Windows component was responsible. That's not to say there isn't a software change Microsoft can do, just that nothing has been confirmed yet. Last edited March 12, 2017 5:42 pm Reply 0 Camm @camm Mar 12, 2017, 3:57pm Ryzen's problem isn't physical vs logical core handling, its bigger problem is windows scheduler is unaware that it should be treating each core complex as non-uniform memory, and thus should be allocating tasks using similar cache calls to a single core complex. What happens at the moment is that doesn't occur, causing cache misses. The addition of SMT just adds a higher chance of causing a cache miss. Reply 0 NATHAN CARTER Guest Mar 13, 2017, 1:09am Amd doesn't have a problem. Its within windows 10. Since this can be fixed with an update, I see no real reason to make a big deal out of it. Its the tinyest difference in the world to be concerned about the performance. It will be fixed. Reply 0 OzHuski Guest Mar 12, 2017, 7:36pm Here is the quick version - its a new CPU and needs lots of optimisations by both software and hardware which will all come now that the CPU is in the hands of both Microsoft, game devs and hardware manufacturers. There hasn't been a new CPU from AMD in so long with this much performance, much like the Switch, its all being blown out of proportion because everyone's watching with baited breath. The Ryzen CPUs are monsters. Intel still appears to have the upper hand for single threaded performance, but under multi threaded performance these CPUs shine. Like any tech - if your an early adopter expect these issues and let's give it time to be resolved. For those of us who aren't, we can calmly wait for the appropriate software and hardware patches to roll out. This is the line that experienced reviewers are telling people! I'll definitely be upgrading to a Ryzen CPU for both work and play. Reply 0 riddick @riddick Mar 13, 2017, 9:52am The AM4 platform has issues which will be ironed out over the next few months, that much is certain. However the higher clocked Intel cpu's (some go up to 5ghz) will still be better performing in the games that are poorly optimized for multicore processors. Intel may try and beat AMD out by simply moving to 5ghz parts, which will likely leave AMD's 4gzh processors in the dust, and given how new 14nm is, its unlikely AMD will raise stock clocks until next year (Zen2). Reply 0 Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja Mar 14, 2017, 10:35am considering Ryzen are not gaming chips, i actually really surprised how well they are holding up in gaming tests compared to Intel's chips. the next 6 months will be most interesting for sure. exciting times ahead. Reply 0 Jiggle Counter @jiggle_counter Mar 13, 2017, 10:54am I swear we've had this issue back in the bulldozer days. Benchmarks came in and they were crap, and AMD said it's an OS issue, wait for Windows 8. Reply 0 looncraz Guest Mar 13, 2017, 9:30pm Difference this time is that we can make changes ourselves and see the difference very clearly... and it's sometimes as high as 25%, whereas Bulldozer only had 5% or so to gain. Reply 0 Mediasearchprogram Guest Mar 15, 2017, 9:22am Will be discussing this in a video, during testing we saw they were using windows 10, AMD even state that they did their primary testing on windows 10. This being the case they didn't forsee this bugs? I could be wrong but if you are doing testing on a new chip and using windows 10, you can't exactly blame the OS. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

AMD designed these processors for PC gamers, creators, and enthusiasts with 8-cores, 16-threads, and the new AM4 desktop platform. As per AMD, their flagship Ryzen 7 1800X is the world’s highest performing 8-core desktop processor, and Ryzen 7 1700 is the world’s lowest power 8-core desktop processor. AMD also demoed that Ryzen 7 1800X outperforms a similarly configured 8-core, 16-thread Intel Core i7-6900K in Cinebench R15 multi-threaded and Handbrake-based video transcoding. The AMD Ryzen 7 1800X costs $499, less than half of what Core i7-6900K costs in the market today. Unfortunately it seems Windows users on the latest version of Microsoft’s desktop OS will not be able to get the maximum benefit from the high performance, good value solution. A bug has been discovered in the Windows 10 Scheduler which limits the performance of AMD Ryzen CPUs. The issue is due to the difference between how Windows treat threading between Intel and AMD processors. For Intel hyperthreading it appropriately prioritizes the main thread and gives secondary threads lower priority. With AMD processors it treats all the threads as equal, meaning lower priority tasks are treated the same as higher priority tasks and overall performance suffers. Another bug also incorrectly identifies the amount of cache available per thread, with the Windows 10 Scheduler thinking each thread has 136 MB of RAM rather than the actual 20 MB available in the L2+L3 cache combined. At present the issue is only believed to affect Windows 10. Windows has had scheduler issues in the past, so we are sure a solution is only a software update away. In the mean time users can disable SMT in the BIOS to improve performance in gaming, but for more multi-threaded work it may be better to leave it enabled.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   WH, Pence: None of us knew about Flynn’s work for Dutch firm with Turkish connections posted at 12:01 pm on March 10, 2017 by Ed Morrissey Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES This seems like a rather large oversight in the vetting process for a national security adviser, no? During the general-election campaign, Michael Flynn and his consultancy did work for a Dutch firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Flynn only disclosed the connection this week after a Justice Department investigation forced Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents. The White House insists that they knew nothing of Flynn’s work, but that raises the question — why not? President Donald Trump was not aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, the White House says. The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey’s government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action “an affirmation of the president’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.” At the White House, asked whether Trump knew about Flynn’s work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said, “I don’t believe that that was known.” Asked about the revelation by Fox’s Bret Baier, Vice President Mike Pence declined to offer his own personal feelings about the story — except that it reinforces the decision by Donald Trump to ask for Flynn’s resignation (via The Blaze): .@BretBaier to @VP: "Doesn’t that mean…even if he didn't lie to you abt what the Russian amb said…you would have had to fire him anyway? pic.twitter.com/a92CPmHrEA — Fox News (@FoxNews) March 10, 2017 BAIER: The story today that former national security advisor Michael Flynn has filed with the Department of Justice as a foreign agent for making more than $500,000 as a lobbyist, essentially, for Turkey. Your reaction to that, considering that, doesn’t that mean, Mister President, that even if he didn’t lie to you about what the Russian ambassador said or didn’t say, that you would have had to fire him anyway? PENCE: Well, let me say, hearing that story today was the first I heard of it. And I fully support the decision that President Trump made to ask for General Flynn’s resignation. BAIER: You’re disappointed by the story? PENCE: The first I heard of it, and I think it is, ah, it is an affirmation of the president’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign. First, let’s point out that the work Flynn and his firm did was not directly involved with the Turkish government — at least, not officially. Their client was a firm located in Holland owned by a Turkish businessman. As Sean Spicer pointed out during the presser yesterday, there was nothing illegal about the work, or “nefarious” either, as Spicer put it — “as long as the proper paperwork was filed.” That, however, is the rub. While the firm was based in Holland, Flynn met with Turkish government officials in September in relation to their client’s work, and the owner has ties to the Erdogan government as well. According to CBS, some of the consulting touched on a very sore point in US-Turkish relations and not just business between a Dutch firm and the US: Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric who Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials- including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican – as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn’s company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan’s son-in-law. Alptekin told the AP he set up the meeting at a New York hotel between Flynn and the two officials while the officials were attending U.N. sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation’s weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Small wonder, then, that the Justice Department demanded that Flynn register himself and his firm as foreign agents. Flynn resisted doing so, and his client still thinks he didn’t need to do so. “It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey,” Alpetkin told CBS, “but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government.” Even so, Alpetkin’s membership on that economic board and the meeting with Turkish government officials raises all sorts of red flags about Flynn’s work and the potential for conflicts of interest — which is why the US requires foreign agents to register in the first place. Let’s get back to the question of why no one discovered this before appointing Flynn as national security adviser. The incoming administration should have already looked at Flynn’s client list at his consulting business for potential land mines, given that Flynn’s consultancy would necessarily rely on leveraging his military and intelligence experience. In fact, one would have thought that the campaign would have vetted Flynn earlier than that, especially given some of the issues surrounding other early Trump campaign figures like Paul Manafort. This is an own goal, an unforced error, which is why Pence seems to be gritting his teeth when telling Baier that he’d just heard about this for the first time. Since Flynn had already been given the boot, this is less consequential now than it might have been had that been the first issue that came out rather than the more-explicable conversation with the Russian ambassador during the transition. This should be a learning experience for the Trump administration about the need to vet even friends of the president when it comes to making appointments.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Michael Flynn talks to reporters as he arrives at Trump Tower in New York in November, after the presidential election. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) By Ashley Parker By Ashley Parker March 10 Follow @ashleyrparker Attorneys for Michael Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, informed the incoming White House legal counsel during the transition that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent — a phone call that raised no alarms within Trump’s team, despite the unusual circumstance of having a top national security post filled by someone whose work may have benefited a foreign government. The firm Flynn headed, Flynn Intel Group, was hired last year when Flynn was an adviser to the Trump campaign by the Netherlands-based firm ­Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin has close ties to Turkish President Recep Tay­yip Erdogan. Although the contract ended after the election, new details about the work Flynn did for Inovo resurrect the controversy over his short tenure as Trump’s top national security aide. The national security adviser is supposed to be an honest broker within the executive branch, pulling together military and diplomatic options for the president so he can decide what policy to pursue. But Flynn’s work potentially benefiting Turkey meant he was representing the interests of a country other than the United States at the same time he was advising Trump on foreign policy during the election. Flynn’s firm was paid more than $500,000 by Inovo for public relations and research work, including looking into exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who resides in Pennsylvania. His extradition is being sought by Turkey, which has accused him of fomenting a coup attempt last year. Flynn wrote an op-ed on Nov. 8 for the Hill newspaper in which he called for Gulen’s extradition — a controversial diplomatic issue for the United States. “The primary bone of contention between the U.S. and Turkey is Fethullah Gülen, a shady ­Islamic mullah residing in Pennsylvania whom former president Clinton once called his ‘friend’ in a well circulated video,” Flynn wrote. “Gülen portrays himself as a moderate, but he is in fact a radical Islamist,” he wrote. Flynn resigned from his White House post last month after just 24 days on the job amid reports he misled Vice President Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. But the disclosures this week about Flynn’s ties to Turkey underscore how the specter of the controversial retired lieutenant general still hangs over the White House.  On Tuesday, Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department identifying himself as a foreign agent who was paid last year to do work that could benefit the Turkish government.       Then on Friday it was revealed that Flynn’s attorneys twice told Trump’s legal counsel team of his possible plans to register as a foreign agent — once in a conversation with Don McGahn, Trump’s counsel, before the inauguration and then in a conversation with another member of the White House legal team during the administration’s early days, someone with knowledge of the situation told The Washington Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. (Daron Taylor,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) A White House official confirmed both calls, the first of which was reported by the Associated Press, but said that Flynn’s attorneys had simply been seeking guidance, which Trump’s legal team said it was unable to provide. Trump was never informed that his top national security pick felt he might need to register as a foreign agent, the White House said Friday.  Dan Pickard, a partner at Wiley Rein and an expert in the Foreign Agents Registration Act, under which Flynn registered, said it is unusual but not unheard of for a senior campaign official to also be registered as an agent of a foreign government. “I’ve been aware of people who are registered under FARA being involved at relatively senior levels of a campaign, but in my experience that’s more the exception than the rule,’’ said Pickard, adding that the legal burden of complying with FARA “is relatively modest.’’ FARA was passed in the run-up to World War II as a means of making pro-Germany activists acknowledge whether they were receiving financial support from that country. For some in Washington, the political appearance of being a paid agent of a foreign government can be more problematic than the actual legal issues, according to others well versed in the law. Some political campaigns have asked FARA registrants in the past to notify them of their status if they attend a fundraiser, and some operatives are wary of being publicly associated with a foreign government. The controversy over Flynn’s ties to Turkey illustrate why. Nearly four weeks after his departure, the White House still can’t seem to escape Flynn.  In a week when the administration is making its biggest legislative push yet, White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s Friday afternoon news conference was yet again overshadowed by unflattering reports about Flynn — with Spicer devoting precious time to defending a staffer who no longer even works for the administration.  “The burden is on the individual to seek the legal advice or professional expertise to decide what they have to file and not,” Spicer said, parsing his explanation as to how someone who might have had to register as a foreign agent was hired as national security adviser. “It’s not up to the transition attorney to go through someone’s livelihood and determine what they need to seek,” Spicer said. “They were given the proper legal advice at the time, which was to seek expertise in that matter.” On Thursday evening, in an interview with Pence, Fox News’s Bret Baier pressed the vice president on reports that Flynn had registered as a foreign agent lobbying, essentially, on behalf of the Turkish government. “Well, let me say, hearing that story today was the first I heard of it, and I fully support the decision that President Trump made to ask for General Flynn's resignation,” Pence said. “The first I heard of it, and I think it is an affirmation of the President’s decision to ask General Flynn to resign.” However, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent Pence a letter in November asking for more information on Flynn’s “apparent conflicts of interest” because of his and his firm’s lobbying work, specifically mentioning Flynn’s work in Turkey. Asked why the letter did not pique Pence’s interest or why the vice president never alerted Trump, Spicer said, “It’s not a question of raising flags.” “It’s not for us to adjudicate whether or not someone needs to file under, you know, the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the FARA registration act, that’s not the job of a transition attorney,” he said. “It’s to tell them to seek additional counsel or to explain to them where to find that information, not to tell them what to do or not to do.”  When Flynn resigned last month, Trump defended his national security adviser as a “wonderful man” who had “been treated very, very unfairly by the media.” On Friday, it remained unclear whether Trump had changed his assessment of Flynn in light of the latest disclosures. But, Spicer said, the White House expects “every employee to follow the law.” “I can tell you the president has made clear to every person in this administration, you are expected to live up to the high standards that he has set for them and that if you don’t you will be dismissed,” the press secretary said.  Devlin Barrett contributed to this report. politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

And and bills you know. He didn't quite eerie noses is coming in and and these moves make it right now two are also win now and in an update way. Where I I think it. See he's fully aware. Building Super Bowl team it's such a difficult and as he or at. Has on hand and he could set the mob for you know two years winning right now might make making good moves so. If you didn't do that. Why keep drop below and it was in particular because. I think that they really liked the saddle us I think day it maybe maybe he'll crop blows more along line member years. But considering the Brady's career and what they can get project and where they aren't too keen anticipating having to operate year to more why not just go percent. Considering that they've definitely put a high priority development. You know make pictures on the roster at the indices and oil. Yeah I mean you're drawn out that they do things and thanks Mike for the call you draw that they do things for maybe a two year window you draw you used the phrase two year went to he has. Why not for. Anyone a full. You know I eight. This thing to patrons can do next dot she's in that mold it you'd think and that opened in this thing up for another two years at that I mean. I don't wanna get into all they. Did chest content with this year and next. I don't see that I see them doing things to give them a great chance next year and a great chance to hear that but I don't know that that's. It's going to next offseason and he repeated. Shell. This idea that they only days Brady only as two years left I don't think that's true they should nickel and readiness for a and some think we've done this offseason might set a shot to make us real serious run this year and next. The week also drew some the next Nazis of the offseason after that. Maybe you quiet somebody put. Martellus Bennett. Didn't break the bank in Green Bay getting. Seven Miller sees it. I was surprised to see that. 321. Mel's seven Alice she's. I was surprised I thought that that would go apparent attack millions isn't a tripod 910 Mel I was surprised 67 million for Bennett. I mean your throat is all in right now all comment out there some people Don that today and net. If that would a case I mean. What do you say hey let's get better at 70 yeah IG alma trying to not join Allen may trick for Dwayne Allen. But they got Donna you know they got a a kid and Dwayne Allen who was three years younger. I also don't want to deny. The fact that. Alan not only is three is on. Each shot a contract not to long ago. And that they re on his block and he says he wants to be the best block it oh yeah. So if Britney is going to be young guy. Any kids get older that some people called in and voice their concern about. Our offense of why pop up blocking up front eyes a tight end blocking tight and actually. Absolutely you consider with some issues with that late in the season the candidates and a door that you know what. Maybe put it irreverent about Dwayne Allen block in as a tight end. And they just set this thing up for Tom Brady I don't know that the Allan moved. Tells me and it just digital for just next year and up here that the air that Allen is on a contract and he's three years on and about it. So I mean I don't look at these moves and think to my and and think to myself hey. This is it next year the last few of liberty I don't think that at all. I think they locking in with Brady for the next three may be fought all of that lets see how it plays out. You know if it what is the way people have tried to tell me it's gonna play out they picked it seems to have success next year. If they have success chipped it does happen it's gotta be because Bernie and if it is because pretty. I gaunt and and make it to another AFC championship what you cut ties a break. I'll be stupid. That would be stupid if Brady comes out next year and you know he's one of the worst quarterbacks in the league it looks like you know forty Israeli hit a mod. And it eat and I can't really do anything else ya then that argue have a conversation this conversation be I don't. How you could jump from what you just saw from a pretty as he's in the back. That extreme. We have forty hits and hits upon ansari. On starred Tom Brady one day is going to be bronze and can't then and he's going to be too old to play this gamut but I don't think he's fallen off the cliff. As Max Alamo like to say right now chart I don't see it I think Tom Brady takes good care of his body. I think this needs to be said for that. And that you know you got 232425. Year old plays in this league who doll. Yes you know they're outdated they look all jacked up but. You know big on that they Chad Ochocinco route eat mcdonalds. Every male and nick. You know just because dip and is younger than Brady. It does it mean that. Because that numbers on paper that there are in better shape than Brady all they're not gonna get infected by an injury as much Brady would. I don't probably better I think wishing you forty got a piece of paper and would pick up the sky is fallen for the guy. I just think he takes two good care of his body fat to be the case and that you saw that last year. 6177797937. Blobs in lol it's about. The LA area has just let's talk quickly about. Something they haven't heard. Lake. It's certainly cattlemen say he's just in the EU's seamless. You know doesn't you don't know who's thrown the ball the genie Collins. You know that the ownership in the coaches have gone in packaging Collins about what. Drop below as like may be east feeding him information he had this guy is the real deal. I might. Name IP. I had to get of the day Bob I don't all the Jamie Collins is insight. On an island team's quarterback even though he was on the same team as Jamie Collins I don't know if that's the reason in Cleveland would be out there. Get ready to give up the king's ransom for for someone in trade. I think Cleveland probably. You know I I think it probably had people in all the places I mean is a reason why. Like there's a reason why. They made. Legal camper. That juries want to made it legal for coupled that's because they knew people doing. And you know if this tamper and the legal time period. This tampering in the illegal time to yourself I mean in Cleveland bet they don't like or apple is what he could be aren't there a pretty good grasp on Barack. Did did some come from any college every other body pressing Iran understand that. I don't know the Cleveland makes it traded doesn't make a trade based. What Jamie Collins says about a quarterback that was once on his deep I don't have. I don't think that. Is will they get all of their Intel unindicted they're about to give up and I say a ball because I believe it's aberrant they're about to give up a boatload of picks. I would never have wanna squash the idea number one I doubt that they didn't the number one overall number one miles Darius was that the best prospects and two as peppers but there's I'd extremely doubt. I'd. I mean I doubted to date on I don't soup. But I will say basically but does make them move. I'm not going to be shocked. But I don't it with yet clear would you be I think it's not a day well. It's easy for us to shape deck as we see number one overall we get all worked up about number one. You're you're she did you seem like a draft junkie I you. And it could mean up before this current. Guess what you'll and the rest of the draft junkies out there usually not overall and he gets all up about these number one picks it's like Christmas every day it. What do you think about it. And ice shaping a basketball and the NBA. Celtic tonight at pebble and overall. They could get Montel faults. They could get one still ball. Don't we put these kids up all of a sudden we see one overall. We put a mop on a pedestal and they can do no wrong and bad you know the second coming it's I'm sorry. I I have a tough time by an end to it as much as maybe a draft junky like you've does I just pitched for shop that. We don't goal which we don't know what type of play is going to be an NFL but also all he's not a quarterback. I she teams that have used the number one pick. That is not a quarterback like Argentina used to and I want to ought to quarterback and we've seen an hour I'm just telling you. If Cleveland is gonna make a deal what the patriots if they think that is below one thing all the not. Pulled that up and they really want the kid they've done all this stuff to make it happen. And they believe he's the guy. It's would be I'd go Rob Lowe is the number one overall Dutch it would be like it would be like Jimmy G and number one overall and I just wish you'd have to look at it. Is if you put a rubble and college football last year. What drop will be the number one over overall pick. Ultimately I think that's how Cleveland plain has gotten ahead may be internally as we speak. Is grapple. Number one overall if he was in college Lester. If if he was just in the draft and we need a quarterback would we be taken grow up in his bid what is point five. We're ready do. And if that's a question yes. Then they have to consider moving the number one overall pick I'm sorry as much you'll fight he'd be in love with it because you're a draft drug and their other guys don't. Quit needs to be real themselves and and you wrote this thing up against the wall and not make him a fantasy pick up fancy tray Cleveland of the patriots of course I don't immediate. Really think number one overall I don't immediately think that of Cleveland you should throw that the trade is should try to keep that and trade number twelve overall. With a couple of the picks sure obviously. A perfect world that you do that. If you are Cleveland and don't look at a new talk rappel ownership he was in college last year and we had about one overall pick would we be taken drop on a one overall. And if it internally they say to themselves. Yes guess what you have to consider a move it if that's the one singled up the pack. You'd be you'd you'd be cheat yourself out of somebody that you'll need desperately as an organization. Cleveland. Is sold. Just not even on anyone's radar in the NFL when it comes the you know we've been a successful organization why. 'cause they don't have a quarterback they could go out and get the best pass rusher in the game against watch if they got any utterance drawn pic after pic after pic but I'm not gonna win. It's got to continue. It's gonna continue and then you can look at and say we just missed the ball. On a kid who has been on the Brady's Wang whose line on the ballot Jack whose land the patriot way and we we we decided to hold on to number one overall. It should. It's it's easy to say you can't give up that pic but as you got a stud common and love you pick the guy that got traded that pick is gonna be not just the start but the franchise strangest times a quarterback in a position you read this time. What are you don't hold not a tech. I. I'm not trying to tell you that mom. Should nail my palm palm saying give the patriots number one overall. I'm. Myself and Cleveland's Rome and in negotiation room right now with the rest of the front office and on guys. We have done all this stuff to get the quarterback. If we get to a point where the patriots. Win big demand and that pick. You know but I had no phone at all it's time iPhone app if they're demanding number one overall yet because they want we just wait a gym is a free agent. Well because dad not at that point. Yaris and one you risk it may be someone else jumping and right because if if if he comes bridge all the sudden. As one. He thought he is as George and I get a lot of it is his choice could you would take a job Cleveland. Yeah yeah it is this some type a deal also be worked out when it comes to contract I get back. But. And who knows I mean SL. IRL but. Both that I mean I guess that question simple. When it comes the just free agency. You know goal or you law. Is it is is I think an option you do not wanna give him. It's not like I'm where I want to control and I think I think Jimmy is gonna try to do not think Cleveland's number one the I. I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it's. It's given at number one overall I don't think it clean I was not I don't think they were just hang the phone up and that the pitcher to the man I don't. I don't think they should hang a follow up on at 61777979376177797. 9837. More of phone calls at this time I'll. 61777979837. On me until 6 o'clock and then Saturdays gate takes Alba on taking patriots phone calls. Up until that not haven't seen not heard anything crazy. And the last couple volleys from the patriots Staal before I did jump on at 3 o'clock today. The pats signed former ravens defensive lineman Lawrence guy to a four year contract. The deal is worth a total of reportedly twenty million. Sell on the pats have got a lot and if your patriots fan I don't know how you would be upset. With anything that does happen that's fine and I still think. More has to calm we got Iran ital I haven't heard anything on him yet. All quiet on the high dollar fraud Dodgers market for a while ago said the pats are keeping a close side on yeah. Based as they should as they shut. No question. So wait. So wait and drop below but I'm I'm keeping an eye on Cleveland because the reporter earlier today from Mary Kay Cabot was that. The browns. We are out there attempted to trade Brock also violent and their fifth round pick for a third round pick. And if they could get a third round pick odds while and a fifth they were gone they just got to cut offs while. Eight is sixteen now. What does that tell tells you get set themselves up to. Make a move to add a quarterback some ball at least the attempt to get another draft pick ethnic Ari added a draft pick from the trade. Which Houston Oz while. I Cleveland set not to jump to drag and I would think that it has all to do with Jimmy grapple and the patriots but we shall see 617. 77979837. Danny's employment it's up then. They were adopted what's happened I'd. Now that much ID. But the first round pick mean. Roger Goodell come up to the podium that they would number one pick. The New England Patriots throughout the community not rule. Out now up from Atlanta. I haven't gone that. Yea I haven't thought and it now because my theory with it is this if I would say that let's say Cleveland wants to get not to know like. Screw what we want optimal given number one overall and the patriots and what. My dear would be that the pitchers do not make that pick they would like trade down and they would trade down to three overall and get a boatload of picks next. Adult ousted doing what is the biggest part of it doesn't throw a lot. As he's doing now. Pats don't accept the traded to L draft day Syria to announce the trees are just they don't Atlanta. And a yeah it's been a period RO I go there again but it wears a draft Philly. Dressed in Philly. And lash out at Adobe in Atlanta. It was a personal. Or. Optic. I hadn't thought of that actually called they had not not that I was really does have a conversation during the break me in diapers a day we were talking about well. You know if it if that did happen and it was and not a scenario where the patriots somehow did get number one overall from Cleveland. In my head my initial thought would be is no way to pitcher to make that pick I don't care how good the guy did is they will take number three. Overall. They'll trade down to three and get a boatload of second third round is in the future I'd but if my other judges that the pot of I'm good Dell and mountain it. Right the last. He's. And the birds Ricci is. You might get any rain adored it OPEC keep the pick. Allison Texas what's up now. Accordingly. Or present you with two scenarios. With the rubble that they get watched grow up. If he's traded if all the skeptics. They're critical or as pieces for the next couple years. They copy that Josh to apologize for the two year contract. Back separate. And there's really don't port it all except. Consider is if they don't trade dropped below at a ship to life. What's going on here it is. That have been all the moves contradictory to what is that history is. That make them what it was time. Nineteen you know they're going nineteen though with six Super Bowl. And Brady. And Belichick note that this is created last year and acorn might even though with a six. I I love wary ahead that would in nineteen LL. Blog at. I told earlier someone else had this idea you know from the bad men. Take in the field. Somebody gonna beat the pats as good as they could be. I I wouldn't put my money on nineteen now I hope I'm wrong I hope I be wrong we'll look to see it. It's just shelled tough it's so tough to do and it. Let's say you're right let's sales write a tell Elvis and they are told someone earlier in the show the first ballot if Al's right patriots do I don't schedule is a great season. Tom Brady. If Tom Brady has that type season. A competitor that he is as good does this team would be a dynasty still attacked. His blocks away. Yards away from that and editor of front nine and all. General I think what we're getting crazy with nineteen at all I mean. I stand there and beaches. Have been out here nineteen in all. I. I don't see it. I help run helped pick duke on ninety you know. If I'm wrong Al from Texas right and someone else who called it isn't the same thing people tweet me about a joke if there right just what. Called plum pretty is like NDP the regular season MVP of the super ball. Plan that is planned better than he did last did they blocks away. It's who they assume pat deprive play an opening day no. The Atlanta Falcons. I've. I'm like I'm not even. I'm not I'm not the end but the schedule that I get tough schedule. Oh no I've despite his funny yes it is funny but when it comes that the bag and took the call was talking about would Brady and his future. Mean you tell me that they don't nineteen and all next year if you are right the point that I feel young Nagin. Should be gut. Brady isn't hang up after app. Is how I feel. Pick a night you know two big approves a pretty not on any talk anyway. Think what is it. Is it the he has a perfect season. And and is thought or is it pace shows up. You know forty hits a mud. And struggles and he's not but this evil he's done eagle which like I did I don't understand. It's an insane thought because if you're a professional organization. The National Football League especially. You'll do everything you can hold on to this type of special player as long as you can't. Don't go perfect and a lock Whitbread. As a competitor is and you know what. The people who say well it's gotta be different with different Brady the appellate judge gonna do a Belichick got to new. I don't rule out and I said this many times I don't rule out that Brady and zoos Korea with a different team. I just hope they could happen next year the sheriff that they are that are maybe not Peter and a navy when he is 4445. He's still trying to hang on. This doesn't seem like a guy who's still just hang in all this guy whose plan at the top. Of you know his game as much as he's better at stopping. At an elite level. And it. As much as I don't believe even maybe when he is 4445. He could be planned for another team and just try to be hang on somewhere else. For right now all we're Brady has private. I don't think I don't think this is the same. I don't think you handle this the same as everything else because this is such unique situation to have Brady play in this good at this stage. At a point where if you actually listen a ballot check and the way he talks about operating. Rating keeps him on his tells. Attract a senate Brady keeps bella check on his toast no chuckles I. It yet before I feel like every big play Afghan Iran. Whether they're on CBS or fox or is again on NBC they have just one on one should dollar Pallet Jack. And he's he's raven of operating is that you know what. You gotta be on on your toes he keeps me on my dad. I could say well this team doesn't do this. And Brady will come to me with a regular season game from 2011. And say no and we thirteen in the third quarter they did this. And you get like what. Is right. Like Belichick talks about Brady like that and I aged you know she got. And net so I don't think he handles this a little bit differently because I believe as much as Belichick knows he's a great coach. You know they're pretty helps him be a great coach I pick vice Versa Brady repelled. Belichick Brady words sent. Sol. If you actually listen I'll Belichick talks about operating. I don't think he just moved on from Brady is easy as some people like bank and take you read this outrageous perfect season but some people like to have. Next yet. I. Got on I put my money that I take the field as a patriots lose at least one. But let's say I'm wrong and and you are right is a perfect season what unit Brady's is gonna get up and walk away and you had the patriots just move on mammal want to move on from. I don't dead because if they are that good. That means Brady's second. And Brady's good you don't just walk away from that chart you know. On to Connecticut it's at all. I guess that that I would GM for a new England and now Cleveland I have oh win win trade for these tools. I would trade. Grapple oh. For. 21 round pick. Or opt for a second and third round pick. For the next two years that I have a question. How is upload defensive back being paid that forty million usually given election. In a year or isn't given forty million dollar one. I paid I wanna say I served pretty big knob and it's going to be paid out than a big chunk of that forty mill is going to be paid out in the first two seasons. Was it was it won eight of the forty in the first the it was a big chunk. And the first two. But. Delaware would be guaranteed. Is. Sick with Gilmore. Now you do what do you do you again on the you do have to bring Butler into it but I'd see I'd bring Butler and that conversation differently now that people bring it. All the people look at a goal that means but was gone. I look at it gullible that means they believe they can get pulled Gilmore and thought well on the it team. Had a pretty good rate in 2070. If pot is going to be there on the three point 91 mill and it you know. Gilmore is going to be there we'll talk about average annual. Of what that their team. Then there's. Not a bad deal. Not a bad deal. It's at 89 male. Where a guy I I just. Amazed. I'd look at Gilmour shot him. And I think to myself. This is the move debt is a just in case we do lose Butler not a willows and well let's bring in a replacement this is they just in case. You know we moves on to an offer sheet. If we lose some in now next year if we franchise I'm. And he goes and and we cannot get a couple first round his arm. Standing near that if that happens then we'll have we know we have to noble locked up. A five year contract and we don't feel laws on the 26 got to turn twenty seven's. The contract. He's locked up for five years is back loaded. And I got you'll head out and have a forty million to the fourth year. This Britain is Garin forty mil guaranteed right yes. Yeah see. I just think. He's a pro bull cola. Five and a set of budget talk fighting NFL. 26 point seven is all. I think if you can get Malcolm potluck at the discount rate of three point nine on which it looks like I I still think that's going to be the case. That's that's pretty good deal through guys and seventeenth young cornerbacks are pretty good deal. I'd that's how I look at him I look out of his tag him and some people say Gilmore means bot was out I look at it as a package deal they have got about a balls they have money control. That I'm not saying that that's fit in a kid it's not. You know and I know. But it's a rule. And the patriots got to try to take advantage of every role is if they're dedicated Knoll. But if that's the way plays all out and you have Gilmore on that contract and Butler only three point I'm on now. Utter I get that in that. I really don't. And considering I tell back on top of it as he doesn't he can't get the big contract that he wants help him. I mean one thing I'm not gonna do today is complain about the patriots offseason I think that is the last thing up. I should do and I think that's the last thing you should do so far the patriots a win in the offseason and I thank you it's fair to say you could. You could proclaim them off season champions already after only two days has it taken Eagles under normally wins losses yeah. At least this one could result and another championship six point 777979837. More calls at this time I'll. I wrapping up the show me until six. And the boys from Saturday's game it will take all the I'll talk about the Bruins went at home against the flyers Drew Stafford. With the game went out five point nine seconds left in regulation he was on the right half wall that a little bit Iran and got to try on Matt. Rosie and Bruins when they beat the flyers to Dejuan. At home against Saturday's game begins at 6 o'clock so keep the phone calls coming in 617. 7797983761777979837. I am taken to patriots calls. For the next couple minutes let's go to ten and lol attempt him. And it can happen on any. What is agent situation. For Brett I am local police sting any. You know they'll bet that you canceled the one that brought you. And and I I would like to see the patriots. Social. Loyalty to guys get approval for its. And it particularly well I haven't minded the I want ital back to your note about the situation to track you need a restricted free agent but I'll be very disappointed that it'll bring back right cholera that money to expand on not on Gilmore. Okay and the second on the point I want to make witchy Dini is we got the draft. I watch a little bit of traffic com mine and that it would like to complicate it when the Columbine was opposite order a lot deputy shot. And my feeling is that that may need to Belichick is stating I read it straight at it for a second and they're well technically it strapped. It isn't that they get policy but it is wrapped that it is worth holding people in the tropics flock. That's Amman. Well I I get that but at the same time you know if they did get their hands on a first and a second. You know they could probably take those picks and trade them for future draft picks. Granted that it that it kind of which you want to drop all the situation to be any I mean it just me. I mean like the play poker and I don't know that anybody football and a poke player but don't go check. But I think it accomplished UK game you can all of our own you can squander gospel. Valuable asset pitch Eric the sign. You know obviously a quick look at the future report so policy pretty dark were actually. It's worth and all content grapple review and also a strategic Egypt but when Dexia. Tactic to read it that the bill is so well for the best flop. Possible package. And it in the long run I think between will be a lot going back but I'm telling you I guess we got it bill we trust you'll liable for the best you. Out and you know what sex of the called Tim and Grady we trust still I think you could also throw that out there. As good did you might think or Rob Lowe could be. Is never gonna be Tom Brady OK I mean it's not interviewed Vicki is. The most spoiled sports fan. I have ever heard in my life it's just need to did you can't even ask or expect that to be the case. You can't torrid. So I mean I just feel like it's never got to get madness it's not. I'm British what you have. I say that no and I think we're talking about this it's never gonna get better than this. Is he raising defending Super Bowl MVP. In the regular season MVP conversation. Maybe argue the reason he didn't win it was because he was suspended the first morning. If we pick the patriots are gonna go well. And have this great season based on all the things that they've done this off season and Brady is the guy that leads them to the promised land once again. Main. Wouldn't have a tough time walking away from that and Hamdan. The keys to the cod to a guide you think is gonna be pretty good but I could guarantee you will not be all have a will be as good as somber. Start I just have a tough time pick up the data Belichick's philosophy. Especially seeing an all things data plan out and the dots that I've connected that I tried to help you connect the last. Week I have. The last week up. And yes. This show after report has forced a lot of people to scratch their heads and all it. In not true. Triple digit eggs that they gonna. Do it would think that would gonna. Rock Iowa. If they don't get a third round pick odds while pick like why. Pictured referred to protect what it exist to make a trip. We heard about Cleveland and the patriot make this trade at all. Now it looks like it's also. Just wait for the break includes. Because out of chapter reported its. Should we believe that it's not gonna happen I mean that's what I don't often take a step back and look at common sense. And think that some things maybe are a little insulting to our Dell is. It could be insulting to our intelligence. All they want it to be but here's the big. I connect the dots I still see that I shot the pride didn't get that from the patriots but what I see that the saints actually trade Brandon cooks. To the pats put a number 32 overall pick. A deal that the saints rejected this time last week. Well. My theory is that the patriots then told Jeff that Ed cannot trade. Drop below because. They didn't want the saints to continue to ask. For what the same stock the patriots were gonna get a girl apple which is the number twelve overall pick from Cleveland. Example we let the saints and all that went on make this move. They can't just to tell you to report that cannot trying to grapple. Acropolis traded. Not gonna look it's shaft his reputation is not going to be row and he gets one Ron had a 250. What they do. Check this pride going to be I wanna reported if Grupo does get traded. And it brings me back my like my theory. That the patriots told Jeff that they weren't trading grapple because they wanted to get coached and on the 32 overall sit and they when they get the trade. A Cleveland they. Have that they can not saying they admit that I would know twelve overall pick it probably trade out. But you'd get more value for the number twelve overall pick Daniel would dirty joke what are. You would. I think that's how the patriots planet and if they don't trigger up all that net. I'll be shocked because then I'll be (%expletive) no wonder what the plan as I got to franchised or upload yet this season. Because that's the only way you could trade him next year by put the franchise tag on. And if you put the franchise tag on grapple. If usual amount of around what you got passed up an hour franchise and out about it sounds like they wanna play the game upon. Which is it's not fair to the kid but it's the rules that we're gonna do. I don't tenable said that there is an age thing in the draft but cornerback is super deep in this draft so if there is it deep stave off as a super deal is this I'm just Samper got no idea Malcolm Butler. Is gone the Nate can still draft again and have a cheap guy. Yeah I would hold on a knock Obama I'm not over Butler. You know on on what angle on what nimble played again you are. If you it's gonna give you the money that you want. First round pick them several match. But that's not gonna happen I don't think it's a first round pick and Albers had Abbie he's gonna hold out good. The picture it'll just look and say hey you know what it's three point I want to tell you we just got stamp on you'll. Though. That he wants but holed out an op play it has any effect in his next contract. It's not kid but that's what is you hold on the public. Until somebody else gives him the offer that he wants and then if that's the patient you can always magic if you really wanted to keep him around I would not. Move but I want it. I would move Rob Lowe and I think that's an extent I Tolle I'd like to see him back but. But I don't know what he's gotten LP it's just too quiet and high tell affront to me this literature is going to be back I don't know what else to be offered I really don't. So I can't compare any deals and what the patriots could give them I don't know what he's being offered it's been way too quiet I have no idea what I caliber what I do know is. Jimmy grapple always not hacked. I'm sorry he was I think this going on Iowa Cleveland. You would go to Cleveland stormed this set the table for a trade and the patriots what they leaked the shaft that they would set the table for a brand could straight. Which they only got to give up 32 overall and they didn't have to give up one of the. The first round picks they got from Cleveland. And this saint folded first and then next step. Is to trader Rob Lowe and on the twelve all world. It's gonna happen it doesn't I'll be shocked. Dave nice job on the glass. Saturday's game is coming up next.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business A World without Wi-Fi looks possible as unlimited plans rise UPDATED: SATURDAY, MARCH 11, 2017, 4:01 P.M. By Olga Kharif Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Ethan Merchant, 20, of Students 4 Seniors, uses his cell phone to search for an answer to Richard Paul's cell phone Wi-Fi issue during a Senior Empowerment Fair, Sept. 14, 2016, the Clare View Seniors Community Room in Spokane, Wash. (Dan Pelle / The Spokesman-Review) The Wi-Fi icon – a dot with radio waves radiating outward– glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favor Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behavior.” At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker. The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Intel Corp., Qualcomm and Comcast. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers – mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum – or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers – risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. LTE-U – and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA – will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 Wi-Fi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said. Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts. “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of Wi-Fi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the U.S. Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” Updated: March 11, 2017, 4:01 p.m.  Tags: business, communication, internet, Netflix, smartphones, Technology, wi-fi Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Microsoft's Project Olympus, the tech titan's open-source cloud server initiative, has turned its attention to artificial intelligence (AI). Along with graphics card maker Nvidia and Ingrasys, a subsidiary of contract manufacturing giant Foxconn, Microsoft unveiled the HGX-1 at the Open Compute Project (OCP) Summit in Santa Clara, Calif. The multi-GPU (graphical processing unit) system specification is not only aimed at accelerating AI workloads, but also at helping to make AI-enabled servers a fixture in the modern data center. "The Project Olympus hyperscale GPU accelerator chassis for AI, also referred to as HGX-1, is designed to support eight of the latest 'Pascal' generation NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA's NVLink high speed multi-GPU interconnect technology, and provides high bandwidth interconnectivity for up to 32 GPUs by connecting four HGX-1 together," blogged Kushagra Vaid, general manager of Azure Hardware Infrastructure at Microsoft. "The HGX-1 AI accelerator provides extreme performance scalability to meet the demanding requirements of fast growing machine learning workloads, and its unique design allows it to be easily adopted into existing datacenters around the world," continued Vaid. Further reading Microsoft, Qualcomm Show Off Windows Server on ARM Machine Learning for z System Mainframes For more traditional server workloads, Microsoft is building on its collaboration with Intel. In addition to existing support for "Skylake" Xeon processors, the companies teased upcoming specifications that could potentially include room for accelerators based on Intel's field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and Nervana deep learning technologies. Intel acquired FPGA provider Altera in 2015 for $16.7 billion, forming the chipmaker's Programmable Solutions Group. Last summer, the company snapped up Nervana Systems, a developer of machine-learning software and hardware. Fresh off the launch of its new Ryzen processors, AMD and Microsoft are readying updated designs based on the upcoming "Naples" server processor featuring a system-on-chip (SoC) design based on AMD's "Zen" processing engine. Previewed at the OCP Summit earlier this week, and scheduled to ship in the second quarter, the x86 chip will feature up to 32 cores and support for eight memory channels per processor. A server outfitted with two Naples processors can have access to up to four terabytes (TB) of memory, spread across 32 DIMMS on 16 memory channels, according to AMD's specifications. "This 32-core, 64-thread CPU signals AMD's re-entry into the high-performance server market and our intention to once again be a significant player in the datacenter," wrote AMD's Forrest Norrod, senior vice president and general manager of the company's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Business Group, in a March 7 announcement. "The new AMD server processor exceeds today's top competitive offering on critical parameters, with 45 percent more cores, 60 percent more input/output capacity (I/O), and 122 percent more memory bandwidth." Microsoft and its technology partners aren't the only ones making waves at the OCP Summit. On March 8, Facebook announced an ambitious server refresh that will require the company to replace practically all of its old equipment to make room for the company's latest OCP hardware designs. (Facebook, Intel and Rackspace are founding OCP members.) Those designs include Bryce Canyon, the first major storage chassis revamp from the social media giant.

Intel's not pleased with the development. SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Microsoft said March 8 that for the first time, it has decided to start using chips based on ARM Holdings designs in the hundreds of thousands of servers that run its cloud services. The company made the announcement during the main keynote at the Open Compute Project Summit 2017 at the Santa Clara Convention Center. This isn't exactly welcome news for Intel, which has been a longtime Microsoft partner and king of the proverbial hill in the data-center processors market. Because ARM processors use less power than Intel's, Microsoft is seeking to cut costs in its fast-growing Azure cloud business. Microsoft has more than 100 data centers globally in 38 regions that are candidates for using its new cloud servers, which are based on a design called Project Olympus and powered by ARM-based chips. Further reading Machine Learning for z System Mainframes Compuware Buys Mainframe DevOps Standardware Working with ARM-server chip partners Qualcomm and Cavium, Microsoft developed a version of its Windows operating system for servers using the ARM processors. The company said it is now testing ARM chips for routine functions such as search, machine learning, storage and big data processing. "We've been working with Qualcomm and Cavium to optimize their products for our data center needs," Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Leendert van Doorn, who gave the keynote, told eWEEK. "And not just their current generation that will be out later this year--but the ones beyond that and the ones beyond that. "We've ported and tested cloud services to them, and overall, we're seeing a very compelling value proposition in them." The kind of servers ARM designs are more throughput-oriented, van Doorn said. "These are servers with very high single-track performance; these are not the ARM servers of a couple years ago, where you had lots of cores and threads, but really no performance per thread," he said. Microsoft is also working closely with the ARM mothership itself on items such as instruction set extensions, server bay system architecture and other standardization documents, van Doorn said. ARM, a British multinational semiconductor and software design company, is owned by SoftBank Group. Its primary business is in processor design, although it also designs software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands. It also develops systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. It is the market dominator for processors in mobile phones (smartphones or otherwise) and tablet computers. Microsoft's new Project Olympus cloud server, introduced last year, uses an open-source design obtained through the OCP. Both the server design and Microsoft's work with ARM-based processors are indicative of the company's internal initiative to use hardware innovations to cut costs, boost flexibility and stay competitive with Amazon Web Services and Google, which also provide computing power, web services and storage in the cloud.

Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired from the White House last month, has registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that may have aided the Turkish government in exchange for $530,000. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)More WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump was not aware that his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had worked to further the interests of the government of Turkey before appointing him, the White House says. The comments came two days after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman could have aided Turkey's government. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called the action "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask General Flynn to resign." At the White House, asked whether Trump knew about Flynn's work before he appointed him as national security adviser, press secretary Sean Spicer said, "I don't believe that that was known." Pence said in an interview later with Fox News that he also did not know about Flynn's paid work. Flynn and his company filed the registration paperwork describing $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn did so after pressure from Justice Department officials. The filing this week was the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency's first acknowledgement that his consulting business furthered the interests of a foreign government while he was working as a top adviser to Trump's presidential campaign. Flynn's disclosure that his lobbying — from August through November— may have benefited Turkey's authoritarian government led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came as Flynn has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android. In paperwork filed with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm acknowledged that his lobbying "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying contract ended after Trump's election in November, according to the paperwork. A spokesman for Flynn, Price Floyd, said the general was not available for an interview Thursday. Floyd referred the AP to Flynn's filing in response to questions about why he and his firm had decided to register this week. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment through a spokesman for his law firm, Covington & Burling. The Turkish Embassy also didn't respond to questions from the AP. Spicer said he didn't know what Flynn had disclosed about his background and lobbying work during the White House's vetting of him for appointment as national security adviser. Spicer said Flynn was free to do the lobbying work because it occurred while he was a private citizen. "There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed," Spicer said. He declined to say whether Trump would have appointed Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. Flynn's newly disclosed lobbying would not have violated that pledge because it occurred before he joined the Trump administration in January, but the pledge precludes Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the Justice Department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works to get lobbying firms back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. More than a month before Flynn was appointed as national security adviser, news accounts and Democratic senators had raised questions about potential conflicts of interest regarding Flynn's work for the Turkish company. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., criticized Flynn's work and late disclosure again Thursday as troubling. "Gen. Flynn's behavior seems to be part of a larger pattern of poor judgment from members of this administration," she said. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that Flynn should return any foreign money he received. "This astonishing admission is more appalling evidence of foreign entanglements and conflicts of interest involving the Trump team," he said. He said a special prosecutor should be appointed to look into ties between Trump officials and foreign governments. Alptekin told the AP that Justice Department officials had pushed for Flynn and his firm to register as foreign agents in recent weeks. He said the filing was a response to "political pressure" and he did not agree with Flynn's decision to file the registration documents with the Justice Department. He also said that he had asked for some of his money back because of his dissatisfaction with the company's performance. "I disagree with the filing," he said in a phone call from Istanbul. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government." Flynn's consulting firm had previously disclosed to Congress that it worked for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin. But neither Flynn nor his company had previously filed paperwork with the Justice Department, which requires more extensive disclosures about work that benefits foreign governments and political interests. Flynn Intel and S.G.R. LLC Government Relations and Lobbying pressured congressional aides to investigate a cleric whom Erdogan had accused of directing a botched coup last summer. The two firms orchestrated meetings with U.S. officials— including congressional staffers and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin, a Republican — as well as journalists. They also worked on research, informational materials and a video on the cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Flynn met privately in September in New York with two senior Turkish government officials, including the government's ministers of foreign affairs and energy. Flynn's company did not name the officials, but the current Turkish energy minister is Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law. Alptekin told the AP he set up the meeting at a New York hotel between Flynn and the two officials while the officials were attending U.N. sessions and a separate conference Alptekin had arranged. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Erdogan, who has accelerated a crackdown against the nation's weakening secularist faction since the failed coup last summer. Erdogan has accused cleric Gulen of orchestrating the aborted coup and called for his extradition from the U.S., where he lives in a compound in Pennsylvania. According to the filing, Flynn Intel's work involved collecting information about Gulen and pressuring U.S. officials to take action against the cleric. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report.

But on Saturday, a White House official said the post-inauguration conversation did occur. BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: March 11, 2017 11:59 am Follow @ATownPolitics WASHINGTON | An attorney for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump’s transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might register with the government as a foreign agent, White House officials acknowledged. According to a person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn’s representatives also had a second conversation with the White House counsel’s office after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. White House press secretary Sean Spicer talks to the media during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Friday, March 10, 2017. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) On Friday, the White House said it had no recollection of the second conversation. But on Saturday, a White House official said the post-inauguration conversation did occur. Both the White House official and person with knowledge of the discussions insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the private conversations. The disclosures Friday indicate that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn’s lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president’s closest adviser on security and international affairs. They also raise new questions about whether Trump’s transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn’s registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Flynn’s registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates’ potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump’s presidential campaign. Among those told of Flynn’s potential Justice Department registration during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn’s representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn’s work. It’s not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn’s lawyers raised the issue. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the president had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said that when Flynn’s lawyer raised the possible filing with the transition team, Trump’s attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. “It’s a business matter, it’s not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual,” Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn’s work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had “impeccable credentials.” In the filings with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November. Flynn’s filing said that he and his firm were not certain whether Turkey’s government was involved in Inovo’s hiring of them as lobbyists. The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin “consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group.” The firm also acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey’s minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Pence said he was unaware of Flynn’s foreign agent work until this week, but called the disclosure “an affirmation of the president’s decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign.” In November, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent Pence a letter warning about conflicts created by Flynn’s lobbying work. “If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it’s clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn,” Cummings said Friday. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn’t violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn’s filings, his firm’s work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen’s extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan’s government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee.

I'm a pretty terrible noob when it comes to these cards, and my recently purchased GTX 1070 is the first one of the family I can say I'll have used. I'll include my full system specs at the end to give the most information, but let me start with what I'm trying to figure out. Firstly, the games that I'm looking at running are all relatively old games: Mass Effect 1 - 3, Dragon Age: Origins, Half-Life 2 and it's episodes plus some expanded content, and Wasteland 2 the Director's Cut. The graphics card I have specifically is MSI's GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming X 8G. Which is nice, but my CPU is the i5-3570K @ 3.40GHz (3.8 Turbo (currently OC'd to 4.2)) and I have 16 GB of RAM. Again, full system specs below. So, it's a fairly old system with the majority of parts from 2012, and some newer parts switched in since. I'm looking at a few sources in regards getting the settings just right for the games, but I'm also trying to cut down on too much time spent experimenting with settings. I've looked to this post/guide on gnd-tech ("How To: Use NVIDIA Inspector to Greatly Improve Image Quality in Pre-DX10 Games") as something of a blueprint, but obviously the author has a superior graphics card and CPU (the 1080 and an i7-6700k @ 4.6 GHz) to my own. I'm only running this on a 1920x1200 24" monitor at max 59 - 60 Hertz in refresh rate (variations of V-sync enabled), but I'm curious if I can get away with 4x SGSSAA and still hold on to somewhere between 50 fps and above or not. Much thanks in advance to anyone that can give me some idea or suggest other settings to try if I'm overreaching for the best quality possible while still retaining performance.

Don't worry your setup still pretty strong Hey lexer98 and RealNC, thanks for your comments and apologies for not even acknowledging them earlier. I'm coming to the end of my first term back to school after 12 years in customer service, and it just seemed that absolutely everything was piling on. So basically, I just needed some time to keep my mouth shut and park a mountain under my butt while I thought zen thoughts. For both, I am actually currently implementing the 4x SGSSAA on both DAO and ME2 currently, with a current aim now of adding in SweetFX (or ReShadeMe, I guess). Seems to be working fine, though I have that strong desire to use FRAPs or perhaps MSI Afterburner to get a bit of a gauge of my FPS as stands. The brain is currently just not equipped to objectively judge that, Hope you both are having a good one, peace.     SergeTroy View Public Profile Find all posts by SergeTroy   Tags msi, nvidia inspector « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Indian officials said they were verifying a message posted by a pro-Islamic State (IS) Telegram channel which identified Saifullah, who was killed in an encounter in Lucknow earlier this week, as a soldier of the Caliphate. This is the first time that any IS-supported channel on mobile application-Telegram has owned up Saifullah, who was part of the alleged terror module, which planted a bomb on a train near Bhopal on March 7. An official said they were suspicious about the message as it was not posted by the official channels of IS, but by a group supporting the terror organisation and was part of "casual conversation" among its sympathisers. After initially claiming that the nine-member module belonged to IS, the Uttar Pradesh police retracted from the statement and said the group was "self radicalised" and was inspired by the IS. Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh also did not mention IS in his statement to the Parliament. He however, described Saifullah, who was shot dead by Uttar Pradesh police, as a “suspected terrorist.” U.S based intelligence website Site Intel Group posted a screen grab of the Telegram message on Twitter, which said, "Pro-#ISIS Telegram Channel Incites for Attacks in #India, Points to Suspected IS Fighter Saifullah as Example." The website also posted a photograph of Saifullah describing him as a "soldier of the Khilafah from India." The photo was juxtaposed with a message in Urdu, Arabic and English. It said, "Think not of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead, Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision." A security establishment official said, " we are verifying the message but we have seen in the past that whenever IS has claimed attack it posts pictures of its members taken much before they are killed. In this case, they have posted a photograph, which was released by the U.P police." U.P police said that the accused were self-proclaimed members of the IS and had even recovered a hand painted signature black flag of the IS from the rented house, on the outskirts of Lucknow, where Saifullah was killed. The low intensity bomb,which the other members planted o ln a train was made of potassium chlorate, which is commonly available in the market. While the home minister avoided naming any outfit for the alleged terror attack on a passenger train, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had told a news agency on Wednesday that the accused belonged to IS and had even sent the photograph of the bomb to their handler in Syria. Eight people have been arrested so far in raids across M.P and U.P.

That became apparent in a March 7 filing with the Department of Justice: Flynn registered his firm, the Flynn Intel Group, as a foreign agent of Turkey—work he did during the presidential campaign. An Al-Monitor reporter highlighted that detail after a Daily Caller report from Thursday. according to his FARA filings, Flynn paid the ex FBI official Brian McCauley $28,000 btw Oct & Dec. 5 2016. https://t.co/V84H5RqHON 2/ — Laura Rozen (@lrozen) March 10, 2017 Flynn paid McCauley $5k Oct.4, $3k Oct.13, $5k Nov.14, and $15k Dec.5, after he’d already been designated Trump NSA https://t.co/V84H5RqHON — Laura Rozen (@lrozen) March 10, 2017 The agent, Brian McCauley, told The New York Times in October that a State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, asked him to classify an email connected to the 2012 attack on Benghazi, Libya. He said this conversation happened in spring 2015, shortly before his retirement. We’ve reached out to him for comment and to figure out more about what the payment was for.  At the time, Kennedy told the Times that they did in fact talk, but there was nothing improper about the conversation. He only wanted to have parts of the email redacted since it was linked to an ongoing investigation. The attack on a diplomatic compound and CIA annex left four Americans dead. In the aftermath, then-Secretary of State Clinton fielded bad press, Congressional scrutiny over security lapses, and a defamation lawsuit. It was a long-running subject on right-leaning news outlets, so obviously, the idea of an official asking an FBI agent to bury relevant information was a big deal since Clinton was running for president. However, Flynn himself was campaigning on Donald Trump’s behalf, and his work got him a job as the National Security Advisor. He resigned from that position in February after misleading administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about a telephone call he had with Russian ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak. U.S. intelligence officials reportedly said that Moscow directed hacking efforts to help Trump win the election. However, no one has been able to prove collusion between the Kremlin, and the president’s campaign, so the revelation of Flynn’s phone conversation wasn’t the greatest thing for an already embattled administration. On top of that, Flynn has only now revealed that he did work for a Dutch firm connected to the Turkish government, and only publicly disclosed this on the March 7 filing.

Home Opinion Rest Of The Story Rest Of The Story March 10, 2017 · · 0 Last Tuesday night, President Donald Trump brought it in his first address to a joint session of congress. Now, I’m not an ideologue and, when there is not a viable two-party system, the nation suffers. In 1887, Sir John Dahlberg-Acton said, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” The warning? Power must to be shared in order to be wielded fairly. Hence, my anger with Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi and her minions. Oh, it was bad enough when you refused to even acknowledge that, “Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Sofbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others … will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” The clear message: “We intend to continue to obstruct this administration no matter how much money flows back into this country or the American people benefit.” US News on its blog said it, “Every single one of them should be ashamed of themselves.” We get it — you’re sore losers. But, when the President of the United States honors the wife of a fallen Navy SEAL, get your butt out of your chair, stand up and applaud! There was not a dry eye in America when Carryn Owens, widow of Senior Chief Ryan Owens, mouthed, “I love you baby,” as she sobbed next to Ivanka Trump. What in the H@#$ is the matter with you? In particular, Dems Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and Keith Ellison (Deputy Chair of the DNC) who didn’t stand at all. You don’t applaud this noble sacrifice. Just sit there on your rump with some of your fellow Dems? You’re such a bankrupt ideologue, you can’t even acknowledge an American hero sacrificing himself for this country? Spitting on this hero’s memory just because Donald Trump started the ovation? And, you still don’t get it when you laughed at “We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption.” I don’t know what’s so funny. Because the public wants government cronyism gone … like yesterday! And, turning your thumbs down on dismantling Obama-Care? What are you guys now — movie critics? Or, just the modern-day Caesars deciding who lives/dies in the arena of American politics? Wearing white/purple for what? Sitting there with their proverbial stick in their keister, stone-faced and proving what? They can hold a grudge over a non-existent issue? And, the mainstream media spin? The New York Times, “Lawmakers sustained the bipartisan tradition of using spare tickets to import human symbols, looking upon Mr. Trump like a mismatched orchestra … the president’s guest list … the father of a teenager killed by an undocumented immigrant, the widows of two officers killed in the line of duty by an undocumented immigrant and the widow of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia …” This pandering was disgraceful. Whether you like this president or not, frowning in lockstep and then scurrying out of the chamber like so many sore losers as soon as you could make a break — we get it! In case you missed it, citizens everywhere in this world (including North Dakota) are tired of politicians and the old tax and spend status quo. And, Dems, who are you pandering to? Because, the logical, inevitable result of this is going to be felt in two years. We don’t care about your ideology. We want a good-paying job, safe drivable streets, a final end to Islamic terrorism and a stop to illegal immigration (just to help keep you in power). Get it?

(QCOM) Stock and Trump the Bulls QCOM stock is gearing up for a leg lower. Profit with a well-placed spread. By Chris Tyler, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 9, 2017, 10:51 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Sell Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Before the Rate Hike! Sorry, RBC. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Short Now. Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Investors Should Bet on the Bears to Win Recent Posts: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock: Goodbye, Not Good Buy Sorry, RBC. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Short Now. Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Investors Should Bet on the Bears to Win View All Posts Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) saw a rare reprieve in Wednesday’s session. But traders may want to fade the modest cheer with a well-positioned, out-of-the-money put spread on QCOM stock. Source: Shutterstock After bearish jeers prompted by Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) litigation fired at Qualcomm several weeks back, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offered QCOM stock investors some slight relief Wednesday. Shares of Qualcomm rallied 1.73% after it was learned that Qualcomm’s 10 nanometer Centriq 2400 processors will power certain Microsoft Azure cloud workloads as the company accelerates its cloud platform services. That’s potentially a problem for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and the collaboration also shows Qualcomm’s commitment to an ARM-based server ecosystem. This could prove a boon in the future for QCOM stock, but there are no guarantees it will — and it certainly won’t happen overnight. Having said that, it’s our opinion there’s still a lot for QCOM stock to prove both off and on the price chart. QCOM Stock Weekly Chart Click to Enlarge When I last wrote about Qualcomm, our technical opinion was focused on the possibility for another leg higher. Shares were laterally consolidating around $66.50 and holding key support levels within an existing uptrend, while stochastics approached an oversold reading. QCOM stock did wind up rallying upward of 5% to fresh year-to-date highs, but then the trend turned aggressively bearish. An initial break of the up-channel support line was followed closely by Apple’s litigation news, which sent shares plunging lower deep into bear territory and where they remain today. The past few weeks have been spent digesting the large and technically destructive loss. Now and with the unwinding of the oversold condition in place, QCOM appears to be ready for a bearish continuation move lower. Admittedly, there is some support for higher prices. Stochastics have yet to confirm our view. Further, QCOM did hold the 62% retracement level and is now at its highest price since the January Apple-induced gap. Speaking of which, if Wall Street lore holds true, the gap is a sizable area to fill. Sometimes you just have to call a spade a spade. And for QCOM stock, this means respecting a bearish flag pattern in a stock much closer to 52-week and multi-year lows and well-positioned to challenge those lowly price levels in the coming months.

That’s especially true for the electronic components, as described by Moore’s Law. Moore's Law refers to an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since their invention. He predicted that this trend will continue into the foreseeable future. One of the most important electronics components is storage memory that has gone from huge room-sized mechanical devices in the 1960s down to smaller and smaller magnetic hard drives that now provide hundreds of gigabytes of data in a three-inch disc. Memory is basically a series of 0's and 1's that are represented in various ways, depending on the storage medium. New WikiLeaks Release Confirms TVs Used for Eavesdropping Now researchers at IBM’s Almaden research labs in San Jose, Calif., and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, described in the journal Nature, have made a breakthrough that would seem to take the size of memory down to its ultimate limits. The researchers have created a memory system represented by a single atom. The atom is the smallest unit of matter that is stable. By being able to put the atom in two different states, the scientists can now use it to represent a 0 and 1. With this accomplishment, scientists can eventually store huge amounts of data in the tiniest of space. Of course, going from this controlled experiment to storage we can buy will take many years, but it shows what’s possible. How did they do it? The scientists took a single holmium atom and placed it on a sheet of magnesium oxide to make the atom bistable. They used current from the tip of a scanning microscope to “shock” the holmium atom with a small voltage to flip the magnetic north and south poles, switching its state from 1 to 0 and back. https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/03/10/scientists-store-data-on-a-single-atom-for-the-first-time/ load more facebook Share Scientists Store Data on a Single Atom for the First Time twitter Tweet email Email Related Products The Western Story Lecture #6: The Genres of Western Learning: Novels, Plays, Poems, Essays and Treatises amazon.com History In The News Lecture #2: The 21st American Century or What Amazon or Facebook Says About America amazon.com Klavan and Whittle: Manly Men and Womanly Women amazon.com Editor's Choice The 7 Creepiest Serial Killers in American History comments Is Your Child a Stealth Dyslexic? comments 8 Great Gangster Films comments Who knew your inbox could be this informative?

Bush Presidential Library has handed over to the Senate Judiciary Committee more than 7,000 pages of documents related to President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. The documents were posted to the committee’s website Friday, and first reported by Politico on Saturday.

ADVERTISEMENT The request included any emails between Gorsuch and the White House while he was serving as principal deputy to the associate attorney general under former President George W. Bush. So far, the Justice Department has turned over more than 144,000 pages of documents on the nominee to the committee. Gorsuch, a judge on the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, was tapped for the Supreme Court last month, and has garnered sweeping support among Republicans. But his confirmation will likely need 60 votes in the Senate to avoid a filibuster, and Republicans only hold 52 seats. Some Democrats have floated the idea of blocking Gorsuch’s confirmation, citing the GOP’s refusal to hold a hearing for former President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland last year. Garland’s nomination was effectively killed after Trump took office and tapped Gorsuch for the high court. If Gorsuch is confirmed, he will take the vacant seat left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. The Supreme Court has had only eight justices for more than a year.

News Trump lawyers knew Flynn might register as foreign agent CHAD DAY, STEPHEN BRAUN and JULIE PACEAssociated Press Privacy Policy An attorney for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump's transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might register with the government as a foreign agent, White House officials acknowledged. According to a person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn's representatives also had a second conversation with the White House counsel's office after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. On Friday, the White House said it had no recollection of the second conversation. But on Saturday, a White House official said the post-inauguration conversation did occur. Both the White House official and person with knowledge of the discussions insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the private conversations. The disclosures Friday indicate that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn's lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president's closest adviser on security and international affairs. They also raise new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn's registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates' potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. Among those told of Flynn's potential Justice Department registration during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn's work. It's not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn's lawyers raised the issue. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the president had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said that when Flynn's lawyer raised the possible filing with the transition team, Trump's attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. "It's a business matter, it's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual," Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn's work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had "impeccable credentials." In the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin's company "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November. Flynn's filing said that he and his firm were not certain whether Turkey's government was involved in Inovo's hiring of them as lobbyists. The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin "consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group." The firm also acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey's minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Pence said he was unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work until this week, but called the disclosure "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign." In November, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent Pence a letter warning about conflicts created by Flynn's lobbying work. "If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it's clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn," Cummings said Friday. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee. ___ Follow Chad Day at http://twitter.com/ChadSDay and Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin “consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group.” The firm also acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey’s minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law. In an interview with the AP, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Vice President Pence said he was unaware of Flynn’s foreign agent work until this week, but called the disclosure “an affirmation of the president’s decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign.” In November, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent Pence a letter warning about conflicts created by Flynn’s lobbying work. “If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it’s clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn,” Cummings said Friday. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn’t violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn’s filings, his firm’s work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen’s extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan’s government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee. ——— Follow Chad Day at http://twitter.com/ChadSDay and Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC     Tags: flynn, flynn, house, foreign, white, government, Other stories from today: Palestinian leader invited to White House in Trump call Third protester dies as South Korea braces for more rallies What CIA WikiLeaks dump tells us: Encryption works     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of electric cars?

Gen. Michael Flynn during a town hall in Virginia Beach, Va. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — An attorney for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump’s transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might register with the government as a foreign agent, White House officials acknowledged. According to a person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn’s representatives also had a second conversation with the White House counsel’s office after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. A White House official said the counsel’s office had no recollection of that second discussion. Both the White House official and person with knowledge of the discussions insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the private conversations. The disclosures Friday indicate that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn’s lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president’s closest adviser on security and international affairs. They also raise new questions about whether Trump’s transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn’s registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Flynn’s registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates’ potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump’s presidential campaign. Among those told of Flynn’s potential Justice Department registration during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn’s representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn’s work. It’s not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn’s lawyers raised the issue. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the president had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said that when Flynn’s lawyer raised the possible filing with the transition team, Trump’s attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. “It’s a business matter, it’s not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual,” Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn’s work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had “impeccable credentials.” In the filings with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November.

Has Ryzen lured you into upgrading sooner than planned? By Julio Franco on Mar 10, 2017, 6:00 PM 89 comments TechSpot AMD has always had the underdog thing going for them. They successfully played that card in the Athlon 64 days to compete with bigger rival Intel, but then for about a decade Core processors have enjoyed the ultimate advantage: being the better product. With Ryzen, AMD has a novel product that's not only competitive in multiple levels, but projects to be a great platform to buy in the mid to long term. You've now read the reviews, you've seen the productivity and gaming performance benchmarks, but is that incentive enough to go with AMD's Ryzen on your next upgrade? For this week's open forum we ask: are you planning a desktop upgrade or has Ryzen lured you into upgrading sooner to get access to all those cores on the cheap? Are you waiting for Ryzen-based APUs, mid-range R5s models, or laptop processors to come out first? Maybe your current PC is just fast enough? Let us know in the comments below.

According to a person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn's representatives also had a second conversation with the White House counsel's office after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. On Friday, the White House said it had no recollection of the second conversation. But on Saturday, a White House official said the post-inauguration conversation did occur. Both the White House official and person with knowledge of the discussions insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the private conversations. The disclosures Friday indicate that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn's lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president's closest adviser on security and international affairs. They also raise new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn's registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates' potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. Among those told of Flynn's potential Justice Department registration during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn's work. It's not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn's lawyers raised the issue. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the president had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said that when Flynn's lawyer raised the possible filing with the transition team, Trump's attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. "It's a business matter, it's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual," Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn's work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had "impeccable credentials." In the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin's company "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November. Flynn's filing said that he and his firm were not certain whether Turkey's government was involved in Inovo's hiring of them as lobbyists. The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin "consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group." The firm also acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey's minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Pence said he was unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work until this week, but called the disclosure "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign." In November, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent Pence a letter warning about conflicts created by Flynn's lobbying work. "If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it's clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn," Cummings said Friday. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee. ___ Follow Chad Day at http://twitter.com/ChadSDay and Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

It sports Intel's newest Kaby Lake CPU, a healthy 16GB of RAM, and one of Nvidia's new Pascal-based GPUs. For a limited time, it's also $50 off, which makes it a solid purchase for gamers who don't want to spend upwards of $1,200 on a new gaming rig.  We went hands on with the Aspire VX 15 at CES and were impressed by what we saw. The VX 15 is the affordable alternative to Acer's higher-priced Nitro line. Although it trades the latter's aluminum chassis for a plastic one, we found the VX 15 still offered a sturdy feel. However, what impressed us most about Acer's new line was what we saw under the hood. This laptop packs a 2.8GHz Core i7-7700HQ quad-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Throw in a 15.6-inch 1080p LCD and Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB video card and you have the makings of a solid, budget gaming laptop. Nvidia's GTX 1050 Ti chip is making a big splash among gamers. The entry-level GPU lets cash-strapped gamers play today's top titles at medium to high settings. We recently benchmarked the GTX 1050 Ti and found that it offers slightly better performance than its cheaper sibling, the GTX 1050. It won't pass the strict requirements of an elite gamer, but it's more than sufficient for everyday gamers. All this means the Aspire VX 15 is worthy of your attention, even more so now that it's just below the $1,000 mark.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Flynn reported Turkey ties to Trump camp print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Flynn reported Turkey ties to Trump camp By Ashley Parker / The Washington Post Published Mar 11, 2017 at 12:02AM WASHINGTON — Attorneys for Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, informed the incoming White House legal counsel during the transition that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent — a phone call that raised no alarms within Trump’s team, despite the unusual circumstance of having a top national security post filled by someone whose work may have benefited a foreign government. The firm Flynn headed, Flynn Intel Group, was hired last year during the presidential race by the Netherlands-based firm Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin has close ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Although the contract ended after the election, new details about the work Flynn did for Inovo resurrects the controversy over his short tenure as Trump’s top national security aide. The national security adviser is supposed to be an honest broker within the executive branch, pulling together military and diplomatic options for the president so he can decide what policy to pursue. But Flynn’s work potentially benefiting Turkey meant he was representing the interests of a country other than the United States at the same time he was advising Trump on foreign policy during the election. Flynn’s firm was paid more than $500,000 by Inovo for public relations and research work, including looking into exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who resides in Pennsylvania. His extradition is being sought by Turkey, which has accused him of fomenting a coup attempt last year. Flynn wrote an op-ed on Nov. 8 for the Hill newspaper in which he called for Gulen’s extradition — a controversial diplomatic issue for the United States. “The primary bone of contention between the U.S. and Turkey is Fethullah Gulen, a shady Islamic mullah residing in Pennsylvania whom former president Clinton once called his ‘friend’ in a well circulated video,” Flynn wrote. “Gulen portrays himself as a moderate, but he is in fact a radical Islamist.” Flynn resigned from his White House post last month after just 24 days on the job amid reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. But the disclosures this week about Flynn’s ties to Turkey underscore how the specter of the controversial retired lieutenant general still hangs over the White House. On Tuesday, Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department identifying himself as a foreign agent who was paid last year to do work that could benefit the Turkish government. Then on Friday it was revealed that Flynn’s attorneys twice told Trump’s legal counsel team of his possible plans to register as a foreign agent — once in a conversation with Don McGahn, Trump’s counsel, before the inauguration and then in a conversation with another member of the White House legal team during the administration’s early days, someone with knowledge of the situation told The Washington Post, speaking anonymously to discuss private conversations. A White House official confirmed both calls, the first of which was reported by the Associated Press, but said that Flynn’s attorneys had simply been seeking guidance, which Trump’s legal team said it was unable to provide. Trump was never informed that his top national security pick felt he might need to register as a foreign agent, the White House said Friday. 16695794 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, who was fired from the White House last month, has registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that may have aided the Turkish government in exchange for $530,000.

Andrew Harnik AP Photo 1 of 2 i By CHAD DAY, STEPHEN BRAUN and JULIE PACE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON An attorney for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump's transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might register with the government as a foreign agent, White House officials acknowledged. According to a person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn's representatives also had a second conversation with the White House counsel's office after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. On Friday, the White House said it had no recollection of the second conversation. But on Saturday, a White House official said the post-inauguration conversation did occur. Both the White House official and person with knowledge of the discussions insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the private conversations. The disclosures Friday indicate that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn's lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president's closest adviser on security and international affairs. They also raise new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn's registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates' potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. Among those told of Flynn's potential Justice Department registration during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn's work. It's not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn's lawyers raised the issue. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the president had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said that when Flynn's lawyer raised the possible filing with the transition team, Trump's attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. "It's a business matter, it's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual," Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn's work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had "impeccable credentials." In the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin's company "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November. Flynn's filing said that he and his firm were not certain whether Turkey's government was involved in Inovo's hiring of them as lobbyists. The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin "consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group." The firm also acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey's minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law. In an interview with The Associated Press, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Pence said he was unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work until this week, but called the disclosure "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign." In November, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent Pence a letter warning about conflicts created by Flynn's lobbying work. "If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it's clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn," Cummings said Friday. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee.

Trump Transition Team Knew of Flynn's Foreign Ties - Long Beach Star Volume 5301 Long Beach Star        http://www.longbeachstar.com   Long Beach News United States News Breaking Business News Breaking Sports News Science News Breaking Sports News Lifestyle News Travel News Breaking Health News Public Health News Arts News Breaking Financial Markets News Trump Transition Team Knew of Flynn's Foreign Ties VOA Saturday 11th March, 2017 Flynn took over as U.S. national security adviser when Trump took office on January 20, but was dismissed less than a month later; White House officials said Flynn failed to tell Vice President Mike Pence about meetings he had last year with Russia's ambassador to Washington, when former President Barack Obama was still in office. Flynn and the envoy, Sergey Kislyak, discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia, it was later revealed. 'Trump was not informed' Reporters peppered Spicer with questions Friday about Flynn, Trump, Pence and the Turkish lobbying incident. The president's spokesman said an attorney for Flynn contacted an attorney for Trump's transition team to ask whether the national security adviser-designate was obligated to report his activities involving Turkey to the appropriate U.S. authorities. Attorneys on Trump's team told Flynn's lawyer it was up to him to decide whether Flynn must take further action, and that Flynn did seek further counsel, Spicer said. WATCH: Spicer Discusses Transition Team, Flynn Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, writing to the Justice Department this week, explained that his client decided to register retroactively as a foreign agent 'to eliminate any potential doubt,' and pointed out that Flynn was not directly hired by a foreign government. The owner of the Dutch company Inovo, which signed a contract with the Flynn Intel Group last August, is Kamil Ekim Alptekin, chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. Differing accounts about Flynn's role Alptekin tweeted this week: 'For the record: nobody remotely linked to the Gov. of Turkey knew about Gen. Flynn's article in advance and I wasn't consulted either.' The previous day, however, the Flynn Group acknowledged that Inovo had seen the article in advance, and that some technical changes were made based on feedback from the Turkish-linked entity. Flynn did file a separate legal document with Congress last November disclosing his role as a lobbyist for Inovo, saying he was helping the Dutch company understand Pentagon budgets. Spicer told White House reporters that filing as a lobbyist was distinct from registering as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice. 'It is not up to, nor is it appropriate, nor is it legal for the government to start going into private citizens, seeking advice and telling them whether they have to register or not,' Spicer said. 'That would be the equivalent of walking through someone's tax return and saying, 'That's not a deduction that you should take.' ' Spicer cut off several reporters who tried to ask follow-up questions, telling them, 'It's one-question Friday' - meaning he wanted to take only one question per person. The press secretary had said at the conclusion of Thursday's briefing that he would institute the informal one-question rule. Journalists persisted, however, and Spicer did take some further questions about the controversy over Flynn's actions on behalf of Turkey. Asked whether the general had disclosed his work on behalf of the Turks in applying for the security clearance he needed to work as the head of the National Security Council at the White House, Spicer said: 'I don't know the answer to that question. You should follow up with General Flynn.' Spicer echoed comments by Trump when he announced the general's appointment, repeating that Flynn was 'unbelievably qualified, 40 years in the military, with impeccable credentials.' The press secretary said Trump insists on the highest ethical standards 'for everyone who works in this administration,' and that is why Flynn had to resign: 'At the end of the day when [the president] found out that General Flynn had betrayed the trust of the vice president, he let him go.'

Gen. Michael Flynn contacted an attorney for the Trump transition team about whether Flynn needed to register as a foreign agent before taking the role of national security adviser — from which he was later forced to resign, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday. The comments came after it was revealed that Flynn had done lobbying work in in the months before his appointment that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” according to documents filed with the Department of Justice. Trump made a pledge during the campaign to “drain the swamp” of lobbyists and has been dogged by questions about Flynn and both his lobbying work and ties to Russia. “Just so we’re clear, is that a personal lawyer of General Flynn’s contacted a transition lawyer and asked for guidance on what he should or should not do,” Spicer said Friday. “The lawyer was instructed that at — that that wasn’t the role of the transition and that it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities or subject matter experts to determine what was appropriate and what was not appropriate in terms of filing. This was a personal matter. It’s a business matter.” But Vice President Mike Pence — the chairman of the transition team — said that the first time he heard of the lobbying ties was this week and not during the transition. “Let me say hearing that story today was the first I heard of it and I fully support the decision that President Trump made to ask for General Flynn’s resignation,” Pence said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday. Two senior administration officials tell ABC News that the Turkey issue was not one of the aforementioned “series of questionable instances” Spicer said last month led Trump to ask for his resignation. A source familiar with the situation tells ABC News Flynn informed the White House counsel team both during the transition and after the inauguration that he would have to file as a foreign agent because of the work he did on behalf of the Turkish government. This source could not say if Flynn first made the team aware of his situation before or after President-Elect Trump announced that he be appointing the former general to be his NSA on Nov. 18th. In a letter, dated March 7, a lawyer for the Flynn Intel Group told the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) division of the DOJ that the company had done work on behalf of a Dutch client, Inovo BV. The work was disclosed in September 2016, and Flynn’s group terminated its contract and ceased operations after his appointment, the letter says. A public disclosure was filed on Dec. 1, 2016, according to the letter. The group had planned to file under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but decided it was not appropriate. “Nevertheless, because of the subject matter of Flynn Intel Group’s work for Inovo BV, which focused on Mr. Fethullah Gulen, whose extradition is sought by the Government of Turkey, the engagement could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey,” the letter said. “To eliminate any potential doubt, the Flynn Intel Group therefore is electing to file a registration under FARA, in lieu of its prior LDA registration.” Gulen is a Turkish cleric who lives in the United States. He was blamed by the Turkish government for a failed military coup there last July. Trump asked for Flynn’s resignation in February after the former general misled Pence and other administration officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, which included sanctions being placed on that country. After the resignation, Trump blasted the media for treating Flynn “very, very unfairly” and called him a “wonderful man.” Spicer said Friday that the president was not informed of “this arrangement” or his need to register as a foreign agent. It was not clear if “this arrangement” referred to Flynn’s lobbying in general or the specifics of the arrangement. Spicer also said there should be no concerns that others in the administration have similarly lobbied on behalf of foreign governments, suggesting that Trump “made the right call” regarding Flynn back when he asked for his resignation over misleading the vice president.

The disclosure suggests that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn's lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president's closest adviser on security and international affairs. It also raises new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn's registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates' potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said Flynn's lawyer had raised the possible filing with the transition team, but Trump's attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. "It's a business matter, it's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual," Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn's work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had "impeccable credentials." Among those told of Flynn's lobbying work during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn's work. It's not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn's lawyers raised the potential filing. According to the person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn's representatives had a second conversation with Trump lawyers after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. The White House official said the counsel's office had no recollection of that second discussion. Both the White House official and person with knowledge of the discussions insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the private conversations. In the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin's company "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November. Flynn's filing said that he and his firm were not certain whether Turkey's government was involved in Inovo's hiring of them as lobbyists. The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin "consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group." The firm also acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey's minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law. In an interview with the AP, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. In an interview Thursday with Fox News, Vice President Pence said he was unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work until this week, but called the disclosure "an affirmation of the president's decision to ask Gen. Flynn to resign." In November, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent Pence a letter warning about conflicts created by Flynn's lobbying work. "If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it's clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn," Cummings said Friday. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

In this Feb. 13, 2017, file photo, Mike Flynn arrives for a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Flynn, President Donald Trumps former national security adviser, who was fired from the White House last month, has registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that may have aided the Turkish government in exchange for $530,000. (Evan Vucci / Associated Press) By Michael A. Memoli Tribune News Service Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was not aware that former national security adviser Michael Flynn previously acted as an agent of the Turkish government, the White House said Friday while sidestepping questions about whether Flynn’s lobbying work conflicted with his sensitive position. Flynn, who resigned last month, filed paperwork with the Justice Department this week that retroactively disclosed work that his personal company did last year on behalf of a firm with connections to the Turkish government. The disclosure was being made “to eliminate any potential doubt” about the nature of Flynn’s lobbying for the firm, Inovo, Flynn’s attorney wrote in an accompanying letter. He acknowledged that the arrangement “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.” The relationship between the Flynn Intel Group and Inovo began in September and was terminated after Trump’s election in November. Flynn, who was a top adviser to Trump’s campaign, was named as his national security adviser Nov. 18 during the presidential transition. He left the White House after just over three weeks on the job for misrepresenting contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Flynn’s lawyer had told attorneys for the transition of his deal with Inovo, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, and was told “to work with the appropriate authorities or subject matter experts to determine what was appropriate.” Transition lawyers gave similar advice about other potential conflicts of interest, Spicer said in explaining why Trump was not informed about the matter. “We trust people to fill out the forms that they are required to do so in an honest and legal manner,” Spicer said. Flynn’s attorney said his work for Inovo targeted Fethullah Gulen, a cleric residing in the U.S. whose extradition to Turkey has long been sought by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Flynn wrote an op-ed for The Hill newspaper on Nov. 8 calling for closer ties with Turkey and accusing then-President Barack Obama of keeping Erdogan’s government at “arm’s length,” while referring to Gulen as a “shady Islamic mullah” and “radical Islamist.” “From Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden,” Flynn wrote. Ekim Alptekin, the Turkish businessman whose firm contracted Flynn’s, tweeted this week that Flynn’s new disclosure was “flawed.” He said Flynn’s op-ed was written without input from him or anyone “remotely linked” to the Turkish government. “Gen. Flynn never engaged in lobbying work for me or my firm. And I never lobbied or contracted lobbyist on behalf of the Turkish Government,” he wrote. A supplemental filing to Flynn’s federal disclosure said that his Hill op-ed was “related to the same subject matters” as his lobbying work but was written “on his own initiative.” Updated: March 10, 2017, 9:59 p.m.  Tags: agent, Donald Trump, lobbying, Michael Flynn, turkey, white house ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Uncertainty over trade rattles tech companies print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Uncertainty over trade rattles tech companies By Ethan Baron / The (San Jose, Calif.) Mercury News Published Mar 10, 2017 at 09:20PM SAN JOSE, Calif. — That shiny new iPhone may say “assembled in China” on the back, but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the U.S. Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple — the world’s most valuable company — in the bull’s-eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration’s actions would affect a who’s who of Silicon Valley’s big name tech companies — which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow. “It’s a real mess,” said Marcus Noland, senior vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade. Only two months into the Trump administration, it’s difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish U.S. companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued. While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45 percent import tariff on goods from China and 35 percent on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10 percent fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20 percent “border adjustment tax” covering all imports from all countries. The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley’s biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more. Also standing to lose? Consumers who will inevitably have the increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts. “You and I are going to pay for it,” said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate, who studies supply chains. However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits. Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi said the proposed 20 percent border adjustment tax would “encourage Americans to buy American products” and “promote good jobs here in the United States” while raising $1 trillion over 10 years. “It will allow us to cut income taxes, which discourage people from working. It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder,” he said last week in an op-ed in The Hill. Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the U.S., potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies. “If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it’s not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward,” said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade. Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank. The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia. “Everything that is in our products comes from overseas,” Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. “That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it’s not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies.” HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, according to analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos, California. Google’s new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the U.S. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam. 16682291 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Gen Michael Flynn talks to media as he arrives at Trump Tower in New York. On Nov. 17 President-elect Trump offered Flynn the job of national security adviser. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) By The Washington Post WASHINGTON - Attorneys for Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, informed the incoming White House legal counsel during the transition that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent - a phone call that raised no alarms within Trump's team, despite the unusual circumstance of having a top national security post filled by someone whose work may have benefited a foreign government. The firm Flynn headed, Flynn Intel Group, was hired last year during the presidential race by the Netherlands-based firm Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin has close ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Although the contract ended after the election, new details about the work Flynn did for Inovo resurrects the controversy over his short tenure as Trump's top national security aide. The national security adviser is supposed to be an honest broker within the executive branch, pulling together military and diplomatic options for the president so he can decide what policy to pursue. But Flynn's work potentially benefiting Turkey meant he was representing the interests of a country other than the United States at the same time he was advising Trump on foreign policy during the election. Flynn's firm was paid more than $500,000 by Inovo for public relations and research work, including looking into exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who resides in Pennsylvania. His extradition is being sought by Turkey, which has accused him of fomenting a coup attempt last year. Flynn wrote an op-ed on Nov. 8 for the Hill newspaper in which he called for Gulen's extradition - a controversial diplomatic issue for the United States. "The primary bone of contention between the U.S. and Turkey is Fethullah Gulen, a shady Islamic mullah residing in Pennsylvania whom former president Clinton once called his 'friend' in a well circulated video," Flynn wrote. "Gulen portrays himself as a moderate, but he is in fact a radical Islamist." Flynn resigned from his White House post last month after just 24 days on the job amid reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. But the disclosures this week about Flynn's ties to Turkey underscores how the specter of the controversial retired lieutenant general still hangs over the White House. On Tuesday, Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department identifying himself as a foreign agent who was paid last year to do work that could benefit the Turkish government. Then on Friday it was revealed that Flynn's attorneys twice told Trump's legal counsel team of his possible plans to register as a foreign agent - once in a conversation with Don McGahn, Trump's counsel, before the inauguration and then in a conversation with another member of the White House legal team during the administration's early days, someone with knowledge of the situation told The Washington Post, speaking anonymously to discuss private conversations. A White House official confirmed both calls, the first of which was reported by the Associated Press, but said that Flynn's attorneys had simply been seeking guidance, which Trump's legal team said it was unable to provide. Trump was never informed that his top national security pick felt he might need to register as a foreign agent, the White House said Friday. Dan Pickard, a partner at Wiley Rein and an expert in the Foreign Agents Registration Act, under which Flynn registered, said it is unusual but not unheard of for a senior campaign official to also be registered as an agent of a foreign government. "I've been aware of people who are registered under FARA being involved at relatively senior levels of a campaign, but in my experience that's more the exception than the rule,'' said Pickard, adding that the legal burden of complying with FARA "is relatively modest.'' FARA was passed in the run-up to World War II as a means of making pro-Germany activists acknowledge whether they were receiving financial support from that country. For some in Washington, the political appearances of being a paid agent of a foreign government can be more problematic than the actual legal issues, according to others well versed in the law. Some political campaigns have asked FARA registrants in the past to notify them of their status if they attend a fundraiser, and some operatives are wary of being publicly associated with a foreign government. The controversy over Flynn's ties to Turkey illustrate why. Nearly four weeks after his departure, the White House still can't seem to escape Flynn. On a week when the administration is making its biggest legislative push yet, White House press secretary Sean Spicer's Friday afternoon news conference was yet again overshadowed by unflattering reports about Flynn - with Spicer devoting precious time to defending a staffer who no longer even works for the administration. "The burden is on the individual to seek the legal advice or professional expertise to decide what they have to file and not," Spicer said, parsing his explanation as to how a registered foreign agent was hired as national security adviser. "It's not up to the transition attorney to go through someone's livelihood and determine what they need to seek," Spicer said. "They were given the proper legal advice at the time, which was to seek expertise in that matter." On Thursday evening, in an interview with Pence, Fox News's Bret Baier pressed the vice president on the reports that Flynn had registered as a foreign agent lobbying, essentially, on behalf of the Turkish government. "Well, let me say, hearing that story today was the first I heard of it, and I fully support the decision that President Trump made to ask for General Flynn's resignation," Pence said. "The first I heard of it, and I think it is an affirmation of the President's decision to ask General Flynn to resign." However, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent Pence a letter in November asking for more information on Flynn's "apparent conflicts of interest" because of his and his firm's lobbying work, specifically mentioning Flynn's work in Turkey. Asked why the letter did not pique the Pence's interest or why the vice president never alerted Trump, Spicer said, "It's not a question of raising flags." "It's not for us to adjudicate whether or not someone needs to file under, you know, the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the FARA registration act, that's not the job of a transition attorney," he said. "It's to tell them to seek additional counsel or to explain to them where to find that information, not to tell them what to do or not to do." When Flynn resigned last month, Trump defended his national security adviser as a "wonderful man" who had "been treated very, very unfairly by the media." On Friday, it remained unclear whether Trump had changed his assessment of Flynn in light of the latest disclosures. But, Spicer said, the White House expects "every employee to follow the law." "I can tell you the president has made clear to every person in this administration, you are expected to live up to the high standards that he has set for them and that if you don't you will be dismissed," the press secretary said. - - - Ashley Parker is a White House reporter for The Washington Post.

WASHINGTON — President Trump's transition team learned before the inauguration that incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn might register with the government as a foreign agent, White House officials acknowledged Friday. The disclosure suggests that Trump transition lawyers did not view Flynn's lobbying work for a Turkish businessman as a liability for an official who serves as the president's closest adviser on security and international affairs. It raises new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn. Flynn's registration this week with the Justice Department disclosed lobbying by him and his firm that may have benefited the government of Turkey. Trump fired Flynn last month on other grounds — that he misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the United States. Flynn's registration comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates' potential contacts with Russia. The FBI is investigating, as are House and Senate intelligence committees. Flynn registered with the Justice Department on Tuesday, citing $530,000 worth of lobbying. His work on behalf of a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin occurred at the same time he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump had not been aware Flynn might register as a foreign agent. He said Flynn's lawyer had raised the possible filing with the transition team, but Trump's attorneys responded that it was a personal matter and not something they would consult on. “It's a business matter; it's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual,” Spicer said. He dismissed questions about whether Flynn's work should have raised red flags for the new administration, saying the retired Army lieutenant general had “impeccable credentials.” Among those told of Flynn's lobbying work during the transition was Don McGahn, a campaign lawyer who has gone on to become White House counsel, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team. A White House official said McGahn and others were not aware of the details of Flynn's work. It's not clear why the Trump advisers did not seek additional information once Flynn's lawyers raised the potential filing. According to the person with knowledge of the discussions, Flynn's representatives had a second conversation with Trump lawyers after the inauguration and made clear the national security adviser would indeed be registering with the Justice Department. The White House official said the counsel's office had no recollection of that second discussion. In the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., acknowledged that his work for Alptekin's company “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The lobbying on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Alptekin, occurred from August through November. Flynn's filing said he and his firm were not certain whether Turkey's government was involved in Inovo's hiring of them as lobbyists. The firm said it was aware, however, that Alptekin “consulted with officials of the Republic of Turkey regarding potential work by Flynn Intel Group.” The firm acknowledged that Alptekin introduced Flynn to two senior Turkish government officials in September, but it identified them only by their titles. The officials included in the meeting were Turkey's minister of foreign affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's son-in-law. In an interview with the AP, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration under pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that his work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee.

But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee. ___ Follow Chad Day at http://twitter.com/ChadSDay and Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Some even say they're not going to take it anymore. "It" is the result of November's presidential election. What these Californians are doing is organizing a secessionist movement -- as in, taking California out of the United States. Their movement is called Calexit, as in Brexit. Their inspiration is the growing gulf that separates them -- politically, culturally, demographically -- from the rest of the union. Hillary Clinton outpolled Donald Trump by a two-to-one margin here. "Without California, Trump would have won the popular vote," tweeted conservative pundit and Trump critic David Frum. The Golden State has a population of 39 million people, more than any other state in the union, and more people than in all of Canada. Metro Los Angeles alone is home to close to 19 million, a total greater than Ontario and Alberta combined. As Frum points out, those are numbers that come with economic clout, and therein lies the rub for many Californians. The U.S. without California, he writes, would be the world's second-ranked technology power instead of the first. It's home to Silicon Valley and companies such as Google, Apple, Cisco, Intel, Oracle, and SpaceX. California boasts the world's sixth largest economy, greater than France, Italy, South Korea and India. California is also culturally distinct from much of the rest of the U.S. It's synonymous with liberal causes, from environmental protection to gun control to health care, and that has other Americans judging Californians, and not in a flattering way. It's a reality not lost on Marcus Ruiz Evans, one of the movers and shakers behind Calexit. "California," he admitted to the Washington Post, "(is) seen as weird." That weirdness extends to politics beyond the presidential variety. Gov. Jerry Brown has vowed to ensure Californians have health insurance coverage, offered through the state-run health exchange called Covered California, even if Trump Republicans repeal ObamaCare. But where the state most hears a different drummer is on immigration. Californians are decidedly in favour of it, and it's easy to see why. California has the largest immigrant population in the union, approximately 10 million in total, a quarter of those undocumented. If you're not an immigrant in California, you know one. Or two. Or more. In response to Trump's ambitions to engage in large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants, the state legislature is considering a bill that would declare the state a "sanctuary." Lawmakers have even hired former Obama attorney general Eric Holder to battle the Trump administration on the issue. That step earned the enmity of the new president. "Trump claims California is 'out of control,' " writes columnist George Skelton in the Los Angeles Times, though the irony is undoubtedly lost on the president. Trump has threatened to cut off federal funds to California. "We'll defund," Trump told Fox News. "We give tremendous amounts of money to California." The problem is that, like residents of Canada's "have" provinces, Californians contribute more money to the federal treasury than what comes back. There has been much grousing about the Trump administration ever since the threats were levelled, fertile ground for Calexit. The secessionists even have the support of Silicon Valley billionaires Peter Thiel and Shervin Pishevar. Companies like Google have expressed concern about their ability in an ­anti-immigrant climate to recruit foreigners for jobs not enough Americans are qualified to fill. In January, the group Yes California was given permission to circulate a petition with the intention of putting the sovereignty question on the 2018 ballot. If the petition is successful -- close to 600,000 signatures are required -- a special vote to decide the state's future would follow in 2019. Calexit does have its skeptics. "Canadians know you don't escape the shadow of your giant neighbour by drawing a border," wrote Prof. Timothy William Waters in the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he believes secession is a bad idea. Such opinions are far from universal. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken in California, one-third of respondents support "peaceful withdrawal from the union." As one tweeter wrote: "We'll just take our avocados and legal weed and go."

Focused on markets in Australia, the US and the Middle East, Oneview integrates a hospital's IT systems onto a single tech platform to aid patient engagement and speed-up workflows for medical staff. Founded in 2012 by Dublin-born entrepreneur Mark McCloskey, Oneview became the first Irish company to list in Australia when it floated on St Patrick's Day last year. In its first year as a listed company it recently reported strong revenue growth with sales jumping to just over €9m, up from €2.3m in 2015. Oneview's collaboration with Intel, in conjunction with its technology partner Microsoft, will see the rollout of smart tech products such as sensors to aid independent/assisted living, wearable tech for patients, and 'smart rooms' in acute hospitals, senior living, and sheltered accommodation centres, said McCloskey. The interactive patient care market is expected to be worth $40bn by 2024, up from $7.4bn in 2015. The Oneview software system is already installed in about 3,000 hospital beds across 20 separate hospital facilities. Its system is also deployed at the Laura Lynn Children's Hospice in south Dublin. The firm said it expects to announce another hospital contract for 660 beds in the US in the coming weeks, with a year-end target of 15,000 newly contracted beds. Last month Barnes Jewish Healthcare (BJC), one of the largest non-profit hospital groups in the US, agreed to deploy Oneview's software solution at its new Barnes Jewish Hospital Tower and St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri. The US group will install 2,000 Oneview devices at its hospitals over the next three years. Oneview is also poised to enter the UK market if a pilot project launched this month with Oxford University is successful. This will enable the firm to roll out its products to the NHS. The company, which is in a rapid growth phase, saw net losses rise from €9.8m to just over €16m last year. Its monthly gross cash burn - before recurring income - is €1.9m per month. Recurring revenue - a key metric for the business - was up 73pc last year at €1.28m. The firm has a considerable war chest, however, with cash on hand of €35.1m. "The market for interactive patient care is growing at a rapid pace," said McCloskey. "Research firm Gartner predicts the sector will be worth $40bn within seven years. The need for a high-quality patient experience has never been more important. "Our technology has revolutionised patient care and we are excited to continue to roll it out across international markets in the coming months," added McCloskey. The firm has also announced a number of new senior hires including Kevin Jennings, the former head of Global Learning Design at Google.

When asked by CBS This Morning if the so-called “Vault 7” revelations could’ve been an inside job, Morell replied without hesitation: “absolutely.” Read more #Vault7: Key revelations from WikiLeaks’ release of CIA hacking tools "This data is not shared outside CIA. It's only inside CIA. It's on CIA's top secret network, which is not connected to any other network. So, this has to be an inside job," he said. Morell advised the CIA to look into if the WikiLeaks informant was a staff employee or a contractor, and if any "red flags" were missed. On Tuesday, the first installment of the “Vault 7” files was made public, revealing the vast scope of the CIA’s hacking capabilities. The batch of 8,761 documents accounts for only 1 percent of the total files to be released, WikilLeaks said, adding that it won’t disclose its source. Morell also advised the whistleblower group against its plans to share technical details of the CIA hacking operation with the tech companies that were directly affected by it. This data is “valuable” to the enemies of the US, who may use it to search and eliminate CIA malware in their own networks. The same stance was earlier shared by the CIA, which refused to confirm the authenticity of the documents presented by WikiLeaks. "Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information that do us harm," the agency said in a statement Wednesday. Morell served as deputy director of the CIA in 2010-13, also being the agency’s acting director on two occasions.

Image: Connor McKenna What are the top sci-tech and pharma companies looking for? by Jenny Darmody 4 days ago37 Shares With some of the biggest sci-tech and biopharma companies in the country at Career Zoo, we asked them what makes a candidate stand out. Thousands of jobseekers flocked to Career Zoo on Saturday (11 March) to talk to some of the top companies in tech, cybersecurity and pharmaceuticals. The first Career Zoo of 2017 took place at the Convention Centre Dublin, with a major focus on big data, the internet of things (IoT) and biotech in the form of panel discussions, workshops and speakers from some of the biggest employers in Ireland. With a big skills gap in many areas – such as cybersecurity and data – many companies were hoping to find talent with the right skills and cultural fit for their organisation. New to the event this year were exclusive tech workshops, which introduced tech-savvy jobseekers to cybersecurity, programming and IoT. PwC hosted a ‘Game of Threats’ workshop simulating a cyber breach, with two teams making decisions on what the other team does. The panels at Career Zoo this year focused on deep data, e-commerce, and the future of tech, with discussions from Intel’s Cliodhna Ni Scanaill, David Ryan of Jet.com and Dr Chris Watson of PTC.

We spoke to some of the top companies hiring in Ireland right now and asked them what would make a candidate stand out for them. Along with panel discussions, demonstrations and workshops, many employers attending the event were hiring, including PTC, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), Qualtrics, Amgen, Version 1 and PwC. Several companies said they were looking for passionate, driven candidates who were willing to continuously learn and progress. Others were looking for self-starters and people who had done their research on the company they wanted to work for. “We’re looking for enthusiastic people,” said Pádraig Keane, supply chain director for BMS. “So, if you come across a candidate that is energetic and motivated, that has researched the role […] that’s always a great sign to start off with.” Updated, 9.46am, 13 March 2017: The video in this article was update to correct a name and title error.

"Not a bad way to start day 50 of this administration," he later said. BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: March 11, 2017 11:59 am Follow @ATownPolitics WASHINGTON | President Donald Trump is embracing government numbers he once maligned as “phony” as he tries to take credit for the latest U.S. jobs report. The new administration on Friday promoted Labor Department statistics that show U.S. employers added 235,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.7 percent from 4.8 percent. White House press secretary Sean Spicer holds up a Trump Administration document to "repeal and replace Obamacare" as he talks to the media during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Friday, March 10, 2017. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) “Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump,” tweeted White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. “Not a bad way to start day 50 of this administration,” he later said. What a difference from last year’s presidential campaign, when Trump repeatedly assailed the report’s legitimacy. Back then, candidate Trump denounced “phony unemployment numbers” he claimed had been invented to make the Democrats look good. “Don’t believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number’s probably 28, 29, as high as 35,” he said last February, on the day of the New Hampshire presidential primary. “The 5 percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics,” he said. That’s last year’s 5 percent, not the new numbers reported on his watch. Asked about the apparent disconnect, Spicer offered a smile and a quip: “I talked to the president prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly: ‘They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now.'” During a speech at the Detroit Economic club last year, Trump pointed to figures that show one in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. He failed to mention the one in five includes children, young people in school and senior citizens who are retired. Though the jobless report has been criticized by others for omitting people who aren’t actively searching for work, it provides a benchmark that is similar to most other nations. While business and consumer confidence have risen since the presidential election, economists also say it’s too soon for Trump to be taking credit for jobs. “No new economic policies have yet been enacted,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. Instead, he pointed to an unusually mild winter that likely boosted hiring by construction firms. Cold weather in February typically shuts down work sites across much of the country. But last month was the second-warmest February since 1895, helping construction firms add the most new jobs in a decade. A survey of small businesses shows that their optimism is up since the election, reaching the highest level in 12 years in January, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Other measures also show greater business confidence. But many of the corporate announcements of new jobs that Trump has promoted — by ExxonMobil, Intel and Ford, for example — will take place over many years and were already planned before the election. Trump and Republicans have been quick to claim credit nonetheless. “The February jobs report exceeded expectations by 50,000 jobs,” said the Republican National Committee in an email, “another sign President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda is spurring businesses to hire ‘aggressively.'” Spicer, meanwhile, may have jumped the gun with his tweets. A 1985 rule bars executive branch officials from commenting publicly on economic data until at least an hour after its release. Jason Furman, President Barack Obama’s top economic adviser, said on Twitter that the rule was intended to prevent White House officials, some of whom see the report a day early, from immediately spinning the data. Spicer downplayed that mini- controversy, saying he didn’t think happily touting news that had been widely reported was “exactly a market disruption.” “I apologize if we were a little excited and we’re so glad to see so many fellow Americans back to work.” Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Trump transition knew Flynn might register as foreign agent Saturday Mar 11, 2017 at 10:31 AM Lawyers for retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump's transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent, but Trump was not aware of the possible move, the White House said Friday. CHAD DAY, STEPHEN BRAUN and JULIE PACEAssociated Press Lawyers for retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn told President Donald Trump's transition team before the inauguration that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent, but Trump was not aware of the possible move, the White House said Friday. The disclosure by White House officials confirms the Trump transition team was aware of the situation involving the president's pick for a top national security post either before he joined the government or soon afterward. But the White House's acknowledgement raised new questions about whether Trump's transition team, and later, his White House lawyers, fully vetted Flynn after being informed about his possible filing as a foreign agent for his lobbying during the presidential campaign that may have benefited the government of Turkey. White House spokesman Sean Spicer dismissed questions about whether the information should have given the transition team pause, saying Flynn had "impeccable credentials." Trump fired Flynn last month after less than a month on the job saying he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Spicer confirmed that Flynn's personal lawyer contacted Trump transition attorneys before the inauguration about the possible filing. But he added that Flynn's representative only asked for guidance and did not provide more details about the lobbying work or Flynn's business dealings. Spicer said Flynn's decision whether to file as a foreign agent was a personal matter that his own attorney would need to handle. Among those told of Flynn's lobbying work was Don McGahn, Trump's campaign lawyer who served in the transition and later became White House counsel, said a person with direct knowledge of the conversations between Flynn's representatives and the transition team. That person, who was not authorized to describe confidential conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that during discussions after the inauguration White House lawyers were told Flynn was moving ahead with plans to file as a foreign agent. On Thursday, Spicer had said he did not believe Trump had been told of Flynn's work as a foreign agent. Later that day, Vice President Mike Pence said he was unaware of Flynn's foreign agent work until this week. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc., filed paperwork this week with the Justice Department formally identifying him as a foreign agent and acknowledging that his work for a company owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." In the filings with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit, Flynn and his company described $530,000 worth of lobbying before Election Day on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. The lobbying occurred from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. In an interview with the AP, Alptekin said Flynn and his firm filed the registration after pressure from Justice Department officials. Alptekin said he disagreed with the decision to register. He also said he had asked for some of his money back. Flynn's registration comes as he has drawn scrutiny from the FBI for his contacts with Russian officials. Through a spokesman, Flynn declined to discuss the registration. In the filing, his attorney said the lobbying contract quickly ended after Trump's election in November. On Thursday, Spicer defended Flynn's work, saying he did it as a "private citizen," but he declined to say whether Trump would have hired Flynn if he had known about the lobbying. "There's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed," Spicer said. After Flynn joined the administration, he agreed not to lobby for five years after leaving government service and never to represent foreign governments. It appears that Flynn's work wouldn't violate the pledge because it occurred before he joined the administration in January. The pledge bars Flynn from ever doing the same type of work again in his lifetime. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must disclose their work to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to get back in compliance with the law by registering and disclosing their work. According to Flynn's filings, his firm's work involved research, informational materials and a video on the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, of orchestrating a botched coup last summer. Erdogan has called for Gulen's extradition, a request the Obama administration rebuffed. Alptekin, the Turkish businessman, has denied having any ties to Erdogan's government. But he is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee.

Remember to SPRING FORWARD! Set your clocks forward one hour at 2 a.m. tonight. ACTION AT CAMP DAVID? -- The FAA has issued a Notice to All Airmen (a NOTAM, in pilot parlance) to expect VIP movement in the Hagerstown, Maryland, area Sunday. Hagerstown is just west of Camp David. Could someone important be visiting the retreat? The White House didn’t have comment for the record, and also hasn’t announced any expected activity for the weekend. The FAA notice http://bit.ly/2mwPN0u (H/t Brian Bartlett) Story Continued Below MOMENT OF THE DAY -- President Donald Trump had House committee chairmen at the White House to discuss health care Friday. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) reminded him that the name of the committee he chairs is the Energy and Commerce Committee. The Walden exchange http://cs.pn/2ng8Jz7 … The full clip http://cs.pn/2mwynBk TO WIT -- “Donald Trump Plays Background Role in Health-Care Battle: President pressures lawmakers, groups behind the scenes while others take a more public stance,” by WSJ’s Louise Radnofsky and Mike Bender: “The course of Donald Trump’s presidency will be defined by his ability to seal a deal to rework the U.S. health-care system, but so far he has outsourced the job of hammering out the details to about a dozen Republican leaders and White House advisers while he serves in the background as a pitchman. … “Mr. Trump appeared to score a win after a Wednesday meeting with leaders of six conservative grass-roots groups, several of whom had strafed the House bill a day earlier over objections to provisions that are must-haves for other Republicans. ‘We believe that we can negotiate on these provisions, address them in a substantive way, and get to ‘yes’ on this bill,’ said Adam Brandon of FreedomWorks after the meeting. One person present said the president said issues unaddressed by the House repeal bill could be tackled at a later stage. Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bremberg were there to back up the president on fine details, ‘but he’s learned a lot and could explain it very well,’ the person said.” http://on.wsj.com/2mMqeJu TRUMP SPEAKS -- @realDonaldTrump at 9:39 a.m.: “We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!” A HEADLINE HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP WILL LOVE -- WaPo A1: “Trump backs health bill as is … APPARENT SHIFT ON HOUSE PROPOSAL … Sides with GOP leaders on Medicaid timeline.” http://bit.ly/2lNyYjh TRUMP’S WHITE HOUSE -- “Trump Abruptly Orders 46 Obama-Era Prosecutors to Resign,” by NYT’s Charlie Savage and Maggie Haberman: “The Trump administration moved on Friday to sweep away most of the remaining vestiges of Obama administration prosecutors at the Justice Department, ordering 46 holdover United States attorneys to tender their resignations immediately — including Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. The firings were a surprise — especially for Mr. Bharara, who has a reputation for prosecuting public corruption cases and for investigating insider trading. “In November, Mr. Bharara met with then President-elect Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan and told reporters afterward that both Mr. Trump and Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general, had asked him about staying on, which the prosecutor said he expected to do.But on Friday, Mr. Bharara was among federal prosecutors who received a call from Dana Boente, the acting deputy attorney general, instructing him to resign, according to a person familiar with the matter. As of Friday evening, though some of the prosecutors had publicly announced their resignations, Mr. Bharara had not. A spokesman for Mr. Bharara declined to comment.” http://nyti.ms/2ngp2fa -- “After 2 months, Mattis is only Trump pick at Pentagon,” by AP’s Robert Burns: “Jim Mattis is not lonely in the Pentagon, but two months into his tenure as secretary of defense not a single political appointee has joined him. The retired Marine general, who took office just hours after President Donald Trump was sworn in, has sparred with the White House over choices for high-priority civilian positions that, while rarely visible to the public, are key to developing and implementing defense policy at home and abroad. When the Obama administration closed shop in January, only one of its top-tier Pentagon political appointees stayed in place — Robert Work, the deputy defense secretary. He agreed to remain until his successor is sworn in. So far no nominee for deputy has been announced, let alone confirmed by the Senate.” http://apne.ws/2mMAMZ9 ****** A message from UC Davis: UC Davis gives people plenty of reasons to celebrate. Our university is solving the world’s biggest problems in food, energy and health. Now we’re doing some celebrating of our own -- UC Davis men’s basketball is entering the NCAA’s Big Dance for the first time, and the women’s team is in the Women’s National Invitation Tournament. Go Aggies! ****** CAUSE AND EFFECT -- “Scott Pruitt’s office deluged with angry callers after he questions the science of global warming,” by WaPo’s Juliet Eilperin: “Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt’s phones have been ringing off the hook — literally — since he questioned the link between human activity and climate change. The calls to Pruitt’s main line, 202-564-4700, reached such a high volume by Friday that agency officials created an impromptu call center, according to three agency employees. The officials asked for anonymity out of fear of retaliation. By Saturday morning, the number was disconnected. Before the number was disabled, interns were dispatched to answer some of the incoming calls, according to one employee. At times, calls to that number ended up going to voice mail. “EPA did not respond immediately to a request for comment. While constituents sometimes call lawmakers in large numbers to express outrage over contentious policy issues, it is unusual for Americans to target a Cabinet official. Pruitt’s comments on the CNBC program ‘Squawk Box’ — that ‘we need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis’ over climate change — prompted an immediate pushback from many scientists and environment groups.” http://wapo.st/2mvhC7H BORDER WARS -- “Almost 100 California entities are interested in building Trump's border wall,” by Carolina A. Miranda on the front page of the L.A. Times: “International engineering corporations, boutique architectural firms and tiny mom-and-pop builders with names like ‘Loko-Koko’ are lining up to help build President Trump’s border wall, despite the fact that Mexico has said it won’t pay for it and polls show that many Americans don’t want it. “Since the Department of Homeland Security placed a presolicitation notice on the Federal Business Opportunities website in late February for ‘the design and build of several prototype wall structures in the vicinity of the United States border Mexico,’ more than 600 interested vendors across the country have signed on, including almost 100 entities from California.” http://lat.ms/2mMu31a -- “Trump's revised travel ban dealt first court setback,” by Reuters’ Steve Gorman: “A federal judge in Wisconsin dealt the first legal blow to President Donald Trump's revised travel ban on Friday, barring enforcement of the policy to deny U.S. entry to the wife and child of a Syrian refugee already granted asylum in the United States. The temporary restraining order, granted by U.S. District Judge William Conley in Madison, applies only to the family of the Syrian refugee, who brought the case anonymously to protect the identities of his wife and daughter, still living in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. “But it represents the first of several challenges brought against Trump's newly amended executive order, issued on March 6 and due to go into effect on March 16, to draw a court ruling in opposition to its enforcement. Conley, chief judge of the federal court in Wisconsin's western district and an appointee of former President Barack Obama, concluded the plaintiff ‘has presented some likelihood of success on the merits’ of his case and that his family faces ‘significant risk of irreparable harm’ if forced to remain in Syria.” http://reut.rs/2mdhxVt UPDATE -- “Russian oligarch responds to Trump airport connection,” by John Pacenti and Alexandra Clough on the front page of the Palm Beach Post: “For the first time, Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev confirmed his plane and President Donald Trump’s jet shared the tarmac in Charlotte five days before the general election, saying he was in North Carolina for a business reason. In addition, Rybolovlev through a spokesman reiterated he has never met the Republican billionaire despite buying the Maison de L’Amitié Palm Beach mansion from him nine years ago. “‘Particular attention has been focused on a trip made by Mr. Rybolovlev to North Carolina,’ said Sergey Chernitsyn, an adviser to Dmitry Rybolovlev. ‘He was in North Carolina for a business meeting and we can state categorically that he did not have any contact with Mr. Trump or any of his advisers at the time he was there.’ Rybolovlev, formerly a fertilizer mogul, never lived in the 62,000-foot mansion. It’s now been torn down and divided into three parcels, one of which recently sold for $34 million. “Speculation that Trump had been in contact with Rybolovlev was stoked when FAA records showed the oligarch’s A319 grey-and-white jet landed in Charlotte just as the then Republican presidential candidate was visiting the area for a campaign rally in Concord on Nov. 3. Trump’s plane arrived at Charlotte Douglas International Airport 90 minutes after Rybolovlev. The McClatchy News Services reported limousine companies and local luxury hotels in Concord didn’t have any record of ferrying Rybolovlev. But the arrival of Rybolovlev’s plane certainly made an impression.” http://pbpo.st/2md9LuH … A1 PDF http://bit.ly/2lA2Jzq A LOOK AROUND THE NATION -- ARIZONA REPUBLIC: “Trump embraces jobs report he once called ‘phony’” http://bit.ly/2keisId… MIAMI HERALD: “Trump’s dilemma: Hail Assange or haul him before a judge” http://bit.ly/2mdjhxK … CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: “NO APOLOGIES: Amid furor, Rep. Shimkus of Illinois stands by argument that men shouldn’t have to pay for prenatal care as part of GOP health plan” http://bit.ly/2nq27gC … STAR TRIBUNE: “In Minn., GOP plan hits poor, the aging: Those 60 and older would be big losers, analysis health tax credits shows” http://bit.ly/2naiQIL THE SOUTHERN WHITE HOUSE -- “Trump’s Mar-a-Lago is heaven -- for spies,” by Darren Samuelsohn in Palm Beach: “President Donald Trump relishes the comforts of his Mar-a-Lago estate for repeated weekends away from Washington, but former Secret Service and intelligence officials say the resort is a security nightmare vulnerable to both casual and professional spies. While Trump’s private club in South Florida has been transformed into a fortress of armed guards, military-grade radar, bomb sniffing dogs and metal-detection checkpoints, there are still notable vulnerabilities, namely the stream of guests who can enter the property without a background check. “And security experts warn that the commander in chief’s frequent visits -- four since he took office in January -- afford an unprecedented opportunity for eavesdropping and building dossiers on the president’s routines and habits, as well as those of the inner circle around him. They add that with each repeat visit, the security risk escalates. ‘The president is the biggest, richest intelligence target in the world, and there is almost no limit to the energy and money an adversary will spend to get at him,’ said David Kris, a former Obama-era assistant attorney general for national security.” http://politi.co/2nga6xy HAPPENING TODAY -- VP MIKE PENCE is in Louisville, Kentucky. “Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, two of Bevin's young sons, as well as one of their friends … Pence came down the stairs, hugged the boys, and then brought them and Bevin back up the stairs to the plane for a quick tour of Air Force Two,” per pooler Ashley Parker of the WaPo. STRANGE TIMES -- “GOP congressman offers strange Obama conspiracy theory -- and even stranger explanations,” by WaPo’s Aaron Blake: “First, here's what [Pennsylvania Rep. Mike] Kelly said last Saturday at a local Republican Party Lincoln Day dinner: “President Obama himself said he was going to stay in Washington until his daughter graduated. I think we ought to pitch in to let him go someplace else, because he is only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is going to totally upset the new agenda. It just doesn’t make sense. And people sit back and they say to me, 'My gosh, why can’t you guys get this done?' I say, 'We've got a new CEO, we've got some new heads in the different departments, but the same people are there, and they don't believe that the new owners or the new managers should be running the ship.'” http://wapo.st/2mclusv THE JUICE … -- STENY HOYER was hanging out at the Big 10 quarterfinals at the Verizon Center Friday afternoon. SPOTTED: Google’s Ed An, Squared Communications’ Michael Meehan, Entertainment Software Association’s Richard Taylor, American Chemical Association’s Booth Jamison and Obama alumni Broderick Johnson. Also in the seats, legendary basketball coach Pat Reilly. -- PAGE SIX: “Fans cheer for Obamas and Bono at NYC lunch,” by Christine Burroni and Ian Mohr: “Talk about a power lunch. Bono joined Barack and Michelle Obama at Stephen Starr’s restaurant Upland on Friday, and the trio caused quite the stir. ‘Everyone in the restaurant knew they were there,; a source told Page Six of patrons who were tipped off by ‘tons’ of Secret Service in the Gramercy eatery. ‘There was a major buzz in the air.’ The former first couple and the U2 frontman ate in a private dining room downstairs for a ‘casual lunch’ -- with no way of avoiding crowds, as they had to walk though [sic] the main dining area to get to their table. Bono and the former president entered first and Michelle followed behind. We’re told Barack Obama ‘flashed his million-dollar smile’ as he waved to the crowd while exiting the restaurant. Fans also cheered for the famous diners. Meanwhile, on Thursday night Obama made a surprise appearance at Carbone for Jay Z’s D’Ussé Dinner Series, when, ‘in the middle of the dinner, Secret Service started surveying the area,’ a source told Page Six. Hosts at the event included Roc Nation Latin CEO Romeo Santos.” http://pge.sx/2nqfi1b GET YOUR BRACKET READY FOR THE PLAYBOOK POOL -- POLITICO Playbook is gearing up for college tournament time with our very own bracket challenge.

Playbook Reads PHOTO DU JOUR: White House press secretary Sean Spicer adjusts his American flag pin after being told it was upside down during the daily press briefing at the White House on March 10. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo K ST FILES -- “Flynn told Trump team he might register as a foreign agent,” by WaPo’s Ashley Parker: “Attorneys for Michael Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, informed the incoming White House legal counsel during the transition that Flynn might need to register with the government as a foreign agent — a phone call that raised no alarms within Trump’s team, despite the unusual circumstance of having a top national security post filled by someone whose work may have benefited a foreign government. The firm Flynn headed, Flynn Intel Group, was hired last year when Flynn was an adviser to the Trump campaign by the Netherlands-based firm ­Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin has close ties to Turkish President Recep Tay­yip Erdogan. “Although the contract ended after the election, new details about the work Flynn did for Inovo resurrect the controversy over his short tenure as Trump’s top national security aide. The national security adviser is supposed to be an honest broker within the executive branch, pulling together military and diplomatic options for the president so he can decide what policy to pursue. But Flynn’s work potentially benefiting Turkey meant he was representing the interests of a country other than the United States at the same time he was advising Trump on foreign policy during the election.” http://wapo.st/2nagfOY THE LOYAL OPPOSITION -- “Governors races test Democrats' rift,” by Gabriel Debenedetti: “With 27 GOP-controlled governorships up for election in 2018, national Democrats envision the midterm elections as a chance to rebalance the scales at the state level, where there are currently twice as many Republican governors than Democrats. But already, party leaders are running into a complication — unresolved issues left over from the Hillary Clinton-Bernie Sanders presidential primary. Far from defeated, Sanders-aligned progressives are nationalizing their fight, showing less patience than ever for Democrats who don’t agree with them. And that’s generating fear and nervousness in the South — in places like Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee — where some promising Democratic candidates who are looking at running statewide in 2018 could face resistance from the left.” http://politi.co/2mc4BOx WEST COAST WATCH -- “'I was determined not to lose my voice':Former Sen. Barbara Boxer says her retirement plans were upended by Trump,” by LA Times’ Seema Mehta: “When then-Sen. Barbara Boxer pondered her retirement, she envisioned informally advising President Hillary Clinton and a Democratic Senate, traveling the country to deliver speeches and spending more time with her husband of 55 years. ‘I was so excited,’ Boxer told an audience of several hundred Friday at UC Berkeley, where she donated her congressional archives. ‘Whoops.’” http://lat.ms/2mTsA9S CLICKER – “The nation’s cartoonists on the week in politics,” edited by Matt Wuerker – 14 keepers http://politi.co/2mStUd3 ****** A message from UC Davis: Mention “UC Davis” and what comes to mind?

Mike Flynn filed paperwork this week stating that he was a foreign agent lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government and despite the White House denial, sources tell the New York Times and the AP, among other outlets, that Flynn's lawyers told the Trump team before the inauguration about the work he did on behalf of Inovo, company owned by a Turkish businessman. Flynn's work "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey," the filing on behalf of Flynn and his company, Flynn Intel Group, states. White House press secretary Sean Spicer admitted Friday that Flynn's lawyer had contacted a transition lawyer wondering whether he should register as a foreign agent, but it was considered a private decision, NBC reports. "That wasn't the role for the transition," Spicer said. "This was a personal matter, it's a business matter." Flynn's company received $530,000 under a contract that continued until the day after Election Day, meaning that Flynn was a paid foreign agent while he was sitting in on classified briefings as an adviser to Trump. The day before the election, Flynn wrote an op-ed in the Hill calling for the extradition to Turkey of "shady Islamic mullah" Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania resident Turkey blames for last year's coup attempt.   View 1 more image My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   11% Hilarious 15% Intriguing 10% Depressing 2% Brilliant 46% Scary 16% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 191 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 191 comments paul castle Mar 12, 2017 8:31 AM CDT So, he's a secret Islamist is he ?

Rugaber, The Associated Press | March 10, 2017 6:49 PM ET More from The Associated Press Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo? More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is embracing government numbers he once maligned as “phoney” as he tries to take credit for the latest U.S. jobs report. The new administration on Friday promoted Labor Department statistics that show U.S. employers added 235,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.7 per cent from 4.8 per cent. “Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump,” tweeted White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. “Not a bad way to start day 50 of this administration,” he later said. What a difference from last year’s presidential campaign, when Trump repeatedly assailed the report’s legitimacy. Back then, candidate Trump denounced “phoney unemployment numbers” he claimed had been invented to make the Democrats look good. “Don’t believe those phoney numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 per cent unemployment. The number’s probably 28, 29, as high as 35,” he said last February, on the day of the New Hampshire presidential primary. “The 5 per cent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics,” he said. That’s last year’s 5 per cent, not the new numbers reported on his watch. Great news. We are only just beginning. Together, we are going to #MAGA! https://t.co/BSp685Q9Qf pic.twitter.com/K7yeBZsf6r — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2017 Asked about the apparent disconnect, Spicer offered a smile and a quip: “I talked to the president prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly: ‘They may have been phoney in the past, but it’s very real now.’” During a speech at the Detroit Economic club last year, Trump pointed to figures that show one in five American households do not have a single member in the labour force. He failed to mention the one in five includes children, young people in school and senior citizens who are retired. Though the jobless report has been criticized by others for omitting people who aren’t actively searching for work, it provides a benchmark that is similar to most other nations. While business and consumer confidence have risen since the presidential election, economists also say it’s too soon for Trump to be taking credit for jobs. “No new economic policies have yet been enacted,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. Instead, he pointed to an unusually mild winter that likely boosted hiring by construction firms. Cold weather in February typically shuts down work sites across much of the country. But last month was the second-warmest February since 1895, helping construction firms add the most new jobs in a decade. A survey of small businesses shows that their optimism is up since the election, reaching the highest level in 12 years in January, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Other measures also show greater business confidence. But many of the corporate announcements of new jobs that Trump has promoted — by ExxonMobil, Intel and Ford, for example — will take place over many years and were already planned before the election. Trump and Republicans have been quick to claim credit nonetheless. “The February jobs report exceeded expectations by 50,000 jobs,” said the Republican National Committee in an email, “another sign President Donald Trump’s pro-growth agenda is spurring businesses to hire ’aggressively.”’ Spicer, meanwhile, may have jumped the gun with his tweets. A 1985 rule bars executive branch officials from commenting publicly on economic data until at least an hour after its release. Jason Furman, President Barack Obama’s top economic adviser, said on Twitter that the rule was intended to prevent White House officials, some of whom see the report a day early, from immediately spinning the data. Spicer downplayed that mini- controversy, saying he didn’t think happily touting news that had been widely reported was “exactly a market disruption.” “I apologize if we were a little excited and we’re so glad to see so many fellow Americans back to work.” Related Americans are convinced by economic report claiming minorities are taking jobs away from whites David Rosenberg: Trump is pointing the finger at the wrong culprit on job losses Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Guru3D.com » News » Arctic Adds Freezer 33 Series CPU Coolers Arctic Adds Freezer 33 Series CPU Coolers by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 03/09/2017 08:15 AM | Source | 3 comment(s) The high-performance semi passive CPU coolers Freezer 33, Freezer 33 CO and Freezer 33 Plus are the successor models of the Freezer 32 series. They are equipped with PWM controlled 120 mm cooling fans and offset heat pipes to ensure optimal heat dissipation.  The low footprint of the Freezer 33 avoids interference with the RAM, even if there are two fans used. Fast and easy to install and extremely reliable, the mounting system is compatible with Intel and the new AMD Ryzen AM4 socket. Semi passive cooling makes the Freezer 33 coolers very efficient and extra quiet. During simple applications, such as creating documents, the CPU is cooled passively. The F12 PWM fan only powers up at a higher load, starting at 40 % PWM. In this way, an optimal cooling capacity at a low noise level is guaranteed. The Freezer 33 Plus features an additional F12 PWM cooling fan mounted on the opposite side of the radiator providing a great airflow and increasing cooling capacity significantly. Both the Freezer 33 and the Freezer 33 Plus are equipped with a durable high precision bearing, reducing friction and achieving a greater efficiency and less heat development.  The Freezer 33 CO is specifically designed for continuous operation. The Japanese dual ball bearing, used in the "CO" version, reduces rotational friction considerably, is significantly less sensitive to dust and high temperature and hence up to 5 times more durable than other bearings. Main Features Freezer 33 Series Compatible with Intel Sockets & AMD Ryzen (AM4) Passive Operation up to 40 % PWM Offset heat pipes ensure optimal heat dissipation Improved fan controller made in Germany Anti-vibration rubbers for quiet operation Installation in all four directions possible Transport-proof mounting with backplate MX-4 thermal paste included The Freezer 33 and Freezer 33 Plus are available in the ARCTIC-Webshop starting at a price of 39.99 £ MSRP as well as on Amazon. The Freezer 33 CO is available for preorder and will be delivered in April. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

With two fans in push pull it's really a freezer. That said, I was expecting to see Arctic releasing some adapters for the AM4 socket, but now I know why this didn't happen and I doubt it will. Not a nice move, the A32 wasn't so cheap. I guess for the AM4 I'll go with some liquid AIO solution now, from another brand. fry178 Master Guru Posts: 383 Joined: 2012-04-30 #5404503 Posted on: 03/09/2017 10:01 PM How about contacting support to ship you the adapter?

The letter, a copy of which was obtained by Tribune News, contradicts White House claims that neither Pence nor Trump knew of Flynn’s lobbying until it was revealed in a Justice Department filing this week. In the letter, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., asked Pence, then the leader of Trump’s transition team, for information regarding Michael Flynn’s business interests and statements regarding potential conflicts of interests. Cummings said Flynn’s work for Turkey and a speech Flynn gave in Russia could violate Trump for America’s code of ethics if Flynn was advising Trump on policy related to those two nations. Flynn was Trump’s principal foreign policy adviser during the campaign. “Lt. Gen. Flynn’s involvement in advising Mr. Trump on matters relating to Turkey or Russia – including attending classified briefings on those matters – could violate the Trump for America, Inc. Code of Ethical Conduct,” Cummings wrote. Cummings’ letter, which was dated Nov. 18, the day after Trump announced that Flynn would be his national security adviser, adds to the mystery surrounding Flynn’s short time in the White House. Trump fired Flynn Feb. 13 for offering a misleading account to Pence of a conversation he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But that firing came three weeks after the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak had been monitored and that a transcript contradicted Pence’s televised account of what Flynn had told him had been discussed. Trump moved against Flynn only after the Washington Post revealed the Justice Department warning a few hours earlier. Flynn’s lobbying for Turkey came to light this week when he belatedly registered with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit and acknowledged that he was paid $530,000 for work from August to November that might have benefited Turkey’s government. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump was unaware of Flynn’s lobbying when he named him national security adviser. Pence told Fox News that he heard about Flynn’s work for Turkey only after Flynn’s Justice Department filing this week. But Cummings’ letter contradicts both versions. Pence’s office did not respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Spicer acknowledged that Flynn’s attorney had raised a possibility of filing as a lobbyist with the transition team but that officials there did not advise him what to do. “It’s a business matter, it’s not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual,” Spicer said. (EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Flynn’s activities in Russia and Turkey were hardly secret. His appearance at a dinner commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Russian news agency RT in 2015, seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin, attracted wide attention largely because of Flynn’s former role as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn reportedly received $40,000 for his appearance. Flynn also advocated the extradition of a Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, from exile in Pennsylvania in response to Turkish government allegations that Gulen was behind a July 15 coup attempt. The U.S. government has not decided on the extradition request. Cummings’ letter made note of news reports on Flynn’s activities in questioning his role in the Trump transition. “Recent news reports have revealed that Lt. Gen. Flynn was receiving classified briefings during the presidential campaign while his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., was being paid to lobby the U.S. Government on behalf of a foreign government’s interests,” Cummings wrote. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of foreign governments or political entities must register with the Justice Department, according to the Foreign Agent Registration Act.

But Cummings’ letter suggested that Flynn was something other than a private citizen because he was receiving classified briefings as a Trump adviser. Flynn was believed to have been an advocate for Trump’s campaign position that a Trump administration would consider lifting sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia in retaliation for Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Turkish media and officials also left little doubt that they expected Flynn to advocate Turkish positions inside the White House. An opinion piece Flynn wrote in November for The Hill website in which he called Gulen a terrorist was widely quoted in Turkey and appeared on the front page of a Turkish government newspaper. Government officials said then that they expected a more favorable U.S. reaction to their extradition request once the Trump administration was in office. Trump signed an executive order that forbids government employees from lobbying for five years and bars them permanently from representing foreign governments after leaving the administration. It also prohibits lobbyists turned government employees from participating for two years in decisions about the issues on which they lobbied. — ©2017 McClatchy Washington Bureau Visit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. — PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): —– Topics: t000002953,t000047682,t000047680,t000047707,t000138195,t000389955,t000047702,t000194684,t000424681,t000047694,t000047683,g000362697,g000362669,g000219715 Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Evan Vucci AP i By Anita Kumar akumar@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform told then Vice President-elect Mike Pence in a November letter that the man Donald Trump had tapped to be his national security adviser was lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. The letter, a copy of which was shared with McClatchy, contradicts White House claims that neither Pence nor Trump knew of Michael Flynn’s lobbying until it was revealed in a Justice Department filing this week. In the letter, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, asked Pence, then the leader of Trump’s transition team, for information regarding Flynn’s business interests and statements regarding potential conflicts of interests. Cummings' letter to Pence Cummings said Flynn’s work for Turkey and a speech Flynn gave in Russia could violate Trump for America’s code of ethics if Flynn was advising Trump on policy related to those two nations. Flynn was Trump’s principal foreign policy adviser during the campaign. “Lt. Gen. Flynn’s involvement in advising Mr. Trump on matters relating to Turkey or Russia – including attending classified briefings on those matters – could violate the Trump for America, Inc. Code of Ethical Conduct,” Cummings wrote. The Cummings’ letter, which was dated Nov. 18, the day after Trump announced that Flynn would be his national security adviser, adds to the mystery surrounding Flynn’s short tenure in the White House. Trump fired Flynn Feb. 13 for offering a misleading account to Pence of a conversation he’d had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But that firing came three weeks after the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak had been monitored and that a transcript contradicted Pence’s televised account of what Flynn had told him had been discussed. Trump moved against Flynn only after the Washington Post had revealed the Justice Department warning a few hours earlier. Flynn’s lobbying for Turkey came to light this week when he belatedly registered with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit and acknowledged that he’d been paid $530,000 for work from August to November that might have benefited Turkey’s government. On Thursday, White House press spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump had been unaware of Flynn’s lobbying when he named him national security adviser.

Voyager 16.04.2 Distro Uses Linux Kernel 4.8 for Kaby Lake Support, Xfce 4.12.3 GO The distribution is based on Xubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Mar 11, 2017 02:32 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  The developer of the Voyager Live Linux distribution announced today the official release and general availability of Voyager 16.04.2 LTS, a maintenance update to the long-term supported 16.04 series of the operating system. Based on the recently released Xubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, Voyager 16.04.2 LTS offers a completely redesigned Xfce 4.12.3 desktop environment, but ships with all the goodies (security updates, latest package versions, updated graphics and kernel stack) from the Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS (Xenial Xerus) operating system. "The philosophy of Voyager from the beginning is not to present and offer a type of options corresponding to a type of person but rather to offer a wide range of options for different people who would not have the same practice," reads the announcement (in French). "Voyager wants to be cross-platform, slick, fast and flexible with a touch of aesthetics." Here's what's new in Voyager 16.04.2 LTS Besides the goodies borrowed from the Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS release, Voyager 16.04.2 LTS comes with its own set of up-to-date applications and components. Among these, we can mention Pitivi 0.98.1, Gradio 5.0.1, Xfce4 HotCorner plugin 0.0.2, Xfdashboad 0.6.1, Clementine 1.3.1, Covergloobus 1.7.3, Screenlets 0.1.6, Corebird 1.1.1, and ClamTk 5.24.1. Popular applications like the Mozilla Firefox 52.0 web browser, LibreOffice 5.3 office suite, Mozilla Thunderbird 45.7.0 email and news client, Xscreensaver 5.34.2 screensaver of X11, I-nex 7.6.0 system information utility, and Mintstick USB 1.3.1 Live USB creator for Ubuntu-based distro are also included in the Voyager 16.04.2 release. Best of all, Voyager 16.04.2 LTS is shipping with the HWE (Hardware Enablement) kernel from Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak), which users who managed to upgrade their Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 16.04.1 LTS installations to the 16.04.2 point release received. The Linux 4.8 kernel included in the distro provides support for Intel Kaby Lake chipsets. Support for Python 3.5 series is provided as well, and it looks like the artwork was improved a little bit to make it more attractive to newcomers. Being based on Xubuntu 16.04.2 LTS, the distro will get LTS support for a few more years. Voyager 16.04.2 LTS is lightweight and fast, and it can be installed on old computers or powerful new ones. If you want to take this distro for a spin and see what it can do, you should download the 32-bit or 64-bit Live ISO images of Voyager 16.04.2 LTS right now from our website.

Evan Vucci AP i By Anita Kumar akumar@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform told then Vice President-elect Mike Pence in a November letter that the man Donald Trump had tapped to be his national security adviser was lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. The letter, a copy of which was shared with McClatchy, contradicts White House claims that neither Pence nor Trump knew of Michael Flynn’s lobbying until it was revealed in a Justice Department filing this week. In the letter, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, asked Pence, then the leader of Trump’s transition team, for information regarding Flynn’s business interests and statements regarding potential conflicts of interests. Cummings' letter to Pence Cummings said Flynn’s work for Turkey and a speech Flynn gave in Russia could violate Trump for America’s code of ethics if Flynn was advising Trump on policy related to those two nations. Flynn was Trump’s principal foreign policy adviser during the campaign. “Lt. Gen. Flynn’s involvement in advising Mr. Trump on matters relating to Turkey or Russia – including attending classified briefings on those matters – could violate the Trump for America, Inc. Code of Ethical Conduct,” Cummings wrote. The Cummings’ letter, which was dated Nov. 18, the day after Trump announced that Flynn would be his national security adviser, adds to the mystery surrounding Flynn’s short tenure in the White House. Trump fired Flynn Feb. 13 for offering a misleading account to Pence of a conversation he’d had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But that firing came three weeks after the Justice Department had warned the White House that Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak had been monitored and that a transcript contradicted Pence’s televised account of what Flynn had told him had been discussed. Trump moved against Flynn only after the Washington Post had revealed the Justice Department warning a few hours earlier. Flynn’s lobbying for Turkey came to light this week when he belatedly registered with the Justice Department’s Foreign Agent Registration Unit and acknowledged that he’d been paid $530,000 for work from August to November that might have benefited Turkey’s government. On Thursday, White House press spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump had been unaware of Flynn’s lobbying when he named him national security adviser. For his part, Pence told Fox News that he had heard about Flynn’s work for Turkey only after Flynn’s Justice Department filing this week. But Cummings’ letter contradicts both versions. Pence’s office did not respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Spicer acknowledged that Flynn’s attorney had raised a possibility of filing as a lobbyist with the transition team but that officials there did not advise him what to do. “It’s a business matter, it’s not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual,” Spicer said. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Cummings and Trump met at the White House about the cost of prescription drugs on Wednesday. Flynn’s activities in Russia and Turkey were hardly secret. His appearance at a dinner commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Russian news agency RT in 2015, seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew wide attention largely because of Flynn’s former role as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn reportedly received $40,000 for his appearance. Flynn also advocated publicly for the extradition of a Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, from his exile in Pennsylvania in response to Turkish government allegations that Gulen was behind a July 15 coup attempt. The U.S. government has made no decision to date on the extradition request. Cummings’ letter made note of news reports on Flynn’s activities in questioning his role in the Trump transition. “Recent news reports have revealed that Lt. Gen. Flynn was receiving classified briefings during the presidential campaign while his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., was being paid to lobby the U.S. Government on behalf of a foreign government’s interests,” Cummings wrote. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM U.S. citizens who lobby on behalf of a foreign government or political entity must register with the Justice Department, according to the Foreign Agent Registration Act. Failure to register is a felony. Spicer said Flynn’s work was acceptable because it was done before he worked for the federal government. But Cummings’ letter suggested that Flynn was something other than a private citizen because he was receiving classified briefings as a Trump adviser. Flynn was believed to have been an advocate for Trump’s campaign position that a Trump administration would consider lifting sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia in retaliation for Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Turkish media and officials also left little doubt that they expected Flynn to advocate for Turkish positions inside the White House. An opinion piece Flynn wrote in November for The Hill website in which he called Gulen a terrorist was widely quoted in Turkey and appeared on the front page of a Turkish government newspaper. Government officials said then that they expected a more favorable U.S. reaction to their extradition request once the Trump administration was in office. Trump signed an executive order that forbids government employees from lobbying for five years and bars them permanently from representing foreign governments after leaving the administration. It also prohibits lobbyists turned government employees from participating for two years in decisions about the issues on which they lobbied.

Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was hired by a prominent Turkish-American with ties to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has engaged in a widespread political crackdown after surviving a military coup attempt. Flynn was assigned to investigate Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and was blamed by Erdogan for helping instigate the July putsch. Flynn signed a contract for the work just three weeks after delivering a fiery speech at the Republican National Convention endorsing Trump and leading "lock her up" chants advocating the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state. Without disclosing his financial interest, Flynn published an Op-Ed article on Election Day arguing that Turkey was misunderstood and assailing Gulen as "a shady Islamic mullah" and "radical Islamist." The contract terminated after the election, when Flynn went on to become Trump's national security adviser. He was forced to resign after just 24 days when it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and others in the White House about the substance of a telephone conversation he had with Russia's ambassador. Flynn registered as a lobbyist last year but did not file papers registering as a foreign agent until Tuesday, providing a fuller understanding of his work. "He was a private citizen at the time," Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said. "And when you're a private citizen, you're allowed to engage in legal activities. I don't have anything further on that, but I think there's nothing nefarious about doing anything that's legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed." Pence, however, seemed less forgiving. "The first I heard of it," the vice president said when asked about stories on the matter during an interview on Fox News on Thursday night, "and I think it is an affirmation of the president's decision to ask General Flynn to resign." Democrats have raised concerns about Flynn's private lobbying since last fall, including his decision to accept a fee reported around $40,000 to attend and speak at a Moscow gala celebration honoring RT, the Russian government-financed, English-language television network viewed in the West as a propaganda organ. In a letter to the Justice Department this week, Flynn's lawyer said that he did not initially register as a foreign agent because the firm that hired him was not a foreign government. But the lawyer, Robert Kelner, said Flynn had decided to register retroactively "to eliminate any potential doubt" because "the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." On behalf of his firm, the Flynn Intel Group, Flynn signed the contract Aug. 9 with Inovo, a Dutch firm owned by Ekim Alptekin, chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. Flynn's firm was to receive $600,000 for 90 days of work. His initial registration as a lobbyist last year indicated he would receive less than $5,000 for lobbying, although that presumably indicates that he did not define most of the services he would provide Alptekin as lobbying under the law. This week, Alpetkin disputed the notion that he hired Flynn to influence the next president. "When I engaged Flynn Co. polls showed 85% likelihood of Hillary winning," he wrote on Twitter after the filings. "If intention was to lobby USG I would have hired Podesta like Gulen," he added, referring to the U.S. government and Tony Podesta, a prominent Washington lobbyist and brother of John Podesta, who was Clinton's campaign chairman. The forms filed this week indicate that Flynn's firm was "to perform investigative research" on Gulen and "develop a short film piece on the results of its investigation." In the end, the forms said, the video was never completed and Flynn's firm received $530,000 of the promised fee before the contract terminated in November.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said that Flynn’s represen-tative reached out to the transition team about potentially registering with the Justice Department because his lobbying work may have benefited the government of Turkey, but Spicer said the transition lawyer viewed it as a personal matter and not an issue for transition officials to decide. Spicer also rejected the notion that Flynn’s lobbying work for a client with ties to Turkey’s government should have raised red flags about Flynn’s appointment as Trump’s top national security adviser. He said Flynn had “impeccable credentials” to serve in that role.”We trust people to fill out the appropriate forms,” Spicer added, when asked whether other Trump advisers also might be lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. Trump fired Flynn last month for making misleading statements to Vice President Pence and others about his discussions with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. But documents Flynn filed this week with the Justice Department raised fresh questions about his ties to the Turkish government, even as he was serving as top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign. His now-shuttered firm, Flynn Intel Group, earned $530,000 last year for work on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch firm, whose Turkish founder has ties to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

China's Alibaba Cloud and Intel on March 9 unveiled a pilot program to build a cloud-based FPGA (field programmable gate array) acceleration service. The goal of the project is to enable cloud-services customers to have virtual access to a large set of compute resources to help them manage business, scientific and enterprise data application workloads more effectively. A field-programmable gate array is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing–hence "field-programmable." By using Intel Arria 10 FPGAs, Xeon processor-based servers and software development tools for application acceleration as a ready-to-go preconfigured infrastructure, Alibaba Cloud will provide systems designers cloud-based workload acceleration as an alternative to investing in on-premises FPGA infrastructure.

"We offer customers access to a number of services in the cloud, and adding an FPGA-based acceleration offering means they can access that powerful computing without the cost or requirement of building out their own infrastructure," Alibaba Cloud Senior Director Jin Li said. Alibaba Cloud is one of China's largest online retailers and web services providers, similar to Amazon and Amazon Web Services in the U.S. One of the key benefits of FPGAs is that they are programmable and can be customized to accelerate and scale for varying workloads, such as machine learning, data encryption and media transcode, the company said.

Jonathan M. Gitlin - Mar 11, 2017 5:00 pm UTC reader comments 122 Share this story The maps we're talking about aren't human-readable; they're complex 3D pointclouds that combine data from LIDAR, cameras, radar, and more. Here Here uses a fleet of mapping vehicles; sadly we found this one at rest, and its sensor mast is stowed and covered. But underneath that cover are 96 megapixels' worth of cameras, a 32-channel LIDAR scanner, and an extremely accurate GPS Inertial Measurement Unit. Jonathan Gitlin Civil Maps has its own mapping mast technology, which it's making available to customers as part of the Atlas DevKit. Civil Maps A closer look at some of the sensors on the Civil Maps mast. Civil Maps The weight of the automotive and tech industries is fully behind the move toward self-driving cars. Cars with "limited autonomy"—i.e., the ability to drive themselves under certain conditions (level 3) or within certain geofenced locations (level 4)—should be on our roads within the next five years. But a completely autonomous vehicle—capable of driving anywhere, any time, with human input limited to telling it just a destination—remains a more distant goal. To make that happen, cars are going to need to know exactly where they are in the world with far greater precision than currently possible with technology like GPS. And that means new maps that are far more accurate than anything you could buy at the next gas station—not that a human would be able to read them anyway. Fully aware of this need, car makers like BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Ford have been voting with their wallets. They're investing in companies like Here and Civil Maps that are building the platforms and gathering the data required. The end result will be a high-definition 3D map of our road networks—and everything within a few meters of them—that's constantly updated by vehicles as they drive along. HD Maps for these territories Here started work building HD maps back in 2013, according to Sanjay Sood, the company's VP for highly automated driving. "The notion of an HD map was created during a joint project with Here and Daimler for the 'Birth of Benz' drive, and we developed a core technology and HD map that was created as a research prototype in order to facilitate the functioning of that car driving through the German countryside," he told Ars. "When it comes to automated driving, the map becomes another sensor that helps the automated vehicle make decisions." The first step is to create the initial map, which involves sensor-encrusted mapping vehicles that put Google's Streetview cars to shame. Here uses a fleet of vehicles equipped with a roof-mounted sensor mast that packs 96 megapixels' worth of cameras, a 32-beam Velodyne LIDAR scanner, and highly accurate Novatel GPS Inertial Measurement Units. These mapping vehicles drive around creating a 3D scan of the road and its surroundings that gets sent to Here's cloud. From the cloud, that data is incorporated into a cm-accurate digital recreation of the real world. "Starting last year, we're essentially building the road network in order to have this map available for the first fleets of cars that are going to be leveraging this technology that are going to be showing up on the roads around 2020," said Sood. "So we have to seed that ecosystem with a map." Enlarge Here Likewise, Civil Maps just announced its Atlas DevKit, a plug-and-play solution developed for its customers. "Advanced localization, map creation, and crowdsourcing of maps are key challenges facing those hoping to test and deploy autonomous vehicle technology," said Sravan Puttagunta, co-founder and CEO of Civil Maps. "The Atlas DevKit platform accelerates the pace of innovation by enabling developers to quickly and economically localize vehicles, build dynamic maps, and crowdsource that critical information with other cars in real time." Like Here, Civil Maps' Atlas DevKit uses a roof-mounted mast (that can be configured with different sensors), although it also has a cheaper version that can utilize the optical, ultrasonic, and radar sensors that are already festooning many a new vehicle. It looks like you’re driving: Do you want me to track changes? Of course, "drawing" a map once won't be sufficient for a technology to which humans are supposed to trust their lives. Rather, maps will need to be constantly updated to reflect closures, road works, and other major obstacles. Here has a couple of approaches to solving that problem. "We have hundreds of these mapping vehicles deployed around the globe," Sood explains. "We have very in-depth relationships with many cities and regional authorities. So typically when there's a large construction project happening, we know well before it even starts, and in many situations we can drive our vehicles there before the roads are open to the public." That will allow Here to deploy updated maps (which typically arrive as 2km-by-2km tiles from Here's cloud) to vehicles the day a certain road is opened or closed. Enlarge Here But a more scalable solution involves leveraging the embedded sensors in cars already using HD maps to navigate. "Today, many high-end vehicles not only have LTE connections but an array of advanced sensors on them; a forward-looking camera, forward and rear radar, and we're working with numerous OEMs on getting that sensor data transmitted into our cloud," said Sood. That's going to mean millions of data points being constantly uploaded to the cloud, where Here's servers will do the heavy lifting of making sense out of it all. "We have machine learning algorithms and aggregation algorithms that sift through that data and try distilling changes from noise or aberrations in the world. Once we've detected those changes we update the map and then deploy that to the vehicle," explained Sood. As you might imagine, that has also meant coming up with a set of standards—called Sensoris—so that different makes of cars aren't uploading wildly different kinds of data. After all, a BMW 7 Series might use a more expensive radar sensor than a Volkswagen Golf, mounted in a different spot, meaning each gets a slightly different view of the world. "How do you take all this heterogenous data and then make sense of it when you put it into a big data lake?" Sood told us. "That's where a lot of the specialized skills that Here has come to the forefront." Not just graphics cards You may only know it for its GPUs, but Nvidia is becoming quite the player in this field, too, thanks to the company's expertise with machine learning and deep neural networks. Those have plenty of applications in the self-driving world, and Nvidia is working with Here, as well as with TomTom, Baidu, and Zenrin, on mapping and cloud-to-car platforms. "HD maps are essential for self-driving cars," said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia. "Here's adoption of our deep learning technology for their cloud-to-car mapping system will accelerate automakers' ability to deploy self-driving vehicles." Nvidia's technology—along with Intel's—will also be required to slim down the bandwidth bills that will surely follow a crowdsourcing mapping fleet. "We're developing a compute platform for the car, where the car itself does the change detection," Sood said. "A lot of the change detection currently happens in the cloud. Once you have cars that actually have the map in the vehicle, that are running around the world, our goal is to have the cars themselves do the change detection. So what it sends up to the cloud isn't a stream of sensor data but specifically, 'here's what's changed in the environment;' the differences between what the car sees and what the map says." That means optimizing all that deep learning and sensor fusion to work onboard the car rather than in a powerful server farm. Listing image by Here Jonathan M.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Windows Server is coming to ARM, Qualcomm servers coming to MS data centers 03/08/2017 at 10:14 AM by Brad Linder 5 Comments An upcoming version of Windows 10 for PCs is expected to support ARM-based chips, starting with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor. Now it looks like Microsoft is also working with Qualcomm to bring ARM support to its Windows Server operating system. The companies have announced a collaboration that will result in Microsoft using Qualcomm’s Centriq 2400 server solutions in its own data centers. Qualcomm Centriq 2400 The Centriq 2400 is a 10nm ARMv8 processor designed for servers, and Qualcomm’s first Centriq-based product supports up to 48 CPU cores. Qualcomm isn’t the first company to produce ARM-based chips for servers. But previous solutions haven’t been widely adopted and while they could support Linux-based server operating systems, they could not run Windows. The entry of a major chip maker like Qualcomm into the space could increase the popularity of ARM chips in data centers. While ARM processors tend to be more energy efficient than x86 chips from companies like Intel and AMD, it’s not clear that will be the case for solutions that bundle 48 CPU cores into a single server.

But none have shown up just yet. If ARM server chips couldn’t gain share on linux, I don’t think Windows support will change anything.

Guru3D.com » News » Panasonic introduces 2-in-1 semi-rugged Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook Panasonic introduces 2-in-1 semi-rugged Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 03/07/2017 08:34 AM | Source | 1 comment(s) Panasonic today launched its first semi-rugged 2-in-1 detachable notebook designed to offer mobile workers the very best of both worlds with tablet and notebook functionality in a light but durable business device.  The 2-in-1 Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook has a large 12.5” display for easy viewing and a wide range of business ports for use with modern and legacy business systems. Alongside its flexible design as a standalone tablet or connected to its own keyboard, the device is suited to the needs of many mobile workers. These include production line managers, fitters and mechanics in manufacturing, field service engineers and telecommunications technicians and customer facing sales staff in retail. “Many businesses deploying consumer 2-in-1 devices have struggled with reliability and functionality,” said Jan Kaempfer, General Manager for Marketing for Panasonic Computer Product Solutions. “This device is purpose built to bring those organisations all the flexibility and ease of use they desire but with the reliability and business-ready design they require to deliver a significant return on their investment.”  Business-ready design The display is ideal for workers needing to view technical images or data and forms clearly and for those wanting to show high quality images or presentations to potential customers. The 12.5" Full HD display (1920 x 1080) is a 10 finger capacitive IPS multi-touch screen. The device also comes with a capacitive pen for annotation. For communication and image capture there is a 2MP Webcam with stereo microphones and 8MP documentation rear camera. For intensive data entry there is a full size, backlit keyboard.  Wide ranging connectivity options Unlike many consumer devices that are reducing the number of ports, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook comes with a wide range of business ports, including USB 3.0, HDMI, LAN and True Serial for connection to a wide range of systems and devices. There is also a 4G LTE option for connectivity when on the move and options for smartcard and contactless smartcard readers for security*. Built to last Drawing on Panasonic’s 20 year history in designing long-lasting mobile devices for business, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook has semi-rugged status for mobile workers requiring a premium product that can withstand light, outside duties. With its magnesium alloy cabinet casing the device is able to withstand drops of up to 76cm and has a spillproof keyboard, yet remains lightweight and slim (max. 1.93 kg and 44mm thick). The tablet without keyboard weighs 1.09kg and is 22mm thick. The fanless device means it is also built to work effectively in dusty environments. Ease of use Designed for work on the move, this latest 2-in-1 has a useful carry strap that can also be used for holding the device in one hand. There is a kickstand incorporated into the design to enable the device to stand easily when connected to the keyboard. In addition, an optional 360 degree rotating hand strap** can be added for easy working with the tablet in portrait or landscape positions. An optional, sleek desktop cradle with Kensington lock for security, also allows the device to be easily used as a desktop.  Powered for productivity Built to handle the most powerful business applications and the ability to work throughout a shift, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook has an Intel 6th generation CPU (Intel® Core™ m5-6Y57 vPro™ Processor with 4 MB Smartcache, 1.1 GHz up to 2.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 515. It comes with a Windows 10 Pro operating system, downgradable to Windows 7 if required, a 128GB Solid State Drive with 256GB as a factory option and 4GB of RAM (8GB factory option, project based).  Pricing and availability The Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook comes with a standard 3 year warranty and will be available from May 2017 (Windows 7 SKU June 2017), price starting 1.995€ + vat.

It Looks like Ubuntu 17.04 Might Ship with Mesa 17.0.1 and X.Org Server 1.19.2 GO Both packages are now ready for testing in the proposed repo Mar 11, 2017 03:57 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Canonical's Timo Aaltonen is back with some great news for Ubuntu Linux gamers, as he's now working on bringing the latest X.Org Server 1.19.2 display server and Mesa 17.0.1 3D Graphics Library to the upcoming Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) release. In his latest blog post, the developer reveals the fact that the long-anticipated X.Org 1.19 display server is now ready for public testing on a special PPA (Personal Package Archive) for Ubuntu 17.04, along with Mesa 17.0.1, which appears to rest in the proposed repository of the forthcoming distribution at the moment of writing. "I’ve prepared X server 1.19.2 along with the driver rebuilds for zesty on the staging ppa here: https://launchpad.net/~canonical-x/+archive/ubuntu/x-staging," said Timo Aaltonen, Hardware Enablement, Field Expert Squad Team Lead at Canonical. "It also comes with Mesa 17.0.1 while it’s still stuck in zesty-proposed." A call for testing Of course, this is more of a call for testing than an announcement, so don't get too excited. However, it will be a huge achievement for Canonical to ship the Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) release with an up-to-date graphics stack based on X.Org Server 1.19 and Mesa 17.0, which translates to a major performance gain for your gaming experience. Therefore, if you want to see Mesa 17 and X.Org Server 1.19 in Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus), we recommend that you set up a special partition and test drive the two technologies from the staging PPA linked above. Make sure that you report any issues you might encounter with your graphics cards, especially AMD Radeon and Intel users. According to Timo Aaltonen, Canonical's plan is to bring both X.Org Server 1.19.2 and Mesa 17.0.1 to the main repos of Ubuntu 17.04 next week, if everything goes well and there aren't any blockers, so fingers crossed for a better gaming experience on Ubuntu. Meanwhile, the Linux 4.10.1 kernel has landed in the Zesty Zapus repos. #Ubuntu 17.04#Zesty Zapus#Mesa 17.0.1#X.Org Server 1.19.2#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news CloudLinux 7 and 6 Users Receive Security Kernel Update to Patch CVE-2017-2636 Debian-Based Elive 2.8.6 Beta Makes the Live Mode Twice as Fast, Updates Artwork Voyager 16.04.2 Distro Uses Linux Kernel 4.8 for Kaby Lake Support, Xfce 4.12.3 New Steam Client Update Adds Steam Controller Configuration Links, Many Changes Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000 Apple Releases Beta 7 of iOS 10.3 & macOS 10.12.4 Sierra to Devs, Public Testers    Ubuntu 17.04 Other Linux Distros LXLE: An extended version of the Lubuntu Linux operating system suitable for low-end systems Ultimate Edition: An Ubuntu based Open Source Linux operating system with a lot of software pre-added Vine Linux: A Linux-based operating system with a highly customized Japanese desktop environment AUSTRUMI: A business card size bootable Linux distribution based on the Slackware operating system Clonezilla LiveCD: A Debian-based Live CD that allows you to clone hard disks without installing any software SolydX: A free Debian-based Linux distribution that features the Xfce desktop environment SolydK: A free Debian-based Linux distribution that features the KDE desktop environment Reader comments Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Reaches End of Life on April 28, Users Can Purchase ESM Updates more on: Ubuntu 12.04 ESM i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.
