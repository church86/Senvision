Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News 3 Popular Stocks Hedge Fund Tycoons Are Ditching It’s not uncommon for Wall Street and retail investors to look toward the world’s top money managers for guidance on where the stock market, and some of the most popular stocks, are headed next. While these hedge-fund magnates can be wrong just like the rest of us, their track record suggests they know a thing or two about investing, which is why the investments of the world’s top hedge funds are so closely monitored. According to 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fourth quarter, a handful of highly popular stocks were kicked to the curb by prominent hedge funds and their managers. Three of those popular stocks, as highlighted by our Foolish contributors, are chipmaking giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , branded-apparel retailer Michael Kors Holdings (NYSE: KORS) , and mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY) . Image source: Getty Images. Patience is a virtue Tim Brugger  ( Intel ): With approximately $160 billion in assets under management, Bridgewater Associates is one of the largest money managers around, and like many of its peers and individual investors, it appears it’s run out of patience as Intel continues its business transformation. In the last quarter of 2016, Bridgewater shed 570,700 shares of Intel, equal to over 37% of its total stake. With its stock down 3% in 2017, Bridgewater isn’t the only Intel naysayer. That said, thanks in part to a stronger-than-expected PC market and continued growth in key units, Intel is coming off a record-breaking quarter and year in which revenue climbed to $16.4 billion and $59.4 billion, respectively. Client computing continues to drive much of Intel’s revenue, but it was its focus on cloud data center sales, the Internet of Things (IoT), and data security that put it over the top. Intel is very much aware that PCs are not where it’s future lies, and it has gone on record saying it is now a data center first provider. Image source: Intel. Intel’s client computing unit revenue climbed a respectable 2% last year to $32.9 billion. But data center sales jumped 8% to $17.2 billion, IoT soared 15% to $2.6 billion, and data security was up 9% to $2.2 billion. With each passing quarter, Intel derives more and more of its total revenue from its up-and-coming units. Add to that Intel’s 3.1% dividend yield, and patient investors will be rewarded, despite what some of the industry’s big hitters think. When the fashion tide turns…. Brian Feroldi ( Michael Kors Holdings ): David Einhorn, the famous billionaire investor who runs Greenlight Capital, is a hedge fund manager I like to keep tabs on. One stock that Einhorn recently sold out of completely is Michael Kors Holdings, the luxury retailer that owns the iconic „MK” brand. It isn’t hard to figure out why Einhorn isn’t feeling bullish about this company’s prospects any longer. Kors has posted a string of disappointing earnings reports that feature declining comparable-store sales. This metric declined by 6.9% in the all-important holiday quarter, driving a 3.2% decrease in total sales. While the company’s massive buyback program helped to drive its EPS higher year over year, the declining comparable-store sales hint that this brand is losing its consumer appeal. If true, that could mean that the company’s troubles are likely to get worse. Image source: Michael Kors Holdings. While management has a plan to right the ship , it admits that the near term is going to be challenging. For the upcoming quarter, it’s projecting that comps will fall in the „low teens,” which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. It is possible that management’s plan could work out and that shares could be a bargain way down here. However, Einhorn clearly doesn’t believe that a turnaround is in the cards, which is why he got out while he could. I agree with him that keeping this stock far away from your portfolio is probably the best move. This nearly 11% yield was on the chopping block Sean Williams ( Annaly Capital Management ): Mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management is exceptionally popular among income investors because of its nearly 11% dividend yield. Assuming this yield remained static, investors could double their investment on the payout alone in less than seven years. However, certain hedge funds wanted nothing to do with Annaly Capital during the fourth quarter. Clough Capital Partners, headed by Charles Clough, former chief investment strategist of Merrill Lynch , dumped all 1.41 million shares of Annaly in Q4 2016, Similarly, Acadian Asset Management, which has more than $20 billion in funds under management, dumped nearly 2.5 million Annaly shares, and Rockefeller Financial Services sold almost 7.2 million shares. These are big hedge funds running for the hills. Image source: Getty Images. What has these big money hedge funds spooked? Look no further than the Federal Reserve’s ongoing monetary tightening. REITs of all forms thrive off borrowing money and reinvesting those assets to generate nearly guaranteed income. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing rises, which throttles the ability of REITs to use leverage. It also has a tendency to inhibit margins. In Annaly’s case, it means a narrower net interest margin, and potentially less cash to divvy out to investors. Even more so, rising interest rates can make dividend stocks appear less attractive. As yields rise on safe interest-bearing assets, investors may choose to opt out of riskier dividend stocks, which can harm a company’s share price. This Fool does understand why hedge funds are approaching Annaly with caution, but I believe they’re overlooking a few key points. Namely, that Annaly’s management team is experienced and has weathered a rising interest-rate environment before, and that Annaly predominantly deals in agency-only (i.e., government-backed) mortgage-backed securities. This means it’s protected from defaults, which makes it among the safer mortgage-REITs. Even if Annaly’s dividend yield were to fall, it’s still likely to have a much higher yield than nearly all S&P 500 companies, and it’s valued at just below its book value. There are plenty of reasons to believe this popular income stock can still be a winner for investors. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While we can't resolve the Intel vs AMD dilemma for you, we can point you to some pretty decent CPU deals this week on both the Ryzen 7 CPUs and Intel Kaby Lake processors.     At Jet.com, you can now apply a $30 off coupon for some decent price drops on AMD's newly minted processors. This code is now valid on both the Ryzen 7 1700 and the Ryzen 7 1700X, both of which were added to Jet's store catalog earlier this month and knocks the price down to $300 and $367. Accompanying AMD's offering are also some deals on Intel's Kaby Lake in the form of a Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K, both of which are now priced at about $318 and $205 after coupon. The coupon code is good for your first three purchases at Jet and seems to have been extended for the foreseeable future.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Analyst backs Intel’s claim that Moore’s Law isn’t slowing Dean Takahashi@deantak April 1, 2017 9:10 AM Tags: Amd, Dan Hutcheson, Global Foundries, Intel, Qualcomm, TSMC, VLSI Research Above: Dan Hutcheson of VLSI Research Image Credit: Dean Takahashi In the past couple of years, there were a lot of stories about how Moore’s Law was slowing down. That was a reason for financial panic, as it suggested that technological progress was slowing and that the global economy could suffer as a result. Only it wasn’t really true. Gordon Moore, Intel’s chairman emeritus, predicted in 1965 that the number of transistors on a chip would double every couple of years. That prediction held up for decades, but it appeared to slow down as Intel became quiet about its progress. But last week, Intel disclosed that, while it took longer for the company to make its latest technological leap, it had miniaturized transistors for its 10-nanometer manufacturing at a better-than-expected level. And that meant Moore’s Law is on track. Intel plans to shift from 14-nanometer manufacturing to 10-nanometer technology later this year. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and the number represents the distance between circuits in a chip. And Intel says that its manufacturing process is ahead of rivals such as Samsung, TSMC, and Global Foundries. I caught up with Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research, at Intel’s event. Hutcheson has been covering the chip industry for decades, and I bounced Intel’s assertions off him. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation. Above: Intel’s view of how small chip circuits are. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VentureBeat: What do you think of the disputes over who’s ahead in 10-nanometer manufacturing? Dan Hutcheson: We got away from these fictitious node names. That really dates back to the ‘90s. Before that everybody used dynamic random access memory (DRAM). I don’t know if anyone remembers that, but before we used DRAM. Then, when the Japanese came to dominate DRAM—okay, we’re not in DRAM, so how do we come up with something different that applies to us? That was when the nanometer node came. Although we called them microns back then. It was a while before we rolled over to nanometers. VB: Does it make sense as far as what Intel has said, that they have this three-year lead? That their 14 nanometer is equivalent to what everyone else is calling 10 nanometer? Hutcheson: Oh, yes. That’s the way it’s been for a long time now, since somewhere around 40 or 65. Intel really accelerated ahead of everyone. A few years ago they got a good node ahead, one or two nodes ahead, and then they started to slow a little bit as far as specific nanometers they were using. VB: Everyone worried about the slowing of Moore’s Law at the time. Hutcheson: That’s all BS. That’s all just people who can’t compete anymore, so they like to go out and talk about how Moore’s Law is dead. I’ve written two Scientific American articles addressing whether Moore’s Law is dead. One of them was in 1996. Another one was in 2005, I think, or 2003. It keeps coming back as a theme. Before we decided to shrink our library, I had this paper from 1968 that said Moore’s Law was going to die. Even Gordon himself, in a 1965 paper, said he thought it would only last into the ‘70s. VB: It came into a lot of the strategy. AMD has been saying that because Moore’s Law is slowing, Intel doesn’t have as big a lead on them anymore on that front. When they pull ahead with better design, like zen, it makes a bigger impact now. They can say Intel can’t outmanufacture them. Or that’s their argument. Hutcheson: AMD’s advantage has always been design. There was a time—if you go back to the 130 nanometer age, AMD’s gate lengths were tighter than Intel’s. That’s not true anymore. But the slowing is a fiction. The other thing people get into is—because of the node being a convention, the way people look at Moore’s Law moved from what my density of memory was, how many transistors I could put in a chip I could sell, to what’s the half-pitch? That you can measure really easily by Rayleigh’s theorem. It boiled down to who bought what litho tool. They told you where they were technically capable at any particular point in time. The problem is, if you and I get in a Ferrari over here at Sonoma Raceway and start driving, versus [Formula One driver] Sebastian Vettel getting in the same car, he’ll run circles around us. This is what Intel is describing today. They’re coming out and saying, “We still build faster laptops.” VB: Qualcomm’s argument has been that they’re on such a good learning curve with smartphone chip production, which Intel doesn’t have, so that they’re moving faster while Intel’s PC business slows down. That was at the beginning of the year, when they announced their 10 nanometer chip. Hutcheson: And everybody sort of hides behind the fact that their 10 nanometer isn’t really 10 nanometer. Just like the 20 wasn’t a real 20. Above: Intel is on the blue path, and rivals are behind on the red path. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi/Intel VB: Do things like gate length tell you that? What tells you that the most? Hutcheson: It boils down to SRAM cell size. I’m still using—if I look at the cell sizes these guys publish at the International Electron Devices Meeting or whatever, you can see where they are. Because you can’t compare a PC CPU to a server CPU and so on, because you’re going to have different densities depending on how far you have to space the transistors because of performance or what you’re doing for low power. Also, depending on the application, how much SRAM you want to have in it. SRAM is very densely packed. The logic is loosely packed. The I/O and all that stuff is very loosely packed. Depending on your mix of those, you get a different chip density. At the end of the day, you say, “What’s the minimum cell?” This is what Intel’s been using for a while: on the cell, we can do this cell height and this cell width. But that’s not such a great metric. The other issue we have is there’s not a new name for the new naming convention. What do you call it? VB: For the foundry business, does it sound like they’re pretty serious? They can use 10 nanometer for it? Hutcheson: Oh, they’re very serious about using 10 nanometer for the foundry. In the end, that’s their big advantage. How do they take their ability to merge the process and link the process to the design to get a competitive advantage? To your point about Qualcomm saying they’re ahead, where they’re really ahead is in all the CDMA technology and the patents. Everything they have in terms of core technology puts them ahead regardless of the transistors. The transistors are just the beginning. You can make up for not having a competitive transistor in other ways. The hard part is, how do you make up for the power difference? In mobile that’s critical, because if your modem burns more power than the other guy’s, you lose. You run the battery down faster. Above: Progress on Moore’s Law is intact, but not always steady. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi/Intel VB: There wasn’t as much talk about that today, the power side of things. Is that something you need to know more about? Hutcheson: It’s more of a dark art. They talked a bit about it, about 22 nanometer versus 10 versus 14 and why they’re bringing 22 out, to go for low power. The point to that would be, when you go for ultra low power, you really go to different architectures, a different transistor. You start from a different base point as you build up the whole design. VB: Where they stand on 3D Xpoint? Hutcheson: They’re two different companies, two different organizations within Intel. There’s the memory group and the others. What I suspect you’ll see in the future is possibly 3D Xpoint being integrated in a heterogeneous way, but in reality it makes a lot more sense to do heterogeneous integration of DRAM before you bring Xpoint into play. VB: Is that what a lot of the heterogeneous packaging was about? Hutcheson: Yeah. Basically, I need to feed the processor information. As far as getting that information into the processor the fastest, it’s SRAM, then DRAM, then flash. What’s happened is the gap between flash and DRAM has spread. Xpoint fits in between those two. My sense is they’re really not ready to look at integrating 3D Xpoint. What makes more sense is taking the DRAM from Micron and integrating it. If you look at what Micron’s been talking about, about system-in-package integration levels and embedded DRAM, that’s all going into heterogeneous packages. Someone buys the DRAM from them and they put it in with other chips. VB: Back to Moore’s Law, if it takes longer for them to get to 10 nanometer, but they have that 2.7X instead of 2X improvement, is that staying on Moore’s Law? Just a little bumpier way of staying on Moore’s Law? Hutcheson: We’re still staying on Moore’s Law. If you can do 2X every couple of years you’re still on Moore’s Law. It doesn’t end. In fact, what you see is—the debate around Moore’s Law sometimes borders on pure hyperbole. People will take that chart John Chen used as a forecast, saying it was bottoming. People still reference that chart, but now they take it as history. It was a forecast. The day it was published, he was saying, “If we don’t do something, it’s going to do this.” That chart got picked up a year or two later and ever since then people have taken it and said, “Oh, it’s flattening out.” It’s not just Intel. When you look at TSMC, they’re still clocking a doubling of density, and so is Global Foundries. But it’s become popular, this whole idea of Moore’s Law slowing.

Cloudera finally ready for the public stage Posted 15 hours ago by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story Krablr releases first diversity report When I first met Cloudera CEO Tom Reilly in 2015 at the Intel Capital Summit, we were about to go on stage for a fireside chat to discuss among other things Intel’s massive investment in his company. While on stage, the conversation inevitably turned to when the company might go public. As you might expect, he gave me the standard startup CEO answer. While Cloudera was certainly of sufficient size to IPO, they had just raised over a billion dollars and had plenty of cash. He was willing to wait until, in his words, “when we feel it’s the right time.” Apparently it was yesterday when the company filed its S-1 paperwork with the SEC indicating its plans to go public. The announcement had been rumored for some time, and made sense, especially given the number of enterprise tech companies that have gone public  (or announced their intentions to do so) recently. As we’ve seen, in the first quarter of this year, enterprise tech IPOs are suddenly a hot commodity with Alteryx and MuleSoft already having gone out, and Cloudera joining Yext and Okta as the next ones up in the queue. In spite of the name, Cloudera isn’t really a cloud company, at least in the pure sense. It’s a commercial product built on top of the open source Hadoop project, the one with the cute elephant for a mascot. In spite of the cuteness, Hadoop is very serious technology used to process massive amounts of data, which should come in increasingly handy in a world with increasing amounts data to deal with — often referred to in industry parlance as “big data”. Separating from the pack Photo: Christian Heilmann on Flickr. Used under CC by 2.0 license. The problem is that while Hadoop may be a powerful way to process that data, and it may be available as open source, it is not simple to use. That’s where companies like Cloudera and Hortonworks, which went public in 2014 come in. These companies, and others like MapR, are attempting to package Hadoop in a way that makes it more consumable for large organizations. While Hortonworks came strong out of the gate after its IPO, it has not fared all as well since. After a high of over $27 in July, 2015, it was under $10 a share as of the close on Friday. But just because two or more companies share the same market doesn’t mean they each share the same fate or are even completely comparable beyond both being Hadoop vendors. Carl Olofson, an analyst at IDC, says there are some fundamental differences between the two companies. He describes Hortonworks as a “pure open source company,” one that packages, coordinates and manages that open source as a product for a subscription fee, and also sells support. He says the company’s products are aimed mostly at “big data technologists.” Cloudera is a bit different, he says. “[It] offers packages that are mostly open source, but with tooling that is proprietary, and that are aimed at various classes of business problems. They sell to business managers. So their approach is different, and as a result, they have a higher percentage of their income derived from software than does Hortonworks,” Olofson told TechCrunch. The Intel connection One of Cloudera’s chief investors was none other than Intel, which sank $740 million into the company in a single investment in March, 2014, obviously seeing some serious potential to take such a substantial stake. And as you would expect, the S-1 revealed Intel and Cloudera have a special relationship and a deep partnership, and that too could give it additional investor credibility as it heads into the public markets. Related Articles The enterprise strikes back Cloudera posts long-awaited IPO filing Intel Pours $740M Into Cloudera In Exchange For An 18% Stake Hortonworks Picks Up 3% After Reporting Better-Than-Expected Q3 Earnings, Strong Guidance Certainly Reilly thought so in our interview saying, “While everyone focused on the dollars behind the investment that Intel made, what was so important to us was the partnership, and the value that Intel brings us as a partner goes way beyond the dollars they gave us.” The S-1included multiple examples of the two companies working together including developing a way to speed up encryption at the chip level and launching an open source cybersecurity project called Apache Spot, a platform for advanced threat detection using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Cloudera’s has been around since 2008, and the market should appreciate that longevity says Olofson. “Compared to others, Cloudera could be seen as a relatively mature player, with steady growth, a good market position and significant momentum,” he said. While markets can be fickle, it could be that this is finally Cloudera’s moment.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Intel Intel’s new tech makes hard drives feel as fast as an SSD Chris Smith @chris_writes March 28th, 2017 at 1:30 PM Share Tweet Intel last week released an SSD that’s faster and more durable than its rivals. The best thing about the Optane DC P4800X drive is that it also works as RAM memory. That’s right, Optane drives may deliver cover RAM and SSD duties in the future. I say in the future because this first Optane product isn’t aimed at the consumer market. Instead, it’ll be used in servers for the time being. However, Intel has now announced a second Optane-branded product, the Intel Optane Memory, which targets regular computer users and should offer you a computing experience as fast as an SSD even on a system that still uses regular HDD spinning drives. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8: Specs, release info, and everything else we know right now Even though SSDs will significantly speed up computers, they’re considerably more expensive than good old HDDs. But the Intel Optane Memory SSD is a product that’ll speed up systems that still use a mechanical hard drive as the primary storage. The Optane Memory is an M.2 NVMe SSD, AnandTech explains, that will be used as a cache drive inside your computer. It comes in 16GB and 32GB capacities, which means it’s not made for regular storage purposes. Instead, Intel designed the drive to be used only for caching, with the help of its Rapid Storage Technology drivers. Optane Memory caching is only supported on Windows 10 64-bit and only for the boot volume, the report explains. Furthermore, you’ll need a Kaby Lake generation 200-series motherboard and Kaby Lake processors to make it all work. Furthermore, the drive might not be too power-efficient for use in a laptop for the time being. If you’re thinking about combining Intel’s Optane Memory with an SSD drive to further speed up your system, don’t get too excited. It’s likely you won’t notice any performance improvements. In spite of these “limitations,” the Optane Memory is a relatively cheap upgrade for desktop users who want a faster OS experience but also plenty of HDD storage. The product retails for $44 (16GB) or $77 (32GB) and is available for preorder right now with an April 24 ship date. More technical details about Intel’s Optane Memory are available over at Intel and AnandTech.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD announces low-power processor for tablet, smartphone markets AMD announces low-power processor for tablet, smartphone markets By Joel Hruska on April 1, 2017 at 9:00 am Comment When AMD announced Ryzen, it made it clear that the chip would hit the desktop market first, followed by server and mobile APUs. Server parts are expected in Q2, with mobile APUs following in the back half of the year. Analysts and reviewers have broadly praised the architecture, but some fans have asked why AMD hasn’t moved into the tablet and smartphone space? After all, these markets were ripe for an x86 alternative once Intel abandoned them, and AMD isn’t burdened by the high fab costs that made Intel products unprofitable. In fact, given that AMD has contracts with both TSMC and GlobalFoundries, there’s no reason to think it would be handicapped by the high manufacturing costs that crippled Intel’s attempts to build an Atom business that could compete with Android. Fans, the wait is finally over. Secret documents emailed to ExtremeTech show that AMD is planning a new mobile product. Codenamed “Little Foot,” the new architecture is a marvel of low-power, high-efficiency performance. We’ve even got an image of the CPU’s design to share with you. “The K6 is a remarkably efficient CPU,” said Greg Favor, the chief processor architect. “We’ve designed a chip that can readily compete with equivalent Intel or ARM processors at a much lower price, without compromising on the performance and power efficiency that users demand from today’s mobile devices.” Like most modern microprocessors, the K6 has a RISC-like front-end (AMD is calling it RISC86) and decodes native x86 instructions into micro-ops. The CPU’s 64KB of L1 (32KB instructions, 32KB data) ensure a high hit rate and keep branch prediction stalls to a minimum. The chip’s short pipeline (six stages), six integer execution units, and four instruction decoders are quite formidable when compared with what other manufacturers offer, and they allow the K6 to punch above its weight class in integer operations. “We settled on the name K6 because we wanted to capture AMD’s dedication to low-power efficiency,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su. “Our last K-branded design was the K12, and, well, K6 is half of that. We fired all our marketing people in 2012. Stop asking these questions.” AMD was cagey about what kind of GPU it might pair with its new architecture, saying the design was in early stages. “We’ve commissioned a new GPU, codenamed Rage,” RTG head Raja Koduri told us. “We expect to deliver superior performance in all 32-bit graphics modes, but God help you if you try using 16-bit color or OpenGL.” AMD expects its new K6 APUs to be in market by mid-2018 on 14nm technology. The company continues to play games with the press concerning which foundry it uses for which products, but our bet is on Samsung or GlobalFoundries. GF’s implementation of Samsung’s 14nm has been excellent for Ryzen, and this nascent APU will need all the power savings and clock speed it can get. The other uncertainty is OS support. AMD has signaled that Microsoft OSes, up to and including Windows 10 Mobile, will run on the K6 platform, but Android compatibility may be tricky. Some of you may recall that Intel was nearly a year late in shipping Bay Trail platforms with Android, and our sources tell us this was largely due to graphics driver issues. AMD will have to navigate a similar situation if it chooses to support Google’s operating system, and it’s not clear if they’ll bother at this point in time.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: And welcome to this busy Friday news night here on "Hannity." Now, in just a few minutes, we'll have Newt Gingrich, Kellyanne Conway, Jay Sekulow, Monica Crowley. They'll all join us. But first -- for the good of the country, it is time to end this GOP circular firing squad, and that is tonight's "Opening Monologue." All right, so sometimes in life, when things don't go exactly the way we want, people get frustrated, they get annoyed, and there's no more frustrating place on earth than Washington, D.C. So I get why the president is upset that Republicans couldn't hammer out this deal on health care last week. Now, the president, to his credit -- he has a big, bold, aggressive agenda. See that list there? He's checking off his promises one after another. I say he's moving at the speed of Trump. Now, we have promised on this program to hold Washington accountable, and that means everybody. Now, while it's understandable the president is frustrated over the GOP health care bill and it being pulled -- I'm, too, but I see it a little bit differently than he does. From my perspective, after seven years, almost eight years of Republicans promising to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to me, it is inexcusable they didn't build a consensus bill that was ready for the president. Now, the other big mistake is the Republican leadership -- they kept everybody in the dark! Everyone was left guessing what's in the bill, what's in the bill? All these rumors were coming out. Oh, this is in it, that's trouble. That's in it, there's trouble. There was no consensus that was built behind the scenes! Now, the Republican leadership -- they dumped this bill. They literally rolled it out and then left it to the president to close the deal. Well, guess what? That's not his job. Now, the president does deserve credit. He did his best to get it done, got very close, but they didn't get there. The legislative branch, though, from my perspective -- they failed the president because they clearly were not prepared for this moment. Now, in the end, I do believe it is important to get the bill right, rather than get it done fast. Now, some in Washington -- they're trying to put all the blame on the conservative Freedom Caucus. And as I said last night, I think this anger is misplaced. Now, if the Freedom Caucus had been consulted from the beginning and they didn't roll out the bill and they had a chance to see it beforehand and leadership reached out to them from the get-go, I don't think we'd be in this situation. Now, sometimes, we need to stand back and remember who our real friends are. Let me give you an example. Let's talk about Illinois Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger. Now, today, writes an op-ed for The New York Times titled, quote, "How the Freedom Caucus is undermining the GOP" where he literally mocks the Freedom Caucus, literally, and their name by writing, quote, "Interesting name for a group of about three dozen members that refuses to let the will of the people advance on the House floor." Now, keep in mind, this is the same Adam Kinzinger who during the election and prior to the inauguration was mentioned in headlines, like the one you see on your screen, the same Adam who in August said he wouldn't vote for Donald Trump. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM KINZINGER, R-ILLINOIS: Donald Trump for me is beginning to cross a lot of red lines of the unforgivable in politics. And so, you know, I'm not going to support Hillary, but you know, in America, we have the right to write somebody in or skip the vote and vote for Mark Kirk in Illinois, for instance, and that's what it's looking like for me today. I just don't see how I get to Donald Trump anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And even following the election, Kinzinger played coy about who he actually voted for on November the 8th. Now, is Congressman Kinzinger -- is he really the guy to be lecturing the Freedom Caucus, who did support candidate Trump? I'm not buying that. Now, during the campaign, the Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows -- he was a staunch ally of candidate Trump, now President Trump. In July, in Greenville on line, they ran an article on Meadows that said in part, quote, "Meadows initially endorsed Texas senator Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primary, but he is now embracing Trump with more gusto than others in the GOP. And according to Nate Silver's Fivethirtyeight, at least 29 of the 34 members of the House Freedom Caucus endorsed or at least voted for Trump in the election. And by the way, with all due respect to Speaker Ryan, Laura Ingraham last night on this program pointed out Ryan made it clear he wanted little to do with then candidate Donald Trump. So let's be clear. A lot of blame to throw around about the Republican health care bill being pulled, and infighting is not a solution to the problem. I also don't think President Trump reaching out to Democrats is ever going to work. The one thing I do know for sure, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Steny Hoyer -- they're not the president's friends and they do not want him to succeed in any way. Don't believe me? Listen to what they said about the president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, MINORITY LEADER: My view is he is far too tolerant in accepting the support of racists. REP. STENY HOYER, D-MD., MINORITY WHIP: I think experience would tell us over the last 10 days, and frankly, the last 15 months, who knows. Who knows what President Trump is going to do at any given moment and give offense to people that we need to be -- have confidence in us and we need to have confidence in our relationship with them. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., MINORITY LEADER: Ineffective. They've accomplished nothing. His deceptor -- the deflector-in-chief -- he's deflected from the fact that he hasn't produced a jobs bill, hasn't produced an infrastructure bill, has accomplished nothing. And he just has to deflect by coming up with bans on certain religions-- (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: All right, now the question is, where do we go from here? How do we solve the problem for the American people because this is a promise they made. Now, Republicans, in many ways -- need to go back to the drawing board and do what they should have done in the first place. They need to create a bill that will pass in the House, and that means the Study Group, the Tuesday Group, the Freedom Caucus, moderates. They all need to be brought in a room, as well as senators, Secretary Price, the vice president, everybody included, and hammer out a deal. Get away from the cameras, and certainly don't go on television and negotiate in the public eye. Now, if they do these things instead of pointing fingers at each other, then they'll have an opportunity to give the American people a bill that they really want, need and desire, one that's going to lower premiums and offer better health care. There's the answer. Solve the problem. Remember the movie "Disclosure"? You talk about solve the problem. Find the solution. Here with reaction, the author of the best-seller "Treason," former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, really, does the Freedom Caucus need to get lectured? We got a speaker that barely wanted to be seen-- NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, no. I-- (LAUGHTER) GINGRICH: Look, first of all, you hit it right on the head. The Freedom Caucus had probably the highest percentage of Trump supporters of any group in the House. They disagree about this one thing, and I think, from their perspective, they probably think Trump was misinformed. But this -- let me give you an example of something today that Nancy Pelosi doesn't get. The National Association of Manufacturers met with the president to share with him that their CEOs have the highest level of confidence in making new investments in the United States that they can remember in well over a decade. This follows other things that are going on. Despite all the noise in Congress, President Trump is making real progress and he's getting things done. And every time you turn around, you see new signs of investment, new commitments to build things in the United States. I think that he's got to solve this legislative problem. My personal advice would be to start with infrastructure. And frankly, after the extraordinary fire in Atlanta last night, which is going to cause enormous traffic problems-- HANNITY: That's I-85. GINGRICH: -- for the city for months-- HANNITY: That's -- that's disastrous. GINGRICH: It's a good reminder -- an area you know well from the years you were down there. I mean, this is a good reminder we got to rebuild our infrastructure. I think you start there, then you move to a nice tax cut bill, not just tax reform. And then you get to health care third. But right now, I think they're all gridlocked and too busy being mad at each other. They've got to get over it, relax. This is the beginning of a long game. This is not the end of it. And we got lots of time to get lots of good things done for America. HANNITY: Well, and by the way, they've got to keep the promise. This is not optional. They can't let ObamaCare implode. So to me, it's very simple. You have to, if you're in leadership, show your members the bill before you unveil the bill publicly. Then you got to build consensus. I appreciate that there are moderates and different groups, Study Group, Tuesday Group, Freedom Caucus. You got to -- everyone's got to work together. They got to hammer out a consensus. It would be wise for them to work with the Senate from the get-go so they don't end up in conference and the Senate bill and the House bill are two very different bills, and that then becomes another opportunity for it to fall apart. So bring everybody together. And while they're doing the things you mention, this can get done, right? GINGRICH: Yes, I think it can get done. I also think, if they do it right, they're going to shock all of us because if you look at the collapse of ObamaCare in rural America, I think Senator Heitkamp, who's a Democrat from North Dakota, might have a really hard time voting against a good Republican bill that was well designed. I think the same thing goes for the senator from Indiana, the senator from Missouri, the senator from Montana. I wouldn't automatically assume that they're going to going to hunker down and decide to destroy themselves. They're up for reelection next year. And in parts of rural America, ObamaCare is a total disaster, and we can do something dramatically better. And if the public understands it -- which is the other half of this -- the country has to believe in the bill if it's going to pass. Health is too big an issue to pass if the American people aren't with you. HANNITY: But there is something to learn from this experience. I think, number one, you can't unveil a bill that nobody's seen. You have to bring the different groups in the Congress together. You should include the Senate so you don't have a problem in conference. And why would they have done it this way anyway? That makes no sense to me. They had-- (CROSSTALK) HANNITY: Here's the frustrating thing. GINGRICH: No, no, no! HANNITY: Eight years! GINGRICH: Look, I have no idea how they ended up like this. We used to follow a model of Listen, learn, help, and lead. Or as somebody once said to me, you know, you got one mouth and two ears and there's a pretty good hint there. And I think the fact is that people -- when you're doing something this big, one fifth of the economy, life and death for every American, you need to do it carefully out in the open. People have to have a real sense of participation. You can't ram it through, and you can't assume that a small group of people know enough by themselves. That's what Obama did wrong. That's what Hillary did wrong back in the `90s. This is a really big, complicated issue. I think it's fixable, but-- and it may take three or four bills, all of which ought to be understood from day one. And I think that -- frankly, that's part of why I would shift and look at infrastructure and at tax cuts because you can do those while you're working through what needs to be done in health care. All three could be done this year if they're willing to work with the American people and have an open legislative process. HANNITY: All right, sir. Great idea. Thank you. And up next on this busy Friday news night, liberals and members of the biased press are out to get the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Devin Nunes. They're focusing their anger in the wrong place. We'll explain in a mini-monologue coming up next. And we'll get reaction from Mercedes Schlapp, Jay Sekulow. Also later tonight, former national security adviser Michael Flynn is offering to testify in front of the House and Senate Intel Committees if he's granted immunity. Monica Crowley has reaction. All of that, plus counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway will join us in studio on this busy Friday news night. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: And welcome back to "Hannity." The House Intelligence Committee chairman, Congressman Devin Nunes -- he's standing firm against attacks from the Democrats and members of the alt left propaganda destroy Trump media. Now, true to form, they are focusing their anger on Congressman Nunes instead of reporting extensively on what is the big story here! They're missing it all. That's tonight's mini-monologue. All right, from the very moment that Chairman Nunes made the bombshell announcement last week that he saw reports that prove surveillance was collected on President Trump and his transition team, well, liberals and members of the biased press -- they've been out to get him! Now, just listen to what they have said about Nunes in just the past 48 hours. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sometimes, it's just easier to explain it away by pure, good old-fashioned 100 percent grade A incompetence and stupidity. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That just may be what we have here with Congressman Nunes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Never seen anything like this amateur hour at work now. Here we go with the latest buffoonery from the Trump operation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do think that Devin Nunes is such a uniquely clueless individual and so out of his depth in this whole investigation that ascribing too much planning and motive to him might be wrong. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Nunes piece is going to get even more interesting and baffling than it is now if you consider a couple of things. First of all, his crazy behavior. Everybody has read about that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You get this? The mainstream alt left propaganda destroy Trump media -- they're trying to distract the country by going after Nunes and questioning his credibility. Now, by doing that, they are ignoring the real story and what we should all be talking about because what Nunes has revealed about the leaks, the unmasking of American names, and of course, the surveillance of the Trump team -- this could end up being the biggest scandal in decades, if not ever, to hit Washington! Now, the big question is this. Did the Obama administration knowingly supreme court the Trump team and incoming opposition party? Now, as Nunes said on this program last week, additional American names were unmasked, and he saw the reports and he said they had nothing to do with Russia and collusion! And this should concern every single lawmaker, every single journalist and every American. And today, Fox's own Adam Housley is reporting that the two individuals who showed Nunes the information at the White House -- they had nothing to do with the outing of this information! In fact, here's what Adam reported earlier today. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX CORRESPONDENT: The person who did the unmasking, I'm told, is very well-known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world and is not in the FBI. We're also told the people who helped Devin Nunes navigate were the two individuals that the stories were reported yesterday about, but they were not his sources. It was a navigation situation. And the reason why they had to navigate, I'm told, is that Nunes learned about this unmasking and who this was taking place back in January, before Trump's tweet, before he met with the president. And it took, obviously, a number of weeks to try to figure out a way for him to see this intelligence because the agencies were stonewalling, we're told, to allow him and others to see it. Now, this all coming from folks that are in these agencies and frustrated with the politics that's taking place in these agencies. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: You hear that? The Trump White House had nothing to do with this! His reporting, Adam's reporting is huge. Now, Democrats and the destroy Trump media -- well, they are doing a disservice once again to you, the American people, by attacking Congressman Devin Nunes instead of reporting on what the scandal is! Here with reaction, the chairman for the American Center for Law and Justice Jay Sekulow, Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp. All right, is there anything wrong -- because Pete Hoekstra said this was standard operating procedure. If you're going to see raw intelligence like this, Jay, that it would be normal procedures to see it in an area that we know is safe and secure and that that's what he did all the time. What about that as a distraction in this case? JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Well, I mean, here's the-- the fact is, there is a statute, two statutes, actually, that deal particularly with this. There's a procedure in place that allows the chairman and others in the intelligence community and the Intelligence Committee to view this data, and it specifically says it shall not be an offense to transmit information described in this section, which is the section involving this kind of material, to either congressional Intelligence Committee. And then that's section 31-22. 31-25 says nothing in this title may be construed as authority to withhold information from the Congress or from a committee of either house of Congress. So there's actually legislation that positively affirms the ability of these committee chairmen and others within the committee to actually get this material (INAUDIBLE) procedures, and of course, the procedures are to protect the intelligence. So there is -- this is rather unremarkable, what took place here. And I think the media -- as you said, this is a distraction, but the law is crystal clear here. There's no violation of law! HANNITY: So what is the big story here? Isn't the big story that, OK, maybe they used real surveillance as a ruse to surveil on a president or a candidate, an opposing party candidate, or the president-elect and his staff? Isn't that the real story here, Mercedes? MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I think that the real story is going to be if we see these tables turn where they're investigating the Trump administration, but yet you're going to start seeing an investigation of the Obama administration, whether they're using this intelligence resources and information for political purposes. And that's why Congressman Nunes reacted in a way that he did, which is he was shocked, he was alarmed when he started reading through these classified information, seeing that there was no link to Russia, yet you're seeing this unmasking of these American citizens-- HANNITY: Unbelievable. SCHLAPP: -- particularly those who are part of the Trump transition team. HANNITY: All right, so they're surveilling. They're unmasking. And then, of course, we know in the case of General Flynn, they leaked the intelligence, which is a felony. SEKULOW: Right. HANNITY: What do you make of Evelyn Farkas, Jay, and her comments that we've been playing in total, in context. Now she says the Russians may have leaked it. And she's saying that she's a victim of fake news. But she said she was urging her former colleagues, Get as much intelligence as you can. SEKULOW: Right. HANNITY: And if they found out, the Trump people, how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff dealing with Russian -- isn't that an unveil/unmasking there? Isn't that confirmation of surveillance, and then talking about releasing it to colleagues? Wouldn't that potentially be an intel leak? SEKULOW: Well, she needs to get a lawyer. I mean, I don't know who's letting her these statements. HANNITY: I have no idea! SEKULOW: But she is -- she has -- she has implicated herself-- HANNITY: Big-time. SEKULOW: -- in multiple felonies! First of all, she keeps saying "we." She wasn't even part of the agency at that particular time! She talked about, you know, going to the Hill to make sure that her colleagues and this information's protected from the Trump -- incoming Trump administration to preserve this. Who is she -- who is she to get this information at that point? And then leaking it is a crime. And she's basically -- you know what she did? She'd be my first witness, if I was going to impanel the grand jury. Dr. Farkas-- (CROSSTALK) SEKULOW: -- the grand jury, and you better because protected! HANNITY: She's probably going to have to see a grand jury. She's going to see the House Intelligence Committee. SEKULOW: Yes. HANNITY: And-- SCHLAPP: Oh, yes. HANNITY: Mercedes-- SEKULOW: It's inconceivable! HANNITY: I actually -- I'm, like-- SCHLAPP: She said-- HANNITY: Who's advising this woman? SCHLAPP: Evelyn Farkas -- she- obviously-- SEKULOW: Not a good lawyer. SCHLAPP: -- she was not advised. And it really put her in an incredibly bad situation because she -- she -- she basically almost makes it sounds like she has some sort of -- active (ph) some sort of way to understand what's in these intelligence reports! So there's a lot of questions that need to be asked. Obviously, we saw that the White House counsel, Don McGahn, sent over a letter basically asking those questions. How was this information handled? Did she have access to any of these intelligence documents? These are serious questions that need to be asked. But I -- I have to say, Sean-- HANNITY: Yes. SCHLAPP: -- going back to Congressman Nunes, we have to remember there's a lot of false information out there. It was a source who contacted the chairman, who said, if you guarantee this confidentiality, I want to -- I need to share this classified information with you. You need to see this. This is what sources do in the right way, instead of leaking information of classified information to the press, which, as we know, is a felony. So we have to make sure that that gets out there in terms of that message (ph). HANNITY: Well said. Well said. All right, Mercedes, we're going to lose you. Thank you, as always, for being with us. Jay stays with us. Coming up after the break -- former national security adviser Michael Flynn-- General Flynn is offering to speak to the House and Senate Intel Committees, but he's asking for immunity. President Trump said it was a smart idea because of the political witch hunt that is happening right now. Jay Sekulow stays with us. Monica Crowley joins us. And then later tonight-- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: My administration is working every day to make it easier for manufacturers to build, hire and grow in America. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The president is not slowing down. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway will join us tonight, right here in studio. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (NEWSBREAK) HANNITY: And welcome back to "Hannity." So this morning, the president took to Twitter to defend former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and the president tweeted, quote, "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt, excuse the big election loss by the media and Dems of historic proportion." Now, this comes after reports say that Flynn is willing to testify in front of the House and Senate Intel Committees in exchange for immunity. Joining is now with reaction, conservative commentator Monica Crowley, and we continue with Jay Sekulow from a legal perspective. Monica, you were there with General Flynn. What happened to him I don't think there's any doubt was leaking this intelligence was a violation of the Espionage Act and a felony, many other laws were broken, we will ask Jay in a second. But I agree. I think General Flynn wants to say what he has to say because he has a victim of a crime here. MONICA CROWLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: General Flynn, Sean, is now a private citizen. So he is perfectly entitled to seek whatever protections he can going forward. And look, I think the reality is none of us know the backstory here. If General Flynn has already been solicited by investigators, then this request for immunity makes perfect sense. If he hasn't yet been approached by investigators, then perhaps he is trying to accelerate the timeline somehow. And look, since we know none of the backstory and none of the details here, perhaps none of this has to do with Russia at all. Maybe there are some other things at play here. But the bottom line is that General Flynn is entitled to these protections. And I also think he has the Watergate story in mind here. Remember that Richard Nixon during the Watergate process was alleged to have been captured on tape merely suggesting the possibility of asking the CIA to interview with the FBI to stop the Watergate investigation. That served as one of the bases for article one of the Watergate impeachment. That's essentially a thought crime. General Flynn does not want to be prosecuted or persecuted for anything, least of all something he may or may not have said or done. HANNITY: Jay, from my standpoint, they leaked this intelligence they never should have leaked. They are surveilling. The NSA does its job. They are surveilling his counterpart in Russia. They're having a conversation. It's a normal procedure. He's getting in touch with people he will have contact with and will be working with. So they're supposed to minimize and they're not supposed to reveal their identity. His identity is unmasked. The contents of their conversation are made public, and then he tells a story to the vice president, maybe left detail or to go, perhaps by accident, maybe on purpose, I don't know. And his career is over because they leaked this intelligence. A felony, right? JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE: Right. So in that scenario you just laid out, this is exactly why General Flynn's lawyers are asking them to seek immunity because, as Monica just said, this is a bit of a witch hunt here in this sense -- who is the victim of really what happened here. General Flynn, the president saying this is right. He is the victim. He was unmasked, so no minimization. It was leaked, so you're talking about felonies and civil actions now. And it was leaked to the press and published, and now he is the one made to look to be the evildoer, so to speak, yet we don't even know the backstory of any of this. But we do know two things. He was unmasked and it was a leak. And that leaking is a felony, period. HANNITY: Doesn't every American need to understand that if your government is going to surveil your texts, your emails, your phone conversations, and they don't have any warrant, and then they disclose that, they could ruin anybody's life, especially yours or Monica's. SEKULOW: I will tell you this. Look, here is the reality. Republican, Democrat, independent, libertarian, I don't care what party you are, the idea that this information was gathered, and it was unmasked and then leaked, this is leaking of intelligence about an individual American, an American citizen. Why are we saying that is OK? We should not be. That should be investigated as a crime because that is what it is. HANNITY: Agreed. That's a one crime we know Monica that happened here. Go ahead. CROWLEY: Yes. And I invoked the Watergate example for a reason earlier, Sean, and that's because I spent four years working with former President Nixon during the last four years of his life. And I know a bit about presidential wiretapping. Devin Nunes, all of these peripheral conversations have nothing to do with the actual possible scandal here, which is that the Obama team, the folks who were still in the White House under President Obama may have in fact unmasked people, surveilled political opponents, and then weaponized classified material against their political opponents. If that is true, that makes Watergate look like child's play. HANNITY: That's what I was going to say. Doesn't this have the potential to be way bigger than Watergate, Jay? SEKULOW: This is national security information that is being leaked here. So the seriousness of this is at the highest level. When you look at what is the potential damage to the United States or intelligence gathering capabilities into those that are working within the government, this is the worst-case scenario of what can happen, and it happened. And here is the fact. If you're looking at where the grand jury should be empaneled, it's fine to get testimony from General Flynn and have him appear before the committee and he should seek immunity and he should get it and he should tell it and lay laid out for the community, and that's great, but the crime here is the leakers. HANNITY: Would you recommend he testify without immunity or no? SEKULOW: No, no. No way. HANNITY: Why? SEKULOW: Because, Sean, they will find a form that was filled out with an inadvertent statement and make that into a felony. I do a lot of criminal defense. Here's the answer on that -- no. HANNITY: All right, guys, thank you both, and have a good weekend. Coming up, President Trump keeping his promises and getting things done. The counsel to the president Kellyanne Conway will join us in studio tonight with reaction. And then later tonight -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If they are going to drink and they're of age, please drink responsibly. Stay with somebody that's sober. Don't wander away from your crowd of people that you know. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And also coming up, the final part of our series that exposes what is happening to your kids on spring break. This year, we sent a producer down to South Padre Island, Texas. We asked the local police about the partying and what they are trying to do to keep your kids safe as they are going insane. "Fox & Friends" co-host Ainsley Earhardt joins us for the full report. Tonight, you need to see it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My administration is working every day to make it easier for manufacturers to build higher and grow in America. We are removing job killing regulations and lifting the burdens on American industry, like I would say they have never been lifted before. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: That was the president earlier today meeting with the National Association of Manufacturers. That was at the White House. Joining us now, a rare New York in studio appearance. She is the counsel to the president, Kellyanne Conway. How are you? Good to see you. You doing OK? I got to see your husband. I haven't seen him for a while. He's going to be doing some work in D.C. too. You know what's amazing to me, in the opening monologue tonight I pointed out the speed of Trump, checking off promises, and I know we get caught up in the media is obsessed that the health care bill didn't get finished. It will. And nobody ever talks about all the good things he's done. For example, I was so happy this week over the EPA regulations. KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: That was huge, and he kept a promise to the coal miners. And he's allowing the EPA to focus on what it's supposed to do, air and water, and really unleash that energy production in a way that makes us less reliant on foreign sources, generates all types of jobs. People complain in this country, Sean, that nothing is made in the USA anymore. Energy is made here. It's under our feet. It's off our shores. HANNITY: We've got more than we'd ever need. CONWAY: It's time we invest in it. The president has promised and is now making good on his promises through a number of executive actions to unleash clean coal and oil and natural gas of course, and any number of different energy sources. But also this week he started the commission on opioids, working with this new White House office of American Innovation that Jared Kushner has put together. HANNITY: You're going to be on this, right? CONWAY: So Governor Christie is the head of the commission and I had the privilege of sitting in on a couple of the listening sessions, and for the first time since I got to the White House I cried, which is saying a lot, because I listened to this story of Vanessa and A.J. and of Pam, and it was incredibly moving to hear their stories. In the case of Vanessa and A.J., both of whom are New Jersey residents, they're success stories. They found treatment. We need to focus on interdiction and prevention. HANNITY: That's also a promise that he made to the people of New Hampshire in particular where they have been devastated as much as other parts of the country. CONWAY: Opioid is a crisis, though, in this country that does not discriminate. It is touching every economic stratum, both genders obviously, all ages, people who have graduated from college, who haven't, who have jobs, who don't. And it really is scary. And this is a president who is very committed to it along with Governor Christie who will be heading up the commission in this Office of American Innovation. HANNITY: So I put this up earlier in the program. Just take a look. I know it would have been nice if the Republicans after eight years had a consensus bill, you know I am very critical of how this was rolled out. But there's all these successes. We'll put it up on the screen. That is President Trump's agenda. He checks it off the list. I don't think I've ever seen a president get a lot done as much as he could do by himself. I wish Congress would get their act together and keep up with him. CONWAY: It's just be good if people got the message. I think actually thing when you look at some of these confidence numbers, it does show that people and job creators, the jobseekers and the job holders, Sean, all our seeing very good in his presidency so far. So if you look at that National Association of Manufacturers survey today, it's the highest it's been in 20 years. The man has been on the job for less than three months. It is a 93.3 percent confidence measure. One year ago it was 56.6 percent. That's not a margin of error. That's not tinkering. That is a huge uptick in confidence. You saw recently the homebuilders' confidence survey, highest in 12 years. The small business confidence survey in Gallop, highest in almost 10 years. And it just goes on and on. People feel good about spending their money. HANNITY: Would you, like me, and I'm not trying to drag you into this fight, like to see Congress better prepared in terms of the legislation, have their caucus, their individual components, the moderates, the Freedom Caucus, the study group, the Tuesday group, the Saturday night go drinking group, get on the same page? (LAUGHTER) CONWAY: I am not aware of that one. HANNITY: I just made it up. These are not small items that he is tackling here on the economy, changing the tax code and infrastructure, even the energy thing. There's only so much she can do on his own. They've got to be ready to game up here. CONWAY: Any one of these achievements would be historic. So if you think about just getting two or three even in the first year, that's huge. And we know that health care reform will happen. We know that the president and every single Republican House and Senate who are there campaigned successfully on repealing and replacing Obamacare. So the question is what are the next steps? You're absolutely right. The conference needs to come together. But you know what I learned through this entire process? Sean, I'm old enough to have worked against HillaryCare and ObamaCare. So I've been in health care for long time. What I learned from this particular process is that this is the price of success. This is a very diverse Republican conference. You have 23 Republican members who sit in districts that Hillary Clinton won. That's a pretty big thing. And so you have everybody from like a plus Republican 25 or 30 district if you will to a plus D single digit district. So bringing together those diverse ideological and geographic viewpoints, it's very important. People have to be brought to the table earlier, but I have to say on this one the president showed a great deal of leadership. He worked the phones. HANNITY: But they dumped a bill that had no consensus on his lap. Why did he have to do the heavy lifting when, in all fairness, the legislative branch had eight years to campaign, run on this, they got to the House in 2010, 2014 the Senate, 2016. Really, they didn't have a bill ready to go? That kind of makes me mad. CONWAY: I'm confident that the conference will come together and that the deficit in votes was in the dozens. We started out in a deficit of dozens and dozens. And it got shrunk down to about 12 to 18 votes perhaps. So that's very heartening. But look, there were moderates not supporting it. There were conservatives not supporting it. But that's the price of success for having a very diverse party. Look at the Democratic Party. Where are the prolife Democrats, the blue dog Democrats, the pro-Second Amendment Democrats? They don't exist anymore. That party is much more myopic now. They've been pulled to the left by some of their factions. But in the case of the president, some people would prefer him to be the closer on this and not the leadoff batter. Some people appreciated the fact that he and the vice president, Secretary Price, Director Mulvaney and others leaned in from the beginning and were very involved. HANNITY: They should have brought everybody in. CONWAY: But it has to really represent, legislation has to represent all of the disparate opinions, and most importantly what the president has promised to do in repealing and replacing Obamacare. It is not sustainable, it's not affordable, so it will get done. HANNITY: All right, good to see you. Thank you for being with us. Coming up, part three of our series exposing what happens to your kids when you pay and send them on down to spring break. Ainsley Earhardt has that report straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: Welcome back to "Hannity." As we continue our series exposing what happens when your kids jet on off to spring break with your money. This year, we sent down a producer to South Padre Island, Texas, to see what spring breakers were really up to. We spoke to the police chief in South Padre Island, his name is Randy Smith, about some of the dangers that spring breakers are encountering this year. It's always dangerous. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was in jail because I got in a beach brawl, and I got too damn drunk. That's why. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How many people have crossed into this island? POLICE CHIEF RANDY SMITH, SOUTH PADRE ISLAND, TEXAS: Some days it's been around 9,000, some days 8,000. Yesterday alone for a 24-hour period was 14,482. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This week how many arrests have you totaled? SMITH: We've had at a five day Texas week period, we have had up to 198, mostly simple, Class A municipal issues like public intoxication or simple assault. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One girl got carried away in a stretcher. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did you get arrested for? (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: P.I., let's say P.I. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Love you, mom. SMITH: If they are combative or give us some issues, or we can't figure out a safe place for them to go, then unfortunately they leave us no option. They come over to our facility here at the jail. They see a judge on the following date, they get released. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You said there probably a couple hundred of those? SMITH: Yes, which is kind of typical. Public works for trash cleaning on the beach, so all around all services so we can better serve businesses and visitors. The only few tips I give all spring breakers is if they are going to drink and they're of age, please drink responsibly. Stay with somebody who is sober. Don't wander away from your crowd of people that you know. And don't drink from items that are being passed around. You don't know the original origins. You don't know what has been spiked in that drink that you're drinking. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Here with reaction, "Fox & Friends" co-host, our friend Ainsley Earhardt has done this many years for us. Thanks for coming aback. AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST: You're welcome. HANNITY: Why am I put in the position of being like the old fuddy-duddy. I don't care that they go on spring break. But when you see they are all wasted. And then you read the people that are preying on the spring breakers. And then you hear about sexual assault that happens here and drunken driving and some people get alcohol poisoning, the fun seems to go away. EARHARDT: Kids are always going to go on spring break. First remember it used to be Daytona Beach, then everyone went to Panama City Beach. You cleaned up Panama City Beach. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: You did it. EARHARDT: So now they are going to Texas to South Padre Island. They have always gone to South Padre but now we are seeing more people at South Padre, more than 100,000 people estimated for a weekend. Now that is a lot of kids to put in one area. And our producers that went there said basically anything goes. The only rule there is no glass on the beach. But as long as you are not stumbling around wasted and getting in fights, you're fine. The problem is, when you start to drink, they are all saying they're drinking the moment they wake up and they start drinking, so by the end of the day, they are black out. They don't know where they are. So if they are all doing it in a group, then they are separating themselves and they're getting themselves in trouble. HANNITY: Quick programming note. Thank you, Ainsley. Be sure to set your alarm and wake up early and catch Steve, Brian, Ainsley every morning 6:00 to 9:00, "Fox & Friends" right here on the Fox News Channel. Up next, we need your help with an important "Question of the Day." And we'll play some of the messages you left for me that were really mean on the "Hannity" hotline straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HANNITY: All right, time for our "Question of the Day." Earlier today the president tweeted out that the mainstream media and Democrats are on a political witch hunt. That is why I call them the alt left propaganda, destroy-Trump media. Do you agree with me, do you agree with the president? We want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. All right, hit me with your best shot. Time for the "Hannity" hotline. Let's see what you left today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTINA: I agree with everything you say about spring break. It is disastrous. My teenage daughter back in the nineties, I believe it was 96 when she wanted to go. Absolutely not. She disowned me for about a year- and-a-half, but that's what you do as a parent. CHRIS: Hey, Hannity. We don't need waterboarding. All we've got to do is have people listen to your show for about two minutes and I'm sure they'll give anything up. Listening to you is pure torture. But I'm sure you won't play this. Keep up the bad work, Hannity. We love you. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Love me? That's hardly showing it. Doesn't matter what you have to say, nice, mean, we don't care. Call the number on your screen, 877- 225-8587. That's all the time we have left this evening. Have a great weekend. Thanks for being with, and we'll see you back here on Monday.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel CEO admits to industry-wide conspiracy to slow CPU advances, kill frequency boosts Intel CEO admits to industry-wide conspiracy to slow CPU advances, kill frequency boosts By Joel Hruska on April 1, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Intel CEO Brian Krzanich met with top investors and stockholders this week, on the same day that Intel held its Technology and Manufacturing Day (which we reported on here). ExtremeTech has received a tape-recording of that meeting and the contents will shock you: According to Krzanich, there’s an industry-wide conspiracy to slow CPU clock speeds and architectural advances to a crawl, while IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, ARM, Samsung, and a dozen other companies all rake in enormous profits. “We actually got the idea from Craig Barrett,” said Krzanich, referring to Intel’s CEO from 1998 – 2005. “Back in the late 1990s, the Pentium 4 was controversial because it dramatically increased clock speeds without delivering a corresponding performance improvement. The technical press labeled it a ‘marchitecture,’ and complained that customers weren’t actually getting the performance they thought they were entitled to.” “What we later realized,” Krzanich continued, “Was that we didn’t actually have to sell people any performance improvements at all. We could just tell them the chips were faster, make up some benchmark numbers, and kick the product out the door.” Krzanich then gave a rough timeline of events, including secret pacts between Intel and IBM, mutual agreements between itself and ARM that killed the early “smartbook” concept but led to Intel’s withdrawal from the mobile market, and AMD’s disastrous attempt to buck this shadowed conspiracy arrangement and go it alone. He chuckled, recounting how Intel funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in secret payments to GlobalFoundries and the Mubadala Development Company, ensuring that AMD’s fab partner was actually responsible for sabotaging the entire Bulldozer product family. That move, by the way, was payback for AMD’s counter-espionage that savaged Itanium and the IA-64 instruction set by paying Microsoft billions to promote the false notion that AMD64 was a superior architecture. Everything you thought you knew is wrong. Power curves like this don’t exist. “It took us several years,” Krzanich concluded, his voice hoarse and sounding vaguely like Emperor Palpatine, “But we finally got the mobile companies on board as well. Have you noticed how advances in mobile chips have slowed? It’s not power consumption issues. It’s certainly not a problem with our materials technology — silicon could easily hit 10GHz, like Craig Barrett predicted nearly 20 years ago. We just realized we didn’t need to bother doing it. The sheeple never knew what hit them.” A bombshell discovery For years, ExtremeTech and dozens of other publications and websites have written about the decline of silicon scaling. We’ve discussed future transistor designs, the myths of Moore’s law, the evolution of that law over time, process node technology, the failure of 450mm wafer development, and a dozen other topics. Now, that research stands in ruins; the work of hundreds of journalists, lithographers, and engineers, disproved by a single CEO’s secret taped remarks. But Krzanich’s remarks just lead to further questions. How has this super-alliance of evil been flawlessly maintained for decades? How could thousands of people working for dozens of companies possibly have been convinced or coerced into keeping this mammoth conspiracy a secret? Is it the Illuminati? The Bilderberg Group? Is Cthulhu stirring in the dead city of R’lyeh? We don’t know. But we’re going to find out.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 1, 2017 at 5:35AM Many semiconductor stocks surged in 2016, thanks to rising demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks many of the top names in the sector, rallied almost 50% over the past 12 months. But despite that robust performance, some semiconductor stocks could rise even further this year. Let's take a look at three chip plays that still have room to run: Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Image source: Getty Images. Xilinx Xilinx is the largest maker of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips in the world. These chips can be reprogrammed after being installed, making them well suited for a wide variety of machines -- including servers, connected cars, smart appliances, and airplanes. FPGAs are usually paired with traditional CPUs to handle industry-specific tasks. That's why Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) acquired Xilinx's only meaningful rival, Altera, in late 2015. That acquisition made Xilinx -- which launched 16nm chips a year before Intel caught up with 14nm ones -- a rumored takeover target for larger chipmakers like Qualcomm. The Altera acquisition also convinced Intel's chipmaking rivals, like Qualcomm and IBM, to pair their CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs to match Intel's new programmable capabilities. Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 11% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years. Xilinx's P/E of 25 is a bit higher than its industry average of 22, but its growing network of partnerships and attractiveness as a takeover target shouldn't be ignored. Micron Technology Micron is often more volatile than other semiconductor stocks because demand for its DRAM and NAND memory chips is cyclical. Demand for those chips was sluggish throughout most of 2016, due to a slowdown in PC sales, the commoditization of the mobile device market, and a glut of memory chips crushing market prices. Image source: Micron. However, those trends reversed in late 2016, as many device makers reported shortages of memory chips and rising prices. That's why Micron posted double-digit sales growth over the past two quarters, which ended six straight quarters of annual declines. Analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 57% this year and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 to $2.42. Micron rallied more than 170% over the past 12 months, but it trades at just six times forward earnings -- indicating that the market remains pretty bearish on its chances (I'd argue that it's overly bearish). However, investors should beware of two major headwinds. First, competition from larger players like Samsung and Western Digital's SanDisk could still put pressure on Micron's margins. Second, Micron warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the memory market with cheap chips in the near future, which could push Micron into a downward cycle again. Advanced Micro Devices AMD's upside potential might seem limited after rising nearly 400% over the past 12 months. Yet investors shouldn't ignore the chipmaker's compelling comeback story. After years of being squeezed in x86 CPUs by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and high-end GPUs by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD carved out a growing niche in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chipsets for gaming consoles and other devices. Image source: AMD. That move enabled AMD to post three straight quarters of positive year-over-year sales growth -- which broke a two-year streak of top-line declines. Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 11% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability again following multiple years of net losses. As for AMD's valuation, its EV/sales ratio of 3.1 remains comparable to Intel's ratio of three and much lower than NVIDIA's ratio of 8.6. Besides gaming consoles, AMD plans to turn up the heat on NVIDIA with more low-end VR-ready GPUs and its next-gen Vega GPUs. It also plans to strike back at Intel with its new Ryzen chips, which offer comparable performance as Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips at lower price points. Those efforts could lift AMD to new highs, but the stock could also plunge if demand for these chips falls short of expectations. The key takeaways Xilinx, Micron, and AMD could all climb higher this year, but each of these companies face clear risks -- Xilinx faces upcoming FPGA battles with Intel, Micron faces challenges from bigger chipmakers, and AMD must land some meaningful blows against Intel and NVIDIA to maintain is momentum. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying any of these semiconductor stocks.   Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

It also laid out what it believes is a better metric for calculating process nodes in the future, though we suspect TSMC, Samsung, and GloFo may all disagree. Intel’s presentation focused mainly on two related topics: The strength and characteristics of its 10nm node, and its proposal for a new (or rather, a return to an old) method of calculating process node scaling. Intel drives “hyperscaling” at the 10nm node Intel is claiming that its 10nm node will deliver a 2.7x improvement in transistor density compared with its 14nm products. That’s a significant jump over its 14nm products, and it’s not just the result of the improvements to various semiconductor manufacturing metrics. Intel has improved its 10nm scaling compared with 14nm through the use of two specific new technologies — single dummy gate, and contact-over-active-gate. Typically, logic cells use a pair of what are called “dummy gates” to isolate each cell from its neighbors. Intel has found a method of using just one dummy gate instead of using a pair of them, and has managed to recover significant space savings as a result. Each gate has multiple contacts that connect to the metal layers within a CPU. Typically, these contacts are offset from the gate. At 10nm, Intel is moving the contact to directly under the gate, which frees up additional transistor space. All of these advantages combined is why Intel is claiming such significant improvements compared with 14nm. The slides below includes visualizations of these improvements and how they collectively improve Intel’s 10nm process node. All slides can be clicked on to expand them in a new window. The general thrust of Intel’s argument is that these new technologies will give it a significant lead over its rivals and competitors in the foundry space. Intel vs. everyone at the 10nm node One major point of Intel’s presentation is actually something we’ve discussed before: When TSMC, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Intel talk about 14nm, the process nodes they discuss are not identical. Each foundry has implemented different feature sizes and each of their nodes (16nm/12nm for TSMC, 14nm for Samsung and GF) has its own distinct characteristics. To some extent, the modern definition of a node has become “The bucket of technologies we periodically dump in to improve some aspects of transistor density, power consumption, and performance enough to justify moving to a new number.” The problem, at least for Intel, is that when a company like Samsung announces 10nm production, that’s actually roughly equivalent to Intel’s 14nm, which debuted in 2014. To get around this issue, Intel has described a method for calculating process node size that would weight certain factors differently than they are weighted today. Intel’s Process Architecture and Integration Director, Mark Bohr, described the formula in an editorial published by Intel: "One simple metric is gate pitch (gate width plus spacing between transistor gates) multiplied by minimum metal pitch (interconnect line width plus spacing between lines), but this doesn’t incorporate logic cell design, which affects the true transistor density. Another metric, gate pitch multiplied by logic cell height, is a step in the right direction with regard to this deficiency. But neither of these takes into account some second order design rules… At the other extreme, simply taking the total transistor count of a chip and dividing by its area is not meaningful because of the large number of design decisions that can affect it – factors such as cache sizes and performance targets can cause great variations in this value. It’s time to resurrect a metric that was used in the past but fell out of favor several nodes ago. It is based on the transistor density of standard logic cells and includes weighting factors that account for typical designs. While there is a large variety of standard cells in any library, we can take one ubiquitous, very simple one – a 2-input NAND cell (4 transistors) – and one that is more complex but also very common: a scan flip flop (SFF). This leads to a previously accepted formula for transistor density: (The weightings 0.6 and 0.4 reflect the ratio of very small and very large cells in typical designs.) Every chip maker, when referring to a process node, should disclose its logic transistor density in units of MTr/mm2 (millions of transistors per square millimeter) as measured by this simple formula. Reverse engineering firms can readily verify the data. Measuring process node metrics in this fashion would give Intel an obvious advantage over all of its rivals. As such, it’s hard to imagine they’ll ever endorse it. Whether its TSMC with a new “12nm” node or potential future gaps between the various pure-play foundries at 7nm, nobody but Intel will substantially benefit from measuring process nodes differently, even if Intel’s method is more accurate." Measuring process node metrics in this fashion would give Intel an obvious advantage over all of its rivals. As such, it’s hard to imagine they’ll ever endorse it. Whether its TSMC with a new “12nm” node or potential future gaps between the various pure-play foundries at 7nm, nobody but Intel will substantially benefit from measuring process nodes differently, even if Intel’s method is more accurate. The slides below steps through some of Intel’s transistor density comparisons against its competitors’ nodes, as well as how it compares against them on specific metrics and how large it expects the gaps to be at 10nm. We can’t speak to the accuracy of Intel’s projections for its competitors at 10nm, but the company’s general projection matches what we’ve seen at the 14nm node. With Intel taking on more foundry customers (or trying to), it doubtlessly sees this as a potential barrier to those efforts. What’s the point of calling a node “10nm” (from Intel’s perspective) if that artificially inflates the value of what your competitors’ are selling and diminishes your own value? The other interesting question is how much these advantages will practically matter going forward. When Intel intended to break into the tablet and smartphone markets to compete directly against ARM, it had an obvious rationale for comparing its own performance against Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and TSMC. Today, Intel and the pure-play foundries once again move in different circles — but that could change in the future if Intel can land some significant foundry deals. The other reason foundry die shrinks aren’t as interesting as they used to be is for the simple reason that they don’t deliver much in the way of improved performance any more, at least not outside specific market segments. Six years ago, the Core i5-2537M was a Sandy Bridge-era core clocked at 1.4GHz base / 2.3GHz Turbo with a TDP of 17W. Today, Intel’s Core i5-7300U is a 15W chip with a 2.6GHz base clock and a 3.5GHz Turbo. It’s TDP is 15W. Intel, in other words, improved the base clock by 1.86x and the boost clock by 1.52x all while trimming the TDP. But in the desktop space, performance gains have been rarer, overclocking headroom has shrunk, and frequency gains have been doled out very sparingly. Intel has absolutely made progress over this time, but not at anything like a quick pace. Again, that’s not the company’s fault — it’s related, as we’ve said before, more to the difficulties with scaling silicon than anything — but with AMD surging back into the CPU fight, Intel may find itself under increased pressure to demonstrate that its 10nm hardware can do more than look impressively futuristic in a variety of graphs.  Intel’s full presentations are available for download, if you’d care to flip through them yourself.         LATEST STORIES (7) Syria: More Gunmen, Family Members Leave Homs for Idlib Syrian Army Expands Control over More Areas in Northern Hama Syrian Army Drives Al-Nusra Terrorists out of Khattab Village North of Hama More Photos of Syrian Gov't Soldiers in Recently Liberated City of Deir Hafer Syrian Army in Fierce Clashes with Terrorists, Northwest of Hama Syrian Gov't Forces Evacuate Civilians from War Zone during Offensive in Northern Hama Iraqi Security Forces Search Western Mosul Houses for ISIL Terrorists No Major US Shift: The Real Goal of Trump’s War on ISIL Is Regime Change in Syria Unconfirmed Arab Media Reports: Iran's Major General Qassem Soleimani in Syria's Hama for Major Assault on Al-Qaeda Iran Commemorates Islamic Republic Day Israeli Forces Shoot, Injure Palestinian Teenager with Live Ammunition in Ramallah Interior Ministry: Iraqi Forces to Liberate Mosul from ISIL by End of Spring Hundreds of Al-Nusra Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Operation in Hama Syrian Armed Forces Hit Terrorists' Positions Heavily in Hama Province Syrian Army Units Shoot Down 2 Attack Drones of Terrorists in Lattakia Syria: More Gunmen, Family Members Leave Homs for Idlib TEHRAN (FNA)- A sum of 400 gunmen and their family members left al-Wa'er district in the Northwestern outskirts of Homs city for militant-held regions in Idlib province.

Despite seeming ideal for speeding up budget-friendly systems with hard drives as their sole storage devices, Optane Memory apparently won't have support from Intel's most budget-friendly Kaby Lake CPUs: the Celeron G3930, the Celeron G3950, the Pentium G4560, the Pentium G4600, and the Pentium G4620. Lower-power "T" variants of those chips won't work, either. Only Kaby Lake Core CPUs are Optane Memory-compatible, according to Intel's ARK database and the Optane Memory product page. We've gotta say: this is a baffling decision on Intel's part. Assuming ARK is correct, the cheapest CPU one can pair with an Optane Memory device is the Core i3-7100, a $120 part that's $28 more expensive than our budget-favorite Pentium G4620. The Core i3 adds 200 MHz of clock speed and AVX support to the bargain, to be fair. Even so, paying $65 or so in total to get that Core i3 CPU and the 16GB Optane Memory hardware itself seems like a hard sell for the frugal system builder who's already chosen a capacious hard drive. If we play the incremental cost game a bit more, one can get a reputable budget 480GB SSD like Toshiba OCZ's TR150 for $130—not that much more versus the $105-ish extra that one would pay for the 16GB Optane Memory module, the Core i3-7100 CPU, and the WD Blue 1TB hard drive one would need to get our Budget Box's storage subsystem Optane Memory-ready. We'll have to reserve judgment until we've had time with Optane Memory products to be sure, but it seems like those 3D Xpoint-equipped gumsticks and their caching software will need to be quite competitive with SSD performance to be worth the platform cost. We've asked Intel to comment on this matter, and we'll update the post if we hear back. Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

According to a report by NBC's Bradd Jaffy, the Senate Intel committee is “not receptive” to Flynn's immunity request “at this time” as it would be “wildly preliminary.” Senate Intel Cmte is “not receptive” to Flynn's immunity request “at this time” — “wildly preliminary,” sources tell @kasie @KenDilanianNBC — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 31, 2017 That said, as Jaffy adds, "that doesn't mean the intel committees wouldn't consider granting immunity down the road.

WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed the matter several times during Friday’s White House press briefing after he was peppered with questions about Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), who said last week he had seen evidence to suggest President Trump’s “wiretapping” claims are true. “When Mr. Nunes came out initially and talked to the media, he made it very clear he had been looking into this, he had stated this much earlier than the president had ever raised this issue about surveillance and the unmasking of individuals for areas that had nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with substantive intelligence or surveillance,” Mr. Spicer said. “So I think that as we continue down this path, if you begin to focus really on the substance, I think we see more and more a very, very troubling and devastating path.” Last week Rep. Nunes visited the White House complex, he came under scrutiny because it is not clear who let him through the gate, who showed him the classified information that showed surveillance was collected about President Trump and/or his Transition Team, and why. Mr. Spicer has said several times the media is too focused on the process and timeline of the story rather than the substance of the information being revealed. Friday,Mr. Spicer referenced comments made by former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia Evelyn Farkas, in which she seemed to suggest intelligence against President- elect Donald Trump and his Team was actively gathered before he took office in January. “I think the substance of this matters, and what continues to come to light in terms of Obama officials admitting either off the record or, frankly, on the record consistent with what Dr. Evelyn Farkas says that there was clearly an attempt to do something politically motivated with the intelligence out there,” Mr. Spicer said. “The question is, why? Who else did it? Was it ordered, by whom? I think more and more, the substance that continues to come out on the record by individuals continues to point to exactly what the President was talking about that day on March 5.” Later in the briefing, Mr. Spicer had a tense back and forth with Glenn Thrush of The New York Times regarding the timeline of Nunes’ White House visit and who was aware of his presence on the 18-acre campus that contains multiple buildings. “You’re playing cute there. … No, the White House chief of staff does not know every single person who is on the 18 acres at any given time,” Mr. Spicer said. “No, we don’t track every single person who is on the 18 acres. Do we know generally speaking who is in the Oval Office? Not all the time because people can go in.” It was terrific to watch, Mr. Spicer put the NY-T back on its heels, Sean Spicer is good, he takes no prisoners. Have a terrific weekend.   Nunes, president, Spicer, surveillance, team, Trump, White House, wiretapping White House Issues a Direct Warning to “Deep State” Intel Leak’rs added by Paul Ebeling on April 1, 2017 View all posts by Paul Ebeling → The following two tabs change content below.

L.A. Now Police arrests are plummeting across California, fueling alarm and questions BUSINESS Technology Palo Alto start-up Cloudera files for $200-million IPO New York Stock Exchange Seth Weinig / Associated Press A U.S. flag flies from the New York Stock Exchange building. A U.S. flag flies from the New York Stock Exchange building. (Seth Weinig / Associated Press) Associated Press Offering more proof that the IPO market is rebounding, big-data start-up Cloudera on Friday filed to raise up to $200 million in its long-awaited public stock debut. The Palo Alto-based company is the latest in a string of enterprise tech companies to indicate plans for an initial public offering, ending the dry spell that had analysts fretting last year. The filing also comes on the heels of Snap’s massive IPO in early March, which saw a first-day pop of 44% that Silicon Valley investors hoped would tempt other tech companies to the public market. Cloudera, which provides an open source data analysis platform to other companies, brought in $261 million in revenue in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, up 57% from $166 million the year before, according to the document the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. The company’s net losses were $187.3 million last fiscal year, and $203.1 million the year before. “We have a long history of losses, and we may not become profitable in the future,” the company wrote in the filing. The company, which was incorporated in 2008, had 1,470 full-time employees in January. A spokeswoman for Cloudera declined to provide additional comments Friday. When's the right time to invest? Play our tech IPO game Joe Fox Joe Fox The company has raised about $1 billion and was last valued around $4 billion as a private company. Cloudera plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLDR.” Intel is one of Cloudera’s major investors and partners, pouring $741.8 million into the start-up in 2014, and holds 22% of the company’s shares — making it the largest outside shareholder. Cloudera also has optimized its software for use with Intel processors. That deeply involved relationship could be a blessing and a curse, Cloudera’s Friday filing revealed. “Intel could have considerable influence over matters such as approving a potential acquisition of us,” Cloudera wrote. “Intel’s investment in and position in our company could also discourage others from pursuing any potential acquisition of us, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price.” After 2016 proved to be a slow year for tech IPOs, 2017 so far has seen increased activity. Following Snap’s much-watched debut, San Francisco-based software company MuleSoft and Irvine-based data analytics company Alteryx went public, and San Francisco start-up Okta and New York-based Yext have filed for IPOs. Okta is expected to price its IPO next week. Snap’s March 2 debut marked the first tech IPO of 2017. San Francisco-based software start-up AppDynamics had been poised to break the ice with a $156-million IPO in January, but instead sold to Cisco for $3.7 billion two days before it was set to price the offering.

What a week! From big announcements to juicy rumors, and some truly shocking surprises, it’s been a rollercoaster ride around the tech world… but fear not, for 7 Days is here again to make sure you didn’t miss any of the week’s top stories. There’s a lot to get through, so let’s waste no more time! Image via Shutterstock The US House of Representatives agreed to the contents of a bill approved by the Senate last week, which will scrap FCC rules to protect broadband users' privacy. The bill will allow internet service providers to sell users' web browsing history and other personal data without their explicit consent. Twitter made a significant change, removing @mentions from the 140-character count in tweets. It follows a similar move last year in which pics, videos, polls and quoted tweets were removed from the count, allowing users to say more within the existing character limit. A South Korean regulator found that Qualcomm has been pressuring Samsung to restrict sales of its Exynos processors to other manufacturers, unfairly restricting competition to protect sales of its own Snapdragon chips. Meanwhile, another chipmaker has been accused of "unacceptable and unethical" behavior. SemiAccurate slammed Intel for allegedly misleading the press by withholding key data about its new Optane memory technology. There was exciting news in India, where the country's first 1Gbps broadband service was launched - but there is a 1TB monthly cap on downloads and uploads. Over in the US, billionaire-entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched a new company called Neuralink, which plans to improve the human mind with digital technology. He believes that developing artificially enhanced brains is a necessity for the long-term survival of our species. In somewhat more mundane - but still welcome - news, Apple released the latest updates to its operating systems on Monday - iOS 10.3, macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 - bringing a handful of new features and improvements. Google announced that its Home speaker hub will launch in the UK next week, priced at £129. But there was bad news for Google, which has lost the support of over 250 major advertisers following YouTube's placement of their ads in videos posted by extremist groups. Google began informing users this week that it's preparing to launch a "new look" for the sign-in experience for its services, which is expected to show up "in the next few weeks". Almost two months have passed since Google announced the release of Android Wear 2.0, and said it would come to existing devices "in the coming weeks". Since then, not a single device had received the update until this week, when it began rolling out for three devices. However, Google then slammed on the brakes on that rollout after discovering a "last-minute bug". Android Wear 2.0 had already been delayed by several months. Android co-founder Andy Rubin - who left Google a few years ago - teased an upcoming handset from his company, Essential. The handset, which appears to have a bezel-less design - as is the big trend these days - was confirmed by Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt to run Android. Photos and key specs were revealed of another new Android handset this week. The new Moto X is expected to be officially unveiled in the next few months. Fresh details also emerged on the HTC U, another new flagship on the way following the launch of the U Ultra earlier this year. It sounds like the U Ultra should have the superior specs, but confusingly, it seems the U will be the better device, with a more powerful Snapdragon 835 processor, and touch-sensitive bezels offering a new way to interact with the OS. The new BlackBerry KEYone has been delayed, following its unveiling at the Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago. The Android handset, which features a fixed QWERTY keyboard below its 4.5-inch display, was due to go on sale in April. Seven months after its release, Android 7.0 Nougat is on just 2.8% of the platform's active devices so far. Its long, slow rollout continued this week: Moto G4 Plus in the US Samsung Galaxy Note 5 in India Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ in Europe HTC One A9 in Europe HTC 10 on Verizon Unfortunately, T-Mobile US raised the hopes of HTC One M8 owners on Monday when it said the Nougat update was "now available" for that device. It wasn't, and the carrier later said it was a mistake. More devices received the latest Android security patches this week too: Sony Xperia Z5, Z4 Tablet, and Z3+ Samsung Galaxy Note 4 on Sprint Samsung Galaxy S5 in Europe Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge in the US If it had been revealed a few days later, you might have thought this was an April Fools' Day joke. Samsung confirmed that it will sell refurbished units of its Galaxy Note7 - the fiery flagship that it recalled, twice, following a series of battery fires last year. But the big announcement of the week was the official unveiling of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ flagships: Overview of key info on the new handsets, including specs and main features DeX, the new PC-like desktop experience for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ DeX Station, the desktop dock with multiple ports and a cooling fan, priced at $149.99 Bixby, Samsung's new digital assistant... which will have some notable limitations at launch Samsung's initial production run will be around 20 million units New Gear 360 camera revealed with True 4K video capture The Galaxy S8 offers multiple security features, including facial recognition, an iris scanner, a fingerprint sensor, and more 'conventional' methods for unlocking the device, such as PIN and pattern unlock. However, it seems the facial recognition feature can be fooled into unlocking the device using just a photo. This isn't an April Fools' Day joke either: Microsoft announced on March 30 that it will be selling Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ 'Microsoft Edition' handsets at its retail stores. It said that "when the devices are unboxed and connected to Wi-Fi", they will apply a "customization" that includes its Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook apps, among others. The announcement was met with surprise and incredulity among many fans of Windows phones, with some claiming that it demonstrates Microsoft's lack of focus on the Windows 10 Mobile platform. All of Microsoft's Windows phones have now reached the end of their retail lives. Two days before the Galaxy S8 event, Microsoft removed the last of its Lumia handsets from its UK store. Pre-orders opened on the Microsoft Store in the UK for the Porsche Design Book One, a Surface Book-style Windows 10 2-in-1 that Microsoft describes as the "convertible of your dreams". Priced at £2,395, it has a detachable display, Pen support, and the latest 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processors - but bizarrely, there's no discrete GPU option. Since February, when Microsoft announced significant price increases on its Surface Book and Pro 4 in the UK, not a day has gone by when the company hasn't been selling them with some sort of deal available. This week, it launched yet another promotional offer, reducing their prices to the same level as before it raised them. On Wednesday, Microsoft opened pre-orders for its Surface Book with Performance Base in 13 new markets around the world. It also opened pre-orders for its high-end 28-inch all-in-one PC, the Surface Studio, and the Surface Dial interaction tool, in three new countries. In unwelcome news for Microsoft, the company is being sued by people alleging that Windows 10 has "destroyed" their data and damaged their PCs. The lawsuit accuses Microsoft of having "failed to exercise reasonable care in designing, formulating, and manufacturing the Windows 10 upgrade and placing it into the stream of commerce." With the release of the Windows 10 Creators Update fast approaching, Stardock released a new version of its popular customization software for the OS, WindowBlinds. The 10.6 update includes a wide range of improvements for the latest Windows 10 version. The Windows 10 Creators Update is coming very soon indeed. Microsoft announced that it will be released via Windows Update for PCs starting on April 11, but you'll be able to install it manually from April 5. Microsoft published ISOs for build 15063 - the 'RTM' build for the Creators Update - along with its latest SDK for the same build. Windows 10 Mobile devices will get the Creators Update from April 25 - but from Microsoft's careful phrasing, it sounds like there may be some limitations on which handsets will actually be able to install it. Microsoft also revealed the first details about the Creators Update for Windows 10 Team, the specialized version of the OS that runs on its Surface Hub collaboration device. Microsoft is continuing to test bug fixes and other minor improvements for cumulative updates that will accompany the release of the Creators Update next month. Build 15063.11 was released for PCs in the Fast and Slow rings on Thursday, while the Release Preview ring got its first taste of build 15063 for PCs on the same day too. Windows 10 Mobile build 15063.2 was released to the Insider Fast ring on Wednesday, quickly followed by the Slow ring. By the way, Microsoft revealed that there are now over ten million Windows Insiders around the world. It had previously stated there were seven million Insiders back in September 2015. Now, here's something that raised a few eyebrows this week. A listing was spotted on the Microsoft Mexico website for an unannounced device called the 'Lumia 651' - identical in appearance to the Lumia 650, but with a larger display. Adding to the mystery, several days after it was widely reported around the world, the product listing remains on Microsoft's site. In the UK, HP seems to have completely lost the plot when it comes to pricing its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship. The company has increased and decreased its price by up to 12% seven times since December, with no apparent logic behind its decisions. In the US, HP is now offering almost $200 off a bundle that includes the Elite x3, Desk Dock, Wireless Charger, and more. Remember WhartonBrooks? Back in August, it announced that it was planning to launch a new Windows 10 Mobile device in the autumn, promising that it would be "the most disruptive since the advent of the smartphone in 2000". It added that it would bring "new products and services that will radically change the mobile computing industry". But in September, it postponed an event it was due to hold at a Microsoft Store, saying that it needed to "align schedules" with all the partners who wanted to join in. That event was never rescheduled. In October, it said that its handset had been delayed due to "regulatory hurdles". On Friday, WhartonBrooks finally revealed its new device, the Cerulean Moment. To say it doesn't live up to the incredible hype and the lofty promises that the company made is a huge understatement. The Moment has specs that are comparable - and inferior in some ways - to the HTC One A9, which was unveiled in October 2015, including a Snapdragon 617 processor, and a 720p display. According to Windows Central, the company's earlier claims about disruption and innovation referred not to the handset itself, but to Windows 10 Mobile's PC-like Continuum feature, which has been available on other premium Windows phones since 2015. And to top it all off, WhartonBrooks is relying on a crowdfunding campaign, aiming to raise $1.1 million for the handset's planned launch in August, by which time its specs will be almost two years behind the industry's best, even for a mid-range $299 device. Moving on... Ride-sharing service Lyft - an alternative to Uber in many cities - launched its app for phones and PCs in the Windows Store. Telegram updated its app for Windows phones with an overhauled interface, and some new features too. However, on March 31, Facebook ended support for its main app on all Windows Phones, as well as for Windows 8 and 8.1 PCs. The Messenger app on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 is also no longer supported. And in more unwelcome news, Zendesk will remove its Windows phone app from the Windows Store next week, having already ended support for it. The company said that Windows phones accounted for "a fraction of a percent" of those who use its services. The latest update to Microsoft's Groove Music app is now available for Insiders in the Fast ring, and includes hints of the upcoming 'Project Neon' design refresh for Windows 10. A new Office Insider Preview made its way to Windows desktop users this week, bringing various improvements. Microsoft also released a new Office Insider build for iOS, adding some handy new features. You can find out about this month's improvements to Office 365 here too. Microsoft opened registrations for its Ignite 2017 conference, which will be held in Orlando, Florida, from September 25 to 29. Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, said in an interview that the company "will not help any government hack or attack any customer anywhere". His comments came as pressure intensifies on tech companies to do more to help governments deal with terror threats, in the wake of last month's attack in London in which four people, including a police officer, were killed. The company later defended its position after an ugly, and somewhat misleading, article was published by The Sun newspaper, accusing Microsoft of "refusing the [British] Home Secretary's demand for more help on terror". Microsoft said that it had responded in under 30 minutes to a request from UK authorities for email information to aid in their investigation of the attack, and had "provided the information that was sought". While Microsoft prepares for the release of its Windows 10 Creators Update - also known as Version 1703 - for PCs and phones this month, it has already begun its rollout for the Xbox One and Xbox One S. The update includes an updated user interface, integrated Beam game streaming, and many other new features and improvements. Meanwhile, Microsoft is already working on a further Version 1704 update for its Xbox consoles, with the same primary build number as the Creators Update. Build 15063.2009 was released for Xbox Insiders in the Alpha ring on Friday, while build 15063.2006 made its way to the Beta ring. Those in the Beta ring also got their first chance to try out the new Xbox Game Pass. Launching this spring, it will provide access to over 100 games for $10 a month. Far Cry 3 became the latest Xbox 360 game to join the list of those playable on the Xbox One, through the Backward Compatibility program. Ryse: Son of Rome and Darksiders are now available free to Xbox Live Gold subscribers under the Games with Gold program. Cities: Skylines Xbox One Edition was announced in February, and it's now confirmed to be launching on Microsoft's consoles on April 21. The first developer units of Microsoft's upcoming Project Scorpio console are already out in the wild, but it seems they're not yet operating at their maximum potential. That's apparently deliberate, as Microsoft is gradually ramping up their performance, with the aim of allowing developers to run the console at full-throttle by June. When the console is officially unveiled, Microsoft will showcase its performance with games such as Forza 7, Red Dead Redemption 2 and a new Call of Duty title, among others. The next game in the much-loved Call of Duty series is expected to return to its roots, set in World War II. Another greatly anticipated game is Destiny 2, which now has its first official trailer, along with a release date and details of pre-order options. Telltale Games announced details of the first episode of its new game, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. And Microsoft announced its new Minecraft 1.1 update for the Windows 10 and Pocket editions, also known as The Discovery Update. Sony released an update for its PlayStation 4 Pro console, bringing support for playing 4K videos stored in mp4 format on a USB stick or home server, through its Media Player app. And Twitch updated its game-streaming service with support for 1080p streaming at 60 frames per second. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a delicious note in Europe, where Domino's Pizza announced that it will start deliveries using autonomous 'Starship Robots'. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a New Yorker on the way with some Strippers on the side. Story of my life. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Rich Woods put the new Logitech BRIO webcam through its paces - and he certainly didn't regret doing so. In fact, he declared it "the best webcam you can buy". Be sure to check out his detailed review. Rich also shared his first impressions of the new LG G6 along with an unboxing video of the stylish new Android flagship. And finally, if you're curious to see some of the new features in the next major version of Google's ubiquitous OS, take a look at Rich's hands-on video with the Android O Developer Preview.

Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers Display Drivers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals Close Articles & Reviews News Archive Forums Premium Categories Computers GPUs / Graphics Cards Linux Gaming Memory Motherboards CPUs / Processors Software Storage Operating Systems Peripherals AMD Ryzen Has Captivated Linux Gamers & Enthusiasts Written by Michael Larabel in Free Software on 1 April 2017 at 09:12 AM EDT. 3 Comments AMD's Ryzen launch was hands-down the most popular topic for Linux enthusiasts and gamers reading Phoronix in March. In March on Phoronix were 291 original news articles and 42 featured articles, keeping up with an average of about 10 original news postings per day and around one featured article/review per day, while in March was a bit more than a one-a-day average due to all the exciting happenings. Phoronix continues featuring new content seven days per week, 365 days per year with not having a 24 hour lapse in posting in several years now since last taking a full day off in January 2013. So for the monthly reminder, if you appreciate all of the content written daily by your's truly, consider showing your support by joining Phoronix Premium or making a PayPal tip or at the very least just not viewing this site with any ad-blockers. Thanks for your understanding and support. It's just over two months now until the 13th birthday of Phoronix! In March 2017, as shown by our most-viewed articles below, AMD's Ryzen was definitely the most popular topic of the month. There was also great stuff with regard to Linux 4.11, AMDGPU+RadeonSI, Vulkan, and much more. Valve Hires X11 Veteran Keith Packard To Work On The Linux Display Stack Valve's latest high-profile hire is adding Keith Packard to their roster of Linux graphics driver developers. Linux 4.11 Doesn't Change The Game For AMD's Ryzen Linux 4.11 is worthwhile in that it's bringing ALC1220 audio support, the codec used by many Ryzen (and Intel Kabylake) motherboards, but this next kernel version doesn't appear to change Ryzen's performance. Kodi Is Getting A Proper Netflix Plugin The Kodi HTPC software will soon have a "real" Netflix plugin/add-on for making a better show/movie watching experience. Extra AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Linux Benchmarks Assuming you have already checked out this morning's Ryzen 7 1800X Linux benchmarks, here are some more data points while putting the finishing touches on the Ryzen 7 Linux gaming benchmarks being published later today. C++17 Is Near, A Look At The New Features Reports out over the weekend indicate that C++17 is "done" as the next version of the C++ ISO standard. Hammering The AMD Ryzen 7 1800X With An Intense, Threaded Workload Today I got around to running a very heavy/demanding, very real-world workload on the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X that I've been meaning to test with this Zen CPU. Firefox 53 Beta Drops Pre-P4/Opteron On Linux, New Compact Themes With Firefox 52 having sailed earlier this week, Mozilla has pushed Firefox 53.0 into beta. OpenSSL Planning To Relicense Its Code The OpenSSL project is planning to change its software license. AMD Sends Out 100 Patches, Enabling Vega Support In AMDGPU DRM 100 patches amounting to over fourty thousand lines of code was sent out today for review in order to provide "Vega 10" support within the AMDGPU DRM driver. Google Is Making It Possible To Run Android Studio On ChromeOS Google is working on Android Studio support atop Chrome OS. With this official Android integrated development environment on Chrome OS, could it make Chromebooks/Chromeboxes a great platform for Android development? And the top 10 featured articles/reviews: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Linux Benchmarks The day many of you have been waiting for is finally here: AMD Zen (Ryzen) processors are shipping! Thanks to AMD coming around at the last minute, I received a Ryzen 7 1800X yesterday evening and have been putting it through its paces. Here is my walkthrough of the Linux experience for the AMD Ryzen and new motherboard and a number of the initial Linux benchmarks for this high-end Zen CPU while much more coverage is coming in the hours and days ahead. AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Linux Benchmarks: Great Multi-Core Performance For $329 Yesterday we posted launch-day Ryzen 7 1800X Linux benchmarks that were particularly appealing for multi-core / heavily-threaded workloads like code compilation. Given all the code compilation done by Linux users in particular, if you were intrigued by the Ryzen 7 1800X performance but find the $499 USD price-tag to be too higher, today I have my initial benchmark figures on the Ryzen 7 1700. The Ryzen 7 1700 is still eight cores and sixteen threads but will only set you back $329 USD as the current low-end Ryzen processor for what's currently available. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X vs. Intel Core i7 7700K Linux Gaming Performance For those craving some Linux gaming benchmarks from the newly-released AMD Ryzen 7 1800X processor, here are some test results. In this initial comparison are benchmarks of the Ryzen 7 1800K to Core i7 7700K when running these processors at stock speeds while using a Radeon R9 Fury graphics card paired with AMDGPU+RadeonSI for the Linux graphics driver stack. AMD Ryzen CPU Core Scaling Performance Curious how Ryzen scales across its CPU cores and SMT? Here are some Ubuntu Linux benchmarks testing a Ryzen 7 1700 with different core/thread counts. GeForce GTX 1080 Ti: Core i7 7700K vs. Ryzen 7 1800X Linux Gaming Performance Since last week's tests of the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, a number of Phoronix readers have requested tests of this high-end GP102 graphics card to be done under both the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X and Core i7 7700K. Here are those OpenGL and Vulkan gaming results for those looking at high-end Linux gaming performance. Running The Ryzen 7 1700 At 4.0GHz On Linux Many Phoronix readers appear rather intrigued by the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 on Linux as it offers good multi-threaded performance with eight cores / 16 threads and retails for just $329 USD. Making the Ryzen 7 1700 even more appealing to enthusiasts is that it overclocks well. For those curious, here are benchmarks of the Ryzen 7 1700 on Ubuntu Linux running at 4.0GHz. The Impact Of GCC Zen Compiler Tuning On AMD Ryzen Performance The latest in our AMD Ryzen Linux benchmarking is looking at the impact of compiled binaries when making use of Zen "znver1" compiler optimizations with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compared to other optimization levels like Bulldozer and K8-SSE3. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti On Linux: Best Linux Gaming Performance The GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is NVIDIA's newest, most powerful graphics card for gamers not only on Windows but also under Linux. I only received the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti this morning so here are my initial Linux performance figures for this new high-end Pascal graphics card compared to other NVIDIA and AMD Radeon graphics cards. Linux VR tests, CUDA/OpenCL compute benchmarks, and additional GeForce GTX 1080 Ti results will be published in the days ahead when having more time to spend with this graphics card. Benchmarks Of Many ARM Boards From The Raspberry Pi To NVIDIA Jetson TX2 For some weekend benchmarking fun, I compared the Jetson TX2 that NVIDIA released this weekend with their ARM 64-bit "Denver 2" CPU cores paired with four Cortex-A57 cores to various other ARM single board computers I have access to. This is looking at the CPU performance in different benchmarks ranging from cheap ~$10 ARM SBCs to the Raspberry Pi to the Jetson TX1 and Jetson TX2. How Well Modern Linux Games Scale To Multiple CPU Cores With all the discussions about AMD's Ryzen 7 processors that boast eight cores plus SMT, there has been much discussion in our forums and elsewhere the past few days about how many cores most modern Linux games actually utilize... That plus with looking at how well Ryzen's CPU cores scale, I have carried out some fresh Linux CPU core scaling benchmarks with an Intel Core i7 6800K Broadwell-E to see if most Linux games can end up using 4+ cores right now. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

According to the official product requirements page, Optane only works with 7th generation Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs. This is surprising since Optane is partly aimed at the budget conscious consumers who want SSD-like speeds without the high cost associated with SSDs. Optane works by creating a bridge between fast DRAM and high capacity spinning hard drives which results in faster boot times, game launch times, and a generally more responsive system. It was positioned as a huge speed increase for low-end systems, but it turns out you'll need a new and relatively high end system to use the technology. The cheapest compatible CPU is the Core i3-7100 which costs around $120. Compared to an unsupported Pentium G4620 build with a 480GB SSD, upgrading to a barebones Optane setup costs nearly the same amount. The i3 is slightly faster and the 16GB Optane module paired with a 1TB HDD would give a larger capacity of high speed storage, but this is still a hard sell for Intel to make. Intel's decision to only allow Core series processors is a bit counter intuitive. As the platform becomes more mature though, we'll see if the caching software and performance boost is enough to entice the next generation of budget PC builders. Of course, this could just be a marketing error on Intel's part and in that case, everyone would be happy.

It's harder to say the same about the CPUs' bang-for-buck in gaming when compared to Intel's Kaby Lake offerings. AMD has promised to work with game developers to improve performance of popular titles on Ryzen chips, and the company says progress has been made on this front. Additionally, AMD says it will soon ship microcode updates to motherboard vendors that should improve performance and prevent system instability in certain conditions. On the software front, AMD says it has worked with Stardock and Oxide Games to improve performance in technology-demo-slash-real-time-strategy-game Ashes of the Singularity, and with Valve Software to increase minimum-FPS performance in Dota 2. Setting aside the incomplete picture of performance provided by average FPS and minimum FPS figures, AMD says its tweaks increase average FPS in Ashes on Ryzen by somewhere between 15-30% depending on the type of test. Ryzen minimum frame rates in Dota 2 rose by almost 15% after some optimization work. PC Perspective tested the Ashes patch and saw performance jumps similar to AMD's claims on Ryzen chips. The patch didn't change performance on an Intel Core i7-6900K tested for comparison. We must note that Intel's chips still deliver the highest performance figures in Ashes, though, even after the Ryzen-focused update. AMD will soon issue a 1.0.0.4 microcode update for Ryzen CPUs, as well. This revision claims to decrease DRAM latency by up to 6 ns, prevent system instability when Ryzen chips execute "unusual FMA3" code, correct a clock speed reporting bug, and eliminate the need for the High-Precision Event Timer when using AMD Ryzen Master. AMD says BIOSes incorporating the new microcode will start showing up in early April, though update times will vary from boardmaker to boardmaker. The company goes on to say that another microcode update scheduled for release in May will "focus on overclocked DDR4 memory," which has been something of a sore spot for the platform.  If AMD can unlock similar performance gains in a wide variety of titles to those it's achieved in Ashes of the Singularity, the value proposition of all Ryzen chips in gaming workloads could improve quite a bit. Similarly, if the company can deliver on improved performance, stability, and compatibility through microcode updates, Ryzen will only become more appealing. Time will tell.

The manufacturer announced on its Edge Up blog page that BIOS updates for 35 different models with B250, H270, Q270, and Z270 chipsets will enable Optane compatibility. As we noted in our previous coverage, these devices will only work with Intel Kaby Lake Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs with 200-series and C236 chipsets. Users with Kaby Lake chips on 100-series motherboards or Skylake processors on 200-series mainboards are left out of the Optane party. Owners of Kaby Lake Pentiums and Celerons are similarly disqualified. What we know about the first wave of consumer Optane models suggests that owners of the lower-end chipsets paired with old-school spinning-rust storage devices will see more benefits from the new technology than those with ROG Maximus IX Extreme Z270 boards paired with cutting-edge NVMe SSDs. Intel has a list of Optane-compatible boards from a number of manufacturers here. As a reminder, the 16 GB model is expected to sell for $44 and the 32 GB model will go for $77.

The DDR3 RAM still supported by the memory controllers inside Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs first hit the scene all the way back in 2007, though the speeds have increased and the operating voltage and power consumption went down in the intervening years. A brisk three years after DDR4 hit the market, JEDEC has announced that it's working on a specification for DDR5 memory, and expects to publish the design standards sometime in 2018. The organization says that DDR5 memory will offer double the bandwidth and density of DDR4 along with increased power efficiency. Given the trend of increasing  core counts and the difficulty and expense of adding additional memory channels to motherboards, DIMM bandwidth seems set to become more important in the future. The standards body is also working on a specification for NVDIMM-P, the next-generation of the NVDIMM standard for memory modules that retain their contents after power loss. The NVDIMM standard could face competition from Intel's datacenter Optane products. Optane offers much lower latencies than even the fastest NVMe storage, along with the same non-volatile operation. For perspective, JEDEC first started talking about DDR3 in May 2005 and products started hitting the market in 2007. The pattern was similar for DDR4, whose final spec arrived in September 2012 and was supported by CPUs released in the second half of 2014. We would expect a lead time at least that long for the first DDR5 products. JEDEC says more information should be available at its Server Forum event in June.

Right now U.S. corporations are sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash here at home. And according to Capital Economics, American firms have another $2.5 trillion stashed overseas. Combine that with low interest rates and tepid earnings growth and you’ve got the perfect recipe for merger mania this year. But what should you look for in a takeover target, and more importantly — which companies make the grade? Senior Analyst Jonathan Rodriguez breaks it all down for you below… Ahead of the Tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Why Takeovers Are Such a Big Deal If you’ve followed the financial news over the last few years, you’ve likely seen a lot of coverage on mergers and acquisitions. And if you weren’t following closely, you might wonder why M&A is such a hot topic… Well, in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 — and fueled by ultralow interest rates — corporate earnings took off in a way not seen since the dot-com boom of the 1990s. But after years of eye-popping earnings growth, the gravy train finally hit a speed bump in 2015. A slowdown in consumption overseas — particularly in China and Europe — hit multinational corporations hard here in the U.S. But many firms were already hoarding mountains of cash — and had access to even more easy money with cheap credit. So what do you do as a loaded company when growth slows down and you’re not sure when it’s going to pick up again? You create growth by acquiring your rivals and pocketing their cash flow. What followed in 2015 was a record-breaking year for M&A. Around the world, $4.3 trillion of merger deals were made, according to Dealogic. The Early Bird Gets the Worm Now, you might be wondering what this means for the average shareholder. In short, if you happen to be one of the fine people holding shares of a takeover target, you could be in line for a big payday. Acquiring companies will often pay for targets in cash, stock and/or debt. And they can offer investors a premium to the current share price anywhere from 20–60%. For instance, semiconductor giant Intel Corp. announced a deal this month to purchase Israeli tech firm Mobileye N.V. — for $15.3 billion. Intel offered to buy Mobileye shares at $63.54 in cash, which represented a 34% premium to the latter’s closing price the day before the announcement. On March 13, the day news of the deal broke, shares gained 28%. As you can see, the rewards of owning a hot takeover target before it’s scooped up are big — and can come swiftly. How to Snag Your Pot of Takeover Gold As you can imagine, the criteria for an acquisition vary based on the kind of business a company operates. But many takeover targets display similar traits… For starters, look for companies with a high cash balance and low level of debt. Acquiring firms love to see a high cash balance in targets. After all, the acquirer is going to pocket the loot once the deal goes through. In fact, a company’s enterprise value (EV) can be a very useful figure for investors hunting for M&A gold. EV is simply a firm’s market capitalization plus debt, minus cash — and it represents a company’s theoretical takeover price. Investors can also divide this number by a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to give them an even more powerful tool. EV/EBIDTA, better known as the enterprise multiple, allows investors to compare a target with other firms on a relative basis. Some analysts even consider EV/EBITDA to be a superior measure of earnings than the price-earnings ratio. In the context of takeovers, though, the lower an enterprise multiple… the better a value the target is. Above all, a company sporting a valuation below that of the broader market (i.e., price-earnings, price-to-sales, etc.) is more likely to be acquired than a company with an excessive valuation. Bottom line: The combination of slow growth, low interest rates and high corporate cash balances will likely fuel a resurgence of mergers and acquisitions this year. And keeping a keen eye out for “cheap” companies with lots of cash and little debt could make you rich in the event of a takeover.

House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said in an interview earlier today that the reports about White House officials helping provide him the information he read on White House grounds are “mostly wrong.” The New York Times reported yesterday that two White House officials––Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis––“played a role” in helping Nunes view the intelligence he saw on White House grounds last week. The Washington Post followed that up with its own report saying that “at least three senior White House officials, including the top lawyer for the National Security Council, were involved in the handling of intelligence files” Nunes reviewed. The chairman stated that he wouldn’t get into “sources and methods,” but added, “Those reports are mostly wrong.” He said they’re full of “innuendo” and while there were people who were probably aware of him being on White House grounds, “that doesn’t make them the source of my information.” Bloomberg View columnist Eli Lake wrote yesterday that Nunes had “misled” him by saying his source of information was an intel official and not a White House staffer: The chairman told me Thursday that elements of the Times story were inaccurate. But he acknowledged: “I did use the White House to help to confirm what I already knew from other sources.” You can watch the video above, via KSEE.

Rugged, spill-proof exterior. 2-in-1 convertible form factor. Support for Google for Education administration and features. Cons Low-resolution screen. No USB-C ports. Bottom Line The Dell Chromebook 3189 is a durable convertible laptop, with a long-lasting battery, a multimode hinge, and enough processing juice to help power online and classroom learning. By Joel Santo Domingo As its name implies, the Dell Chromebook 3189 Education 2-in-1 (starts at $349; $389 as tested) is a convertible laptop made with students in mind. It delivers all-day battery life, and is built tough enough to handle all the abuse that school-age children can dish out. And since it supports school-administered Google for Education accounts, this reasonably priced chromebook can be shared among students and managed by teachers or school IT staffers, making it a welcome addition to the classroom. //Compare Similar Products Compare Asus Chromebook Flip (C302CA-DHM4)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Chromebook 11 Non-Touch   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 15 (CB3-532-C47C)   %displayPrice%%seller% CTL J5 Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad 11e Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14 for Work   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Chromebook 13 G1   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo N22-20 Touch Chromebook   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook R 13 (CB5-312T-K5X4)   %displayPrice%%seller% Hanging Tough The Chromebook 3189 has a rounded edge surrounding its black, polycarbonate exterior, but is otherwise devoid of any design flair. It measures 0.8 by 12 by 8.2 inches (HWD) and weighs 3.16 pounds. That's a bit thicker and heavier than the Asus Chromebook Flip, our top pick for chromebooks, but the Chromebook 3189's rugged construction is the reason for the added heft. View All 10 Photos in Gallery Since it's MIL-STD 810G tested and rated, the Chromebook 3189 can withstand extreme temperatures, rapid changes in altitude, blowing sand and dust, shock and vibration, and drops up to 30 inches onto a wooden surface. The rounded edges are rubberized, and there are two long rubber strips on the bottom panel to help prevent the laptop from sliding around. The chiclet-style keyboard is sealed against liquids, and the top lid is scratch-resistant. This chromebook is designed to survive all day in the classroom, as well as trips back and forth from home in a school bag packed with textbooks along with school and sports supplies. Made to Touch The 2-in-1 convertible form factor means that you can pivot the screen 360 degrees around its dual hinges, allowing you to use the touch screen in traditional Laptop mode, Tent mode (with the keyboard pointed away, and the hinge pointing upward), Stand mode (with the keyboard flat on the table, and the screen angled in front), or Tablet mode (with the keyboard folded away 360 degrees, and the screen up and exposed). The touch screen is responsive, and comes in handy for both data entry and on-screen drawing and note-taking. The 11.6-inch display has a low 1,366-by-768 resolution, which is the minimum required for chromebooks. Full HD screens, like the one on the Asus Chromebook Flip and the Acer Chromebook 14, are still rarities, and we don't consider full HD an absolute necessity for use in a school setting. Using a lower-resolution screen on the Chromebook 3189 eases the strain on the Intel Celeron N3060 processor, since it doesn't have to process the extra pixels. Native 720p and downscaled 1080p videos displayed smoothly on the panel in our tests, though downscaled 4K videos stuttered and paused often for processing. In addition to easing the burden on the processor, the lower-resolution screen also uses less power than a full HD or 4K screen, leading to better battery life. Like its predecessor, the Dell Chromebook 11 Non-Touch, the Chromebook 3189 has a multicolored Dell Activity Light on the top-right corner of the lid, that a teacher can use to make sure all students in the class are on the same page, are online, or are ready (say, for an exam to start). Or it can be used by a student to signal the teacher in lieu of a raised hand. An API for the light is available online, so you can integrate various colored lights into your teaching programs. The keyboard is optimized for Chrome OS. That means that instead of the standard F1-F12 keys, the top row of function keys are labeled with icons for forward/back, reload, full-screen, toggling Overview mode (to show all windows at once), screen brightness, screen lock, and volume controls. There's a dedicated Search key in place of the Caps Lock key, since you would likely use the search function more often in the web-based Chrome OS. Key action is smooth, and the keyboard itself is very sturdy. There's no keyboard flex at all, something that will help the laptop survive being shared among grade-school students. Like the keyboard, the one-piece touchpad is also sealed against spills. There's a good selection of connectivity ports, including a headset jack on the right side of the laptop, as well as an HDMI port, a microSD card reader (which accepts up to 256GB cards) for extra local storage, a power connector, and two USB 3.0 ports on the left panel. There are no USB-C ports, which are pretty rare on chromebooks right now. Integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 handle wireless connections. Like all chromebooks, this laptop runs the stripped-down ChromeOS operating system. It basically uses the Chrome browser as its main interface to the web, eschewing storage-space-filling programs like Microsoft Office. On the flip side, if your school uses Windows programs developed in-house, or off-the-shelf apps, you may be out of luck trying to run them on ChromeOS. Also, the Chromebook 3189 doesn't yet support Android apps, though compatibility could be added in the future, as ChromeOS automatically updates itself over the internet when available. A Look Inside Our review configuration has 32GB of fast SSD storage. There are also Chromebook 3189 models available with 16GB ($329) and 64GB ($409) SSDs. We think 32GB of storage is large enough for Chrome OS, because students will likely save their work in the cloud-based Google Drive that comes with each Google for Education account. As long as your school has more than four users, Google includes unlimited storage online, or 1TB each for one to four users. Google for Education is free to all accredited nonprofit education organizations. The 4GB of RAM, which is standard for all three versions, isn't expandable, but it should be sufficient for basic web and office app functions. In testing, we were able to keep a half dozen actively updated websites and a streaming audio site running simultaneously. The Intel Celeron N3060 is the only processor available on the Chromebook 3189, and it is fast enough for tasks like browsing education sites, light drawing and coloring in grade-school art classes, and viewing videos from sites like PBS.com. It might be a little light on power compared with, say, the Intel Core m3 chip in the Asus Chromebook Flip, but the Chrome OS and browser runs well on this budget-priced CPU. We weren't able to run our Windows-based benchmark tests on the laptop, but it felt snappy while leading and navigating between websites. We could easily edit a letter in Google Docs, stream music from Spotify, and chat in Slack simultaneous, for example. As long as you keep the number of active tabs below 12, you should be fine. Windows systems in this price range are likely to have Celeron or lower-power processors, like the Intel Atom CPU in the Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR). Our Editors' Choice budget Windows 2-in-1 convertible, the Lenovo Yoga 710, goes for $549, and like the Asus Chromebook Flip comes with a speedier Intel Core m3 processor. See How We Test Laptops The 42WHr battery pack is sealed into the chassis, and can't be swapped out. That's not likely to be an issue, though, since the Chromebook 3189 lasted an impressive 11 hours and 39 minutes in our battery rundown test. When fully charged, the laptop will last an entire school day, and still have enough juice for homework afterward. It's still an hour longer than the Asus Chromebook Flip (10:23), which has a higher power drain from its full HD screen, but there are other chromebooks that returned longer run times, including the Acer Chromebook 15 (14:17) and the CTL J5 Chromebook (12:21). Ready for School The Dell Chromebook 3189 Education 2-in-1 is an attractive choice for the school environment, thanks to its relatively low price, decent feature set, durable construction, and long-lasting battery. For non-students, we still prefer the Asus Chromebook Flip, our Editors' Choice chromebook, since its metal exterior, faster processor, and larger full HD screen make it a better fit in a home-entertainment capacity. If you're willing to give up the convertible hinge, the $230 Lenovo N22-20 Touch Chromebook is a utilitarian clamshell chromebook that will save you a few bucks. And if you absolutely must have Windows, the Asus Transformer Mini is a decent (if slowish) alternative for about the same price. That said, if you're filling out a purchase order for a few dozen (or a few hundred) units at a time for your educational institution, the Chromebook 3189 should be on your short list.

Trump wrote at 9.50am: 'Wow, Fox News just reporting big news. Source: "Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked...."' Twelve minutes later, he added: '..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated." If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.' Scroll down for video Donald Trump tweeted about a Fox News story this morning that seemed to support his claim he was spied on during the election. The story cited a single anonymous source. Trump's first tweet was published at 9.50am and his second was published at 10.02am. The tweets do not appear to quite follow each other grammatically and it is not clear if there was a reason for the 12-minute delay between them The Fox News story cites a single anonymous source who said that a 'very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world' individual, not associated with the FBI, was responsible for allegedly revealing the identities of private persons involved in the Trump campaign. An unnamed congressional source said: 'The main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election.' The Fox News story did not provide further details of who these private citizens were.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Trump 'didn't win this election': New DNC chair says...

Share this article Share The story comes as Devin Nunes, a California Republican representative and the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, said US intelligence collected incidental evidence on Trump, The Hill reported. Nunes came under fire for alleged closeness to the Trump team, particularly when it emerged that White House officials colluded with him during his investigation into the alleged surveillance.  Trump also on Saturday morning attacked NBC News' Chuck Todd in a furious tweet, wondering why the 'sleepy-eyed' host didn't give more air time to his claims that the previous administration wiretapped his headquarters. In the Fox News story that Trump cited, a single anonymous source said that a 'very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world' individual, not associated with the FBI, was responsible for allegedly revealing identities of private persons in Trump campaign The president's Twitter rant came a day after Todd warned on MSNBC that Trump could be on the verge of a 'lame duck' presidency due to the current investigation over his campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Todd's 'lame duck' quote was immediately picked up by conservative websites such as Breitbart news, where it was making headlines Saturday morning when Trump published his tweet. The Russia probe, which has been fed by Trump's unsubstantiated wiretapping claims, escalated to new heights over the end of the past week, with Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn asking for an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony.  The president followed up with another message 21 minutes later, once again taunting media outlets for not predicting his victory in the presidential election The president's Twitter rant came after Todd warned that Trump could be on the verge of a 'lame duck' presidency due to the investigation over his campaign's alleged ties to Russia Todd said in a commentary on MSNBC Friday that Trump's presidency had been left 'beyond crisis mode' by the ongoing Russia probe fiasco.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News 3 Top Apple Suppliers to Buy in 2017 Strong earnings growth and the dominance of the iPhone, which more than 700 million consumers use worldwide, have combined to help Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  stock rise more than 900% in the past decade. Apple is the largest company to trade on any U.S. stock exchange by market cap, and it has by far the most cash of any public company. It’s using that cash pile to make huge investments in research and development. But we’re not going to talk here about Apple. I want to focus instead on what companies have been benefiting from Apple’s success as they help supply the parts and services necessary for Apple’s continued growth. Here, then, are three key Apple suppliers that could also make top stocks for 2017. Image source: Apple. Micron Technology Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)  is a semiconductor manufacturer that makes products for computers, consumer electronics, the automotive industry, industrial applications, and more. The company supplies the internal processing power of iPhones and other Apple products. Micron’s stock was a great performer in 2016, gaining more than 50% during the year, and looks on track to continue gaining in 2017. Micron’s NAND products, which are advanced rewritable memory devices, seem to have huge potential as cloud computing continues to grow, which could help to diversify and grow sales in the coming quarters. In its most recent quarter, Micron’s sales rose 58% year over year. The company does face some risks, including an increasing threat from major players in the field, including Intel . It also faces volatility in the prices for its products, the same thing that’s sent the stock tumbling in the past. In addition, Micron’s CEO recently announced his retirement, and so far a replacement hasn’t been named. It should also be noted that Micron stock is still off its November 2014 high, which was followed by more than a 70% drop over the next 18 months. Still, analysts expect Micron’s earnings to continue growing quickly, and the stock price looks attractive at less than 6 times forward earnings estimates. Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN)  is an advanced semiconductor maker that makes chips and processors, including various components of Apple’s iPhone and iPad. The company recently got a major operational boost when it moved to a new type of chip for one of its main products that reduced production costs significantly — as much as 40%. For the full year of 2016, sales rose only about 3%, but earnings per share grew nearly 24%. The company showed strong momentum within its auto and industrial segments, two areas the company has been investing heavily in, and which seems to be paying off now. Sales are climbing faster now than they did in 2016, and management has guided for Q1 sales of as much as $3.43 billion, compared with $3 billion during the prior-year period. As for the stock’s valuation, it looks relatively cheap in its industry, trading at just 23 times earnings. It also comes with a nice 2.5% yield that’s grown very consistently over the past decade and is likely to continue growing, as the company has a payout ratio of less than 50% and strong cash flow. The progression of iPhone generations. The iPhone 8 is expected in fall 2017. Image source: Apple. Broadcom Last, but certainly not least, is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , which, following the 2016 merger with fellow semiconductor behemoth Avago, is a $94 billion company by market cap. Broadcom is a major supplier of wireless chips used in the iPhone, and there’s been speculation lately that Broadcom and Apple are working together on wireless-charging technology that could be in the iPhone 8, expected to be released later this year. That would be a major positive development for both companies. Thanks to the merger, Broadcom’s 2017 sales are likely to grow substantially from last year, but expect that growth to continue as the company expands its market share. The company’s long-term earnings growth potential looks even better, as it’s expected to grow around 15% annually over the next five years. While the stock looks expensive because of the cost of the acquisition, it’s trading at just 14 times forward earnings estimates, and it also pays a 2% dividend yield. Is it a good idea to invest in companies that might ride Apple’s coattails, or is it better to just invest in Apple itself? That’s a fair question, as Apple already looks like one of the best stocks to own in 2017 , and betting on its suppliers has been a gamble in years past. Apple has a history of squeezing suppliers on prices to protect its own margin, while new entrants in the chip space have left some companies with questionable growth prospects. However, each of the companies we’ve looked at have many more buyers than just Apple, and each also has its own unique growth prospects. Therefore, it wouldn’t be a bad strategy to consider both Apple and these suppliers as good stocks to own going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Texas Instruments When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Flynn’s recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid Flynn’s effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump’s election campaign in 2016. The new disclosures show that Flynn declared more than $827,000 from his work for the Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The disclosures detail Flynn’s financial activities dating back to 2014, including Flynn’s 2015 work for Russia’s state-supported television network and speeches to two other Russian companies. Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI, which has been investigating allegations of contacts last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials and surrogates. The White House released two filings for Flynn on Saturday. One was filed while he was still in the administration. The other was filed Friday, more than a month after Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser. Trump has said he asked Flynn to step down because he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said. The White House on Friday began releasing scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company’s lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Flynn’s client, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. Flynn reported assets worth between $1.2 million and $2.4 million during the last year. He also reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.

Flynn’s initial disclosures, which he submitted in mid-February, left out that he received money from Russia’s state-funded television network, RT, for a speech in Moscow and from air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the United States. Flynn included the speaking fees in disclosure forms he filed Friday, according to the documents. Both sets of filings were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said Flynn “had only just begun the financial disclosure filing process at the time he left the White House. “He filed a draft form explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract, and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counsel’s Office and OGE (Office of Government Ethics) regarding what he was expected to disclose. That process was suspended, however, after he resigned. When the White House asked him this week to complete the process and to itemize the specific speaking events, he did so,” Kelner said. CNN has reported extensively on the RT speech, but the existence of the other two speaking engagements was disclosed last month by House Democrats. Flynn resigned just days after the date of the initial financial disclosure after it became public that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. The disclosure forms show Flynn made as much as $1.5 million last year. According to his financial snapshot, Flynn received $827,055 in salary and bonus from his firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. The retired lieutenant general listed a speaking engagement for “RT TV,” the Russian TV network, when asked in the form to disclose “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” but did not specify the amount. CNN previously reported that Flynn, according to a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was paid more than $45,000 by RT, formerly called Russia Today, for a speech in Moscow in December 2015. The US intelligence community has long assessed RT to be a propaganda tool of the Kremlin, writing in a January report on Russian interference in the US election that the organization had participated in disinformation campaigns aimed at the US. Flynn initially said he was paid by his speakers bureau for the talk. The forms say Flynn received “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year” from the Russian airline and cybersecurity company for speaking engagements in the United States. House Democrats last month also revealed the existence of those two speeches, saying Flynn received $11,250 from the airline and $11,250 from the cybersecurity firm. The White House acknowledged in March that Trump’s transition team was aware before Flynn was tapped to serve as national security adviser that he had engaged in work that would likely require him to register his consulting firm as a foreign agent. Flynn’s Justice Department filing last month raised questions when it revealed that Flynn’s firm worked on behalf of a Turkish-owned company, Inovo BV, to improve US confidence in Turkey’s business climate. Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from the company and acknowledged in its registration as a foreign agent that the work may have benefited the Turkish government. The White House has many advisers who earned millions of dollars last year, including President Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, whose assets combined with her husband’s could exceed $700 million. Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income, according to a new financial snapshot of about 180 of the men and women serving in Donald Trump’s White House. Other Trump aides with lucrative histories include Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of banking giant Goldman Sachs, who netted up to around $75 million in the previous year. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon made up to $2.5 million. The newly released financial disclosure forms list the assets the Trump aides held when they walked in the doors of the White House in January — before administration counsel advised them to resign from various postings, divest certain holdings or recuse themselves from future decisions. But the documents nevertheless offer a portrait into the lives of several key White House aides, especially those who came from Wall Street or have other ties to the financial industry. Kushner, like Trump, a prominent real estate titan, held a position in 267 separate entities, ranging from the Trump transition team to dozens of property holdings in New York and New Jersey. Ivanka Trump, who just this week formally said she would join the West Wing after serving as an informal adviser to her father, has yet to file her own disclosure forms. But the White House said earlier on Friday that her documents would look largely similar to her husband’s. Bannon’s forms reveal numerous ties to various conservative organizations and sources funded by the family of influential Trump donors Bob and Rebekah Mercer, such as Breitbart News, which he led as executive chairman, and Cambridge Analytica, a data firm used by many Republican clients. Other income sources for him are Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy firm valued at as high as $25 million, along with Affinity Media Holdings, which could have awarded him capital gains of as high as $1 million last year. Bannon is also in the process of selling some of his stake in Cambridge Analytica and Glittering Steel, another Mercer-backed entity, according to the forms.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Light up your desktop's insides with… Light up your desktop's insides with Corsair's colorful new Vengeance RGB memory kits By Kevin Parrish — March 29, 2017 4:37 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC builders wanting to spruce up the innards of their desktops with colorful hardware now have five new memory kit options from Corsair. Corsair began selling its five new Vengeance RGB DDR4 memory kits, which range in price between $150 and $600, on March 21. As the name implies, these high-performance DDR4 memory sticks sport a “precision-engineered” light bar across the top of the heat spreader to light up the innards of your desktop with various colors and effects. They can even change color based on system temperatures. Here are the specs and pricing of all five kits: CMR16GX4M2A2666C16 CMR16GX4M2C3000C15 CMR32GX4M4A2666C16 Kit contents (size): 2x 8GB 2x 8GB 4x 8GB Type: DDR4 DDR4 DDR4 Number of pins: 288 288 288 Performance profile: XMP 2.0 XMP 2.0 XMP 2.0 SPD latency: 15-15-15-36 15-15-15-36 15-15-15-36 SPD speed: 2,133MHz 2,133MHz 2,133MHz SPD voltage: 1.2 volts 1.2 volts 1.2 volts Tested latency: 16-18-18-35 15-17-17-35 16-18-18-35 Tested speed: 2,666MHz 3,000MHz 2,666MHz Tested voltage: 1.2 volts 1.35 volts 1.2 volts CAS latency: C16 C15 C16 Price: $150 $155 $300 CMR32GX4M4C3000C15 CMR64GX4M8A2666C16 Kit contents (size): 4x 8GB 8x 8GB Type: DDR4 DDR4 Number of pins: 288 288 Performance profile: XMP 2.0 XMP 2.0 SPD latency: 15-15-15-36 15-15-15-36 SPD speed: 2,133MHz 2,133MHz SPD voltage: 1.2 volts 1.2 volts Tested latency: 15-17-17-35 16-18-18-35 Tested speed: 3,000MHz 2,666MHz Tested voltage: 1.35 volts 1.2 volts CAS latency: C15 C16 Price: $305 $600 Each Vengeance RGB memory stick consists of a custom performance printed circuit board, hand-screened integrated circuits, and a built-in heat spreader for cool, superior performance no matter the load. The XMP 2.0 support means that each chip can safely switch between preconfigured, tested Intel XMP profiles for safe overclocking. “Vengeance RGB’s Corsair Link software control is compatible with a wide range of Intel DDR4 platforms, from dual-channel Z270 and Z170 to quad-channel X99, with more boards adding compatibility every week and AMD Ryzen support planned soon,” the company said. Corsair added that each Vengeance RGB stick packs “specifically designed” lighting circuitry, meaning users won’t see a memory performance decrease with the lighting enabled. And through the Corsair Link tool, users can synchronize the memory’s lighting and effects with other compatible Corsair products installed in the system. The lighting effects include Static, Rainbow, Breathing, and Color Shift. According to Corsair, the new Vengeance RGB memory sticks are compatible with third-party motherboard software RGB control. The first motherboard maker to embrace Corsair’s colorful new memory is Gigabyte, which now supports Vengeance RGB lighting in its RGB Fusion app. Other motherboard partners will add support for the Vengeance RGB sticks “soon.” As a refresher, CAS latency is the time between the memory controller’s initial command to the availability of stored data on the output pins. Naturally, the smaller the number, the faster the memory performance per clock cycle. The four-digit latency numbers actually represent four parameters: CAS latency, Row Address to Column Address Delay, Row Percentage Time, and Row Active Time. Thus, for an additional $5, customers get less latency and higher memory speeds using the CMR16GX4M2C3000C15 kit than they would with the CMR16GX4M2A2666C16 kit. But the performance increase also increases the power draw, upping the usage to 1.35 volts from 1.2 volts.

Flynn’s attorney says the former national security. Credit: Evan Vucci/AP Associated Press 2 April 2017 • 2:37am Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3 million (£1 million)  for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments.  In response to questions about the differences in the filing, MrFlynn's lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Mr Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Mr Flynn's recent financial history, made available on Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Mf Flynn's business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia's state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies.  The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015.  The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump's campaign. Profile | General Michael Flynn Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinised by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. The first filing was turned in on Feb. 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn't include an itemised listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet. The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Mr Flynn's paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Mr Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. "Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so," Mr Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalised version. A document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn's lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Michael Flynn Credit: Carolyn Kaster/AP Mr Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn's client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice Department officials contacted Mr Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Mr Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and "potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey." Mr Flynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Mr Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Mr Flynn provided to the bureau. Mr Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc., detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Mr Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. As part of his firm's lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Michael Flynn Credit: Ozan Kose/AFP Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan's, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey's claim was false and that "no such discussion occurred." Flynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee.  The group's website says it aims to "promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States." But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks.  Mr Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. Mr Flynn was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit think tank promoting libertarian ideals.

X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 2 April 2017 Ong denies M’sia taking advantage of the US by tho xin yi KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is not taking advantage of the United States – as claimed by Donald Trump for its large trade deficit – as the bulk of its exports to the United States are electronics manufactured by American companies here. “Perhaps US President Donald Trump does not know there is a huge presence of American manufacturers in Malaysia such as Intel and Western Digital due to the low production cost here. “The electronics they make are brought back to America as semi-finished products to be assembled into computers and handphones,” International Trade and Industry Minister II Datuk Seri Ong Ka Chuan said. It was reported on Friday that Trump wanted its administration to find out the countries and goods res­­ponsible for the United States’ nearly US$50bil (RM221.35bil) trade deficit. A report by AFP, quoting Com­merce Secretary Wilbur Ross, said the United States would look for “inappropriate behaviour, trade deals that have not lived up to their promise, lax enforcement, currency misalignment and troublesome World Trade Organisation constraints”. Malaysia was named in the list of countries seen as “potentially involved”. Speaking to reporters here after attending the Xianning-Kuala Lum­pur tea promotion and tea culture exchange conference yesterday, Ong said it must be made clear that Malaysia was not taking advantage of the United States. Quoting February trade figures, he said 53% of exports to the US were electronics produced by American companies here, while the rest included furniture and chemicals. He said that taxes were imposed on goods entering the United States as both countries did not have a free trade agreement. Therefore, exports there had always been low, he added. “If Trump were to ‘punish’ us for this, the American firms will be the ones dealt a severe blow,” Ong said. On another matter, he said the trade in tea between Malaysia and China grew almost 40% to RM57mil last year from RM40.9mil in 2015. He said there was room for further growth in the tea business to help both countries reach the US$160bil (RM708.320bil) trade goal. Ong said that tea leaves could be transported via railway to China and Europe should there be a comprehensive rail system connecting Asean to China, which is already running a train route linking 18 European cities. The event was organised by the Tea Trade Association of Malaysia to push for closer cooperation between tea merchants from Malay­sia and China’s Hubei province. Seven pairs of Malaysian and Chinese tea merchants signed memorandums of understanding to expand their collaboration.

Stephen Braun and Chad Day WASHINGTON The Associated Press Published Saturday, Apr. 01, 2017 8:15PM EDT Last updated Saturday, Apr. 01, 2017 8:15PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3-million for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments. In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn’s lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Flynn’s recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional investigators in exchange for his co-operation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Flynn’s business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia’s state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies. The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump’s campaign. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice-president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. The first filing was turned in on Feb. 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn’t include an itemized listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet. The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Flynn’s paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version. An OGE document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn’s lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company’s lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Flynn’s client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials.

Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey.” Flynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5-million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc., detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. As part of his firm’s lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan’s, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey’s claim was false and that “no such discussion occurred.” Flynn’s new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee. The group’s website says it aims to “promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States.” But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks. Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. Flynn was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a non-profitthink-tank promoting libertarian ideals.

Lindsey Graham at a town hall on Saturday again pledged he will ensure a "bipartisan and fair" investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the presidential election — and said recent developments involving Michael Flynn are "getting weirder by the day." "We're going to follow the evidence and not let politics get in the way," Graham told the overwhelmingly anti-Trump crowd. Play Facebook Twitter Embed Sen.

"We're going to talk about the Flynn deal," Graham said from the town hall stage with a chuckle. "It's getting weirder by the day, isn't it? Yeah." Related: Flynn's Immunity Request Rejected By Senate Intel Committee Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. questions Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch at a confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on March 21, 2017. Susan Walsh / AP Graham openly questioned how the Trump campaign "missed" the fact that Flynn was registered as a foreign agent for Turkey during the campaign. He also poked at Flynn's comments in 2016 that individuals connected to Hillary Clinton who sought immunity were essentially admitting guilt to a crime. "You know, Flynn said himself, 'If you want immunity, you must, you know, be guilty,'" Graham quipped. He suggested that the investigations by the committees in Congress and the FBI should also look at former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort's business dealings while he led the GOP nominee's campaign last year. "Let's see what kind of business dealings he had. So, when issues arise, about people around the campaign or in the Trump administration have deals that don't sound right or look right, we'll look at it," Graham said.

Devin Nunes, R-California, is running astray. "Nunes. The House. They're off in a ditch," Graham said. Related: Flynn, Nunes Fallout Over Russia Probe Grows Ominous for White House The several hundred that gathered on Saturday widely embraced Graham's remarks about his commitment to investigating any potential Russia connections. He warned the crowd that future interference by the Russians could impact the U.S. again, and also roil European politics in elections from France to Germany. But on other issues Graham addressed on Saturday, the riled-up crowd spit back dissatisfaction. Graham said he would vote to change Senate rules to prevent Senate Democrats from filibustering the confirmation proceedings for Judge Neil Gorsuch. "If I have to, I will vote to change rules because I am not going to allow President Trump to be denied the same opportunity that every president has had for 200 years because you're mad and you can't accept the outcome of an election," he said to jeers.

The earnings also account for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments.  In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn's lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3 million for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors. The earnings also account for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying Flynn's recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Flynn's business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia's state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies.  The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump's campaign. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Now THREE White House officials are in hot water for passing... Trump attacks 'sleepy-eyed Chuck Todd' in furious tweet... Share this article Share The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the US during the transition. The first filing was turned in on February 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn't include an itemized listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that US intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet.  The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Flynn's paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the US Office of Government Ethics. 'Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,' Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn (pictured in February 2017) to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the US during the transition Flynn (pictured in February 2014) declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman 'could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey' An OGE document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn's lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman 'could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.'  His client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice Department officials contacted Flynn on November 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and 'potential ties between Lt Gen Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey.' Flynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc, detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. Flynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser. Flynn's pictured with Trump on October 18, 2016, in Colorado  As part of his firm's lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan's, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey's claim was false and that 'no such discussion occurred.' Flynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee.  The group's website says it aims to 'promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States.' But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks.  Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. He was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit think tank promoting libertarian ideals.

Trump says his former national security adviser is right to ask for immunity in exchange for talking about Russia. Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday WASHINGTON - Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3 million for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments. In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn's lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in.

The disclosures detail Flynn's business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia's state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies. The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump's campaign. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. NationWH releases financial disclosures for top officials The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. advertisement | advertise on newsday The first filing was turned in on Feb. 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn't include an itemized listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet. The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Flynn's paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. "Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so," Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version. An OGE document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn's lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. NationHow Trump's made his mark with 15 executive actions The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn's client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice Department officials contacted Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and "potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey." Flynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. Nation30 people Trump has picked for Cabinet, top jobs In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc., detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. advertisement | advertise on newsday As part of his firm's lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan's, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey's claim was false and that "no such discussion occurred." Flynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee. The group's website says it aims to "promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States." But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks. Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. Flynn was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit think tank promoting libertarian ideals.

Flynn's recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid Flynn's effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016.

Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI, which has been investigating allegations of contacts last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials and surrogates. The White House released two filings for Flynn on Saturday. One was filed while he was still in the administration. The other was filed Friday, more than a month after Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser. Trump has said he asked Flynn to step down because he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.

The disclosures detail Flynn’s financial activities dating back to 2014, including Flynn’s 2015 work for Russia’s state-supported television network and speeches to two other Russian companies. Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI, which has been investigating allegations of contacts last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials and surrogates. The White House released two filings for Flynn on Saturday. One was filed while he was still in the administration. The other was filed Friday, more than a month after Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser. Trump has said he asked Flynn to step down because he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said. The White House on Friday began releasing scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company’s lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Flynn’s client, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice officials contacted Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and “potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey.” Flynn reported assets worth between $1.2 million and $2.4 million during the last year. He also reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Referring to the Friday episode of NBC's "Meet The Press," in which host Chuck Todd interviewed former White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest about an ongoing investigation into collusion and back dealings between the Trump administration and various political and financial entities in Russia, Trump asked when the media would stop talking about Russia and start talking about the Obama "surveillance scandal" again.  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017 ​Later on Friday evening, Todd appeared on NBC's "Nightly News," observing that the president's debunked assertions were the primary reason for a perceived lack of legitimacy in Trump's administration. © AP Photo/ Carolyn Kaster US Senate Intel Committee Rejects Flynn's Request for Immunity in Exchange for Testimony - Reports During Friday's program Todd said: "I think the biggest problem here is you have the president not wanting to accept the conclusion that Russia tried to interfere in the election and that there is going to be an investigation in this, whether he likes it or not." "The source of all of the current problems for this West Wing right now, for this presidency right now, all stems from that tweet where the president accused [Obama] of wiretapping him," he added, according to Business Insider. Trump's early-morning tweets included what appeared to be a personal attack on the news journalist, referring to Todd as ‘Sleepy Eyes,' while returning to a tried-and-true gambit of claiming that any news story he doesn't like is "Fake News. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017 Attempting to draw attention away from the ongoing Russia question to the more palatable topic of his own persecution, Trump commented on a Fox News report claiming to have revealed the "high up" official responsible for the unmasking of private citizens and associates of Trump who were allegedly caught up in surveillance activities under the Obama administration. Trump's claims that Trump Tower was "wiretapped" by Obama have been refuted by Obama administration officials, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and FBI Director James Comey, among others.  — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017 ​Adding fuel to the fire of Trump's difficulties is former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn who, after just two weeks in office, was forced to resign when it came to light that he had lied under oath to cover up conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn offered to testify in the ongoing investigation, in exchange for immunity from prosecution, but was turned down. It was noted that, prior to the November 2016 presidential election, Flynn said, "when you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime." Trump and his administration have said Flynn should be interviewed in the ongoing investigations, and that they have nothing to hide.  ...

Look at what happened with the NSA and Obastards approval with Merkels wire tapping fiasco as far back as 2010. Trump is not the type fantasize to about something and make a big issue of it if there was not nothing there. As much as the nazicons deny this, they are going to have a very big problem to keep denying it. As to the rest of the B/S like Russian hacking and interference, its just like rubbish they keep throwing in his way while he keeps kicking that can to the gutter!!! Reply bobbibrestel 03:32 02.04.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete Remind people enough that the corporate news media are liars and this forces them out of the politics news business eventually. One of the reasons the corporate media hate Trump is because he is effective at making the press look like active accomplices in the lying and corruption. Not just mere sock puppets who mindlessly repeat the lies they are told.

Flynn's recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid Flynn's effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016. The new disclosures show that Flynn declared more than $827,000 from his work for the Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The disclosures detail Flynn's financial activities dating back to 2014, including Flynn's 2015 work for Russia's state-supported television network and speeches to two other Russian companies. Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI, which has been investigating allegations of contacts last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials and surrogates. The White House released two filings for Flynn on Saturday. One was filed while he was still in the administration. The other was filed Friday, more than a month after Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser. Trump has said he asked Flynn to step down because he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the Office of Government Ethics. "Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so," Kelner said. The White House on Friday began releasing scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn's client, Ekin Alptekin, told The Associated Press that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice officials contacted Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and "potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey." Flynn reported assets worth between $1.2 million and $2.4 million during the last year. He also reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.

By Andrew Kent Saturday, April 1, 2017, 4:10 PM Google+ Reddit LinkedIn Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn attends Russia Today's 10th anniversary dinner / President of Russia Lawfare readers are surely aware that on Thursday, the lawyer for former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn went public with a statement seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony to either of the congressional intelligence committees investigating Russia-Trump matters. Flynn's attorney offered a teaser: "Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit." The Wall Street Journal reports that Flynn's lawyer also approached the FBI with the same offer.  A common view among the media and pundits seems to be that Flynn's move is a sign of weakness—that he is legitimately scared of prosecution and looking for protection. But that may not be the best read of the publicly-known facts. Alex Whiting at Just Security has outlined a procedural reason to think that Flynn is not making a serious overture to criminal enforcement authorities: his lawyer is not behaving in the way that an experienced defense attorney would if truly intent on a deal with prosecutors and the FBI. In that case, seeking a private proffer session, not making a splashy public announcement, would be the right way to proceed.  Flynn and his lawyers may actually think that he has a rather low chance of being successfully prosecuted. There are a number of reasons why that could be so. And if that is right, Flynn's actions might be best understood as a smart play by someone seeking a clear win, rather than a desperate attempt to minimize losses.   Who Would Indict Flynn, and for What? While the FBI is headed by someone (Director James Comey) who seems genuinely committed to getting to the bottom of the Russia-Trump mess, the FBI can only recommend criminal charges. Prosecutors at the Department of Justice are the ones who decide. But while Attorney General Jeff Sessions—like Flynn, a member of Donald Trump's inner circle during the campaign—has recused himself from "from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States,” that arguably does not cover the crimes with which Flynn might be charged. Based on what is now publicly known, Flynn seems to have the most criminal exposure about three matters. First, he might be charged under the false statements statute with lying to the FBI about his December communications with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States. But that communication occurred over a month after the campaign ended. (And in any event, FBI sources have told the press that charges are unlikely, seemingly because of Flynn's ability to muddy the waters by parsing what he was asked and what he said.) Second, Flynn may have some criminal exposure under the Foreign Agents Registration Act for his dealings last year with the Turkish government. But that occurred in his capacity as a private consultant, working through his company Flynn Intel Group. Of course, clients likely sought him out because of his close ties to the Republican nominee for president, but that does not mean the actions are campaign-related. Third, some have raised the issue of whether Flynn truthfully disclosed on his SF86 security clearance form payments he received from Russian-government linked entities during 2015. Lies on this form can be prosecuted, again under the false statements statute. But this does not seem to be clearly campaign-related; for instance, Flynn was apparently paid for giving a speech at a gala dinner in Russia. So Jeff Sessions might well be the ultimate decisionmaker on whether Michael Flynn is criminally charged. If he is, I would bet good money that Flynn gets a pass—all the more so because FARA violations and problems on security clearance forms are rarely pursued criminally. That is, Sessions would have a plausible-sounding story to tell that criminal prosecution is not the correct resolution. If Sessions is not the decisionmaker—either because he broadens his recusal or because Flynn's criminal exposure concerns campaign-related matters within the scope of the existing recusal—the Deputy Attorney General will be in charge. Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, that will be Rod Rosenstein, a respected career prosecutor who is currently United States Attorney for the District of Maryland. Rosenstein was put in that position by President George W. Bush, who also tried to seat him on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Because this White House seems to prize loyalty to President Trump above all else—and has blocked senior appointments sought by cabinet members like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when the nominee was thought insufficiently Trumpist—Rosenstein will have to affirmatively prove that he is willing to aggressively and independently go after a key Trump ally.   The Pardon Power Even if DOJ indicted Flynn, or was seen to be moving in that direction, Flynn could appeal to his former boss, President Trump, for a pardon. The Supreme Court has confirmed that a pardon issued under the president's Article II constitutional power can be preemptive—coming before charges are filed. And a pardon can also be a blanket one—covering any possible crimes that may have been committed. President Gerald Ford famously issued a pre-prosecution blanket pardon to Richard Nixon. DOJ has an office that, in the ordinary course, processes and advises the president on pardon applications. While this office has its own rules and standards, a president may choose to disregard all of that. Trump's doing so in order to protect Flynn (and hence himself and other members of his orbit) would of course produce a firestorm of criticism and cries of cover up. But if there is any president who seems willing to ignore considerations of probity and propriety, it's Trump. (See Ben Wittes and Quinta Jurecic on the president's character.) Trump is already on record, via Twitter, supporting Flynn by calling the investigations of him a "witch hunt." Trump also publicly praised Flynn as "a wonderful man" who had been treated "very, very unfairly"—after having fired him. The White House could even claim a sort of precedent for a Flynn pardon. President George H.W. Bush pardoned six people implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal. Bush had been Vice President during the events in question, was a potential witness in criminal cases against his former colleagues, and was believed by the independent counsel investigating the matter, Lawrence Walsh, to have been intentionally obstructionist. Walsh was furious about the pardon and accused Bush of perpetrating a cover-up. In response, Bush said the independent counsel's prosecutions were merely the "criminalization of policy differences."   Immunity from Congress If it isn't particularly likely—again, based on what is now publicly known—that Flynn will be successfully prosecuted, why go public seeking immunity? The answer is that even relatively narrowly drawn immunity granted by a congressional committee could end up blocking later prosecutions for the full array of misconduct in which Flynn might have engaged. In other words, the prize sought here is very valuable. Congress has the statutory power to grant immunity to witnesses testifying before either house or a committee or subcommittee of either house. The Attorney General (or, if recused, the person acting in his or her stead) can delay the issuance of the court order granting immunity, but cannot block it. Congress has a practice of coordinating with law enforcement and prosecutors about immunity grants, but nothing in the law requires this. As the Senate Intelligence Committee has rebuffed the immunity request, Flynn is probably hoping that House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes, who already appears to be solidly in the tank for Trump on the Russia matter, will offer him broad immunity. But the statute requires that a congressional committee approve the request for immunity "by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the full committee." The committee has thirteen Republican and nine Democratic members, so Nunes would need to hold together his Republicans and pick up two Democrats. Flynn would have to offer pretty interesting testimony to get two Democrats to go along with this—something much more than a bare promise of "a story to tell." It's not impossible to imagine this happening, however. The stakes in the Russia-Trump inquiries are enormous, for the country and for the two political parties. There may well be Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee who decide that whether Michael Flynn serves a year or two in jail or not is much less important than getting to the bottom of what happened. It's probably a long shot, though, for Flynn, to get immunity from one of the intelligence committees in the near term. Democrats will probably want to get a better sense of what the FBI is uncovering and what other witnesses besides Flynn are saying before offering immunity to a key player like Flynn. But there's no downside to trying for Flynn, and the upside for him is potentially large.   The Iran-Contra Immunity Fiasco The immunity statute grants only "use immunity." An immunized witness before Congress does not get blanket immunity for the entire transaction about which he or she testifies. Rather, no testimony under the court order granting congressionally-requested immunity, "or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony," "may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order." Why seek such apparently limited use immunity from Congress? In practice, use immunity can turn into full transactional immunity. It turns out that it can be devilishly difficult for prosecutors in a later criminal case to prove that no evidence they are presenting was "directly or indirectly derived" from immunized testimony before Congress. The prosecutions of Oliver North and John Poindexter for Iran-Contra crimes fell apart in just this way. Both were granted use immunity by a select congressional committee investigating Iran-Contra, and the public testimony under the immunity grants was televised. In the later criminal prosecutions, the D.C. Circuit ruled that protecting the defendants' Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination essentially required the prosecution to affirmatively demonstrate that none of its witnesses were in any way affected by that testimony. This proved impossible. Witnesses can compound the problems for prosecutors by ranging widely in their immunized congressional testimony. If Flynn were immunized by Congress, it would be for testimony about Russia. But a friendly House committee member, say Chairman Nunes, might lead him to talk about his potentially illegal work for Turkey, thereby extending the immunity in practice to that topic. There will surely be more public revelations about these matters in the days and weeks to come, revelations that could entirely change what we think we know now. But at present, it does not seem likely to me that Flynn is seeking immunity from the congressional committees because he and his lawyers apprehend a clear and present danger of jail time. Flynn seems rather to be seeking to gain maximum advantage from the congressional committees' and public's legitimate interest in his testimony, and the possibility that Republicans on the House committee might be willing to use their power to help protect him. If House Republicans do this, it will likely be because they assume that Flynn, even though he would be testifying under oath and could not avoid being questioned by Democrats, would do his very best to give testimony that was favorable to President Trump.

Ogg April 1, 2017 9:20 am EDT Print Email Tweet With Friday having been the last trading day of March and the first quarter, it was a rather busy week. The Dow was up over 5% and the S&P 500 was up over 6% so far in 2017, coming into Friday. What cannot be ignored is that investors have continued to buy market pullbacks in an eight-year bull market, and those same investors are looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week, which this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls over the course of each week. Our goal is to find new ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, and the week of March 31 brought some significant upside targets in analyst upgrades and initiations with solid Buy and Outperform ratings in major technology stocks. For some balance, investors should keep in mind that the calendar is entering a time where the markets might need a breather and when technology stocks are facing a slower three to four months ahead on a historical basis. These were some of the top technology analyst calls for the week of March 27 to March 31, 2017: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was started with a Buy rating and assigned a $1,100 price target at Loop Capital on March 31. It was given a similar upside target at Barclays this week as well, and Amazon saw its price target raised at Stifel from $912 to $1,025. Shares traded Friday at $886.54, in a 52-week range of $585.25 to $890.35. The consensus target price is $948.61. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) hit a new high this week, and UBS has outlined how Apple shares could hit $200. What is amazing here is that the UBS price target is not even at the highest of the analyst universe. Instinet raised its Apple price target to $165 from $135. Needham raised its Apple target price to $165 from $150 during the last week of March. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) was started as Outperform with a $265 price target (versus a $220.04 prior close) at Macquarie on March 31. Analysts have been raising their expectations for Broadcom in recent weeks, and its shares ended trading at $218.96 on Friday. Its 52-week range is $139.18 to $227.75. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Goldman Sachs on March 30. It also was raised to Outperform from In-Line and the target price was raised to $60 from $51 (versus a $49.04 prior close) at Evercore ISI on March 29. CyberArk shares closed trading at $50.87 on Friday, and its 52-week range is $37.00 to $59.28. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ: FTNT) was raised to Outperform from Neutral and the target price was raised to $50 from $38 (versus a $36.56 close) at Robert W. Baird on March 29. Fortinet has a 52-week range of $28.08 to $38.56, and its stock was trading at $38.35 on Friday’s close. Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ: GRPN) also gets grouped in with the tech stocks, but it is perhaps a misnomer due to social-couponing for retail spending. Groupon was started with a Buy rating and assigned a $5 price target (versus a $3.99 prior close) at Citigroup. The 52-week range is $2.92 to $5.94, and a consensus analyst price target is $4.91. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was started with an Outperform rating and assigned a $40 price target (versus a $35.75 prior close) at Macquarie on March 31. Intel has a 52-week range of $29.50 to $38.45 and a consensus analyst target of $40.03. Red Hat Inc. (NYSE: RHT) saw its price target raised to $98 from $95 at RBC Capital Markets after the company reported one the strongest quarters in recent years as billings jumped. BMO also raised its price target on the shares to $90 from $75. Those targets compare with the current Wall Street consensus target of $87.16. The 52-week trading range was $68.54 to $85.01. The stock closed Monday at $82.20, and shares were trading almost 5% higher in the premarket at that time. Red Hat shares ended the week at $86.50, and its new 52-week high after solid earnings is now $87.91. Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) falls under tech due to its social media efforts, but some of us think of it as a waste of time more than anything. The analysts came out on March 27 with their post-IPO coverage after the quiet period had ended. Many of the underwriting firms were far more positive than the independent analysts who said to sell Snap (should you be surprised?). Cowen, Morgan Stanley, RBC, Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and more firms were among the positive analyst calls. More key analyst calls and research reports have been seen as follows: SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has five reasons to keep buying the top chip stocks. Merrill Lynch has six top software picks to buy now. Seven stocks with over 50% to 100% upside from recent analyst calls.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory It’s been a busy Saturday on Twitter for President Donald Trump, who is not golfing at his Mar-a-Lago resort this weekend, with the president now pushing a Friday evening report on Fox News stating he was spied upon before being elected. In a two-part tweet, Trump wrote, “Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news. Source: “Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated.” If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.” It would appear that Trump — who did not provide a link — is pointing at a report from Fox News on Friday evening under the heading, “Intelligence official who ‘unmasked’ Trump associates is ‘very high up,’ source says.” According to the report, “Intelligence and House sources with direct knowledge of the disclosure of classified names told Fox News that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., now knows who is responsible — and that person is not in the FBI.” The report notes that the information came from “a congressional source close to the investigation.” It was just weeks ago that the president opened up a can of worms with an explosive series of Saturday morning tweets accusing former President Barack Obama of personally having a hand in wiretapping Trump Tower. That accusation has since been shot down by congressional investigators and the FBI. Those claims were also based upon something that the president saw on Fox News.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is a Rotten Apple Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Without a doubt, if ever there was a candidate for a „Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” stock, it would be Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMD ). Source: Shutterstock Not long ago, on a CNBC roundtable segment, an analyst proposed a „buy” recommendation on AMD stock. The other pundits laughed. And then they laughed some more. When the humor appeared to fade, they laughed again, just for good measure. It took a while, but the joke was ultimately on the naysayers. Last year was a stunning turnaround for Advanced Micro Devices. From start to finish, AMD stock returned long-suffering shareholders more than 300% in profits. To put that into perspective, 2016 was the biggest year in its publicly traded existence. More impressively, AMD eclipsed the performance of 2009, when several stocks were clawing back from 2008’s devastation. What’s particularly endearing for both present stakeholders and prospective buyers is that Advanced Micro Devices is not slowing down. For 2017, AMD stock is up just shy of 30%. That’s enough for a very solid year for most people’s portfolios. In fact, if it keeps up this work rate, AMD could challenge for yet another triple-digit return. That would make consecutive triple-digit returns, something that hasn’t happened for AMD stock since 1982 and 1983. Although the prospect for a history-making event is extremely enticing for investors, we also have to remember the risks. Advanced Micro Devices has long played second-fiddle to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) for a reason. It also gave a foothold for semiconductor rivals like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The question is, which AMD will show up this time around? Many Reasons to Love AMD Stock Certainly, I can respect the idea of Advanced Micro Devices pulling off another upset. It’s running high on momentum, and sometimes, that’s all you really need. But as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli asserts, other substantive factors are working in favor of AMD stock. Having a strong business is all about people. And AMD has a powerhouse leadership , starting from the top. At the helm is CEO Lisa Su, a phenomenal executive who has a doctorate’s degree in electrical engineering from MIT. She has also served in high-level positions at renowned firms Freescale Semiconductor Ltd (NYSE: FSL ) and International Business Machines Corp . (NYSE: IBM ). Along with great people are products. Historically, this is one area that has tripped up AMD stock. Although, it’s always been cheaper in price compared to rival Intel’s offerings, AMD semiconductors have wrestled with the quality stigma. The company hopes to change that with its Ryzen CPU series. Imbued with the latest technological firepower, it can legitimately challenge Intel for the throne. True to its heritage, the AMD units are priced lower than the competition. As Su succinctly states, „More performance, half the price.” Finally, the broader fundamentals are supportive of AMD stock. The supply glut that gutted the semiconductor industry is easing, facilitating recoveries of left-for-dead tech firms. Don’t Look Under the Hood! As great as the bullish argument for AMD stock is, I still have my doubts. No one doubts the abilities of Advanced Micro Devices’ CEO, but Su is a genius, not a miracle worker. In this case, the problem is bigger than her or anyone else. Last time around, I mentioned that AMD stock has shifted from one state of distress to another. This assessment was based on the venerable Altman Z-Score indicator. And although it’s improving in this department, AMD has been distressed for the past six consecutive years. But the fine print is in which specific factors AMD is improving, and not improving. The Z-Score is aggregated from a list of five factors. By far, the largest improvement is in the ratio between „market value of equity” and „book value of total liabilities.” Although important, this doesn’t tell us much about company performance. What does illuminate performance are the Z-Score’s earnings and sales generation factors. For both metrics, AMD stock is still considered distressed. That likely won’t change until the semiconductor firm can address the deep-seated problems that got it in trouble initially. As a small caveat, I do think that the recovery in AMD stock is nothing short of remarkable. It might have some legs to go a little bit further. But to stake a major position on the back of exceptionally poor fundamentals? I’m crazy, but I’m not that crazy. As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace The post Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

"Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news. Source: 'Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated,'" Trump wrote in tweets. "If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.," he added. ADVERTISEMENT Fox reported Friday, citing a single unnamed source, that the U.S. official was "very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world." The report said the individual behind the alleged unmasking or naming of private citizens in intelligence reports was not in the FBI. An unnamed congressional source told Fox that "the main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election." Trump has pushed for evidence of surveillance of members of his team on the part of the Obama administration after FBI Director James Comey and others said there was no evidence to support his claim early last month that former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaDNC chairman: Republicans 'don't give a s--- about people' Haley: Trump hasn't stopped me from 'beating up on Russia' Don't look now: Hillary's back MORE ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said last month that he had learned that the U.S. intelligence community had incidentally collected information on members of Trump's transition team. The New York Times reported that two White House officials had helped him get the information that he later used to brief Trump. Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffMaxine Waters 'glad' Flynn hasn't gotten immunity Sunday shows preview: McConnell, Schumer face off ahead of Gorsuch fight Pelosi: Nunes situation 'brings dishonor' to House intel panel MORE (Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said Friday that he was shown what was presented as the same information shown to Nunes last week. Schiff said the information didn't justify a "departure from normal review procedures" and called for the information to be shared with both House and Senate committees investigating Russia's involvement in the November election. Trump has made a habit of sharing news he views as favorable, even from outlets that he criticizes, such as The New York Times. The president shared an article from the "failing" newspaper on Saturday that detailed ObamaCare's struggles. Tags Barack Obama Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News Dow Jones Industrial Average Nabs Sixth Straight Quarterly Win Shutterstock photo The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  spent the entire session trading lower, weighed down by a sharp decline for energy stock Exxon Mobil — even as oil prices recovered from earlier losses. Following this morning’s strong inflation data, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard took a more dovish tone than his fellow central bankers, saying, „This is not an environment where the data is screaming at the Fed that you have to move.” While this pressured bank stocks — and the S&P 500 Index ( SPX ) — a late-session burst of selling pressure had the Nasdaq Composite (COMP)  snapping its five-session winning streak. Despite the lower finish, the major U.S. benchmarks all notched impressive quarterly gains, with the Dow’s sixth straight quarterly win its longest streak since 2006.

The drug stock that plunged 25% on Parkinson’s patent woes.  The $4 million options trade on Lowe’s stock. Plus, a rare batch of options bulls bet on UnitedHealth; BlackBerry earnings impress; and an unusual bearish brokerage note for this airline stock. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA – 20,663.22) gave back 65.3 points, or 0.3%, paring its weekly advance to 0.3%. XOM’s 2% drop paced the 21 other Dow decliners, while Intel stock led the nine advancers with its 0.9% gain. For the month, the Dow shed 0.7% — its first monthly decline since October — but surged 4.6% in the first quarter. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX – 2,362.72) closed the session down 5.3 points, or 0.2%, and the week up 0.8%. While the SPX slipped 0.04% in March, its 5.5% first-quarter gain marked its best quarter since 2015. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP – 5,911.74)  swung to a 2.6-point, or 0.04%, loss in the final minutes of trading, but maintained a 1.4% weekly lead. While the COMP added 1.5% in March, its 9.8% first-quarter gain made it the index’s best quarter since 2013. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX – 12.37) added 0.8 point, or 7.2%. While the market’s „fear gauge” slipped 4.6% on the week and 4.3% on the month, it surrendered 11.9% in the first quarter. 5 Items on Our Radar Today SpaceX successfully launched a used rocket into space last night — a historical feat for the aerospace industry. According to CEO Elon Musk, „It means you can fly and refly an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket. This is going to be, ultimately, a huge revolution in spaceflight.”  (The Verge) South African President Jacob Zuma ousted Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan — sending mining stocks lower and the rand tumbling against the U.S. dollar. This came as part of a broader shift in the country’s cabinet, and signals growing political upheaval.   (MarketWatch) Despite uncertainty surrounding Republicans’ attempts at another Obamacare repeal , UnitedHealth stock saw a rare surge in call buying today. BlackBerry turned in an impressive fourth-quarter earnings report, sending BBRY stock to levels not seen since September. Though most analysts are bullish toward Alaska Air Group,  ALK stock saw its price target lowered at Imperial Capital today. Data courtesy of  Trade-Alert Commodities Oil prices extended their newfound lead over $50, even after data showed the U.S. rig count climbed for an eleventh straight week. By the close, May-dated crude was up 25 cents, or 0.5%, $50.60 per barrel, and 5.4% higher on the week. For the month, however, crude oil gave back 6.3%, and shed 5.8% on the quarter. June-dated gold futures closed the session up $3.20, or 0.3%, at $1,251.20 an ounce, bringing their week-over-week advance to 0.2%. In March, the malleable metal shed 0.2%, but jumped 8.1% in the first quarter. Get your daily dose of Dow futures, stock news, and more with Schaeffer’s Opening View .

One of our greatest sources for news and laughter, Stephen Colbert, is the gold standard of comedy, satire that parallel's America's Trump-reality. In this sketch, he plays both interviewer and a deep-voiced 'mystery' source who has access to this leaky sieve on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. COLBERT: What's the mood in the White House these days? SOURCE: Panic. Complete panic! The staff is scared for their jobs. COLBERT: Are they really scared they're going to lose them? SOURCE: No, they're scared they're going to keep them. The insanely unethical and unorthodox conduct of The House Intel Committee's chair, Devin Nunes is certainly warranted. Stephen doesn't exactly hold back either. COLBERT: Devin Nunes claims to have a secret source in the White House, who The New York Times caims to have revealed. Are they right? SOURCE: No Stephen. Devin Nunes' secret source is Devin Nunes. COLBERT: Wait? You're saying he got this information from himself? Does he have two personalities? SOURCE: No. I'm not sure he has one personality. But he does sneak off to secure locations, and then, when he's alone, he draws lipstick on his hand and interrogates it. The conversation devolves into how Nunes acquires his intel, more specifically, he pulls it from his posterior. The source also remarks on the 'Eyes Wide Shut' parties that go on in the White House. He admits that Steve Bannon looks better 'in a mask, and wearing pants, because there are some things you cannot unsee.' Stephen inquires about Trump and Melania's marital problems and the source reveals that the problem is that 'they are married to each other.' However it helps to maintain 'separate bedrooms if you live in separate cities.' They joke about Trump taking responsibility for the failure of the AHCA, and admit that of course, he still blames Paul Ryan. Roughly two weeks ago, Trump mentioned that 'we could expect some very interesting information coming to the forefront,' and he asks his 'source' what that might be. ↓ Story continues below ↓ SOURCE: He swallowed his keys and they'll be coming to the forefront soon. He ate a lot of oat bran today. Naturally, the joke comes full circle as it appears that Trump and Nunes are both pulling things straight from their rears.

But, despite the recriminations, there is still a way for them to grab victory from the jaws of defeat. The House healthcare bill failed because it was too complex, combining too many controversial provisions. Its sponsors didn't spend the time or make the effort to explain, in clear terms, how it would work. Most voters neither trusted nor understood it. When a bill turns off conservatives, moderates and liberals, somebody needs to start over. ADVERTISEMENT A Quinnipiac University poll showed that only 17 percent of voters supported the Ryan plan, with only 14 percent of independents favoring it. Another poll by PPP, a Democratic-oriented outfit, found that only 55 percent of Republican voters, 32 percent of independents and 5 percent of Democrats would prefer the GOP House leadership's American Health Care Act over ObamaCare.   So what do Republicans do now? Should they let the whole issue die and then blame Democrats for the consequences, as President Trump mischievously suggested? It's up to them, of course. But that strategy is loaded with pitfalls, in addition to cold-blooded cynicism. For starters, it doesn't give GOP voters what they were promised. A new Reuters poll shows that 80 percent of Republicans still want to repeal ObamaCare. The other problem is that ObamaCare may not implode and, even if it does, it may not be a Big Bang. It may happen in slow motion over years, and that would destroy the political rationale for the strategy. Republicans need fresh thinking. Instead of throwing everything into one, big, complicated, hard-to-understand healthcare reform bill — as has been the practice since President Bill ClintonBill ClintonHow Republicans can still reform healthcare Chelsea Clinton dismisses rumors she'll run for public office: report Trump seeks to stop lawsuit from ‘Apprentice’ contestant MORE and first lady Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonDon't look now: Hillary's back Yes, Marine Le Pen can win in France. Here's how. How Republicans can still reform healthcare MORE tried that in the early 1990s — they need to streamline their tactics. A smart approach for them — one that gives the GOP base what it wants and follows a sensible route to getting there — is to split ObamaCare repeal from replacement, and then to propose multiple, single-object bills to handle replacement issues. The first step would be to repeal ObamaCare as soon as possible, but to push back the effective date of the repeal to a year from now. This gives Congress time to shape, sell and pass legislation to smooth the transition from ObamaCare and to open the door for new ideas, including free-market approaches that conservatives have always wanted. The next step for the GOP leadership would be to introduce a package of separate — emphasis on "separate" — bills that tackle a range of replacement issues. One bill, for example, could continue the policies for preexisting conditions and dependents up to 26 years of age, the prohibitions on lifetime insurance limits, and the restrictions on charging older Americans more. Democrats would be hard-pressed to vote against these wildly popular provisions that they have supported in the past. A second bill could expand health savings accounts, which is something Republicans have advocated. A third bill could deal with subsidies for premium and out-of-pocket medical expenses, perhaps offering tax credits to offset some of them. A fourth could deal with Medicaid expansion. It would be good for Congress to vote up or down on each of these proposals. It would sidetrack the blame game and draw clearer, more understandable policy lines. It would also extract both Republicans and Democrats from the single "all-or-nothing" box that ObamaCare put them in and Ryan's bill perpetuated. Most importantly, it would likely produce the best policies for healthcare. By dividing replacement of ObamaCare into separate issues, it may also bring Democrats into the process and make both parties more responsible for the outcome. Republicans would benefit by disrupting the Democratic strategy of killing everything with a Trump or GOP label. Democrats, especially senators who face reelection next year in states that voted for Trump by wide margins, would benefit by not having to always be the party of "no." Admittedly, drafting separate bills on these often-related issues would not be an easy task, but it can and should be done. After this plan is set in place, the GOP would need to mount a major public information campaign explaining them. As former Speaker Newt Gingrich has wisely advised, "The number one goal of any health reform must be to communicate with the American people and convince them this will provide a much better future than the current system." Whether you agree or not with either side's policies, this cleaner and simpler approach would break the mold of business as usual and show that Congress can get something done. If the legislative process can't be perfect — and it won't ever be — it should at least be logical.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" NAS FTW If you use a PC stick for streaming you (really) need to get a NAS By Richard Devine Tuesday, Mar 28, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 14 Comments If you use a PC stick for media streaming, you should pair it up with a NAS (Network Attached Storage) drive for a complete package. There are a number of reasons you might use a PC stick as a front end for your media consumption, such as size, low price and the fact that it runs Windows 10. The very idea that something is powered by Windows means you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to the software and hardware you can use. Being the most popular desktop OS on the planet has its advantages. If you're currently or thinking of using a small PC stick as a media center, the best thing you can pair it up with is a NAS drive. Here's what you need to know. Why use a NAS? A PC stick is a tiny computer, and for that reason you're extremely limited on what will actually fit inside of it. With all the bits a PC needs to actually run squeezed in with an HDMI output and a couple of external ports, you're not going to find huge specs. There are some options, such as Intel's Core m powered Compute Sticks, that take it up a notch. But for the most part, you're limited when it comes to storage and processing power. To house your own media library, just use a NAS and host it elsewhere. It's a more elegant solution than hosting it all on another PC, and you can still access your files from any other computers or mobile devices in your home. It's also a much more efficient way to organize your library, especially if it's large, compared to just plugging in a thumb drive or a microSD card to a PC stick directly. You'll get the best overall performance from your PC by just allowing it to be the streamer. Getting up and running with a NAS isn't as scary as it sounds, and there are lots of consumer-friendly options out there to choose from. Thankfully for you, we've got a roundup of the ones that are worth your time: The best NAS drives. Great software for Windows media streaming Besides being able to hook into Netflix, Groove, Microsoft's own Movies & TV app and many more services besides, Windows has some excellent media centers to choose from. Three that are definitely worth your attention are Plex, Emby and Kodi. All of them are available to download from the Windows Store, and after you've done the initial setup work of pointing your chosen one to where your media lives, it's easy street from there. Kodi even allows for Plex integration as well as OneDrive and a whole lot more. All options are fairly friendly to the big screen, too, which is good, but if you're using Plex it might be worth checking out the Plex Media Player application for Windows. It's designed as a big-screen-friendly front-end for Plex, making it easier to navigate on the TV. Plex Media Player is a separate download than the Windows 10 app, and it's available on the official Plex site.

You may have just upgraded your computer to use DDR4 recently or you may still be using DDR3, but in either case, nothing stays new forever. JEDEC, the organization in charge of defining new standards for computer memory, says that it will be demoing the next-generation DDR5 standard in June of this year and finalizing the standard sometime in 2018. DDR5 promises double the memory bandwidth and density of DDR4, and JEDEC says it will also be more power-efficient, though the organization didn't release any specific numbers or targets. Like DDR4 back when it was announced, it will still be several years before any of us have DDR5 RAM in our systems. That's partly because the memory controllers in processors and SoCs need to be updated to support DDR5, and these chips normally take two or three years to design from start to finish. DDR4 RAM was finalized in 2012, but it didn't begin to go mainstream until 2015 when consumer processors from Intel and others added support for it. DDR5 has no relation to GDDR5, a separate decade-old memory standard used for graphics cards and game consoles. RAM isn't going anywhere in the near future, but if you look ahead a few years, you can see a potentially RAM-free future looming. Intel's Optane drives are attempting to combine the capacity, density, and non-volatility of an SSD with speed that is beginning to approach RAM's—first-generation Optane drives have about 10 times higher latency according to Intel, but that's not so far off the mark for many workloads. As the technology improves, it may well remove the need for separate pools of RAM and storage, triggering a fundamental shift in the way that computing devices work. For now, though, bring on the faster RAM.         LATEST STORIES (7) Syria: More Gunmen, Family Members Leave Homs for Idlib Syrian Army Expands Control over More Areas in Northern Hama Syrian Army Drives Al-Nusra Terrorists out of Khattab Village North of Hama More Photos of Syrian Gov't Soldiers in Recently Liberated City of Deir Hafer Syrian Army in Fierce Clashes with Terrorists, Northwest of Hama Syrian Gov't Forces Evacuate Civilians from War Zone during Offensive in Northern Hama Iraqi Security Forces Search Western Mosul Houses for ISIL Terrorists No Major US Shift: The Real Goal of Trump’s War on ISIL Is Regime Change in Syria Unconfirmed Arab Media Reports: Iran's Major General Qassem Soleimani in Syria's Hama for Major Assault on Al-Qaeda Iran Commemorates Islamic Republic Day Israeli Forces Shoot, Injure Palestinian Teenager with Live Ammunition in Ramallah Interior Ministry: Iraqi Forces to Liberate Mosul from ISIL by End of Spring Hundreds of Al-Nusra Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Operation in Hama Syrian Armed Forces Hit Terrorists' Positions Heavily in Hama Province Syrian Army Units Shoot Down 2 Attack Drones of Terrorists in Lattakia Syria: More Gunmen, Family Members Leave Homs for Idlib TEHRAN (FNA)- A sum of 400 gunmen and their family members left al-Wa'er district in the Northwestern outskirts of Homs city for militant-held regions in Idlib province.

Morning Joe Fascinated by That Report of Steve Bannon Destroying a Jacuzzi With Acid Report: Senate Intelligence Committee Rejects Immunity Deal With Michael Flynn Flynn Last Year: ‘When You Are Given Immunity, That Means That You've Probably Committed a Crime’ EXCLUSIVE: High Profile Attorney Gloria Allred Under State Bar Investigation for Possible Misconduct video ‘Russia Has Properties Here, Like the White House’: Bill Maher Faces Off with Roger Stone by Josh Feldman | 2:30 am, April 1st, 2017   Bill Maher faced off with Roger Stone on his show Friday night over the allegations of collusion between Russia and people in President Trump‘s orbit. Stone said there’s no evidence yet, and Maher brought up what House Intel Democrats recently spoke out about––that Stone tweeted about John Podesta before the email dump and that Stone was in contact with Guccifer 2.0. Stone reiterated that he was “maligned” by those Democrats and wants to be able to testify to push back against what they were saying. Maher also confronted him about claims made by the Trump family about Russian connections. He pointed to contradictory statements made by Trump’s two sons about whether their business has assets in Russia or not, even saying that “Russia has properties here, like the White House.” Watch above, via HBO.

We can't talk about how Ryzen 5 CPUs perform yet, but we can show you what we'll be using to test them. It's a box. There's a pair of CPUs in it. The Ryzen 5 1500X has a Wraith Spire cooler in the box with it, hence the much larger package. Here's the Wraith Spire in its non-RGB LED form, next to a Haswell or similar-era Intel stock cooler. AMD also sent along the Wraith Max RGB LED-illuminated cooler. You can't buy this cooler or get it with a CPU in stores, but prebuilt Ryzen systems with fancier CPUs inside will probably come with this heatsink installed. This is Gigabyte's handsome AB350-Gaming 3 motherboard, our B350 pick for AM4 CPUs from our most recent System Guide. AMD also sent along a kit of this outrageously-tall GeIL EVO X DDR4-3200 RGB LED-illuminated RAM. Critically, these are DDR4-3200 single-rank DIMMs rated for 16-16-16-36 timings. Ryzen CPUs can't reach those high memory speeds with dual-rank DIMMs right now. Seriously, look at how big these things are. I'll probably be seeing a lot of them as I test this Ryzen 5 duo.

Carolyn Kaster, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Michael Flynn, President Trump’s first National Security Adviser who resigned after 24 days on the job, failed initially to disclose payments he received from Russian-linked firms, financial disclosure forms released by the Trump administration on Saturday reveal.  In the initial filing submitted in February, Flynn does not list payments from RT, the Russian state-owned television station or other Russian-backed firms. In an amended disclosure filed Friday, Flynn lists a number of Russian-backed companies - including RT - and notes he received speaking fees.  What is congressional immunity? In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn’s lawyer told the Associated Press that the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Play Video CBSN Lawmakers want Michael Flynn to testify without immunity Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is facing mounting pressure to testify about what he knows about possible connections between the ... Flynn has long been dogged by allegations of receiving money from Russia. In March, Democrats on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released documents in mid-March revealing Flynn was paid a fee $45,000 by RT for a speech in Moscow in 2015. At the GOP convention in July 2016, Flynn had denied Moscow had funded the RT speech, telling Yahoo’s Michael Isikoff that he “didn’t take any money from Russia, if that’s what you’re asking me.” “Well then, who paid you?” inquired Isikoff. “My speakers’ bureau,” Flynn said. “Ask them.” However, a speakers’ bureau is just an agency, a conduit for payments by parties interested in . Russia would have paid the speakers’ bureau, which would have taken its cut, and then passed on the rest of the payment to Flynn. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner told the Associated Press that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version.

Flynn also disclosed a speaking engagement from a Turkish businessman. Since his high-profile departure from the Trump administration, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying Flynn as a foreign agent and acknowledged his work for a businessman with close ties to the Turkish government. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said he didn’t believe Flynn’s lobbying work was known by the Trump administration during his tenure there. The bulk of Flynn’s income comes from his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., where he is listed as the chairman. Upon joining the Trump administration, Flynn had said he would dissolve his companies, and his lawyer said he did shut down Flynn Intel in Nov. 2016. His financial disclosure forms reveal he had positions at 11 companies. Flynn also listed work as an FBI consultant. Flynn has been back in the headlines this week as the Senate intelligence committee has begun to hold hearings in its investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Flynn’s lawyer said Thursday that Flynn would be willing to testify if he was offered immunity - and Mr. Trump seemed to implicitly back that idea, calling the investigations a “witch hunt.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments. In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn’s lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Flynn’s recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Flynn’s business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia’s state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies. The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump’s campaign. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.

That Trump Tower server was communicating regularly with the Russia-based Alfa Bank. The FISA surveillance warrant granted last October was designed in part to find out why, and if the server indicated improper ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, Mensch reported last November. This week, however, Mensch updated her earlier reporting with a new analysis which, in a report published Saturday on her Patribotics blog, indicates that the server may have been receiving stolen data, including hacked United States voter information. That information, Mensch writes, was then used by the Trump campaign and the sophisticated “audience targeting” firm that it used, Cambridge Analytica, to direct Russian-created propaganda “fake news” campaigns at specific voters Trump needed to sway in order to win the 2016 presidential election. In other words, according to Mensch, the Trump campaign received information stolen by Russian hackers via a Trump Tower server, then used that information to guide Russian disinformation agents in publishing “fake news” stories on Facebook — fake news propaganda designed to help Trump win the election by targeting specific voter groups. Alfa Bank is one of the largest financial institutions in Russia and is closely tied to Russian president Vladimir Putin, according to the New York Times.

(Image By Evan Vucci) Financial documents released by the White House on Saturday revealed Trump’s campaign CEO and now top “strategic adviser,” Steve Bannon, collected six-figure “consulting” fees from Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 campaign, and served as the company’s vice president and secretary. The use of Facebook to micro-target voters, according to Mensch’s analysis, was linked to a massive theft of Facebook user data carried out by a lecturer at Britain’s Cambridge University named Aleksandr Kogan, who has since changed his name to Aleksandr Spectre, according to an investigative report published Thursday by The Intercept. Kogan collected the Facebook data on behalf of a contractor known as Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL, which has an “election division” which promises clients “data-driven messaging… delivering electoral success.” Cambridge Analytica is a subsidiary of SCL. “In order to perfect the social media targeting Russia hacked the electoral voter databases of various key American states,” Mensch wrote. “This information was fed back to (Trump Campaign Manager Paul) Manafort and Cambridge Analytica / SCL via the means of the bank server in Trump Tower. Manafort and Trump used terrifyingly accurate micro-targeting obtained firstly by Facebook theft but secondly by Russia obtaining the exact demographic profiles of voters through hacks of U.S. state databases and passing it back to Cambridge Analytica.” Donald Trump walks out of an executive order signing ceremony on Friday without signing the orders, after reporters peppered him with questions about the Russia scandal. (Image By Pool/Getty Images) According to reporting by Ann Marlowe in Tablet Magazine, Alfa Bank is financially tied to SCL and Cambridge Analytica as well, and Richard Burt, another top Trump adviser, sits on the “senior advisory board” of Alfa Bank. As Mensch concludes, if indeed the Trump Tower server was being used to send hacked and stolen information back and forth to Russia’s Alfa Bank — which Mensch describes as “a front for Russian intelligence” — Trump would be directly connected to Russian “active measures” to meddle in the U.S. election, and help him win it. And if so, she writes, “he will be impeached for it.” MORE DONALD TRUMP RUSSIA SCANDAL STORIES FROM THE INQUISITR Trump Russia Investigation Told To ‘Follow The Trail Of Dead Russians’ Trump Russia Scandal: 2 White House Officials Fed Secret Intel To Devin Nunes Donald Trump Caught On Tape With Russian Spy, New Report Claims James Comey Trump Russia Hearing: 5 Incredible Moments Nobody Is Talking About Trump Russia Hearing: Russians Used ‘Cut Out’ In Leak To Wikileaks — But Who?

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter Imperial Valley News President Trump Restores Confidence in the American Economy Washington, DC - President Trump Restores Confidence in the American Economy: “We’re going to win economically; we’re going to win with the economy.” – Donald J. Trump BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY: Since President Donald J. Trump’s election, economic indicators have responded with record confidence to his pro-growth agenda. Today, the National Association of Manufacturers released its Manufacturers’ Outlook Survey showing the highest level of optimism in 20 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up over 12 percent since Election Day 2016. The Weekly Gallup Economic Confidence Index turned positive shortly after the President’s election and has remained positive for 19 consecutive weeks. The Business Roundtable’s CEO Economic Outlook Index recently jumped 19 points, the largest jump since 2009. The National Association of Home Builders Confidence Index currently is at its highest level in 12 years. The Gallup Small Business Index reflects the most optimistic small business owners have been since July 2007. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index recently soared to its highest level in more than 16 years. The American Dream Index recently rebounded to 100.5, up from a 12-month low point in December, the final full month of the Obama administration. EARLY PROGRESS: In just the first full month of President Trump’s Administration, the United States economy has already made promising strides in the job market. In February, the President’s first full month in office, the U.S economy created 235,000 new jobs. 58,000 new construction jobs were created. 28,000 new manufacturing jobs were created. In February, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent. In February, the U.S. labor force participation rose to 63 percent. In February, long-term unemployment in the U.S. fell by 49,000. IMPLEMENTING JOB CREATING POLICIES: President Trump is executing an agenda that favors the American worker. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum creating the White House Office of American Innovation, which will implement policies and scale proven private-sector models to spur job creation. President Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and negotiations. President Trump initially signed a Presidential Memorandum to clear roadblocks to construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and recently his Administration formally approved the project. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum declaring that the Dakota Access pipeline serves the national interest and is being prepared to be put into service. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to help ensure that new pipeline construction and repair work uses materials and equipment from the United States. CUTTING GOVERNMENT RED TAPE: President Trump has quickly taken steps to get the Government out of the way of job creation. President Trump signed an Energy Independence Executive Order to help eliminate burdensome regulations on America’s energy industry. President Trump directed each agency to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to identify costly and unnecessary regulations in need of modification or repeal. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated. President Trump directed the Department of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers. President Trump signed legislation, House Joint Resolution 38, to prevent the burdensome “Stream Protection Rule” from causing further harm to the coal industry. President Trump ordered the review of the “Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the United States,” known as the WOTUS rule, to evaluate whether it is stifling economic growth or job creation. PARTNER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR: President Trump has worked hand-in-hand with the private sector to get companies re-investing in America. Exxon Mobil Corporation announced a $20 billion investment in the United States, which will create more than 45,000 jobs. Charter Communications announced a $25 billion investment in the United States, and that it will hire 20,000 American workers in the next four years. Accenture announced the creation of 15,000 new high skilled jobs in the next four years and a $1.4 billion investment in training its own employees. Intel announced a $7 billion investment in a new factory in the United States, supporting over 10,000 jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced a $1 billion investment to modernize two plants in the United States, creating 2,000 jobs. General Motors announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States, creating over 1,000 new jobs. Ford announced the cancelation of a plant in Mexico, while adding 700 jobs in Michigan. FOLLOWING THROUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump campaigned on jumpstarting the economic engine of America so businesses could grow and Americans could get back to work. As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised “I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.” As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised “we will make America the best place in the world to start a business; we’ll hire workers, and we’ll open factories.” As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised “we will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations, which are destroying our job-creation capacity.” Prev Next You are here:   Home News President Trump Restores Confidence in the American Economy Main Menu Imperial Valley News News About Us Copyright Infringements Privacy Policy Contact Us Sitemap Web Links Latest News President Trump's Weekly Address to the Nation Director Mick Mulvaney: Transforming President Donald J.

By: AP | Washington | Published:April 2, 2017 9:11 am A financial disclosure filed by former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn shows he earned nearly USD 1.3 million for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a Turkish firm, as well as work for other entities. Flynn filed the financial document yesterday, the day the White House released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn had electronically signed an earlier disclosure in February according to one document. A second filing signed by Flynn was dated Friday but was released Saturday instead of with other administration disclosures. The new disclosure shows that Flynn declared more than USD 827,000 from his work for the Flynn Intel Group. The firm filed as a foreign agent last month to the Justice Department, saying its work likely benefited the government of Turkey.

Ong also said that American firms based here would be affected if the administration led by US president Donald Trump were to punish Malaysia for its low production costs, The Sunday Star reported today. “Perhaps US president Donald Trump does not know there is a huge presence of American manufacturers in Malaysia such as Intel and Western Digital due to the low production cost here,” he was quoted saying. Ong said that 53 per cent of exports to the US were electronics produced by American companies based here, adding that the semi-finished products are then taken back to the US to be assembled there. “If Trump were to punish us for this, the American firms will be the ones dealt a severe blow,” he was quoted saying. It was recently reported that the Trump administration wants to find out countries and goods that are responsible for the US’ US$50 billion trade deficit. Malaysia was named as one of the countries that was “potentially involved.”                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week You are not our appointed moral guardian, Nazri tells Censorship Board MCA: Cabinet never discussed BN’s plan to take over RUU355 Penang hit by floods after heavy downpour PPBM gets cool reception Despite false 'Allah' claim that cost half million, Bata to issue fresh shoe design You are not our appointed moral guardian, Nazri tells Censorship Board MCA: Cabinet never discussed BN’s plan to take over RUU355 Pakatan to register as official coalition WSJ: Former MP, navy chief among Malaysians who had stakes in North Korean firm Despite false 'Allah' claim that cost half million, Bata to issue fresh shoe design Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Ferrari F430 once owned by Trump sells for US$270,000 Donald Trump’s parrot ― Roger Cohen Trump sends letter to Vietnam’s president to promote ties China downplays tensions with US as Xi prepares to meet Trump (VIDEO) Wall Street slips as investors lock in gains of strong quarter Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Project Scorpio revealed A major outlet is ready to officially reveal the specs of the next Xbox, Project Scorpio By Jez Corden Saturday, Apr 1, 2017 at 8:18 pm EDT 26 Comments Jez Corden is a Senior Editor for Windows Central focusing on Xbox. He dropped out of school to play video games — it worked out okay in the end. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram! Well, it's no longer looking like we'll have to wait until E3 2017 to find out what's in the box. A major gaming outlet recently visited Microsoft to take a look at Project Scorpio's internals, ahead of a planned exclusive blowout of coverage. Forza Motorsport 7 was utilized to showcase Scorpio's power, which we revealed recently has been planned for some time as a headline title to exemplify the power of the next Xbox. Forza Motorsport 7 will run at a 4K resolution on Project Scorpio, and if our information is to be believed, it'll look truly stunning. It looks as though Project Scorpio's specifications could be revealed as early as next week, potentially putting an end to long-standing debates over whether it would be using the latest Ryzen CPU tech from AMD, or something a little older. Specifically, we have heard Thursday could be the day all of this comes to pass, but take that with a pinch of salt for now. It looks as though Project Scorpio's specifications could be revealed as early as next week. Either way, Project Scorpio is slated to run at 6 teraflops (TF), putting it at a significant GPU advantage over the Xbox One, and its chief competitor, the 4.2 TF PlayStation 4 Pro. Project Scorpio ditches the Xbox One's ESRAM, picking up 12GB of GDDR5 memory, vs. the Xbox One's 8GB DDR3 and 32MB of static ESRAM. Developers will still have to optimize against the Xbox One's ESRAM, however, as games are not allowed to be exclusive to Scorpio by policy. All titles arriving on Scorpio (save for VR) will also be available on Xbox One, albeit with lower resolutions. We've also heard that Project Scorpio will sport an incredibly "compact" design, owing to advances in cooling. Considering Microsoft is known for cramming powerful hardware into small packages from its Intel-powered Surface tablets, it should come as no surprise that Microsoft is leveraging the full breadth of its industrial design team to make Scorpio as impressive as possible. For instance, we recently outed the fact that Scorpio will also sport an internal power supply, ditching the clunky power bricks of yesteryear. If you're anxious to find out what's next in store for team Xbox, the wait is almost over. Until then, hit the link below for a collection of every scrap of information we've gathered on Project Scorpio so far. Oh, by the way, it's April 2nd where I am, so no, this isn't an April Fool's joke!

Missed the isn't ;) The Scorpio is shaping up to be quite appealing... What a pity the software experience has become utter sh*t in the last two major updates. -9 6 hours ago Reply Avatar of Apathy Does anyone else not like missing the preview tile of the last app that was running anymore? I was trying to close a game last night and couldn't even tell it was still running in the background. 3 6 hours ago Reply DJCBS That's exactly the thing that annoys me the most in the update. I had my cable box connected to the Xbox and several times I'd "minimise" the active tile to check the time or other info. Now not only I can't do that, I get no info whatsoever on the status of that tile, the f*cking ads are even bigger and the amount of wasted space grew even more. Then the Xbox app that had the ability to be used as a controler no longer has it. And then clicking the Xbox button not taking me immediately home but to that stupid side panel.   The people incharge of the Xbox UI are clueless on what they're doing and if they're using the "Beta testers" feedback for it, it's a good example of how terrible a job is done when you get a bunch of fanboys designing things for you. -2 4 hours ago Reply DougB541#CB Not at the cost of resources. I  barely go home now with the new guide and only manual close a game if its frozen or glitched. 2 4 hours ago Reply Avatar of Apathy I think your resources comment just made the point of needing to see what is running in the background essential. I did like the fact that I could have an Edge in kind of a Windowed mode watching a video while looking at my home screen for things, but needing to see if a game that is online is closed and not using band with is a must for some. Hopefully it doesn't do this and I worried for nothing. I don't mind the new menu too much, though they should gave had the ability to double tap to go home and reversed the shortcuts instead of just taking one away. -1 1 hour ago Reply mrpuny I'll play devil's advocate here.  Let me start with your last comment.  I suspect that the reason that Microsoft didn't just switch the behaviors (double tap on Xbox button to go home) is that for any gamers already used to bringing up things like the game DVR controls with the double tap, it would now be bringing them home.  I think Microsoft really had to break this behavior.  Now, to go home it takes the following taps: "Xbox button" -> "A" -> "A" (or left thumbstic to the right in place of the 1st "A").  Takes relearning if you want to go home, but that's by far the less time sensitive act. Second, once you're home, I think you can use the usual controls to see recently running apps and quit them if necessary, more or less like before. A third thing.  In regards to snapping, I think Microsoft has really had to rethink this in the context of being able to bitstream audio to support object based audio systems like Atmos.  Currently, the main focus is on supporting Blu-Ray audio, but I believe these object based audio codecs are working their way into streaming video,and in the future games and eventually new broadcast TV standards.  The thing is that these object based audio streams need to be bitstreamed directly to audio receivers, and that's fundamentally incompatible with how the Xbox One used to work;  it used to have a sound mixer in settings (gone with latest update) where it would decode the game/app/blu-ray audio streams, mix them together, re-encode if necessary and then output the combined audio.  However, that doesn't appear possible with these advanced audio codecs.  At least I'm not aware of any devices of any sort that can decode, mix, and reencode true advanced audio.  I don't know if that's a hardware limitation or a licensing limitation.  But without the ability to do that, it really negates snapping, and also limits the applicability of the current overlay tech.  So I can see why at least some of that has gone away - at least for the time being. 0 23 min ago Reply Dan Harris My biggest problem with the old behaviour was the guide button didn't take you home half the time, it just didn't respond and you had to press it again. At least the button brings up the guide immediately now 0 1 min ago Reply JotaKa A leak by Microsoft ahead of E3 is actually a brilliant move. It pretty much guarantees that they dominate the news media between now and then. 0 6 hours ago Reply Keith Wallace They can't seriously stick with pre-Ryzen cores, can they? For starters, the arch was a giant failure, and its cat cores are part of why this fast hardware refresh is needed. That, and it is not a well-cooled arch, so it makes a lot of sense that Ryzen's vastly improved TDP would be present in a compact device. I don't see how a low profile cooler and a Bulldozer-based CPU run cool. On top of that, going with pre-Ryzen (Kaveri?) would mean a CPU bottleneck no one wants to see. A compromised console sold as the "premium" device would be met with a lot of negative press, I imagine. Personally, Ryzen 3 at the heart would be sensible. Though early announcements are always fun, this might be risky as well. If MS hasn't secured some magic, unknown games for E3, not having Scorpio to unveil could lead to a pretty light conference. 1 6 hours ago Reply kenzibit Damn! this is as solid as my ****! -3 6 hours ago Reply Telling the truth It would explain the use of Vega and Ryse and the incredibly compact design, since Vega is also about to be fully revealed next week, very soon... I mean Scorpio needs to carry those new tech to be atractive in the long run. Im gonna buy it since it comes with Ryse and Vega, if not... not sure. 0 5 hours ago Reply HalfBlackCanadian Hyyyyyype 0 4 hours ago Reply Chemy JMHT So, maybe they are lastly thinking about VR for it, hopefully Oculus Rift compatible. 1 3 hours ago Reply I_am_flashfire4 Hopefully Vive compatible you mean 2 3 hours ago Reply koenshaku i agree but MS 5% of FB shares though, so they will either support their own windows VR or oculus. vive is the superior device though I look forword to software supporting the new trrackers and the release of the wireless batteries. 0 2 hours ago Reply Dan Harris This would make sense but I think they'd go with what offers the best experience.

I've never had to wait anyway. The only real issue I can see is that it's being released during the holidays, might be a hot Christmas item... But the fact it's really only for 4k & hdr geeks, I can't see this being anywhere near the issue similar to Nintendo's newest console. 0 15 min ago Reply peachy001 That website got a hell of a scoop!

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: [Updated] Microsoft teases new mobile device on Facebook, then removes post -5 by Greg Jordan  @Greg_Jordan88 Apr 1, 2017 at 22:50 GMT8 hours ago [Update: April Fools!!] Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is the latest and greatest smartphone, with a new ‘Infinity Screen’, a new intelligent interface dubbed ‘Bixby’, top of the line specs, and a new DeX dock that will allow you to connect the phone to an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a desktop like experience (sounds familiar right?). Our very own Michael Allison even wrote a piece about how the new phone is a beautifully executed Lumia 950. Microsoft took note of this and has even announced that it will sell it’s own version of the Galaxy S8 (more like a device pre-loaded with all of Microsoft’s apps and services). A lot of you took this as a sign that Microsoft was finished with the smartphone market, but if Microsoft’s Facebook page is to be believed, the company may still have an ace up its sleeve. A few hours ago my timeline was flooded by friends and followers alike, referencing a new mystery device on Microsoft’s official Facebook page. I immediately went to the page and looked at said device, and it was gorgeous!!! I took a screenshot on my Idol Pro 4S for reference, and begin to peruse through the specs of the phone. These top of the line specs included Windows 10, a 6.15 inch 2960 x 1440 4K display, 8 GB of RAM, 1 TB of storage, dual core Intel Kaby Lake processor, USB Type C, HDMI, and something called a SP5 connector. I immediately rushed to write the story so that everyone could see, and no sooner than I went to upload an image, I couldn’t find the screenshot in my gallery (with this unreliable insider build). I went to look up tech stories to find an image, and though I was unable to find one, the  one that I have above in this story was the one that most resembled Microsoft’s image. I even went back to Microsoft’s Facebook page and the image had been taken down, with no reference at all to the device ever haven been there. What do our readers think? Was this the ever alluding Surface Phone? Or something new all together? And what about this SP5 connector? Let us know what you think in the comments section!

Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income, according to a new financial snapshot of about 180 of the men and women serving in Donald Trump’s White House. Other Trump aides with lucrative histories include Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of banking giant Goldman Sachs, who netted up to around $75 million in the previous year. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon made up to $2.5 million. The financial backgrounds of Trump aides are detailed in new forms that disclose the assets that those aides held when they walked in the doors of the White House — before administration counsel advised them to resign from various postings, divest certain holdings or recuse themselves from future decisions. But the documents will nevertheless offer a portrait into the lives of several key White House aides, especially those who came from Wall Street or have other ties to the financial industry. Kushner, like Trump, a prominent real estate titan, held a position in 267 separate entities, ranging from the Trump transition team to dozens of property holdings in New York and New Jersey. Ivanka Trump, who just this week formally said she would join the West Wing after serving as an informal adviser to her father, has yet to file her own disclosure forms. But the White House said earlier on Friday that her documents would look largely similar to her husband’s. Bannon’s forms reveal numerous ties to various conservative organizations and sources funded by the family of influential Trump donors Bob and Rebekah Mercer, such as Breitbart News, which he led, along with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm used by many Republican clients. Other income sources for him are Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy firm valued at as high as $25 million, along with Affinity Media Holdings, which could have awarded him capital gains of as high as $1 million last year. Bannon is also in the process of selling some of his stake in Cambridge Analytica and Glittering Steel, another Mercer-backed entity, according to the forms. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn made as much as $1.5 million last year. According to his financial snapshot, Flynn received $827,055 in salary and bonus from the firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. The retired lieutenant general listed a speaking engagement for “RT TV” under “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” but does not specify the amount. CNN previously reported that Flynn, according to a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was paid more than $33,000 by RT, formerly Russia Today, Russia’s state-funded broadcaster, for a speech in Moscow in December 2015. The US intelligence community has long assessed RT to be a propaganda tool of the Kremlin, writing in its January report on Russian interference in the US election that the organization had participated in disinformation campaigns aimed at the US. The forms say Flynn received “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year” from Russia-based air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the US. The White House acknowledged in March that Trump’s transition team was aware Flynn engaged in work that would likely require him to register his consulting firm as a foreign agent before Flynn was tapped to serve as national security adviser. Flynn’s Justice Department filing last month raised questions when it revealed that Flynn’s firm worked on behalf of a Turkish-owned company, Inovo BV, to improve US confidence in Turkey’s business climate. Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from the company and acknowledged in its registration as a foreign agent that the work may have benefited the Turkish government.

Flynn attending an exhibition marking the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today) TV news channel in Moscow on Dec. 10, 2015. (Michael Klimentyev / Sputnik / EPA) Matea Gold, Rosalind S. Helderman, Sari HorwitzWashington Post Before resigning under pressure as President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn submitted a personal financial disclosure form to federal ethics officials that failed to note speaking fees he received from Russia-related entities in 2015, new filings show. Flynn later noted the payments on an amended form he signed Friday that listed among his sources of income the Russian government-backed television network RT, a U.S. air cargo company affiliated with the Volga-Dnepr Group and the U.S. subsidiary of Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab. The White House released both sets of the forms Saturday as part of a broad release of documents detailing the financial holdings of top administration officials. Flynn's initial form was submitted to the Office of Government Ethics and the White House on Feb. 11 - just days before he was forced to leave his post amid controversy over his contacts with Russia's ambassador. On the document, he noted that he received fees through a speakers bureau, but he did not detail the names of the organizations that paid to have him as a speaker. Michael Flynn offers to cooperate on Russia probe in exchange for immunity Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has offered to cooperate with congressional investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a suggestion that has been met with initial skepticism, according to people familiar with the matter. "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell,... Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has offered to cooperate with congressional investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a suggestion that has been met with initial skepticism, according to people familiar with the matter. "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell,... (Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima) A person familiar with his filing said Flynn's initial form was a draft that would have gone through the usual process of review and revision in consultation with the White House Counsel's Office and the Office of Government Ethics. However, that process was suspended when Flynn resigned. In recent days, White House officials asked him to finish the process and advised Flynn that he needed to itemize each organization that paid to have him as a speaker, the person said. Flynn first acknowledged in a July interview with Yahoo that he had been paid for the December 2015 RT event in Moscow, where the retired Army lieutenant general sat with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a celebration for the network. He later confirmed to The Washington Post that the network provided his payment. The U.S. government has said that RT, which receives Kremlin funding, is part of an array of propaganda outlets that help popularize a pro-Russian perspective through the media. It was not until earlier this month that Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, disclosed new documents showing that Flynn had also been paid in 2015 for speeches in Washington by Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. A look at the links between Russian officials and Donald Trump's campaign and White House administration. In all, Flynn earned at least $1.3 million in the past year, including more than $827,000 through his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, his disclosure shows. Flynn's amended filing included a dollar figure for an October speaking engagement paid for by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a former official with the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, a U.S.-based nonprofit. In his original form, Flynn included Kurtulus on a section of the form that requires officials to name all their sources of income exceeding $5,000 over the previous two years. He omitted Kurtulus, however, in another section of the form requiring more specific disclosures for income sources in the last year. In the amended form, he disclosed that he was paid a $10,000 speaking fee by Kurtulus in October 2016. The Daily Caller reported that Flynn met with Kurtulus and another activist, Hilal Mutlu, a cousin of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that same month. At the time, Flynn's firm was also being paid by a Dutch company owned by a Turk to undertake efforts favorable to the Turkish government. The amended form details several other speaking engagements, including a $15,000 speech delivered to conservative activist David Horowitz's Freedom Center and a $22,500 speech to Randall-Reilly Publishing Company. Flynn also reported that he was paid $14,454.20 to deliver a speech to BlackDuck Software in October, just weeks before the election. BlackDuck's website shows that Flynn spoke about the government's vulnerability to computer hackers in the speech.

The US intelligence community has long assessed RT to be a propaganda tool of the Kremlin, writing in its January report on Russian interference in the US election that the organization had participated in disinformation campaigns aimed at the US. The forms say Flynn received “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year” from Russia-based air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the US. The White House acknowledged in March that Trump’s transition team was aware Flynn engaged in work that would likely require him to register his consulting firm as a foreign agent before Flynn was tapped to serve as national security adviser. Flynn’s Justice Department filing last month raised questions when it revealed that Flynn’s firm worked on behalf of a Turkish-owned company, Inovo BV, to improve US confidence in Turkey’s business climate. Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from the company and acknowledged in its registration as a foreign agent that the work may have benefited the Turkish government.

Helderman and Sari Horwitz By Matea Gold, Rosalind S. Helderman and Sari Horwitz April 1 at 5:15 PM Follow @mateagold Follow @PostRoz Follow @sarihorwitz CBS News correspondent Major Garrett asked White House press secretary Sean Spicer, March 31, if President Trump wants Congress to grant former national security adviser Michael Flynn immunity. (Video: Reuters) Before resigning under pressure as President Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn submitted a personal financial disclosure form to federal ethics officials that failed to note speaking fees he received from Russia-related entities in 2015, new filings show. Flynn later noted the payments on an amended form he signed Friday that listed among his sources of income the Russian government-backed television network RT, a U.S. air cargo company affiliated with the Volga-Dnepr Group and the U.S. subsidiary of Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab. The White House released both sets of the forms Saturday as part of a broad release of documents detailing the financial holdings of top administration officials. Flynn's initial form was submitted to the Office of Government Ethics and the White House on Feb. 11 — just days before he was forced to leave his post amid controversy over his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. On the document, he noted that he received fees through a speakers bureau, but he did not detail the names of the organizations that paid to have him as a speaker. A person familiar with his filing said Flynn's initial form was a draft that would have gone through the usual process of review and revision in consultation with the White House Counsel's Office and the Office of Government Ethics. However, that process was suspended when Flynn resigned. In recent days, White House officials asked him to finish the process and advised Flynn that he needed to itemize each organization that paid to have him as a speaker, the person said. [Trump adviser Flynn paid by multiple Russia-related entities, new records show] White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on March 31, that Trump fully supports Michael Flynn testifying before Congress. "Take whatever precaution you want," Spicer said, responding to news reports that Flynn's lawyer asked for immunity before he testifies. (Reuters) Flynn first acknowledged in a July interview with Yahoo that he had been paid for the December 2015 RT event in Moscow, where the retired Army lieutenant general sat with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin during a celebration for the network. He later confirmed to The Washington Post that the network provided his payment. The U.S. government has said that RT, which receives Kremlin funding, is part of an array of propaganda outlets that help popularize a pro-Russian perspective through the media. It was not until earlier this month that Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, disclosed new documents showing that Flynn had also been paid in 2015 for speeches in Washington by Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. In all, Flynn earned at least $1.3 million in the past year, including more than $827,000 through his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, his disclosure shows. Flynn's amended filing included a dollar figure for an October speaking engagement paid for by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a former official with the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, a U.S.-based nonprofit. In his original form, Flynn included Kurtulus on a section of the form that requires officials to name all their sources of income exceeding $5,000 over the previous two years. He omitted Kurtulus, however, in another section of the form requiring more specific disclosures for income sources in the last year. In the amended form, he disclosed that he was paid a $10,000 speaking fee by Kurtulus in October 2016. The Daily Caller reported that Flynn met with Kurtulus and another activist, Hilal Mutlu, a cousin of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that same month. At the time, Flynn's firm was also being paid by a Dutch company owned by a Turk to undertake efforts favorable to the Turkish government. The amended form details several other speaking engagements, including a $15,000 speech delivered to conservative activist David Horowitz's Freedom Center and a $22,500 speech to Randall-Reilly Publishing Company. Flynn also reported that he was paid $14,454.20 to deliver a speech to BlackDuck Software in October, just weeks before the election. BlackDuck's website shows that Flynn spoke about the government's vulnerability to computer hackers in the speech. politics post-politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

(AMD) Stock Is a Rotten Apple Big-Box Retail Stocks: 2 to Buy, 2 to Avoid Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still the Alpha Dog View All Posts Without a doubt, if ever there was a candidate for a “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” stock, it would be Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Source: Shutterstock Not long ago, on a CNBC roundtable segment, an analyst proposed a “buy” recommendation on AMD stock. The other pundits laughed. And then they laughed some more. When the humor appeared to fade, they laughed again, just for good measure. It took a while, but the joke was ultimately on the naysayers. Last year was a stunning turnaround for Advanced Micro Devices. From start to finish, AMD stock returned long-suffering shareholders more than 300% in profits. To put that into perspective, 2016 was the biggest year in its publicly traded existence. More impressively, AMD eclipsed the performance of 2009, when several stocks were clawing back from 2008’s devastation. What’s particularly endearing for both present stakeholders and prospective buyers is that Advanced Micro Devices is not slowing down. For 2017, AMD stock is up just shy of 30%. That’s enough for a very solid year for most people’s portfolios. In fact, if it keeps up this work rate, AMD could challenge for yet another triple-digit return. That would make consecutive triple-digit returns, something that hasn’t happened for AMD stock since 1982 and 1983. Although the prospect for a history-making event is extremely enticing for investors, we also have to remember the risks. Advanced Micro Devices has long played second-fiddle to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for a reason. It also gave a foothold for semiconductor rivals like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The question is, which AMD will show up this time around? Many Reasons to Love AMD Stock Certainly, I can respect the idea of Advanced Micro Devices pulling off another upset. It’s running high on momentum, and sometimes, that’s all you really need. But as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli asserts, other substantive factors are working in favor of AMD stock. Having a strong business is all about people. And AMD has a powerhouse leadership, starting from the top. At the helm is CEO Lisa Su, a phenomenal executive who has a doctorate’s degree in electrical engineering from MIT. She has also served in high-level positions at renowned firms Freescale Semiconductor Ltd (NYSE:FSL) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). Along with great people are products. Historically, this is one area that has tripped up AMD stock. Although, it’s always been cheaper in price compared to rival Intel’s offerings, AMD semiconductors have wrestled with the quality stigma.

Flynn filed the financial document yesterday, the day the White House released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn had electronically signed an earlier disclosure in February according to one document. A second filing signed by Flynn was dated Friday but was released Saturday instead of with other administration disclosures. The new disclosure shows that Flynn declared more than USD 827,000 from his work for the Flynn Intel Group. The firm filed as a foreign agent last month to the Justice Department, saying its work likely benefited the government of Turkey.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 April 2017 by Military News 3 Internet of Things Stocks to Buy in 2017 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological shift that is opening communication between the world’s devices, and it looks poised to change the way the world operates — and generate tremendous value along the way. While increasing device connectivity and insights stemming from data analytics are already having an impact, the IoT revolution is still in its early phases, and 2017 looks to be an influential year in the progression of the tech. To help readers navigate investing in this potentially massive tech trend, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick their choice for a top IoT stock to buy this year. Read on to learn why IBM (NYSE: IBM) , Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) , and Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) made the list. Image source: Getty Images. Flying under the radar Tim Brugger (IBM): Much has been made of IBM’s „strategic imperatives,” which include data security, mobile, cloud, and artificial-intelligence-driven solutions via its Watson supercomputer, but IoT doesn’t get mentioned. Don’t be fooled, though: Not only does IBM have serious plans to win its fair share of the skyrocketing IoT spending in the coming years, but it’s ideally positioned to do so. Imagine the amount of data the 24 billion connected „things” estimated to be in the IoT by 2020 will amass. It’s mind-boggling. Storing, analyzing, and ultimately developing actionable results from all that information will require an artificial-intelligence-driven computing wonder of enormous capabilities — otherwise, what good is all the data? Which is where IBM’s Watson IoT cloud platform enters the picture. The event may have flown under the radar, but IBM committed $3 billion to its IoT initiatives nearly two years ago. Since then it’s acquired The Weather Company for $2 billion, utilizing Watson to analyze and provide insights from the 26 billion inquiries The Weather Company receives every day. IBM also just took the wraps off its new Watson IoT headquarters in Munich, Germany, with projects to further its reach and expand its capabilities even more. The data all the IoT devices generate in the coming years will only be as valuable as the ability to analyze it to assist business and government with everything from customer targeting to product development. When it comes to analyzing incredible amounts of data, IBM’s Watson is in a class by itself, which is why IBM is an IoT stock to buy in 2017. A retailer benefiting from the Internet of Things Daniel B. Kline  ( Best Buy): Electronics retailer Best Buy has faced and survived some major challenges in recent years. One of them has been that while televisions, laptops, and other electronics have gotten better, they haven’t changed dramatically. That makes it less likely a consumer will come into a store to see the latest model, which not only costs Best Buy sales, but also robs it of the opportunity to sell warranties or installation services. The explosion of IoT devices will benefit the retailer in two ways. First, shoppers are likely going to be more willing to come to stores to actually look at products in a category they are not very familiar with. This is already starting to happen in Best Buy stores as more shelf space has gone to connected-home products and other items in the broad IoT category. The second major benefit for Best Buy is that in many cases customers will want the benefits of IoT, but need help installing the devices. Even doing something simple like setting up an Amazon Dash ordering button may be beyond the ability of some Best Buy customers. That should create service and Geek Squad sales opportunities for the retailer. Going forward, Best Buy could even increase this type of service by working with manufacturers to embed Geek Squad service calls into the functionality of more-complicated IoT devices. A smart appliance could in theory order its own repairs before it breaks, and the retailer would be well-positioned to handle some of those service calls. I oT will spur demand for this company’s chips Keith Noonan  (Xilinx): Many chip companies have been seeing strong momentum thanks to IoT, and Xilinx stands out as a leader in a semiconductor segment that could see continued benefits from growing machine-and-sensor connectivity. The chipmaker specializes in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) — semiconductor solutions that can be programmed after manufacturing rather than having a set process. FPGAs are especially useful at the beginning of technology cycles, when the likelihood of changes and smaller market size make it less feasible to use expensive chips designed for a specific purpose. With the Internet of Things ushering in a range of new technologies that will change and evolve at a rapid pace, there’s a good chance that FPGAs will see increased demand. The rollout of the 5G networks needed to facilitate the growing wave of machine-to-machine communication will be one source of momentum for programmable chips, but Xilinx has other opportunities related to IoT. Intel ‚s acquisition of Xilinx’s rival Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 pointed toward the growing importance of FPGA chips for data centers. Notably, Xilinx is winning influential customers in the space, having recently signed deals with Baidu and Amazon to provide data center solutions. The chipmaker’s FPGAs will also be used for IoT-related technologies including machine learning, cloud computing, analytics, and machine vision. Those looking for returned income have another reason to consider adding Xilinx to their portfolios. The stock currently yields 2.2%, and the company has raised its payout for six years running. With strong growth potential and dividend income to fall back on in the event of market turbulence, Xilinx looks like an IoT stock to buy in 2017. 10 stocks we like better than IBM When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 In the second week of March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had two high-profile visitors from Japan — Toyota Motor president Akio Toyoda and Suzuki chairman Osamu Suzuki. Toyota is the world’s second largest carmaker and Suzuki is ranked No. 10. Although a global pygmy, the latter’s India operation lords over almost half the market. India seems to be the centrepiece of their global partnership that will bring together Toyota’s global leadership in technology and manufacturing with Suzuki’s strength in small cars and in India. “Suzuki and Toyota both will benefit. It (the Toyota-Suzuki alliance) will help Suzuki bring technology that is relevant for the Indian market. And to Toyota it will offer scale not available anywhere,” says RC Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki Ltd. Around that time, in early March, another alliance was being stitched in Germany. Volkswagen AG, the world’s largest carmaker, signed a memorandum of understanding with home-grown Tata Motors to jointly develop auto components and vehicles for India and beyond. “The aim is… to lay the foundations that will enable us to offer customer-oriented mobility solutions in the emerging, fast-growing automobile markets as elsewhere,” said Matthias Mueller, CEO of Volkswagen AG (VW), in a statement. The Indian Tango Motown is ripe for disruption. India is just one of the many battlefronts. An industry built around gasoline- and diesel-fuelled vehicles is under scrutiny as tightening emission norms give e-vehicles a boost. Amid all this, the centre of gravity is shifting — from the west to the east and from the developed world to the emerging markets. So far, it was China, which outpaced the US to be the world’s biggest car market, that got all the attention. The Tata-VW, Suzuki-Toyota alliances signal that the action might be shifting to India, the last big frontier to be claimed by Big Auto. India, the fifth largest car market with 3 million cars (SIAM forecast for 2016-17), is tipped to be the third largest by 2020. Toyota, the maker of Prius and Mirai, hopes that Suzuki’s India volumes will help it make hybrid technology cheaper. Aligning with the NDA government’s Make in India pitch, it could also lead to the export of new-technology cars from India and create jobs. “India is a high potential market (for Toyota)… The main focus of Toyota and Suzuki partnership is to achieve a sustainable growth with mutual business interests while staying independently competitive,” says Akito Tachibana, MD, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, the Indian operation. The $189 billion Toyota and $22 billion Suzuki make an unlikely pair. Toyota, globally overtaken by VW last year, faces new competitive pressures with players like Tesla. Low oil prices and advances in e-vehicle technologies have at least partly blunted the edge that Japanese automakers’ fuel-efficient vehicles enjoyed among consumers. Suzuki has its own issues. “To be viable in the automobile industry, a volume player needs a scale of at least 5-6 million units globally. Suzuki does 3 million,” says Rakesh Batra, partner and national leader (automotive), EY India. India accounts for 65% of the global profits of Suzuki, which is feeling the pressure as tightening safety and emission norms and thrust on clean technologies in India demand big R&D investment. Also read: Gap between developed and emerging markets is bridging fast, says Guenter Butschek, Tata Motors “Suzuki needs Toyota for technology,” says Bhargava. Suzuki attempted to forge an alliance with larger partner VW in 2009 when the latter bought 19.9% stake in Suzuki but the partnership ended bitterly in 2015. “Chance of success is much higher in partnerships where there are cultural similarities,” says Bhargava. By that yardstick, the alliance between German VW (through group firm Skoda) and India’s Tata Motors — although still at a preliminary stage — could be complex. Both face multiple challenges. Still reeling from the emissions scandal of 2015, VW faces both financial (has earmarked $19.9 billion to resolve claims) and reputational damage. As a strategy, it has decided to shift its R&D focus to clean technologies, including e-vehicles. Its India business too has struggled. The alliance with Tata Motors should help VW improve its India business and also offer it a chance to exploit its capabilities in conventional petrol-diesel technologies, says VG Ramakrishnan, cofounder of Avanteum Advisors, an automobile consultancy firm. Tata Motors’ loss-making domestic passenger car business too has been hurting. Market share has slipped from 13% in 2013 to under 5% today, with an unimpressive product portfolio. “We are working towards an appropriate collaboration model,” says Tata Motors MD Guenter Butschek (See “Gap Between Developed and Emerging Markets...”). The alliance could launch its first product in 2019. Experts feel that if cultural issues are tackled, the alliance could benefit both. “Tatas need access to latest technologies. VW is struggling in India,” says Kavan Mukhtyar, partner, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Tech Disruption A 2013 McKinsey report on disruptive technologies (it counts autonomous driving among the top 12) forecasts that factors like improved safety, lower emissions and increased fuel efficiency could create an economic impact of $200 billion-1.9 trillion. According to EY, last year deals worth $19 billion took place between carmakers, technology firms and ridesharing companies. Autonomous technology is seeing the biggest action. Intel just acquired Israeli firm Mobileye for $15 billion whose technology allows cars to have 360-degree vision. Late last year, Samsung Electronics acquired auto infotainment provider Harman International for $8 billion. Another area seeing lot of action is IT and electronics. Till now, Google’s Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay have controlled how drivers connect their smartphones to their vehicles. To counter this domination, in January, a consortium led by Ford Motor and Toyota began to develop an open-source platform as an alternative for in-vehicle and car telematics. “Increasingly, features and electronics rather than power trains are becoming the basis of competition,” says Kumar Kandaswamy, senior director, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India. Alliances are also being struck to develop clean energy technologies. In January, 13 firms from energy, transport and industrial sector, including Toyota, BMW and Daimler, joined hands with oil and gas giants like Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA and Alstom to invest $10.7 billion in developing hydrogenrelated technology within five years. Betting on fuel cell technologies, they see it as a good alternative to battery-powered EVs to cut emissions. In fact, Toyota is betting on fuel cell vehicles to cut 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from its vehicles by 2050. Ridesharing platforms like Uber and Lyft too are changing the dynamics. Toyota has bought a minor stake in Uber and will begin offering leases to Uber drivers. VW and General Motors have invested in Uber rivals Gett and Lyft respectively. Closer home, M&M is striking an alliance with Ola to push its e-vehicles. Despite the rush to form alliances, the journey will not be easy. Six years ago, Nissan struck an alliance with Mercedes-Benz to develop luxury cars for their brand Infiniti. But it hasn’t quite worked, thanks to unrealistic sales targets and shifting political tide (the two firms have a shared factory in Mexico from where exports to the US face uncertainties). In 2014, Chinese search giant Baidu and BMW began working on self-driving cars. But late last year, the collaboration was disbanded. Says Guillaume Sicard, president, Nissan India: “The fundamental principles are to find common ground and insist on winwin — and not win-lose — projects, meaning both companies would benefit from doing a project.” Led by Carlos Ghosn, the Renault-Nissan alliance, which also involves equity cross holdings and will complete two decades in March 2019, has worked well for both partners. “We like to take on concrete projects and measure performance with specific milestones and deliverables,” adds Sicard.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware Ashes of the Singularity V2.20 Shows 20% Improvement On Ryzen By Keith May Mar 31, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit Okay, I know the long time running joke is that Ashes of the Singularity is a benchmark and not a game, but it really is a full fledged game receiving constant updates and even an expansion that later combined both the original AotS and Ascension into one package.  Okay, with that out of the way let us get to the real topic at hand here, Ryzen update.  Ashes of the Singularity is now the first game to see a proper update to take advantage of the new AMD Ryzen architecture.  This was much needed as even in our review of the Ryzen 7 1800x it fell short by a significant margin in this title.  Just keep in mind going forward that we only took the CPU test results for that review.   Related MSI Enabling A-XMP For Ryzen Motherboards Soon taken from our video review     Testing   Settings Used Testing the game was easy enough. We ran through three runs of the built in benchmark tool for GPU and CPU and took the averages of each AVG ALL, Normal Batches, Medium Batches, and Heavy Batches to see what variation we could measure between the entire run. We ran the game at 1080p with the High preset in DX12 mode for all of these tests, both GPU and CPU on both V2.10 and the new V2.20 build. Related AMD Ryzen 5 Mainstream Processors Confirmed For April 11th Launch – 6 Core Ryzen 5 1600X To Cost $249, 4 Core Ryzen 5 1500X To Cost $189 Advertisement Ryzen 7 1800x System CPU Ryzen 7 1800x Memory 16GB G.Skill Trident Z 2667 CL14 Motherboard MSI X370 Xpower Titanium Storage 480GB OCZ Trion 150 SSD Power Supply Corsair AX860i Graphics card used was a Founders Edition NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with GeForce 378.92 Drivers. Results   GPU Based Benchmark The results of the GPU tests pretty much say it all here, there has been a massive improvement in performance, better utilization of the CPU netted serious gains here. Overall average FPS saw a 19.4% improvement. Normal Batches saw the same 19.4% improvement. The Medium Batches portion of the test saw our best improvement with a 20.9% gain. Heavy Batches may have gained the least amount of the entire test but I don’t know anyone who would balk at a still 18% gain over the games previous version. CPU Based Benchmark The CPU benchmark here shows yet again that 20% uptick in performance gains. If you refer back to the chart from our Ryzen 7 1800x review this gain now puts the 1800x ahead of the Intel i7 7700k in this title, which is theoretically where it should be giving the games ability to scale with hardware as well as it does. Conclusion AMD did say there would be updates coming and that they were working with developers to help bring these to market, and it looks like the first delivery was a success. I know there are other sites reporting greater gains than what we’re showing here, but this is where we are with what we’ve tested and the results are good. This is a great step in the right direction for not only the companies involved, but the consumer invested in these platforms. If AMD continues to push this level of success then those early adopters are in for a real treat. Now I can’t help but wonder was Ryzen the only architecture to see gains from this update. Sound off in the comment section if you’re running a different setup with either an older FX based CPU or an Intel Core series and let us know if you’re seeing gains as well.

Lenovo, one of the world’s biggest PC makers and a huge purveyor of virtual reality technology, is looking to let businesses uses VR technology in the workplace easily. The new Lenovo ThinkStation P320 is a Windows PC built for the demands of engineers and developers that need software like VR4CAD. Lenovo revealed the ThinkStation P320 during DevelopLive 3D, a tradeshow dedicated to new ways to automate and enhance the workplace, which is exactly what the company believes the ThinkStation P320 will do. Samsung Gear VR, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift VR headsets are helping the technology gain traction in gaming. Lenovo has taken the guesswork out of getting started with VR in a business setting. The ThinkStation P320 is ProVR certified, meaning it can run the tools that virtual reality development requires. A Flex Module system lets companies add the ports that their engineers need to work efficiently. The ThinkStation P320’s GreenGuard certification underscores Lenovo’s commitment to balancing the power that working with VR requires and environmentally cautious power consumption. The Lenovo ThinkStation P320 in both its forms. Read: Oculus Rift vs HTC Vive: What’s the Difference? The desktop computer comes in two configurations. One maximizes space savings and the other that is the same size as a full tower desktop PC. The two computers have everything that businesses need to get the most out of their 3D software. Processors include up to a 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processor. Up to 64 GB of RAM can be stuffed inside. Buyers have the option of maxing the machine out with a 400W power supply and 1TB solid state drive too. Flex Modules for the PC include media card readers, eSata ports and USB Type-C Thunderbolt technology. Windows 7 Pro, Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu are all supported operating systems, Lenovo says. The Lenovo ThinkStation P320 will go on sale this coming April. The company says that its kept affordability in mind, but pricing hasn’t been announced yet.

Sadly, the X.Org/Wayland/Mesa turnout so far for applicants are very low. At this week's X.Org Foundation Board of Directors meeting, they acknowledged so far there are only two applicants interested in working on "X.Org" projects this summer -- the X.Org Foundation's participation also incorporates Wayland, Mesa, libinput, DRM and related parts of the stack. This is a pity to see only two students so far interested in possibly getting involved with these important pieces to Linux gaming and the Linux desktop. There are a lot of interesting projects to work on and many will agree that Wayland/Mesa/X.Org could use all the help it can get. There are also many success stories of former GSoC X.Org student developers going on to making a career out of their work... Among the successes that come to mind are former GSoC'er Samuel Pitoiset who was working on the Nouveau stack had continued his contributions and went on to now working for Valve on the Radeon driver stack. Tom Stellard was long ago a GSoC student working on the Radeon GLSL compiler and then went on to be employed by AMD and now Red Hat. Timothy Arceri wasn't a GSoC student but went from doing crowd-funded work to learn Mesa development to working for Collabora and now Valve. Martin Peres went from being a student developer hacking on Nouveau to now working at Intel on their driver stack. Collabora also recently hired a GSoC student just from last year that's been working on the soft FP64 support. And there are so many other successes for those that get involved with free software graphics drivers to now being successfully employed in the field with there being a shortage of experienced Linux graphics driver developers. So if you are an eligible student for GSoC and interested in open-source development, I highly recommend checking out their GSoC ideas page. Among the 2017 ideas are improvements to Mesa's OpenMAX and VDPAU state trackers, replacing DriConf, Nouveau improvements, DRM clean-ups, and more. For applying or to see other participating projects, see the GSoC site.

If he succeeds, it will deliver an early win for Democrats in the first competitive race of the Trump era. “The campaign’s goal is not to get into a runoff, though we’ll be ready to fight a runoff if necessary,” Ossoff said as he announced endorsements from a handful of state legislators. “The campaign’s goal is to win this election outright on April 18.” With early voting starting this week, Ossoff and Democrats are in full force seeking to boost turnout in the district. Actress Alyssa Milano and actor Chris Gorham offered to drive voters to the polls. And Better Georgia, a state progressive group, has teamed up with other groups to raise money and canvass in the “Vote Your Ossoff” campaign that has caught fire online.  ADVERTISEMENT So far, Democrats have a slight advantage in early voting. According to The New York Times, as of Wednesday, 55 percent of voters have participated in a recent Democratic primary, compared to 31 percent who have voted in a Republican primary. And among voters who have requested — but not yet returned — absentee ballots, Democrats also have an early lead. “That was a very big sign for Jon Ossoff,” said Georgia Democratic strategist Tharon Johnson. “We saw that the enthusiasm in this race right now is definitely amongst the Democrats.” While polls show Ossoff nearing the threshold to avoid a runoff, success is far from guaranteed, given that there are 18 candidates running in the “jungle primary.” If no one candidate gets 50 percent, the top two vote getters will advance to a June 20 runoff. Ossoff is expected to at least make the runoff, where it’ll be a much steeper climb once Republicans coalesce around a nominee. Johnson said the momentum in the race makes him more “optimistic” about the possibility of Ossoff winning outright, but said it’s “highly unlikely” the race will be decided on April 18. Ossoff’s unexpectedly strong showing has taken Republicans by surprise in a district that handily reelected Price. A victory in the district for Democrats will likely bolster their belief that there is a backlash against Trump heading into 2018 midterm elections. As the primary comes down to the wire and election handicappers readjust their race ratings to “toss-up,” Republicans are working to make sure Ossoff doesn’t win more than 50 percent of the vote. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is making a last-minute investment and launched its debut TV ad Friday. In addition to radio and digital ads, the NRCC will also deploy staffers to the district who will work with the Republican National Committee (RNC) staffers already there, according to an NRCC official. Those resources come after Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership, spent more than $2 million targeting Ossoff. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump would help in the special election “if needed,” but Spicer didn’t specify whether the president would campaign there or offer any other support. Republicans are turning up the heat on Ossoff, accusing him of inflating his resume and seeking to paint him as a “30-year-old frat boy.” They have questioned his national security credentials during his time as an aide to Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.).  The attacks prompted Ossoff's campaign to release a timeline showing that he worked as a national security staffer for five years and had top-secret clearance for five months of his tenure.  Ossoff has captured much of the attention in the race, but the 11 Republican candidates are battling each other to make one of the spots in a runoff.  Karen Handel, former Georgia secretary of State and a leading contender, won an endorsement from former Sen. Saxby ChamblissSaxby ChamblissDemocrats go for broke in race for Tom Price's seat Spicer: Trump will 'help the team' if needed in Georgia special election Wyden hammers CIA chief over Senate spying MORE (R-Ga.), who held a fundraiser for Handel with GOP mega-donor Fred Cooper. Her first TV ad in the race took aim at Ossoff as Pelosi’s “handpicked candidate” and slammed him in a fundraising email over his celebrity support. But Handel isn’t the only Republican candidate who has scored a high-profile endorsement. Former state Sen. Dan Moody nabbed the coveted support of Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who was also featured in an ad. And former state Sen. Judson Hill has endorsements from Sen. Marco RubioMarco RubioDemocrats go for broke in race for Tom Price's seat Overnight Cybersecurity: Senate Intel holds Russia hearing | WH struggles to respond to latest Nunes development | Trump extends Obama cyber threat order Rubio: Former campaign aides targeted by IP address in Russia MORE (R-Fla.) and former Speaker Newt Gingrich ®, who represented the Atlanta suburban district from 1979 to 1999.  The conservative Club for Growth’s debut in the race was a TV ad aimed at Handel, who the group described as a “big-spending career politician.” The Club endorsed Bob Gray, a former councilman who has inched higher in the polls.  Gray has aligned himself closely with Trump and believes voters in the district want a leader with “business-minded experience” and outsider credentials. He contrasted himself with Handel, Moody and Hill, who all had political careers, and said he can’t envision a scenario where Ossoff wins the seat even with all the outsized attention. “It’s a surprise to see how much resources are being dumped into it, I do think there’s some surprise where the poll numbers reflect he is,” Gray told The Hill. “But I don’t think anyone believes there’s any chance that he’s going to win the seat either in the special election or the runoff.”  Bruce LeVell, who led Trump’s national diversity coalition, has challenged Gray’s support for Trump and called him a member of the #NeverTrump movement. LeVell has enlisted support from Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s first campaign manager, and Pastor Mark Burns, a high-profile Trump surrogate, who stumped for him at a rally this week. The Georgia Republican Party is gearing up for an expected runoff and plan to get fully behind whoever emerges as the nominee with full confidence that they’ll hold the seat.  “Once we know who our candidate is after the 18th, we will be ready with money and resources and a grassroots army to support our nominee and push them across the finish line,” said Ryan Mahoney, Georgia GOP spokesman.  “We’re working around the clock to make sure [Democrats] don’t get that win in Georgia. They are desperately trying to flip the script here, and it’s just not going to happen in Georgia.” As Republicans seek to cast Ossoff as a liberal aligned with the Democratic establishment in Washington, strategists say he'll need to start immediately appealing to independents and Republicans while keeping his base and progressives in his corner. “His general election runoff messaging must start now,” Johnson said. “He’s got to have this delicate balance between securing and holding onto that support but also having a message that appeals to moderate, disaffected Republicans.” Tags Saxby Chambliss Marco Rubio   View the discussion thread.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Meadows talks health care, Trump tweets at West Henderson Saturday Apr 1, 2017 at 12:16 AM Apr 1, 2017 at 1:01 AM Derek Lacey Times-News Staff Writer @BRNDerek History, civics and journalism students at West Henderson High got a chance to practice what their teachers have been preaching Friday when U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows stopped by to answer their questions about political issues. Speaking for about an hour, Meadows encouraged students to look at the truth in both sides of every argument. If they can do that, he said, it will ultimately make them great journalists, great citizens and make the nation a better place.  "The responsibility of a journalist is critically important, because the power of the pen is something that not only transforms, but it also informs," Meadows said.  After pulling some student volunteers to explain how bills are introduced and become law, Meadows fielded a slew of tough and pointed questions from the students on topics ranging from internet privacy legislation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Donald Trump's tweets. Most of the questions, however, revolved around the failed attempt by Republicans to pass the American Health Care Act, the GOP's bid to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Meadows said it wasn't a surprise that the students asked "excellent questions," sometimes more direct than he even gets in the capitol, and added that "they're going to make some great journalists."  Meadows, chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is an opponent of the GOP measure. The congressman has been in the spotlight in the past couple of weeks, along with the entire Freedom Caucus, portrayed as being at the center of the bill's failure.  "It has put me in the headlines more than I care to be," Meadows told the group Wednesday. He said the plan "is not better than the existing plan," that it didn't do enough to bring down premiums and that in casting a wider safety net, the plan didn't do enough for those who have the highest need.  Meadows was even called out on Twitter by President Donald Trump, who tweeted at Meadows twice Thursday, saying "If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform," and "Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador? #RepealANDReplace #Obamacare." Earlier in the week, he took aim at the Freedom Caucus, saying the group "was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory." He also said "The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!" But Meadows said he's not worried.  "In the end I serve at the pleasure of the people of Western North Carolina and they're going to judge me based on what I've done, not based on a 140-character tweet," he said.  The direct tweets do add undue pressure, though, he told students. He said he had two options: respond or continue to focus on the people he serves, and he chose the latter.  After Meadows' talk, students at West showed solidarity with him, taking group photos and tweeting them to the president, saying "this is what it's really about." Students asked several questions about the AHCA, the bill's fate, and other health care issues. Seventeen-year-old junior Hunter Koch asked how a clean repeal of the ACA, which would take away affordable health care for about 18 million Americans, constitutes "freedom" when it comes to the Freedom Caucus. Meadows said the caucus' position from the start has been to repeal and replace the legislation on the same day, noting that the group supported the replacement plan put forth by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). It needed a few amendments, he added, but it was never considered in earnest. "I ultimately think what we'll end up with is a partial repeal with a partial replacement that takes part of a couple of different things to address the freedom aspect that you're talking about," he said. "Because ultimately, if you're mandating somebody that you have to do X, Y and Z, it's not freedom." The other point is that this is a compassionate society, he said, and "we want to make sure there's a hand up" for those who are struggling. Koch said Meadows did a fair job of answering the question, but could have added more detail. Meadows said he's been working around the clock on the issue for the past few weeks and has been trying to get different groups together for negotiations. If something is brought to the table to help bring down premiums, he's willing to make concessions as well, but there haven't been meetings because of a reluctance to give up ground. "There has not been a willingness on their part to meet, and part of that is because they believe that if they beat me up long enough that I'll finally say yes, and that's just being blunt about it," he said, adding that he won't vote for something that doesn't drive down premiums.  Premiums have gone up by 30 to 35 percent, and under the AHCA would have continued to increase in the short term for Western North Carolina, he said. For the 11th District, they'd probably continue to increase over a 10-year period.  Another problem with the bill is how it handles the safety net aspect, covering people up to 850 percent of the poverty level, where the ACA covers those up to 400 percent of the poverty level, Meadows said. That may sound good, but the truth of the matter is that those earning 400 percent or below would have received less under the AHCA. "My conservative philosophy says if we're going to provide a safety net, provide it for those that have the greatest need," he said. "Under the GOP plan, I would be getting a check from the federal government to help me pay for insurance, and I'm well above the poverty line, and I didn't think that was fair." Obamacare has hurt a lot of people, Meadows added, and is something he campaigned against. But he also wants to make sure that if it goes, it's replaced with something better.  "It's critically important for me to make sure that we get it right," he said. "Even if it sends me home for doing the right thing." Two-state solution He was also asked if he feels the two-state solution is the best route for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He answered that that's the political answer — that a two-state solution is best — but if that would have solved the conflict, it would have solved it long ago.  Meadows, who serves on the Middle East and North Africa subcommittee, said if it was just a geographical issue, Israel and Palestine would make an agreement. What he thinks it will take is Israelis and Palestinians working together, adding that at a manufacturing facility, he saw Jews and Palestinians working side-by-side for the benefit of one another, even while fighting was taking place just a few miles away.  Special prosecutor for Russia investigation Meadows said it's premature to bring in a special prosecutor for the ongoing investigation into possible Russian interference in last year's election. The Senate Intel Committee, which is looking into the matter, is bipartisan and they need to be allowed to do their job, he said. There's more headlines than substance, based on what he's heard from committee members.  If the committee is inconclusive or leaves some doubt once it's finished, at that point, further action like a special prosecutor or select committee would be appropriate, he said.  Internet privacy Bobby Slagle, an 18-year-old senior, asked Meadows how recent legislation to undo a Federal Communications Commission privacy rule, which is awaiting Trump's signature after passing the House, would benefit him as an individual.  If Trump signs it into law, it could eventually allow internet providers to sell customers' browsing information.  Meadows said his staff went back and forth on the measure, an issue where he saw truth on both sides. It came from a transparency standpoint on the issue of jurisdiction between the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.  It was a difficult vote, as the measure would allow the sharing of cookies and other things, he said, adding that he'd be glad to follow up with Slagle on the issue. "I feel like he didn't answer my question," Slagle said, describing it more as "dancing around" the answer.   School vouchers A teacher asked Meadows about school vouchers, citing studies that show public schools making strides in improving test scores while charter schools weren't. He asked why money would be taken from successful public schools like West to be given to "a failing experiment somewhere else." The short answer, Meadows said, "is that you wouldn't." Meadows said he has unparalleled passion for public schools and that when he looks at the issue, he doesn't see it as the necessity of taking money from public schools, rather providing more options and "not boxing somebody in to a particular geographic location." Henderson County has great schools, but that's not always the case elsewhere, he said. "I'm an advocate to say, 'Let's strengthen our public schools; let's give students more options,'" he said. "But let's make sure the results match it. The reports that you're talking about are critically important." Trump budget proposal Meadows said he has different agendas on the budget than the outline presented by President Trump, not only concerning the Appalachian Regional Commission, which Trump's outline eliminates, but also with other areas like Meals on Wheels, the cuts to which he called troubling.  "We're going to be working on our budget to hopefully" realign some of the priorities for Western North Carolina, he said.

That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious?

Twitter Facebook The laptop is dead Here's my open-and-shut case on why the venerable laptop is on its way out Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 01 April, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments You may never buy another laptop. Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Twitter Facebook It’s not game over for Apple TV -- yet Software updates have kept the device current, but new hardware is essential to besting rivals Michael deAgonia (Computerworld (US)) 01 April, 2017 21:40 - - - - print email Comments Every day. That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious? 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Shares traded lower earlier in the session after Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer told CNBC the Fed had not yet decided whether to raise interest rates in September. However, the market largely recovered in the final moments of trade. Share this story File picture After several volatile sessions that at one point pushed the S&P 500 to its lowest level since October 2014, the three major U.S. indices ended the week with gains. “A lot of investors are rebalancing their portfolios before going into the weekend,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. Many on Wall Street have been hoping the recent global market turbulence and worries about China's economy would lead the Fed to hold off raising rates. This expectation was reinforced on Wednesday by comments from New York Fed President William Dudley. However, following Fischer's comments on Friday, overnight indexed swap rates implied traders now see a 35 percent chance the Fed would raise rates in September, up from 22 percent earlier in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.07 percent at 16,643.01 while the S&P 500 edged up 0.06 percent to 1,988.87. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.32 percent to end at 4,828.33, driven by a 2.52 pct rise in Intel Corp. For the week, the Dow gained 1.1 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq added 2.6 percent. The S&P remains down more than 5 percent from when the market began to sell off on August 18. The turmoil has prompted several strategists to cut their end-of-year forecasts for indexes. Credit Suisse, for example, cut its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 2,100 from 2,200 on Friday. Half of the 10 major sectors rose, with the energy index jumping 2 percent as oil added to gains.. The utilities index lost 0.42 percent. Chevron's 3.6 percent gain provided the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500. Data released on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending picked up a bit in July, further evidence of strength in the economy. Autodesk dropped 4.96 percent after the maker of computer-aided design software cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast. Big Lots was jumped 15.67 percent after its second-quarter profit beat expectations and the company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. While the Dow and S&P were negative, advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,917 to 1,114. On the Nasdaq, 1,882 issues rose and 877 fell. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 22 new lows. Volume was lighter than in recent days. About 7.8 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, compared to an average of 11.2 billion in the past five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

Available in both Windows 10 and Windows 7 flavors, Lenovo is also targeting the P320 at small and medium-sized businesses that might want to do some design work in VR without breaking the bank. With a relatively staid design, the tower itself will actually be available in both a full-size tower or small form factor once it launches. On the inside, you'll find processor options ranging from Intel's Kaby Lake i3 through i7 chips on up to the Intel Xeon E3-1200 v6. Graphics options include NVIDIA Quadro P1000 and P4000 chips, and the tower can be configured with up to 64GB of 2400MHz DDR4 memory. As for storage, you can add up to 16TB, but your fastest M.2 option maxes out at 2TB. Lenovo says that the ThinkStation P320 will go on sale at the end of April. And though we don't have an exact price at the moment, the company is specifically targeting the P320 at those looking for workstation power at the price of a desktop.

Twitter The laptop is dead Here's my open-and-shut case on why the venerable laptop is on its way out Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 01 April, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments You may never buy another laptop. Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop. Join the TechWorld newsletter!

Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious? Join the TechWorld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

In fact, people might not even notice you wearing it, but what this little device can do is way beyond your imagination. This futuristic wearable is revolutionising human-computer interaction using hand gestures. In short, you might not need a mouse to access your project on the laptop; you’ll only need to move your hand. Sounds amazing right! Ready to hear something unbelievable? The KAI is the brainchild of two 20-year-olds, Adarsh Warrier and Abhishek Satish, engineering students from VIT, Vellore. They created the minimalistic wearable that crowned them the victors at Demo Day 2016. “Imagine you’re a car designer. Usually, if you want to look at a specific part of your design, you will need to use the mouse to scroll to that section. But here, just wear the band, imagine that you have a 3D model in your hand, and move it. The KAI senses your movement and you can see the part that you want to zoom in on displayed on the screen,” explains Adarsh. With an idea that sounds like something out of Iron Man, this student duo broke new ground at the Intel Hackathon in Pune. “Abhishek had conceptualised the original design when we were at the hackathon last year. And within 24 hours, we created our first prototype called Mark 1. This could control a light bulb as well as a computer with different gestures,” he says. The only trouble they faced, was that their invention didn’t have a company registration. This prompted them to set up their own start-up, Vicara Tech that houses Project KAI. “Our vision, when we started the venture, was to set up an electronics-hardware ecosystem in India, rivalling that of America and China. With the rise of IT, app-based start-ups have been on the rise, but everyone ignores the significance of hardware in our economy. We want to change that and make India self-sufficient in that aspect,” says Adarsh.           Reach Out: vicaratech.com O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Jobs Wisdom Jobs Sarkari Result Freejobalert Latest Bob Dylan receives his Nobel Literature prize 400 CRPF jawans hospitalised in Kerala JCO killed in IED blast along LoC in Poonch Drunk Britons arrested for harassing AI air hostess 29 stranded Keralites to be brought back to Kerala by next week Soviet era Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko dies at 84 40 cows carcases recovered from UP farmhouse Gallery Movie stars who hid their actual identity behind their pseudo names FBI releases never seen before pictures of  9/11 Pentagon attack arrow Videos Dangal girl Sanya Malhotra plans to climb Mt.

Flynn resigned Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, in the wake of revelations about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

John Hickenlooper really feels about marijuana Denver’s Navajo Street Art District teeters as galleries escape rising rents By Steven T. Dennis, Chris Strohm and Billy House, The Washington Post The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser would have to go through several steps before lawmakers would consider offering immunity in exchange for his testimony. Rep. Adam Schiff of Washington said that he would discuss Mike Flynn’s offer with the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice Department, and that he would need to receive details about what Flynn would say. “As with any investigation — and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day — there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered,” Schiff said Friday in a statement. Trump encouraged Flynn to seek immunity from prosecution Friday morning, calling investigations into alleged contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government a political “witch hunt.” “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!” Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using shorthand for Democrats. While it’s unclear if Trump was coordinating with his former adviser, Flynn has told investigators that he’s willing to be interviewed in return for immunity from prosecution. “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, said in a statement late Thursday. “We will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place.” Jack Langer, a spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee, said that the panel “had a preliminary conversation with Michael Flynn’s lawyer about arranging for Flynn to speak to the committee. The discussions did not include immunity or other possible conditions for his appearance.” Flynn’s lawyer suggested immunity is justified because his client is “the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated.” Kelner, a partner at Covington and Burling LLP in Washington, said: “No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.” Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, was forced out of the Trump administration after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. after Trump’s victory.

Defense Secretary James Mattis said Friday at a London news conference with his U.K. counterpart that Russia “is choosing to be a strategic competitor.” Its violations of international law are a matter of record, including its Crimea annexation and “mucking around” in other countries’ elections, he said. The House and Senate Intelligence committees are also investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including any contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, was one of Trump’s closest advisers during the campaign and was one of the more vocal critics of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, even leading chants of “lock her up” during his Republican National Convention speech regarding her use of a private email server. “I mean, five people around her have had, have been given immunity,” Flynn said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in September. “When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime.” Flynn briefly held one of the most sensitive jobs in the Trump administration as national security adviser, which carries the highest-level security clearance. He has been at the top of the list for Democrats and others investigating the possible Russia connections. In the weeks after Flynn left the administration, new details emerged about his business ties with Turkey’s government and Russian entities. Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, did for a Dutch consulting company, Inovo BV, which has ties to President Recep Erdogan of Turkey. Flynn’s filing showed that his company received $530,000 from Inovo between Sept. 9 and Nov. 14. Kelner wrote in a letter accompanying the filing that Flynn had previously registered with Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but made the new filing because the work could have been interpreted as benefiting the government of Turkey. Lobbying on behalf of a foreign government requires registration with the Justice Department. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee are seeking documents related to Flynn’s security clearance applications and contacts and payments from Russian, Turkish and any other foreign sources including the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, dating from Flynn’s 2014 retirement from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the present. Democrats on the House committee last week released documents showing Flynn received more than $45,000 from RT for taking part in a December 2015 gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin’s table. Other documents showed that Flynn, who received $11,250 for a 2015 speaking engagement in Washington for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm; and an $11,250 payment from Volga-Dnepr Airlines. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said the retired lieutenant general “both informed and fully briefed” the Defense Intelligence Agency about his Russia trip beforehand and when he returned. — Bloomberg’s Toluse Olorunnipa, Robert Hutton and Terrence Dopp contributed.

A recent joint study by NASSCOM and Zinnov titled Indian Startup Ecosystem Maturing - 2016 estimates that the number of start-ups in India could cross 10,500 by 2020. With a promising future outlook outlined for the country's start-up sector, industry experts are looking at prominent entrepreneurial centres such as Bangalore, Delhi/NCR, and Mumbai as the most likely locations for the next big billion business to emerge from India. Unfortunately, they might be looking in the wrong direction. Startups from tier-2 and tier-3 cities are giving their metropolitan peers a run for their money, underlining why the next 'Unicorn' start-up might emerge from these geographies. Sounds too good to be true? A quick look at the results some of the startups based in these relatively untapped goldmines of entrepreneurial talent have earned will put to rest any doubts. Rajkot-based Balaji Wafers and Namkeen group, which started out as a home enterprise, is today worth Rs 4000 crore and holds a sizeable share in the Indian as well as the international snacks market. Kolkata-based Wow! Momo is on a similar growth curve. Having started off as a bootstrapped venture with Rs 30,000 way back in 2008, the quick service restaurant (QSR) start-up is at present the country's largest momo chain with physical presence in Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Delhi/NCR, Coimbatore, Pune, Thrissur, and Digha. The startup registered a turnover of Rs 50 crore in the 2015-16 fiscal, and is now planning to go international after having secured Series A funding of $2 million from Indian Angel Network (IAN). Odisha-based dairy start-up Milk Mantra, which has more than 43,000 farmers from 800 villages as a part of its network has also recently raised $10 million from Neev Fund after having become EBITDA positive in FY 2015-16. Another remarkable entrepreneurial success story to emerge from tier-2 ecosystems is that of Beardo, an innovative male body grooming start-up launched in October 2015. Backed by veteran actor-turned-entrepreneur Suniel Shetty, the brand has witnessed immense traction for its range of products comprising beard washes, beard balms, beard & hair growth oils, serums, face washes, beard & hair wax, soaps, and beard combs. Considered to be amongst the top brands in the male body grooming space, the venture has over 200 salons across Ahmedabad, Pune, Mumbai, Surat, and Delhi. Beardo's innovative product line and consumer traction were the main reason why FMCG major Marico recently acquired a 45% stake in the brand. This success is not just limited to startups operating in the FMCG sector. FusionCharts, a privately held software provider of data visualisation products which started out as a one-man operation in Kolkata, today has more than 23,000 clients and 5 lakh users. It serves prominent Fortune 500 companies like Google, ZOHO, Cisco, Nokia, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Facebook, Apple, Intel, IBM, EMC, and Tibco as well as The Weather Channel, NASA, and the Federal Government of the United States. A full-stack SaaS-based e-commerce logistics reconciliation platform based out of Ahmedabad, DSYH (Don't Scratch Your Head) is supporting leading e-commerce marketplaces such as Amazon, Paytm, Flipkart, and Snapdeal, as well as logistics operations for BlueDart, Aramex, Delhivery, and FedEx. Its disruptive, tech-led approach has helped in streamlining operations for merchants affiliated with online marketplaces in India, earning the start-up industry-wide recognition for improving the e-commerce seller ecosystem. Girnar Soft, the parent company to India's top auto portals CarDekho.com, Gaadi.com, and Zigwheels.com, was incepted in Jaipur, as were fintech start-up RazorPay and on-demand outstation cab service HippoCabs. Other cities, such as Pune and Chandigarh, have also been home to promising startups such as Xpressbees, Busibud, and LearnVenue. Several factors have contributed to the rise of an alternate startup ecosystem based in these relatively untapped markets. Government-led initiatives such as 'Make in India' and 'Start Up India' have generated significant interest in the entrepreneurial landscape in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, encouraging public and private entities to join hands with state and local governments to develop start-up friendly ecosystems. The 'Start-up Chhattisgarh' initiative launched by the Chhattisgarh government, as well as various TiECon events organised in cities like Chandigarh and Pune, highlight this push for fostering entrepreneurship beyond the metros. The launch of regional centres affiliated with leading innovation and investment platforms such as Venture Catalysts has also led to greater mobilisation of high net-worth individuals (HNIs) as angel investors to start-ups across India. The increase in the number of co-working spaces such as Innov8 has also allowed start-ups to grow and flourish without needing to invest too much capital into establishing their own setups. All these factors have not only led to an increase in the amount of funds available to promising early-stage ventures from smaller cities, but has also boosted the country's overall innovation quotient and fostered the creation of a more robust and interconnected start-up support ecosystem. The writing is on the wall - start-ups in tier-2 and tier-3 cities are making their presence felt in the larger entrepreneurial landscape in India owing to their innovativeness and willingness to create local solutions for global problems. They are fundamentally rooted in the communities they belong to, and are therefore more attuned to the requirements and demands of their target audiences. With more than 60% of the country's population currently residing in the semi-urban, tier-2/tier-3, and rural geographies, ventures operating out of smaller towns and cities have easier access to promising business opportunities and resources. It is time for the key stakeholders in the Indian start-up community - investors, government agencies, and private entities alike - to cast a wider gaze, as they prepare for the imminent arrival of the next Indian Unicorn.

The International Trade and Industry Minister II was commenting on US President Donald Trump's list of "trade cheats", in which Malaysia is among the countries claimed to be responsible for the US' nearly US$50bil (RM221bil) trade deficit. The others listed are Japan, Germany, Mexico, Ireland, Vietnam, Italy, South Korea, China, India, Thailand, France, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia and Canada. Ong said the bulk of Malaysia's exports to the US are electronics manufactured by American companies here. "Perhaps Trump does not know that there is a huge presence of American manufacturers in Malaysia, such as Intel and Western Digital, due to the low production cost here. "The electronics they make here are brought back to America as semi-finished products to be assembled into computers and handphones," Ong said. He was speaking to reporters after officiating the Xianning-Kuala Lumpur tea promotion and tea culture exchange conference here. Quoting February trade figures, he said 53% of exports to the US are electronics produced by companies from there, while the rest were made up of things like furniture and chemical products. He added that taxes are imposed on goods entering the US as the countries do not have a free trade agreement, and therefore exports to the US have always been low.

Schultz will remain with the company, running its premium Reserve brand and shepherding its new Roastery locations — among other tasks. With long-time CEO stepping down, Starbucks is looking for a smooth handoff to his successor The Washington Post Apr 1, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Kevin Johnson, right, who has served as Starbucks’ chief operating officer, will take over for CEO Howard Schultz on Monday. Schultz will remain with the company, running its premium Reserve brand and shepherding its new Roastery locations — among other tasks. Will the third time be the charm? Starting Monday, Starbucks will begin answering that question when it officially hands over the coffee company’s reins to Kevin Johnson, its president and chief operating officer, marking only the third time the top job will be held by someone else at Starbucks in the nearly 30 years since Howard Schultz first became chief executive. Seventeen years ago, Schultz handed the title to Orin Smith, a longtime company insider, and five years later, it went to Jim Donald, a former grocery executive who’d run the company’s North American operations. Schultz stayed on as chief global strategist and chairman, yet he remained actively involved — a vocal chairman who spoke out on earnings calls, kept the same physical office at headquarters and penned a famous leaked email in 2007 about how the Starbucks brand had become commoditized. Amid a global recession, the board fired Donald, and Schultz returned to the job in 2008. As Schultz sees it: “There is no more important responsibility for a CEO of a public company than to get succession planning right.” Now, Schultz and Johnson will again attempt one of the most delicate transitions in all of business: The handoff by an iconic, wildly successful CEO or founder to a successor. It’s a paradigm of its own, fraught with potential for ego clashes and muddled lines of authority, and one of corporate America’s most precarious high-wire acts. For founders and CEOs closely associated with a brand’s success, their identities “are often hyphenated with the enterprise,” says Jeff Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. Schultz, for his part, says he’s ready. Asked in a recent interview whether he’ll find it hard not to meddle, he said, “I don’t think it’s going to be challenging at all. Kevin and I have laid out a very specific level of understanding between us in terms of role and responsibility, and I’m going to respect that.” That division of specific roles and responsibilities is also what observers say could help the succession stick this time around. Schultz has carefully outlined what he plans to spend his time doing in his post-CEO role: running the company’s premium Reserve brand and shepherding its Roastery locations, the company’s new sprawling, tasting-room style temples to coffee. In addition, he’ll continue to lead the company’s social impact initiatives, such as hiring refugees across its global locations and offering college benefits to baristas. “He’s got meaningful projects to work on, something he’s really impassioned about,” said Sonnenfeld, who described Schultz’s role in the first CEO handoff as less well-defined. Steve Mader, a managing director with the executive search firm Korn Ferry, agreed that when many founders or high-profile CEOs pass the reins, they don’t have such a specific mandate. “They come to work every day, but they basically find themselves as a quasi-supervisor of the CEO, working old relationships,” he said. “What’s often going on when a founder leaves is an experiment in leaving his or her post.” Mader, who says he knows Johnson well, also believes the duo have complementary skills. Johnson is the former CEO of Juniper Networks, so his tech background versus Schultz’s retail and services history will come in handy. “They learned to work together as CEO and COO, and their skill sets are so different I don’t think they’ll have any trouble carving their jobs out,” he said. But it doesn’t always go so well. Business history is littered with stories of iconic CEOs who clash with their successors. One recent example: Ralph Lauren handed the CEO title to outsider Stefan Larsson, but the two couldn’t agree on creative direction for the fashion brand and Larsson is leaving the company less than two years after he started. Jason Schloetzer, a professor at Georgetown University who studies CEO succession, says the indefinite nature of Schultz’s executive chairmanship is unusual, as are the responsibilities Schultz will retain. “This is a lot of detailed involvement for someone who’s relinquished day-to-day operations,” he said. Yet it can also work well. Sonnenfeld cites examples such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates or Intel’s Andy Grove, saying both were iconic CEOs able to remain in the post while carving out distinct strategic roles from their successors. “The conventional wisdom is they should move on,” he said. “But the conventional wisdom is often wrong if they can define a meaningful role.” Investors, for their part, are glad to see Schultz remain actively involved, said Sara Senatore, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein. The company is growing fast in China and rolling out a host of new digital and retail initiatives, but U.S. sales have missed analyst expectations five quarters in a row, and the company trimmed its full-year revenue forecast in January. “Schultz’s presence is far more likely to be viewed as a positive than a negative,” she said. “If he were to segue entirely, investors would view that unfavorably.” Having been through this before, Schultz has also surely learned something about the succession planning process. He told the Harvard Business Review in 2010 that “in all fairness” to former CEO Donald, “I don’t think I did that well.” And in “Onward,” a book Schultz wrote in 2012, he acknowledged that being a chairman was “like a parent standing back and watching his children make their own choices,” one that “had its unique emotional challenges” for him. Now, Schultz says he — and Johnson — are ready. He said he’s involved the leadership team more in this transition to help them feel they had a stake in the outcome. And he says he’s learned the value of having his successor spend more time learning from the inside — Johnson was COO for two years but has been on the board for seven. With this succession, “I was much more deliberate and thoughtful,” Schultz said, “by taking a longer view of how to do this in a way where there would be no pressure to assume the level of responsibility until there was the proper immersion and the opportunity to really understand the company from the ground up.” Meanwhile, Schultz has said he is more prepared on a personal level. Emotions about the handoff, he said, would probably come when he was onstage at the annual meeting March 22 rather than on the official day. “We’ve been planning this for so long,” he said. “I feel very comfortable in my own skin with regards to the decision.” Tags Howard Schultz Work Economics Company Kevin Johnson Commerce Jeff Sonnenfeld Brand Jim Donald Investor Ceo Recommended for you Featured Businesses NP Dodge Real Estate | Council Bluffs | IA Council Bluffs, Iowa 1032 Woodbury Ave , Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-328-5008 Thompson Music 14220 Fort St, Ste 103, Omaha, NE 68164 402-289-9699 The Fountains Ballroom West 4714 N. 120th St, Omaha, NE 68164 402-496-3000 Blooms & Bouquets 1111 N 13th St #422, Omaha, NE 68102 402-730-2640 Currently Open Coziahr Heating and Air Conditioning 1409 3rd Ave, Council Bluffs, IA 51501 712-323-5782 Currently Open Advanced ChiroCare 7 N Sixth St, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-256-5440 In case you missed it Omaha City Council approves development package for 'visionary' $1.2 billion project near Boys Town North End Teleservices is Omaha Chamber’s Small Business of the Year Stage Stores, winner in Gordmans bankruptcy auction, will operate 50 locations and keep open Omaha distribution center Trump eases way for coal, but market leans away Former owner of Wohlner’s, Omaha's oldest grocery store, dies at 94 Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders’ yellow brick road leads to Berkyville and the Wizard of Omaha Thanks to Berkshire’s success, Warren Buffett is giving away a fortune that just keeps growing Replay: March 28 Warren Watch chat Tweets by @OWHmoney loading...

Commercial release of DDR5 RAM might take a while, however.  ( David Friedman | Getty Images ) Advertisement DDR5, the next generation of RAM, will offer twice the speeds of current-gen DDR4 RAM come time it's released, according to JEDEC, an organization setting the terms of computer memory standards. The typical modern computer still houses a DDR4 RAM; some still have last gen's DDR3. But of course, in the fast-paced motion of technological advancements, everything seems short-lived, and things change a lot in a short amount of time. The same can be said for DDR4 RAM, as you may have guessed by now. As Ars Technica reports, JEDEC will be holding a demo of the new cards in June 2017, with finalizations set in place by 2018. In addition to being twice as fast as its predecessor, DDR5 RAM will be more power efficient, although the organization wasn't able to provide exact metrics illustrating by how much. "As planned, DDR5 will provide double the bandwidth and density over DDR4, along with delivering improved channel efficiency. These enhancements, combined with a more user-friendly interface for server and client platforms, will enable high performance and improved power management in a wide variety of applications," says JEDEC in a statement. When Will DDR5 RAM Be Released? Despite the imminent demo, it might take long before DDR5 hits commercially, as was the case with DDR4. So if you're worrying about your recent purchase of current-gen chips — don't, because the release of DDR5 chips will might take a while. This delay might stem from memory controllers in processors and SoCs needing to be upgraded to natively support DDR5 technology. This redesigning process typically takes two to three years from conception to finalization. By contrast, DDR4 RAM was finalized in 2012, but it wasn't until 2015 when the technology was able to reach the mainstream threshold. Consumer processors manufactured by Intel and other companies helped the commercialization of DDR4, and a similar trajectory is needed for DDR5 to traverse the same fate, which it will, eventually. If DDR5 mirrors the DDR4's development schedule, commercial DDR5 RAM might not arrive until 2021. But hopefully this time it won't take as long. For now, no other metrics can paint a vivid picture of what DDR5 RAM can offer, save for the fact that it's poised to double the speeds of current-gen RAM technology. It's all pretty nebulous at present. The point is, don't contemplate whether you're getting a bang for your buck if you buy DDR4 RAM now, because DDR5 is still a ways to go, anyway. A Potentially RAM-Free Future? RAM technology is a crucial element of powering computer, so the notion of it going completely kaput is a hard one to swallow. However, as Ars Technica notes, in a few years, enough innovation in technology might push us to start exploring the idea of RAM-free setups. Optane drives by Intel are attempting to combine the capacity, density, and non-volatility of an SSD with RAM-level speeds. This version of future may or may not come, though if it does, it'll no doubt signal a whole new paradigm shift in computing technology. Thoughts about DDR5 RAM?

Beth McKenna (TMFMcKenna) Mar 31, 2017 at 8:51PM Graphics and mobile computing specialist NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) core gaming market continues to perform wonderfully, and its emerging markets are growing fast. The company has the potential to hitch a ride on the growth trains of many technologies widely expected to explode in the coming years, from virtual reality (VR) to driverless cars. Reflecting its superb fiscal 2017 financial results and immense growth opportunities, NVIDIA's stock has returned a whopping 211% over the last year through Thursday.  Here are 10 reasons to buy NVIDIA stock and hold on for the long ride:  1. NVIDIA is in the right general business Over the last few decades, technology has become an increasingly large part of our world. Numerous emerging technologies promise to further "tech up" the consumer and industrial spaces. This dynamic has led to increasingly strong sales in the semiconductor industry.  Projected 2017 revenue is nearly $354 billion. Image source: Statista. As to NVIDIA's specific business, the company operates in two main segments: graphics processing units (GPUs) and Tegra processors. In fiscal 2017, these businesses accounted for 84.3% and 11.9% of total revenue, respectively. (There's also a small "other" category.) NVIDIA's flagship GPU segment's main processor product lines include the GeForce for gaming, Quadro for design professionals, and Tesla for cloud computing. The segment also includes the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2, a scalable artificial intelligence (AI) computing platform for driverless vehicles. End markets for the Tegra business, which produces processors that integrate a computer onto a single chip, are things that are mobile -- from consumer gadgets to autos and drones. The company's four core market platforms are computer gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. 2. It's led by a founder-CEO  NVIDIA gets high marks on leadership. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is a co-founder of the company, so he knows it intimately. He also has a lot of skin in the game: he owned 1,751,179 million NVIDIA shares as of March 15, valued at $191.6 million based on Thursday's closing price of $109.40 per share. Huang, who has a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford, worked as a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, before founding NVIDIA in 1993. Huang gets a thumbs up from 98% of the 588 Glassdoor ratings from current or former employees, with the company itself garnering 4.3 stars (out of a total of 5). Huang is 54 years old, so investors probably don't need to be concerned that he'll retire soon. In early March, the first batch of what NVIDIA touts as its most powerful GeForce card ever, the $700 GTX 1080 Ti, sold out in 30 minutes, even with a two-card-per-customer limit. Image source: NVIDIA. 3. Its dominance in discreet GPUs  NVIDIA is the dominant player in discreet GPUs, which is its core business. In the calendar fourth quarter of 2016, NVIDIA held a 70.5% share of the market for discreet GPUs, with competitor AMD holding a 29.5% share, according to industry monitoring and analysis firm Jon Peddie Research.  4. Its financial performance proves it can execute Data by YCharts. In fiscal 2017, which ended Jan. 29, NVIDIA's year-over-year revenue grew 38% to $6.91 billion, earnings per share based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) soared 138% to $2.57, adjusted EPS jumped 83% to $3.06, and free cash flow rose 37.6% to $1.50 billion. Both segments grew, with GPU revenue increasing 39% to $5.82 billion and Tegra revenue rising 47% to $824 million. (There was $264 million of "other" revenue.) NVIDIA's powerful growth in fiscal 2017 is especially impressive because it's a good-sized company with a market cap of $64 billion.  5. It's been whipping Wall Street's estimates In the last two quarters, NVIDIA smashed Wall Street's EPS estimates by 46% (Q3) and 19% (Q4). This supports the belief among some, myself included, that analysts' future estimates will also prove too conservative. If this premise proves true, the stock's valuation may not be as pricey as it seems at first glance. Image source: Getty Images. 6. Its great performance in its core computer gaming market Market Platform                           Fiscal 2017 Revenue                  Year-Over-Year Change                 Computer gaming    $4.06 billion (58.8% of total revenue)  44%  Data source: NVIDIA.  The company predicts continued solid growth in its core gaming market due to growth drivers like VR, eSports, and the adoption of broadband in emerging markets.  7. Its phenomenon growth in its data center and auto markets Market Platform                           Fiscal 2017 Revenue                  Year-Over-Year Change                 Data centers   $830 million (12% of total revenue)  145%  Automotive $487 billion (7% of total revenue)  52% Data source: NVIDIA.  8. Its explosive growth opportunities  Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's products have applications in numerous hot tech spaces that are widely projected to explode in the years and decades ahead, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence, driverless cars, and cloud computing. (There's some overlap in these categories, as driverless cars and cloud computing are AI-driven apps.)  Laying out NVIDIA's current market sizes with the company's estimated total addressable market (TAM) sizes -- the annual revenue opportunity available for it to capture -- we can clearly see its phenomenal growth opportunities:  Market  NVIDIA's Market Size in Fiscal 2017*   Total Addressable Market (TAM)**   Gaming  $4.06 billion  $20 billion   Professional visualization (includes virtual reality and augmented reality)  $835 million  $6.5 billion   Data center $830 million  $5.0 bilion   Auto  $437 million  $8.0 billion  Data sources: *NVIDIA's fiscal 2017 earnings report; **NVIDIA's Sept. 2015 Corporate Presentation. NVIDIA's customer and partner list reads like a Who's Who of the corporate world. Here's just one example of its growth opportunities: Tesla Motors has long used NVIDIA's Tegra processors to power its vehicles' standout infotainment systems and instrument clusters. In October, Tesla began using NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 AI-computing platform to power its Autopilot on all new Model S and Model X vehicles. The more affordable Model 3, slated for release later this year, will be similarly equipped. This isn't to say NVIDIA's road to growth in its various markets will be speed bump free. Tesla, for instance, had been working with Israeli company Mobileye on its Autopilot efforts before the companies' ugly public parting. In mid-March, chip giant Intel announced a $15.3 billion deal to buy Mobileye, so NVIDIA is in for some stiffer competition in the emerging driverless car market. 9. Its commitment to shareholders NVIDIA's commitment to returning value to shareholders is evidenced by its dividend and stock buyback programs.   Data by YCharts. It's quite rare for fast-growing tech companies that have considerable growth opportunities to pay dividends. Granted, NVIDIA's dividend is modest, with a current yield of 0.52%. However, the dividend has grown 56% in approximately three years. The fact that NVIDIA pays a dividend at all suggests that management is extremely confident of the company's continued success and resultant strong FCF.  NVIDIA has been actively buying back its stock, which suggests that management doesn't view the stock as overvalued, or at least not significantly so. In fiscal 2017, NVIDIA spent $739 million on share repurchases and paid $261 million in dividends, so it returned a total of $1.0 billion to shareholders. Since the restart of its capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, it's returned $4.02 billion to shareholders, representing 88% of its cumulative FCF for this four-year period.  10. Its valuation is palatable given its growth potential Data by YCharts. NVIDIA stock's absolute valuations are high. At Tuesday's closing price of $107.30, it is trading at 42.4 times trailing-12-month earnings, 46.2 times trailing free cash flow, and 32.8 times projected forward earnings. However, when we bring growth into the equation, the stock's valuation is more palatable. The forward PEG (P/E to forward projected earnings growth) of 1.18 is pricey, but far from outrageously so. Many factors come into play, but a rough rule of thumb is that a PEG of 1.0 implies that a stock is about fairly valued. Moreover, if you believe that analysts' forward earnings estimates are too conservative, then this PEG would be overstated.  Summing it up Huang's statement in NVIDIA's Q4 earnings release provides a great summary of what I believe to be the primary bull case for NVIDIA stock: Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.‎ Deep learning on NVIDIA GPUs, a breakthrough approach to AI, is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars, early cancer detection and weather prediction. We can now see that ‎GPU-based deep learning will revolutionize major industries, from consumer internet and transportation to healthcare and manufacturing.  Beth McKenna has no position in any stocks mentioned.

I welcome people to also come back in the future and restart the thread with new news and parts. The thread is about how to make the maximal PC processing systems to handle complete work flows realtime going into the future, particularly 8k and above. I'm gong to kick off with some unconventional hardware and configurations. Any companies that would like to sponsor this effort by doing workstations, plug ins drivers and updated applications to take advantage of these configurations in the background off site are welcome, remembering if you want to be involved in the thread at all you have to strictly seek Redusers administration's official permission first, as are their rules. As this is not their initiative, they are under no obligation to allow any company to post here. Any outside system builder enthusiast should also seek their permission too. These objectives are open to other top end uses as well, such as 3D and simulation/engineering/scientific uses, which hopefully will be complimentary, but establish a business case to service this sector. I expect Red will progressively move towards 16k for rendering purposes of 8k footage, but there has long been developed 16k holographic filming technology, that needs to move far beyond that to achieve 8k resolution. Plus, advertisers need to move far beyond that again for street level billboards and video billboards. Touch table products are in need of 16k or more for work spaces. Start While I am pursuing the highest performance system, I am hopeful of also being able to get a better system than today with cheaper half priced parts. I am looking at systems past single CPUs, even single main boards, and separately beyond the twin GPU configurations. Processing farm: So, I have heard of rack systems, where each blade may contain many individual computer modules in a blade, and you keep stacking blades. As well are rack systems full of many GPU's. Another option is just to string PC's together. I understand that large data sets ate ideal for these sorts of parallel and processing farm like solutions, but our software is not usually written to distribute the workload across many threads or PC's. I understand that the usual parts used here (we don't need to use them) are not optimised for workstation use, but can properly written software out do our present top of the line systems on these parallel processing configurations? Enabling software: What sort of plugins, drivers can be written to enable existing software to use these systems (and which software allows this). How would a company write (the technology to do) such plug ins and drivers, or even software to do this. These answer are not simple yes or no answers, but complex and justifiable. We currently are seeing single socket 36 core AND processor systems. How useful. The future Linux, Windows and undoubtedly the Mac, are moving towards ARM. ARM is moving towards higher performance for server space. Some ARM systems like the Apple A11 and Nvidia CUDA GPU enabled Tegras offer much higher processing densities and lower energy consumption, but at the moment a lot lower single thread performance. However they are a reasonable candidate for above 5Ghz implementations, but just gave not received performance implementations at such speeds. These can be integrated into massive processing systems on a 1KW budget, even 200w, as a single cheap old Mosis compares favourably at 10watts of more with an i3 in Linux, plus it has an CUDA array. Intel alphas Phi, and a desire to integrate that with normal processing functionality. The Phi currently is like a mini processing farm. Opencore RiscV processor us aimed at being more efficient than past Each, including ARM, and has attracted so lot of industry attention. We will soon probably face mass arrays boards of these. At the moment Linux programs are probably best poised to take advantage of these configurations, with even x86 binary to arm transliteration software modules available to run x86 Linux binary, and others to run windows. Apart from old ARM parallel processing requiring more careful programming (new r Ella cemented has already been announced, and new processing architecture to be announced latter in the year) how suitable might these be give the software? WPU cards: Finally, a plea to the manufacturers. GPU's have a lot of circuitry that is not needed for non 3D display/Game heavy processing purposes. While every PC might have a GPU configuration for display purposes, it would be desirable to have cards stripped of these excess parts with the freedom up space dedicated to higher processing densities for custom, cuda, other code, alongside the GPU, a Workstation Processing unit (WPU). As such, these cards with the exiting of an ARM, or other, section for control, could act as a parallel processing computer board that could be further turned around and used on a card in a blade back plane. A new high density processing platform: A previous proposal of mine was for a blade system with an optical bus back plane linking inserted rows processing cards (like PC's, GPU's or WPU's) card to cats, or through a control card, and optical links from rack to rack to rack. Using standard high speed optical technology this far exceeds the performance of PCI-e, and rather than a contact protocol is meant to be a donkey maximum speed low latency parallel protocol. This also fits in a lot with the idea of present rack with computer modules, useful for cooling cards in blade systems. There you go, some useful ideas. Knowledgeable people will already know a lot more than me about the blade modular systems. Since when has denying that the possible is possible been reason? Such is the life of some skepticism. Normalcy involves what is realistically possible, not just what you say. Inferiorly superior (humbleness) rather than superiorly inferior (arrogance). - Reputation is something the unwise apply. But integrity is what the wise apply.     Quick Navigation Post-Production HARDWARE Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

Digital Trends Home > Computing > The Asus Zenbook UX370 is on its way, according to… The Asus Zenbook UX370 is on its way, according to recent FCC documents By Mark Coppock — March 29, 2017 2:54 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Your choice of Windows 10 2-in-1 will get just a little more difficult in the near future, if a recent FCC certification filing is any indication. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can be a hotbed of information on new and often unknown devices. Every gadget that utilizes the airwaves and might interfere with other gadgets has to make its way through the FCC eventually for testing and certification, and sometimes products hit the FCC before much else is known about them. One such machine appears to be the Asus Zenbook Flip UX370, an upcoming Windows 10 2-in-1 device that would replace the UX360. It appears that the Zenbook UX370 hit the FCC certification process and some interesting information has been uncovered, Liliputing reports. More: Asus may reveal a refreshed ZenBook Flip UX300-Series 2-in-1 in late February Up to now, we’ve known that the UX370 was going to be a “hero” device for Asus, taking its place as the company’s top 13.3-inch 360-degree convertible device. Judging by the specs of the current UX360, the next model is likely to offer a low-power seventh-generation Intel Core Y processor and will sport up to a QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) resolution display. We reported on the UX360 specs previously and here is a refresher to aid in speculation on what might arrive with the UX370: Screen size: 13.3 inches with Touch Screen resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 at 60Hz 3,200 x 1,800 Operating system: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Pro Processor: Intel Core m3-6Y30 Intel Core m3-6Y54 Intel Core m3-6Y75 Intel Core i5-7Y54 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 (integrated) Intel HD Graphics 615 (integrated) System memory: 4GB LPDDR3 at 1,866MHz (up to 8GB) Storage: 128GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD 256GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD 512GB SATA 2 M.2 SSD Webcam: HD web camera (facing) HD camera (back) Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Bluetooth 4.1 Audio: 2x 1.6-watt speakers Digital array microphone Asus SonicMaster technology Battery: 54 Watt-hour Ports: 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Microphone/headphone combo jack 2x USB 3.0 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C 1x Micro HDMI Size: 12.71 x 8.66 x 0.54 inches Weight: 2.86 pounds with battery Some details apparently uncovered by the FCC documentation help to flesh out the machine. Interestingly, the machine would reduce the battery capacity from 54 watt-hours to 39 watt-hours. The machine might incorporate a fingerprint reader for Windows 10 Hello support. A second USB Type-C connection could be added for additional support of future peripherals. In addition, Asus should offer its battery-powered pen for Windows Ink support. A mini-dock could be provided with some configurations providing HDMI, USB 3.0, and additional USB Type-C connections. Intel’s Core U-series processors could also be on hand rather than the low-power versions, but that might cause some concerns if the battery capacity is indeed significantly reduced. There is no additional information on when Asus will release the Zenbook UX370. However, the fact that the machine is going through the FCC certification process implies that it could be arriving sooner rather than later.

Lindsey Graham Saturday faced down a hostile crowd of mostly Democrats and independents at a South Carolina town hall as he backed Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court. "There are Democratic members of the Senate who want to filibuster this guy," the third-term Republican said amid boos during the session at Trident Technical College in North Charleston. "You are taking the Senate down a very dangerous path. "Don't do it." The jeering grew louder as Graham continued. "So I will vote to report him out — and if I have to, I will vote to change the rules, because I am not going to allow President [Donald] Trump to be denied the same opportunity that every president has had for 200 years because you're mad and you can't accept the outcome of an election." By then, Graham could barely be heard over the crowd, which NBC News estimated at several hundred. He also vowed that the Senate would conduct a "bipartisan and fair" investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election, even though he admitted that recent developments surrounding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn were "getting weirder by the day." "We're going to follow the evidence and not let politics get in the way," Graham said. "We're going to talk about the Flynn deal," he then added. "It's getting weirder by the day, isn't it? Yeah." Graham said he wondered how Trump officials "missed" Flynn being a registered foreign agent for Turkey during the campaign — even poking at Flynn's comment in 2016 that those connected to Hillary Clinton who were seeking immunity were admitting their guilt to crimes. "Flynn said himself, 'If you want immunity, you must, you know, be guilty,'" Graham quipped. Regarding the House Intelligence Committee and its Russia investigation, he said: "Nunes. The House. They're off in a ditch." Graham was referring to Republican Chairman Devin Nunes, who was shown intelligence information privately on the White House grounds — data that the Trump administration apparently already had — but he told the president what he saw and not others on his committee. Those included Democratic Vice Chairman Adam Schiff. Both congressmen represent California. "I don't know who invited him to look at the evidence in the White House," Graham said, speaking of Nunes. "All I can say is, 'Why do you show it to the chairman of the Intel Committee if you've got it yourself?' "That never made sense to me. "Schiff and his buddies seem to be prosecutors about every other day on TV," he added. "I hope they can get their act together and start interviewing witnesses. "Whether or not it can be salvaged, I don't know. "But opening up the files to Schiff — whatever Nunes saw, Schiff should see — it should have been that way in the beginning. "So, I don't know if they're going to get their act together." Related Stories: 5 Weeks Left For Republicans to Roll Back Obama-Era Regulations Top Trump Aide Calls for Primary Challenge to Rep.

Keith Noonan, Tim Brugger, and Daniel B. Kline (keithnoonan) Apr 1, 2017 at 11:37AM The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological shift that is opening communication between the world's devices, and it looks poised to change the way the world operates -- and generate tremendous value along the way. While increasing device connectivity and insights stemming from data analytics are already having an impact, the IoT revolution is still in its early phases, and 2017 looks to be an influential year in the progression of the tech.  To help readers navigate investing in this potentially massive tech trend, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick their choice for a top IoT stock to buy this year. Read on to learn why IBM (NYSE:IBM), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) made the list. Image source: Getty Images. Flying under the radar Tim Brugger (IBM): Much has been made of IBM's "strategic imperatives," which include data security, mobile, cloud, and artificial-intelligence-driven solutions via its Watson supercomputer, but IoT doesn't get mentioned. Don't be fooled, though: Not only does IBM have serious plans to win its fair share of the skyrocketing IoT spending in the coming years, but it's ideally positioned to do so. Imagine the amount of data the 24 billion connected "things" estimated to be in the IoT by 2020 will amass. It's mind-boggling. Storing, analyzing, and ultimately developing actionable results from all that information will require an artificial-intelligence-driven computing wonder of enormous capabilities -- otherwise, what good is all the data? Which is where IBM's Watson IoT cloud platform enters the picture. The event may have flown under the radar, but IBM committed $3 billion to its IoT initiatives nearly two years ago. Since then it's acquired The Weather Company for $2 billion, utilizing Watson to analyze and provide insights from the 26 billion inquiries The Weather Company receives every day. IBM also just took the wraps off its new Watson IoT headquarters in Munich, Germany, with projects to further its reach and expand its capabilities even more. The data all the IoT devices generate in the coming years will only be as valuable as the ability to analyze it to assist business and government with everything from customer targeting to product development. When it comes to analyzing incredible amounts of data, IBM's Watson is in a class by itself, which is why IBM is an IoT stock to buy in 2017. A retailer benefiting from the Internet of Things Daniel B. Kline (Best Buy): Electronics retailer Best Buy has faced and survived some major challenges in recent years. One of them has been that while televisions, laptops, and other electronics have gotten better, they haven't changed dramatically. That makes it less likely a consumer will come into a store to see the latest model, which not only costs Best Buy sales, but also robs it of the opportunity to sell warranties or installation services. The explosion of IoT devices will benefit the retailer in two ways. First, shoppers are likely going to be more willing to come to stores to actually look at products in a category they are not very familiar with. This is already starting to happen in Best Buy stores as more shelf space has gone to connected-home products and other items in the broad IoT category. The second major benefit for Best Buy is that in many cases customers will want the benefits of IoT, but need help installing the devices. Even doing something simple like setting up an Amazon Dash ordering button may be beyond the ability of some Best Buy customers. That should create service and Geek Squad sales opportunities for the retailer. Going forward, Best Buy could even increase this type of service by working with manufacturers to embed Geek Squad service calls into the functionality of more-complicated IoT devices. A smart appliance could in theory order its own repairs before it breaks, and the retailer would be well-positioned to handle some of those service calls. IoT will spur demand for this company's chips Keith Noonan (Xilinx): Many chip companies have been seeing strong momentum thanks to IoT, and Xilinx stands out as a leader in a semiconductor segment that could see continued benefits from growing machine-and-sensor connectivity. The chipmaker specializes in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) -- semiconductor solutions that can be programmed after manufacturing rather than having a set process.  FPGAs are especially useful at the beginning of technology cycles, when the likelihood of changes and smaller market size make it less feasible to use expensive chips designed for a specific purpose. With the Internet of Things ushering in a range of new technologies that will change and evolve at a rapid pace, there's a good chance that FPGAs will see increased demand. The rollout of the 5G networks needed to facilitate the growing wave of machine-to-machine communication will be one source of momentum for programmable chips, but Xilinx has other opportunities related to IoT.  Intel's acquisition of Xilinx's rival Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 pointed toward the growing importance of FPGA chips for data centers. Notably, Xilinx is winning influential customers in the space, having recently signed deals with Baidu and Amazon to provide data center solutions. The chipmaker's FPGAs will also be used for IoT-related technologies including machine learning, cloud computing, analytics, and machine vision. Those looking for returned income have another reason to consider adding Xilinx to their portfolios. The stock currently yields 2.2%, and the company has raised its payout for six years running. With strong growth potential and dividend income to fall back on in the event of market turbulence, Xilinx looks like an IoT stock to buy in 2017.

Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 19h ago in Gadgetry Comments 312 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Cowboy Bebop Letter from the Editor Apple may have scrapped its rumored March press event, but fortunately, we were able to count on Samsung for some good old-fashioned spectacle. Actually, by the company's standards, Wednesday's Galaxy S8 launch in New York was fairly tame: There was no orchestra onstage, and attendees looking for VR headsets underneath their seats were left empty-handed. Instead, we got the heavily leaked Galaxy S8 (and S8+), along with a healthy dose of humility -- yes, Samsung is still very sorry about those exploding Note 7s. All told, the phones themselves look promising, with nearly bezel-less displays that make the devices easier to hold than their 5.8- and 6.2-inch screen sizes would have you believe. Samsung's face-recognizing personal assistant Bixby looks interesting too, though we're gonna call BS on the company's pitch that these devices represent a fresh form factor for phones -- they're still just boxes, guys. Oh, and can Samsung succeed where other companies have failed, and make phone-powered desktops a thing? Only time will tell, but suffice to say, we have some questions. There was so much happening at Samsung's one-hour press event that you may have missed, well, lots of other things going on this week. Just a few hours before the Samsung event, the first reviews of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update hit the internet. We're especially excited about built-in game streaming and some new Edge browser features, but you might end up downloading it just for Paint 3D. Meanwhile, in more sobering news, Democrats pushed the issue of cybersecurity, and the Trump administration claimed coal can be a form of clean energy.

The Polar M600, Nixon Mission, Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal and Michael Kors Access join the Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 and TAG Heuer Connected on the update list that so many other older devices will never join. Hopefully, your wristwear is on the list, though, because it looks like version 2.0 is worth the wait. That's one way to fix the problemTwitter is changing its default profile pic Twitter had the idea that new users would "hatch" into birds -- like its logo -- before sending tweets, so it made the default profile image an egg. Unfortunately, over the years, anonymous trolls have associated the egg with every kind of hate and filth you can imagine, and probably some you can't. Now Twitter is adjusting the head and shoulders of its default pic to be more inclusive and assigning a neutral gray color scheme to give them less prominence.

This, in turn, will result in improved performance with greater power efficiency. The standard will also feature a more user-friendly interface for server and client platforms, we’re told. Mian Quddus, Chairman of the JEDEC board of directors, said in a press release that increased server performance requirements are driving the need for advanced technologies and the standardization of next generation memory such as DDR5 will be essential to fulfilling those needs. As The Tech Report recalls, JEDEC first started talking about DDR3 in May 2005 ahead of the first products hitting the scene in 2007. Similarly, JEDEC published the final specifications for DDR4 in September 2012 with support finding its way into consumer products in the second half of 2014. JEDEC is also developing NVDIMM-P (Non-Volatile Dual Inline Memory Module, Persistent), a new high-capacity memory module that retains content after power is cut (kind of like Intel's Optane memory). More information on the DDR5 and NVDIMM-P standards will be shared at JEDEC’s Server Forum event in Santa Clara on June 19. The standards body said it aims to publish the design for DDR5 sometime in 2018. 5 comments 201 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Intel's first consumer-grade Optane SSD will be super-speedy, and super-small How much faster is a modern workstation for Adobe Photoshop CC 2017?
