Krzanich met with President Trump on Feb. 8 and followed the meeting with an announcement that Intel would invest $7 billion in a factory that will employ up to 3,000 people in Chandler, Arizona. The investment would complete plans for a plant that was previously started. According to Krzanich, Trump's position on taxes is what inspired him to revive the factory. Under the current tax system in the U.S., relative to overseas, Krzanich said it would cost approximately $2 billion more over the span of 10 years. "The tax plan that the administration is putting forward would drastically reduce that … we are betting on that tax plan coming into fruition," Krzanich told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Monday. Rick Wilking | Reuters Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, speaks during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017. The CEO opened up to Cramer and described what it was really like behind closed doors at the White House, stating that he considered it to be a way to start a dialogue with the new administration. "It was a good chance to sit down and talk about everything from immigration, tax reform, our position on diversity and women and underrepresented minorities in the workplace. All of those areas we were able to talk to both the president but also really substantive time with his staff," Krzanich said. Krzanich confirmed that after his meeting with Trump, he spent an hour and a half in the White House speaking to Gary Cohn, Ivanka Trump and Reince Priebus, among others, about various subjects. Intel also issued a letter to its employees and stakeholders clarifying why it was important to meet with Trump. The next day, Krzanich held a meeting with the organization to talk to them about why he did it. "We are not going to change as a company who we are. We stand for those values that we believe in," Krzanich said. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News Intel Introduces Versatile New FPGA for Industrial and Automotive Markets SANTA CLARA, Calif.–()–To serve the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, Intel Corporation today announced the Intel® Cyclone® 10 family of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Designed to deliver fast and power-efficient processing, they have a variety of uses, including for automotive, industrial automation, pro audio visual and vision systems. As the “things” become more connected and able to share volumes of real-time data among themselves, data become more difficult to process. Information coming in from sensors and cameras in buildings, factories, homes and vehicles at an increasing rate can no longer be adequately handled by microprocessors or microcontrollers alone. High-performance processing devices such as Intel’s FPGAs are able to collect and send data, and make real-time decisions based on the input from IoT devices. FPGAs can be programmed to deliver the specific level of computing and functions required by different IoT applications. The Cyclone® 10 FPGAs – Cyclone® 10 GX and Cyclone® 10 LP – have their own unique features to address different design team needs. Cyclone 10 GX is unique among other low-cost FPGAs as it can support 10G transceivers and hard floating point DSP (digital signal processing). It offers 2-times the performance increase over the previous generation of Cyclone. The architectural innovation in the implementation of IEEE 754 single-precision hardened floating-point DSP blocks can enable processing rates up to 134 GFLOPs (giga floating-point operations per second). This is important for engineers needing higher performance using the FPGA for applications such as motion or motor control systems. Markets for Intel Cyclone 10 GX include those where high I/O performance and core speed are key requirements. Uses include industrial machine vision and smart city applications that provide surveillance in parking lots , on roads and on bridges. Cyclone 10 GX is also well-suited to support pro AV technologies, such as video streaming applications. Motor-driven systems account for more than two-thirds of industrial energy consumption, and their efficient operation is vital to the smart factory. Cyclone 10 GX FPGAs enable cost-savings when using motors and drives, power assembly, computer numerical control (CNC), machine tools and robotics. By using FPGAs such as the Cyclone 10 GX, operators can benefit from significant reductions in overall cost of ownership across entire product lines. For example, operators can use Cyclone GX to lower their bill of materials costs by integrating industrial networking and functional safety in a single chip. Designers using Cyclone GX and Cyclone LP FPGAs in industrial settings can more easily reach compliance under the Machinery Directive safety standard known as IEC 61508 by working with Intel, the first FPGA supplier to obtain device and tool qualification under this important industry standard. The Intel Cyclone 10 LP is the perfect solution for applications where cost and power are key factors in the design decision. These systems typically use FPGA densities that are sub 75K LE and chip-to-chip bridging functions between electronic components or I/O expansion for microprocessors. Cyclone 10 LP can also be used for automotive video processing used in rear-view cameras and in sensor fusion, where data gathered while the car is on the road is combined from multiple sensors in the car to provide a more complete view of what is happening. The Cyclone 10 FPGA family will be available in the second half of 2017, along with evaluation kits and boards, and the latest version of Quartus, the Intel FPGA programming software.

Analysis: Twitter still lost money during an election season when the service was a major part of the story nearly every day By Brady Dale • 02/13/17 1:25pm President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House February 8, 2017. Krzanich announced an investment of $7 billion to build a factory in Chandler, Arizona. Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images This post is from “Last Week Was a Beta,” the Innovation channel’s technology news week in review. It must be frustrating running Twitter. Last week, Intel announced it would spend $7 billion on a factory in Arizona because it’s afraid of the President’s tweets. In fairness, it didn’t announce that it was afraid of his tweets, but that’s how it looks. Ever since the then president-elect’s wrestling match with Carrier over a factory relocation, primarily conducted via the microblog, big companies have been cautious about announcing moves against American workers. Intel, for its part, seems to have picked a way to get out ahead of any presidential ire. Not only did it not announce any firings, it went out of its way to let the president be seen getting credit for adding jobs. This looks like what financiers would call a hedge. Odds are, Intel knows it might later make moves the president doesn’t like, but the president might be less inclined to call the chipmaker out after he and its CEO have shared this special moment. CEOs hesitated to speak up until they knew they wouldn’t have to go it alone. If they’d condemned it one by one, they knew there would be tweeted consequences. Intel would probably quibble with this characterization of its decision, but here’s what’s clear: the company announced the factory investment in an Oval Office press conference coordinated with the president, as The New York Times reported. This president has been one of the most ardent users of his office’s bully pulpit in recent memory, and Twitter has been a great tool for him to work applying that public pressure into his day. He doesn’t have to organize a speech, call a press conference or even step out of his office. All he has to do is pick up his mobile and type a message out. It doesn’t always work, though. The president also went after Nordstrom last week for dropping his daughter, Ivanka Trump’s, clothing line. In the end, the retail chain seems to have come out ahead in the altercation, but who wins and who loses in a social media tête-à-tête with the commander-in-chief comes down to who a company’s customers are, as Bloomberg explained. It’s also worth adding that Intel probably also coordinated with the president in order to score points as the White House pursues major policy changes, such as a complete restructuring of how corporate taxes work. For example, House Republicans have been actively pressing the administration to consider changing America’s tax structure away from a profit-oriented tax and focusing solely on money earned inside the US border. Multinationals like Intel would want a place at the table as deals like this get considered. Theater like last week’s factory announcement gives the company a bargaining chip for access. But Intel, like every other major company, also doesn’t want to be the target of a Trump tweet storm. We saw that reticence a week ago as the tech industry finally came out as one condemning the president’s immigration order. CEOs hesitated to speak up until they knew they wouldn’t have to go it alone. If they’d condemned it one by one, they knew there would be tweeted consequences. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images So if the service is so powerful, why can’t it make money? Twitter earnings for the last quarter came out last week. Not only did it miss its target by $23 million, it lost $167 million. These steep losses came during Twitter’s prime time: the US presidential election. Twitter’s fiscal year runs the calendar year. It’s fourth quarter started on September 30, according to Yahoo Finance. During the election, Twitter was in the news nearly every day thanks the new President’s frequent tweeting during the campaign. If Twitter can’t make money during its prime time, when can it make money? In fact, Twitter lost $457 million for the year. Contrast it with the news from Facebook last week. Facebook turned 12 this month, but has only now finally showed signs of actually letting its customers verify the statistics the company uses to charge them. Last week, we reported on very public remarks by an executive of Procter & Gamble who said the company just won’t buy ads on sites that don’t have a third party verifying their statistics. Those remarks seem to have hit home. Menlo Park announced plans to give its advertisers more confidence in its numbers, but even with frustration growing, Facebook still makes lots of money. So even with bungled numbers and frustration in corporate America was turning against it, the world’s dominant social network ended the last quarter of 2016 with $3.5 billion in net income. That’s pretty good, but it’s still half as much as Intel plans to spend because (at least in part) it doesn’t want the White House sending any derogatory tweets its way. Seen in that light, one has to wonder if CEO Jack Dorsey isn’t sitting around asking himself how he can get in on his own company’s action.

The 2017 Razer Blade doesn't just receive this CPU upgrade over last year's model, Razer also delivers a GTX 10 series GPU, faster memory, and a new 4K UHD screen option to potential purchasers. Last year the Razer Blade packed the potent combination of an Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970M (6GB GDDR5 VRAM) into a slim unibody 0.70-inch / 17.9mm aluminium chassis. This year that power plant has been replaced with the latest Intel Core i7-7700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.8GHz / 3.8GHz), plus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5 VRAM). The chassis remains a slim 17.9mm. Elsewhere Razer has improved its Blade offering with faster memory DDR4 2400MHz rather than 2133MHz, and extra screen options. Last year there was a single screen choice; a 14.0-inch IGZO QHD+ 16:9 Ratio, 3200x1800, with LED backlight, and capacitive multi-touch. This year there are two options; a 14-inch IPS Full HD Matte (1920 x 1080), or a 14-inch 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) capacitive multi-touch screen. It’s a shame there's no 2K screen option. "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," said Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO, in a press release about the 2017 Razer Blade. "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year. Beyond gaming, it has been really gratifying to see people enjoying the power and portability of the Blade for video editing, music creation and software development." Availability of the 2017 Razer Blade will start from today: RazerZone.com in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and France will have stock from 13th Feb (today). Selected other retailers will have stocks from 20th Feb. Starting prices are US$1,899 / C$2,749 / €2,149 / £1,799. Meanwhile, Razer has scheduled rest of the world availability for March.

Posted by GoNz0 - Mon 13 Feb 2017 19:13 Like for like spec bar the GPU being a 1060 instead of a 1050 will cost £500 more than the Dell offering. £200 more I could understand, £500 they are having a laugh. I just paid £1,788 for the Dell XPS 15 2017 with UHD panel, 16gb RAM & a 512gb SSD with 3 years onsite warranty. Posted by EvilCycle - Tue 14 Feb 2017 11:24 As above I love the laptop but hate the price. I know you pay extra for the portability etc. and I understand there are people who spend a lot of time away from home that would benefit from this type of gaming machine, but I can never stop myself from comparing the specs to what you could get in a desktop for the same price, and it always puts me off because it just seems a bit excessive. Posted by decends - Tue 14 Feb 2017 19:56 i hate how much they charge for this laptop. For its price you could get a laptop with a 1070 inside of it instead. Sure its not gonna have all the bells and wistles (SSD's and crap) but its GPU will blow this thing out of the water.

Forty-nine percent of the more than 2,000 organizations surveyed said that a lack of cybersecurity skills has slowed the adoption or usage of cloud services. An additional 36 percent of enterprises said they are experiencing a scarcity of cybersecurity skills but are continuing with their cloud deployments regardless. Only 15 percent of those surveyed stated they do not have a skills shortage, Intel reported. Lack of IT Skills The findings were published in Intel Security's second annual cloud security report, "Building Trust in a Cloudy Sky." The report outlines the current state of cloud adoption, the primary concerns with private and public cloud services, security implications, and the evolving impact of shadow IT, according to Intel. "The 'cloud first' strategy is now well and truly ensconced into the architecture of many organizations across the world," said Raj Samani, EMEA chief technology officer, Intel Security, in a statement. "The desire to move quickly toward cloud computing appears to be on the agenda for most organizations. This year, the average time before respondents thought their IT budgets would be 80 percent cloud-based was 15 months, indicating that cloud first for many companies is progressing and remains the objective." Nevertheless, a dearth of security skills remains a major issue preventing enterprises from adopting cloud technology more rapidly. As a result, employees may be engaging in shadow IT activities as a result of their employers' inabilities to provide the tools they feel they need for their jobs. But Trust Is Growing According to the report, almost 40 percent of cloud services are now commissioned without the involvement of IT as a result of the ease of procurement. In addition, visibility of these shadow IT services has dropped from about 50 percent last year to just under 47 percent this year, leading 65 percent of IT professionals to report that the phenomenon is interfering with their abilities to keep the cloud safe and secure. This is not surprising given the amount of sensitive data now being stored in the public cloud; more than half (52 percent) of respondents said they have definitively tracked malware from cloud SaaS (software-as-a-service) applications, according to Intel. Despite the growing pains, trust in cloud services is actually increasing, the report noted. Most organizations now view cloud services as being equally or more secure than private clouds, and more likely to deliver lower costs of ownership and overall data visibility. Improved trust and perception, as well as increased understanding of the risks by senior management, is encouraging more organizations to store sensitive data in the public cloud.

Once the cloud has predominantly pulled the majority of companies into the cloud you will see cloud providers raising pricing and services to a back breaking level just as the cable companies have done. Cloud providers will make it very expensive and extremely difficult for companies to pull back after they have committed all of their data and hardware into cloud based companies. Sean: Posted: 2017-02-13 @ 2:58pm PT It would have been nice to include some indication of the lacked skills, the ones that were in demand etc. and where to acquire them. M. Johnson: Posted: 2017-02-13 @ 2:55pm PT Nothing is more secure than something I have control of, therefore, until and unless I gain that kind of confidence in the Cloud, it will remain nothing more than vapor on the wind to me.

Microsoft Offers Patent Troll Defense Next Article > Amazon Unveils New Conference Call Service To Take on Skype By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 14 2017 A new video and phone conference service from Amazon aims to compete with the likes of Microsoft's Skype for Business. Amazon Web Services unveiled its new Amazon Chime service today to provide unified communications tools to enable companies to host or join meetings as well as chat online, while sharing content and screens across their devices. "In a world where meeting attendees are often not in the same city, much less the same office building, unified communications has become increasingly more important," the company said in a statement. "Amazon Chime takes frustration out of meetings, delivering very high quality video, voice, chat, and screen sharing." Push-Button Conferencing Amazon is pitching the new service as a way to bring high-end quality to an aspect of enterprise technology often seen as a source of frustration for companies due to clunky or hard-to-use interfaces, bad sound and audio quality and complicated login procedures. Chime aims to deliver high-end video and audio quality while making the process of hosting or joining a meeting as simple as the push of a button. Chime calls all participants listed for a meeting when it starts so joining is as easy as clicking a button in the app, according to the company. It also provides a visual roster of all attendees, taking the mystery out of knowing who is on the call. The new service also comes with its own mobile and desktop apps that can be synchronized across multiple Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows devices. Amazon said Chime can also be integrated into existing corporate directories, and also allow IT administrators to manage identities and control access across their organizations. Easy Deployment Perhaps most attractive for IT departments, Chime doesn't require deployment or upfront investments, since enterprises can just download the app. Additionally, Amazon said it costs about a third as much as competing solutions. "It's pretty hard to find people who actually like the technology they use for meetings today. Most meeting applications or services are hard to use, deliver bad audio and video, require constant switching between multiple tools to do everything they want, and are way too expensive," said Gene Farrell, vice president, enterprise applications, AWS, in the statement. The service is now available in three versions. Amazon Chime Basic is free and lets a user attend meetings, call another person using voice or video, and use its messaging and chat capabilities. Amazon Chime Plus adds user management, such as the ability to manage an entire e-mail domain, disable accounts, or configure Active Directory, as well as 1 GB per user of message retention, for $2.50 per user, per month. And Amazon Chime Pro adds the ability to host meetings with screen sharing and video for up to 100 users and also includes support for mobile, laptop, and in-room video along with unlimited VoIP support for $15 per user, per month.

In contrary to most currently known Optane products, that are low capacity caching drives, this Optane drive is a full fledged SSD with a capacity of 375 GB and up to 500,000 IOPS. The specs are posted by a Taiwanese website which took them from a document that briefly appeared on Intel’s website. The P4800X is a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe add-in card. It’s expected that in the same P4800X series also drives with capacities of 750GB and 1.5TB should become available. When Intel and Micron first announced 3D Xpoint memory the companies claimed it would be 1000x faster than traditional NAND memory. When looking at the specified sequential read and write speeds this promise doesn’t seem to hold up. With 2,400 MB reads and 2,000 MB/s writes the first Optane SSD doesn’t impress as Samsung’s NAND based 1TB 960 Pro SSD is able to read data at 3,500 MB/s and write data at 2,100 MB/s. The 3D Xpoint memory does impress when it comes to latency and IOPS. Where the Samsung has a specified maximum 440,000 IOPS for reading and 360,000 IOPS for writing, the P4800X impresses with a specified 550,000 IOPS for random reads and 500,000 IOPS for random writes. Intel specifies a typical latency of 10 µs which is half of that of Intel’s own P3700 SSD. Even better, the sheet states that 99.999 percent of read and write operations will be performed in less than 150 or 200 microseconds (respectively), even with a queue depth of 16. Another advantage of 3D Xpoint memory appears to be endurance, something Intel and Micron also boasted about when the memory was announced. The P4800X is able to withstand at least 12.3 Petabytes of data written to the drive which is way more than the 800 TBW (0.8 PWB) of the 1TB Samsung 960 Pro. Although it’s unknown what the P4800X will cost, it’s likely the price will be a disadvantage over NAND SSDs. Another disadvantage is the power consumption. The PX4800X is listed to use 18 watts, while e.g the Samsung drive only draws up to 5.7 watts. When looking at the spec of this first Optane drive it doesn’t seem to live up the expectations Intel and Micron set for 3D Xpoint powered drives. It’s not 1000x faster than NAND and it doesn’t have 1000x the endurance of NAND.

Razer Razer made its slim 14-inch Blade into one of the smallest VR-ready PCs last September by dropping in Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. That's now being joined by the latest "Kaby Lake" silicon from Intel. Announced today, the Blade will run on a seventh-gen 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, updated from its sixth-gen Core i7-6700HQ. We haven't seen big performance differences between the two, but it's always nice to have the latest components. Plus, it's joined by 16GB of faster 2,400MHz DDR4 memory. Also, with the last version, Razer added a matte 14-inch IPS 1,920x1,080-resolution display alternative to its high-res 3,200x1,800-pixel touchscreen. This time around you'll have a 4K UHD (3,840x2,160-pixel) touchscreen option, alongside the full HD screen -- Intel touts this generation of chips being particularly efficient with 4K video. The new 14-inch Razer Blade starts at $1,799 in the US and £1,899 in the UK, which roughly converts to AU$3,100. The full HD model is available now on the company's site and at other US retailers from February 20. Worldwide availability will rollout in March, while the 4K UHD model won't arrive until sometime in Q2. Razer keeps the Blade thin. Razer Aside from the processor and memory bumps and the high-res display, the slim system remains pretty much unchanged from last year's models. 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of VRAM 16GB of system memory (DDR4, 2,400MHz) Choice of 256GB, 512GB, 1TB PCIe-based SSD storage Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (802.11ac + Bluetooth 4.1) One USB-C Thunderbolt 3 and three USB 3.0 ports HDMI 2.0 video and audio output 3.5mm headphone/mic combo jack 0.7 x 13.6 x 9.3 inches (17.9 x 345 x 235 mm) Full HD weight: 4.1 pounds (1.86 kg) UHD touchscreen weight: 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg) A gaming laptop with a colorful personality The Razer Blade is one sold-separately accessory away from being ready for high-end VR. by Dan Ackerman 1:20 Close Drag Editors' Top Picks See All Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Starting at: $1,699.00 Apple's Touch Bar -- a thin screen that replaces the function keys on the new MacBrook...

With their latest v5.4 release, StreamDSP has added support for Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs as well as Intel Stratix-10 FPGAs to their already impressive list of supported FPGA families. The StreamDSP sFPDP IP core is a fully-compliant implementation of the Serial Front Panel Data Port (sFPDP) communications standard, as defined by the VITA 17.1-2003 specification. StreamDSP Serial FPDP IP now supports the following FPGA devices: Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+, Virtex UltraScale, Virtex-7, Virtex-6 LXT, Virtex-5 LXT/FXT, Virtex-4 FX and Virtex-II Pro Xilinx Kintex UltraScale, Kintex-7, Artix-7, and Zynq-7000 Xilinx Spartan-6 LXT Altera Stratix-10, Stratix-V GX, Stratix-IV GX and Stratix-II GX Altera Arria-10, Arria-V GX, Arria-V GZ, Arria-II GX, Arria-II GZ, and Arria GX Altera Cyclone-V SOC and Cyclone-IV GX Microsemi Igloo-2 StreamDSP provides "ready-to-run" simulations, evaluations, and reference designs targeted to popular development boards for each of the supported FPGA families. This allows StreamDSP's customers to quickly and easily verify proper operation both in simulation and with their chosen device family and greatly shorten integration time. The wide range of FPGA device support also allows StreamDSP to do extensive compatibility testing between different FPGA families using their own array of development boards, sFPDP based equipment, and a sFPDP protocol analyzer from Absolute Analysis. The sFPDP IP core from StreamDSP makes it simple for customers to connect Altera and Xilinx devices together with very high bandwidth connections. "Over the past several years we've seen our customer base for the Serial FPDP IP core increase substantially. Our customers appreciate knowing that we're always busy adding support for the newest FPGA families, as well as continuing our support for the older families. Having this wide range of device support allows our customers to choose any FPGA device family they like for each program while retaining a common user interface to the high-bandwidth serial link," said Greg Schueller, StreamDSP's Director of Business Development. "The new UltraScale+ and Stratix-10 families enable an incredible amount of processing to be done in the FPGA, and Serial FPDP continues to be the high-speed serial protocol of choice for remote sensor applications. Many customers also choose Serial FPDP to allow simple plug-and-play connectivity between Altera and Xilinx devices," added Greg. To support the growing number of requests for even higher bandwidth, StreamDSP also provides a multi-lane wrapper that can be used to channel-bond several sFPDP lanes together. This gives StreamDSP's customers access to very high-bandwidth multi-lane data paths. In addition, StreamDSP is currently involved in the definition of VITA 17.3, which will be the successor to VITA 17.1, providing advanced encoding and native channel bonding.

Aside from the upgraded chips, the Blade is virtually unchanged from its predecessor, except for a slightly higher price, with the Blade now starting at $1,899 versus the previous model’s $1,799 price tag. The extra hundred dollars gets you a 2.8GHz Core i7 Kaby Lake processor (instead of a 2.6 GHz Skylake i7 chip), along with the same Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a 1080p display. The Kaby Lake-equipped Blade with the 1080p screen configuration will be available on Razer’s website starting today in North America and Europe, while a 4K touchscreen variant will ship sometime in Q2 later this year.

Lady Gaga Halftime Drone Swarm show was pretaped to shield the crowd (no drones or planes were allowed near the stadium on the day of the game) This artful drone swarm is not the first, though it is probably the highest-profile spectacle of its kind in the United States. Drones and dance troupes appeared on talent shows, drones have danced with humans alone in a field, an earlier Intel drone swarm set an early Guinness World Record with a dancing display. And there is my personal favorite, a small swarm of just 20 aerial robots performing before Mount Fuji, lights and flights creating a vibrant, thick sky. At the end of their Half Time performance, Intel’s drones spelled out the name of the show’s other big sponsor, Pepsi. Each one of Intel’s “Shooting Star Drones” weighs under 10 ounces, can fly for up to 20 minutes, and flies at around 6 mph. Yet it’s the computing that really stands out: the whole swarm of 300 flying robots are controlled by one pilot and one computer, with a second pilot on hand in case of emergencies. Coordinating flying swarms has applications far beyond just entertainment. The Pentagon tested an autonomous drone swarm in October 2016. Those robots, coordinating with each other and flying together towards set objectives, represent the first wave of military swarming, with smaller, cheaper flocks of robots replacing or complementing the jobs previously done by bigger, more expensive craft. The US military has launched 103 miniature swarming drones from a fighter jet during a test in California.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel releases Unite collaboration tool By Sead Fadilpašić News  Collaboration is getting new toys. Shares Intel recently announced the launch of the new Intel Unite, a wireless meeting platform that works regardless of the device employees are using at any given moment. Intel Unite comes with a bunch of new features and capabilities, including analytics, extended support for more devices, extra features and more control for IT professionals.  “Using Intel Unite software on Intel’s Core vPro platform not only increases employee productivity, but delivers security and manageability features to drive peace of mind for my IT team deploying the solution. We’re finding that Intel Unite is easy to use, manage and has saved us significant time,” commented Adolfo San Martin from Acciona. First up is the Advanced Analytics. With the help of the new telemetry plug in, IT pros can track usage, including how often meeting spaces are utilised, for how long they’re used, and in which state is the technology used at those meetings. Besides Windows and Mac OS X, Intel Unite is now also available on iPads and Androids, with Chromebook support ‘not far behind’. Meeting Control now offers more control for meeting administrators. Different permissions can be set up, which is essential for, for example, classrooms. In terms of security, aside from the already available Rotating PIN, Intel Unite now offers Static PIN, as well.

The new processor is based on the Broadwell-EX die and has approximately a 200 MHz higher base frequency than its direct predecessor, released in Q2 2016. Intel said that the new CPU has set a number of records in various benchmarks. Intel’s customers interested in the chip will also have to pay a record price too. The flagship Intel Xeon E7-8894 v4 processor features the Broadwell-EX XCC (extreme core-count) die and has 24 cores with Hyper-Threading technology, 60 MB of L3 cache, 165 W TDP, a default frequency of 2.4 GHz and a turbo frequency of up to 3.4 GHz. Like other Broadwell-EX XCC CPUs, the new chip has quad-channel DDR3/DDR4 memory controller support and can manage up to ~3 TB of DRAM per socket (when used in conjunction with four Jordan Creek 2 scalable memory buffers). The CPUs are also equipped with 32 PCIe 3.0 lanes and three 9.6 GT/s QPI links for multi-socket environments. Intel E7-8800 v4 Xeon Family   E7-8867 v4 E7-8870 v4 E7-8880 v4 E7-8890 v4 E7-8894 v4   E7-8891 v4 E7-8893 v4 TDP 165 W 140 W 150 W 165 W 165 W 140 W Cores 18 / 36 20 / 40 22 / 44 24 / 48 10 / 20 4 / 8 Base Freq 2400 2100 2200 2200 2400 2800 3200 Turbo 3300 3000 3300 3400 3500 3500 L3 Cache 45 MB 50 MB 55 MB 60 MB 60 MB 60 MB QPI (GT/s) 3 × 9.6 3 x 9.6 3 x 9.6 DRAM DDR4-1866 DDR3-1600 DDR4-1866 DDR3-1600 PCIe PCIe 3.0 x32 3.0 x32 3.0 x32 Price $4672 $4762 $5895 $7174 $8898 $6841 $6841 Intel’s multi-core Xeon E7 processors are designed for various heavy-duty servers with four, eight or more sockets (to support more than eight sockets special third-party node controllers are required). Such mission-critical machines typically to be available 24/7/365 and this is why the Xeon E7 v4 and the Broadwell-EX range has a host of various RAS (reliability, availability, serviceability) features. The Xeon E7-8894 v4 CPU has exactly the same set of capabilities as its direct predecessor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4 released last year. Intel claims that due to increased default frequency (and obviously because of the core count in general), the Xeon E7-8894 v4 sets a number of performance records in various general, server, HPC, big data analytics, business processing, database and other benchmarks, such as SPECint_base2006, SPECompG_2012, and so on. The Intel Xeon E7-8894 v4 processor carries a tray price of $8898, which is the highest price of an Intel mass-produced CPU ever. Its predecessor on the top spot in the range, the 24-core Xeon E7-8890 v4 (which runs at 2.2 GHz) is priced at $7174 and still sits at its original tray price. As always, there are customers willing to pay such sums of money for server CPUs that deliver certain levels of performance. Moreover, there are workloads that benefit from a +200MHz (9%) performance increase so significantly (from a financial point of view to the owners of the machines) that it justifies paying extra 24% (or $1724) for a 200 MHz frequency increase (provided that this is the only advantage that this CPU has over the E7-8890 v4).

POST A COMMENT 68 Comments View All Comments jabber - Monday, February 13, 2017 - link Will look forward to picking one up on Ebay for £50 in a few years. Reply bill.rookard - Monday, February 13, 2017 - link Haha. Indeed. I don't think it will ever really hit $50.00 but if it falls to $250.00 it would be worth it to pick up. My question is pretty simple though. What about the Ryzen based server parts which you know will be hitting soon. The 32 core Naples chip - assuming that the Zen cores are indeed solid - and assuming that the pricing is similarly aggressive in their pricing - is likewise going to shake up the server market. I'd love to see how long that pricing at almost $9,000 per cpu will hold. Reply Black Obsidian - Monday, February 13, 2017 - link AMD's penetration in the server market has historically been almost entirely on the low end, despite having had some mid-range and even a couple of high-end (4S) offerings. It'll be interesting to see if Ryzen changes that, but I wouldn't hold my breath. For the 4S workloads I'm familiar with, a $9K CPU--or even the $100K box as whole, once you factor in 4 such CPUs and a couple TB of RAM--is a rounding error on the licensing costs of the software running on it and the professional(s) hired to use it. Reply Meteor2 - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link So what *are* the workloads for a 4S or a 8S server running these chips (and packing up to, what, 24 TB of RAM)? Running thousands of VMs in one box? Reply keeepcool - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link High Frequency Trading bots, google search, and lots more banking stuff, paired with buckets of FPGA's. Reply Kevin G - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link High frequency trading prefers low latency above anything else. Those systems often use lower core counts at higher clocks to shave off a bit of time. This chip doesn't fit well into that role vs. other models from Intel. Reply nils_ - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link Also, you don't really want NUMA in HFT, so there is little point in getting that many sockets. Reply Brutalizer - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link There are many types of high frequency traders. Scalpers needs ultra low latency, and they prefer a few highly clocked cores. Say an algorithm needs 20 steps before you can decide to trade or not, if you have 4GHz you finish 20 steps before another cpu that uses 2GHz. So HFT are not interested in these E7 cpus, they are too low clocked. The use case for these E7 cpus with up to 8-sockets, are large business servers such as SAP, databases, etc - such ERP business software must run on a single large machine, and can not be run on clusters such as SGI UV3000 servers. The largest scale-up business servers typically have 16 or 32-sockets. The largest scale-up clusters, typically have 10.000s of cores and 100s of TB of RAM - in effect a mini super computing cluster. The largest scale-up business server that SGI has, is a UV300H with 24-sockets, or have SGI released a new model with 32-sockets now? Anyway, business servers stop at 32-sockets. Scale out HPC clusters go to 10.000s of cores and above. But they can not run business software (because such software communicate too much between the cpus, so it can not spread out on a slow cluster) I have checked the "world records" that Intel claim. And they are somewhat strange. For instance, Intel claims 4-socket server world record of 43.300 saps. Well, one 2-socket SPARC M7 server reaches 30.800 saps. https://blogs.oracle.com/partnertech/entry/new_sap... And if you go to 8-sockets, SPARC M7 reaches 130.000 saps: https://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/20160531_s... So, Intel is able to claim the "4-socket sap world record" only because Oracle has not bothered to benchmark 4-socket SPARC M7 servers. Likewise with the next benchmark I bothered to check, Java specjbb2015. 16-socket Integrity HP Superdome, reaches: 776,269 max-jOPS and 84,557 critical-jOPS. The number of interest is usually the critical-jOPS. But anyway, let us compare both numbers to one single SPARC M7 cpu: 120,603 max-jOPS and 60,280 critical-jOPS. https://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/201511_spe... In other words, the 16-socket Intel E7 cpu server might have the 16-socket world record, but if Oracle just bothers to benchmark a 8-socket SPARC M7 server, then Oracle will easily get the world record. I think the other "world records" are similar. Because, typically, SPARC M7 is 2-3x faster than the fastest Intel Xeon or POWER8. And if this E7 want to compete with SPARC M7, it must be 2-3x faster than the E5-2699v4 cpu. Which can not happen. So I would be very surprised if Intel manages to snatch one single world record from SPARC M7 on a socket-per-socket basis. We all know that Intels new cpus are not 200-300% faster than the previous generation, no, they are only 10% faster or so. To compete with SPARC, Intel needs 200-300% improvements.

Almost half of 2,000 IT professionals surveyed for the vendor's second annual Building Trust in a Cloudy Sky report admitted a lack of infosec experts had slowed their cloud adoption plans. More than a third, 36%, say they're experiencing a scarcity in skills but are continuing to use and adopt cloud regardless, and just 15% of respondents said they have no skills shortage. While the skills gap has slowed 60% of engineering firms' cloud plans, the report found that the largest organisations had the most skills, and therefore were the least affected, with 23% of these firms reporting no skills gap. Growing trust in public cloud As companies struggle to source cybersecurity skills in-house, their trust of the public cloud is growing, with 85% of those surveyed storing all or some of their sensitive data (mostly customers' personal information) there, and 23% completely trusting it, compared to 13% in 2015. However, a quarter of UK companies aren't storing any data in the public cloud at all. "In the UK, low public cloud usage appears to be predominantly a trust issue, as they reported the lowest opinions of the public cloud's abilities to maintain identity and access control, and to keep their organization's data safe and secure from hackers," read the report. Private cloud drops off Meanwhile, pure private cloud users halved from 51% in 2015 to 24% in the latest report, with hybrid cloud growing from 19% to 57%. "This move to a hybrid private/public cloud architecture requires the data centre to evolve to a highly virtualised, cloud-based infrastructure," the report read. But companies cited unauthorised access to sensitive data as their top concern about private cloud, followed by IT skills for maintenance, and the requirement to maintain compliance. An average 52% of firms' data centre servers are virtualised, while 80% of companies are using containers, Intel's research found. With 73% expecting to shift to a software-defined data centre within two years, Intel found the shift is slowest at large organisations, with 10% having no plans to do so, and 29% only expecting to do so within five years. C-level get on board with the cloud Senior executives, including the C-suite, are now more aware of the pros and cons of public cloud, with 86% of IT staff saying their firm's top dogs "mostly or totally" understood these. CIOs and C-level staff expect their budgets to be weighted 80% towards the cloud in the next 12 months, and are more likely to be following a cloud-first strategy, according to the report. "These senior executives were also aware of the security skills shortage, and the affect it was having on their cloud adoption rate," the report read. They are tackling this by buying in integrated security tools, and running DevSecOps functions within the IT department. Cloud service provider issues "High costs/poor value is now the number one operational issue that IT professionals have experienced with their cloud providers in the past year," the report found, ranking it ahead of poor customer service, which came second. This marks a stark contrast with last year, when IT professionals experienced difficulty migrating services or data to the cloud. Lack of insight into cloud providers' operations remains IT professionals' top technical priority. https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-security-cloud-report-rev...

We play with the ultimate, if unofficial, NES, and see a streaming-only album win a Grammy. The ultimate NES comes with an appropriate price tag. The Analogue Nt Mini wants to be the last NES you'll ever buy Trying to play an NES cartridge on Nintendo's original, 30-year-old hardware can be an exercise in frustration. The console's ancient composite cables offer terrible image quality on modern televisions, and getting games to actually run is a ballet of resetting, jostling and, of course, blowing on game cartridges. While Nintendo's own NES Classic Edition and the Wii U and 3DS virtual consoles offer refuge for the casual gamer's nostalgic yearnings, collectors looking for a more authentic experience have had to compromise. Is it better to play on the original, but unreliable, hardware, or an NES clone plagued with compatibility issues? Sean Buckley says that with the Analogue Nt Mini, you may not have to tolerate either. They'll still be better. Intel's 8th-gen Core processors won't be revolutionary Intel has revealed that its 8th-generation Core processors, due in the second half of 2017 will be built on a 14-nanometer process for the fourth time in a row. The company is shy on what these new chips will entail, but it's claiming that it'll manage another 15 percent performance improvement -- in tests at least -- like it did with the 7th-generation Core designs you see now. Real-time weather reports from tiny drones. NASA's tiny airborne probes could help improve weather forecasts It's not easy to gather airborne weather data beyond major airports. Airliners have had a sophisticated probe system (TAMDAR Edge) for over a dozen years, but that doesn't help much in those remote areas where you may only see smaller airplanes or drones. NASA is close to covering this gap. It recently started test-flying a relatively tiny, lightweight version of TAMDAR Edge aboard an Ikhana drone. The tech promises real-time weather data on virtually any aircraft, filling in local atmospheric conditions even in barren places like the Arctic. Bigger courses and faster drones Drone Racing League lands a title sponsor for the 2017 season It doesn't have the cachet of something like the Winston Cup (yet), but the Drone Racing League says its 2017 campaign will be called the Allianz World Championship Series.

While the worldwide PC market is stagnating, the data center sector continues to see rapid growth. An Intel presentation showed that the total available market (TAM) – the maximum available revenue the company could generate if it owned the entire sector – was $30 billion for its PC CPU business. For data centers, the figure is more than double - $65 billion. As part of the company’s restructuring, “each of the functional groups inside of Intel look at their business and their investments and their strategies, in the context of making the data center a priority,” said Intel’s data center chief, Diane Bryant. “And that includes being first to launch on a next-generation process technology node, and that’s a big deal.” As noted by Fortune, with the amount of time it takes to develop each new generation of chips, we probably won’t see the effects of this shift in strategy for a few years. It’s likely to be 2019’s 10nm Tiger Lake chips that arrive for servers first, followed by the company’s 7 nm chips. While the move is unlikely to be welcomed by PC fans, it doesn’t spell the end for the platform. Like any company, Intel is just placing its primary focus on where the money is. The good news is that even as the PC market declined, the success of Intel’s Core i7 chips saw the firm raise its operating profits by 30 percent – a trend that’s expected to continue.

Credit: Ann Singer More like this John McAfee asks court to block Intel’s security spinoff Intel asserts its trademark rights against John McAfee John McAfee’s company could spoil the party for Intel’s new venture Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now A dispute between Intel and security expert John McAfee over the use of his name for another company is headed for settlement talks, according to court records. The move comes shortly after the federal court refused John McAfee and MGT Capital Investments, the company to be renamed, a preliminary injunction on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee, as part of a proposed spin-out by the chipmaker of its security business as a separate company that would be called McAfee. The chip company said in September it had signed the agreement with TPG to set up a cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. The two sides have now informed District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that they consent to a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox. MGT announced in May last year it was teaming with John McAfee to set up a security company that would be named “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc,” and would have him as the CEO and executive chairman. Intel acquired McAfee Inc. in 2011 and uses the McAfee mark for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. It countered in a letter in June that John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security-related goods and services. The letter prompted John McAfee and MGT to file a suit to seek a judgment that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT, does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. John McAfee claims he entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a precursor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. The maverick entrepreneur has argued in court that he had at no point in the agreement assigned rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. The settlement talks do not necessarily mean that the two sides will come to an agreement.

Thursday 16 Feb 2017 / Tehran - 12:35 / GMT - 09:05 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology http://fna.ir/E8KSYV Mon Feb 13, 2017 2:27 Intel Researches Quantum Computing, Neuromorphic Chips for Future PCs Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Intel realizes there will be a post-Moore’s Law era and is already investing in technologies to drive computing beyond today’s PCs and servers. The chipmaker is “investing heavily” in quantum and neuromorphic computing, said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during a question-and-answer session at the company’s investor day on Thursday. “We are investing in those edge type things that are way out there,” Krzanich said. To give an idea of how far out these technologies are, Krzanich said his daughter would perhaps be running the company by then. Researching in these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is something Intel has to do to survive for many more decades. Shrinking silicon chips and cramming more features into them is becoming difficult, and Intel is already having trouble in manufacturing smaller chips. Smartphones, PCs, and other devices are getting smaller, faster and more power efficient thanks to Moore’s Law, a 1965 observation loosely stating that the number of transistors in a die area would double every two years, causing performance to double while driving down the cost of making chips. Intel has been using Moore’s Law as a guiding star to make faster and smaller chips and reducing the price of devices. However, it is widely agreed that Moore’s Law is slowly dying, and Intel’s manufacturing struggles are growing. For decades, Intel’s business has been heavily reliant on its ability to make and deliver chips. But the process is slowing down. Intel used to advance manufacturing processes every two years, and that has now changed to three to four years. One way to resolve that crisis—which all chipmakers face—is to completely change the current computing model in PCs, smartphones, and servers. The current model—known as the Von Neumann approach—involves data being pushed to a processor, calculated, and sent back to memory. But storage and memory are becoming bottlenecks. The answer is to adopt new models of computing, which is where quantum computers and neuromorphic chips fit in. Quantum computers have the potential to be powerful computers harnessing the unique quality of a large number of qubits to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Neuromorphic chips are modeled after the human brain, which could help computers make decisions based on patterns and associations. Intel has made some advances in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips. But Krzanich’s comments lend more credibility to the company’s push to look at a future beyond today’s computing models. Some short-term answers can resolve the bottlenecks based on Von Neumann model, including Optane, Intel’s new form of super-fast memory and storage. It could unite SSDs and DRAM in systems, cutting one bottleneck. Intel is also embracing silicon photonics, which could resolve throughput issues in data centers. Both technologies have researched for more than a decade and are now practical. The chipmaker has lived off the PC industry for decades but is now looking to grow in markets like data centers, the internet of things, automotive and high-performance computing. The new focus is bringing a gradual change to the way Intel makes chips. It’s similar to the 1970s, when different types of chips like vector processors and floating point arrays were crammed together for complex calculations. For example, Intel is slapping together two separate functional blocks for applications like machine learning and autonomous cars. Intel envisions FPGAs combining with CPUs in autonomous cars. Later this year, the company will release a chip called Lake Crest, which combines a Xeon server CPU with deep-learning chip technology it picked up through its Nervana Systems acquisition. Intel is also merging an FPGA inside an Intel Xeon chip to carry out machine learning tasks. Intel is expecting a lot of data to be generated by sources like autonomous cars, which will need edge processing for tasks like image recognition, analysis, and map updates. Intel is pushing its wide roster of co-processors to the edge, and that is where the quantum and neuromorphic chips may fit. Quantum computer research is also being done by other companies. D-Wave recently released a 2,000-qubit quantum computer based on quantum annealing, while IBM has a 5-bit quantum computer accessible via the cloud. IBM is also playing with brain-like chips and has benchmarked its TrueNorth chip, which has a million neurons and 256 million synapses. Academic institutions like the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Stanford University, and the University of Manchester in the UK are also working on neuromorphic chips. HPE has shown a computer that emulates the human brain, and it intends to adapt ideas from that for servers.         Related News Minister: Iran Ups Cooperation with Foreign Researchers  LATEST STORIES (11) Syrian Army Kicks off Fresh Round of Attacks in Eastern Aleppo to Bring Al-Assad Lake Under Control ISIL Terrorists Killed in Failed Attack on Iraqi Volunteer Forces, West of Mosul Hezbollah Leader Thanks 'Foolish' Trump for Revealing 'Ugly Face of US' Syrian Army Repels Terrorists' Attack on Al-Manshia Neighborhood of Dara'a Syrian Army Destroys Terrorists' Tunnel in Deir Ezzur Bahraini Police Use Tear Gas to Break up Protests Syrians Stuck in Greece Remember Memories of Those They Left Home Assad Tells Belgian Reporter Belgium & EU Merely Obey 'US Master' on Syria Hash Al-Shabi Forces Repel ISIL Attack, Southwest of Tal Afar Protestors Rally Against Donald Trump's Immigration Policies in New York City Construction of Karbala's International Airport Begins Spokesman Deplores US Meddling with Iran's Internal Affairs Revolution Anniversary: Bahrain’s Uprising Is Far from Over Parliament Speaker Renews Iran’s Support for Iraq’s Territorial Integrity Spokesman: Iran Prioritizing Regional Stability, Security Syrian Army Kicks off Fresh Round of Attacks in Eastern Aleppo to Bring Al-Assad Lake Under Control TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian Army troops launched a new round of offensives on ISIL's positions to take control of the al-Assad Lake that is the main source of water supply to Aleppo city.

Twitter Facebook Intel, McAfee dispute heads for settlement talks Security expert John McAfee claims he did not assign rights to his personal name IDG John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 13 February, 2017 18:34 - - - - print email Comments A dispute between Intel and security expert John McAfee over the use of his name for another company is headed for settlement talks, according to court records. The move comes shortly after the federal court refused John McAfee and MGT Capital Investments, the company to be renamed, a preliminary injunction on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee, as part of a proposed spin-out by the chipmaker of its security business as a separate company that would be called McAfee. The chip company said in September it had signed the agreement with TPG to set up a cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. The two sides have now informed District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that they consent to a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox. MGT announced in May last year it was teaming with John McAfee to set up a security company that would be named “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc,” and would have him as the CEO and executive chairman. Intel acquired McAfee Inc. in 2011 and uses the McAfee mark for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. It countered in a letter in June that John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security related goods and services. The letter prompted John McAfee and MGT to file a suit to seek a judgment that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT, does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. John McAfee claims he entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a precursor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. The maverick entrepreneur has argued in court that he had at no point in the agreement assigned rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. The settlement talks do not necessarily mean that the two sides will come to an agreement. Demand for 3rd Party ERP Support Soars More from Rimini Street Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 12, 2017 at 9:00PM A while back, various leaks showed that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was planning to introduce two waves of processors for its upcoming Purley server platform -- Skylake-EP and EX, and Cannon Lake-EP and EX. Skylake-EP and EX represent all new architectures built using the company's 14-nanometer+ technology, while Cannon Lake-EP and EX were supposed to represent mild architectural enhancements of the Skylake-EP and EX chips, but with the benefit of being built on the company's upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Intel's Haswell-EP server processor. Image source: Intel. Although I can't make this prediction with 100% certainty, I strongly suspect that based on Intel's most recent disclosures, Cannon Lake-EP and EX are dead. The new "data center first" strategy As I outlined in a previous column, Intel announced that it's making a massive change in its plans in how it builds future server processors. Going forward, beginning with the 10-nanometer++, the company's third-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, server processors will be first to adopt new manufacturing technologies, with personal-computer chips adopting this new manufacturing technologies later. Intel's first 10-nanometer processor will be its Cannon Lake-Y chips targeted at low-power notebooks and 2-in-1 hybrid systems -- this is expected to go into volume manufacturing in the second half of 2017, with sales velocity accelerating in the first half of 2018. I believe that the company will introduce a second generation of chips built on 10-nanometer technology beginning in the second half of 2018, based on its Ice Lake architecture. I also believe this will be manufactured on Intel's second-generation 10-nanometer technology, known as 10-nanometer+. If we assume that Intel aims for annual product refreshes in the personal-computer market, then we should expect to see the company's third-generation 10-nanometer processor family, known as Tiger Lake, in late 2019/early 2020. Tiger Lake would presumably be manufactured in the company's 10-nanometer++ technology. If Intel's data-center group will start shipping product on 10-nanometer++ before its personal-computer chip business does, then we should expect the 10-nanometer++ server processor to launch sometime before late 2019 or early 2020. Let's call it mid-2019 for that processor family, which I believe will be codenamed Ice Lake-EP and EX. In that case, where's the room for Cannon Lake-EP and EX? Intel's Skylake-EP and EX chips are expected to launch in "mid-2017," according to recent company disclosures. If we have the 10-nanometer++ server processor pinned down to a mid-2019 launch, then the only way that the Cannon Lake-EP and EX parts, presumably 10-nanometer-based, would really fit in would be if they were to launch in mid-2018, since a product cycle of under one year in this market is highly unusual. However, over on the AnandTech forums, a user posted a slide that seemingly comes from Dell -- a leading personal-computer and server vendor. A purported Dell system road map. Image source: AnandTech Forums. In the slide, Dell shows that its server and workstation offerings will see upgrades to Skylake-EP and Skylake-W in the second half of 2017. The slide also indicates that those systems will continue to be the company's offerings through the second half of 2018. If Intel were going to release Cannon Lake-EP and EX chips in the middle of 2018, then one would reasonably expect a major server and workstation vendor like Dell to refresh its offerings to utilize those new chips. Will there be a Cannon Lake server processor family at all? I have seen evidence in the LinkedIn profiles of Intel employees that there indeed exist server processors utilizing Intel's Cannon Lake architecture. However, in the descriptions those employees provided, the chips are referred to as "SoCs" -- i.e., system on a chip. I think there's a very good chance we'll see Xeon D products, Intel's high-end server system-on-a-chip line aimed at certain types of less processor-intensive workloads, based on the Cannon Lake architecture in the future. However, I think that Cannon Lake-EP and EX -- the potential successors to the company's workhorse Skylake-EP and EX chips -- were cancelled to allow the superior Ice Lake-EP and EX products to come to market quicker than they would have otherwise.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The move comes shortly after the federal court refused John McAfee and MGT Capital Investments, the company to be renamed, a preliminary injunction on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee, as part of a proposed spin-out by the chipmaker of its security business as a separate company that would be called McAfee. The chip company said in September it had signed the agreement with TPG to set up a cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. The two sides have now informed District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that they consent to a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox. MGT announced in May last year it was teaming with John McAfee to set up a security company that would be named “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc,” and would have him as the CEO and executive chairman. Intel acquired McAfee Inc. in 2011 and uses the McAfee mark for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. It countered in a letter in June that John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security related goods and services. The letter prompted John McAfee and MGT to file a suit to seek a judgment that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT, does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. John McAfee claims he entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a precursor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. The maverick entrepreneur has argued in court that he had at no point in the agreement assigned rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. The settlement talks do not necessarily mean that the two sides will come to an agreement.

In a recent set of benchmarks, leaked by WCCFTech, it looks like this CPU is going to pack a serious punch and will not burn a hole in your pocket at the same time. Sysmark and CPUMark numbers test out the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7-1700X, which tells us that this behemoth can easily take on Intel’s Core i7 6900K and 7700K. Ryzen comes with a 3.4GHz base clock and a 3.8GHz boost clock. The CPU is also expected to come with 95W of TDP and a 16MB L3 cache. In single threaded performance, Ryzen 7-1700X comes really close to the Intel Core i7-6900K, which is clocked at 3.20GHz, however, it fails to take over the recently unveiled 4.2GHz Core i7-7700K. Also read: Lenovo Yoga Book: Why I love and hate this ultra-portable When compared to Ryzen 1700X’s predecessor, however- The octa-core FX-8350, the Ryzen 1700X is an impressive 37% faster. Other tests reveal more hidden goodies about the soon-to-be-unveiled processor. We’re seeing a massive architectural improvement with better performance and lower power consumption. In the Integer math test, the Ryzen 7-1700X completely annihilates Intel's top-end Core i7-6900K. Also in this test, AMD Ryzen 7-1700X beats the Intel Core i7-7700K (4-core at 4.20GHz) by a whopping 85 percent. This sounds too good to be true. Even in the encryption test, AMD smashed the Intel Core i7 6900K and 7700K, which have been strong performers for Intel. However, the Ryzen 7-1700X doesn’t outperform the Intel Core i7’s in every test. The Intel processors still pack a hard punch when it comes to physics and prime numbers. You’ll need to take these numbers with a pinch of salt, as these are not the official test results. However, from what we can gauge, it seems like the CPU packing will pack a serious punch. You also cannot ignore the fact that this CPU is going to be priced at $389, according to leaks by WFFCTech. In comparison, a Core i7 6900K is priced at approximately $1000 as of now.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | February 13, 2017 -- 05:29 GMT (21:29 PST) | Topic: Security Intel Today's cybersecurity landscape is in a constant state of evolution. Old malware resurfaces to attack new targets, phishing campaigns plague the enterprise, and ransomware targets our healthcare services. It is a lot to ask for cybersecurity professionals to constantly stay on top of both new and existing threats, but Intel hopes to make the job easier. Last week, Intel Security, formerly known as McAfee, launched the Threat Landscape Dashboard. The platform is a free online resource which allows users to view what the company considers today's most significant threats. Malware and digital threats are ranked based on "the prevalence of attacks that exploit those vulnerabilities," according to Intel Security. The dashboard includes information on threats as a whole, exploit kits, vulnerabilities, campaigns, and ransomware. Relationships between them are also illustrated; for example, how the RIG exploit kit takes advantage of specific vulnerabilities in software to spread different ransomware families. "For the administrators responsible for safeguarding a company's systems, networks, and digital information, keeping up is an overwhelming task, made doubly difficult because it is often hard to determine the most significant threats," the team says. To make life easier, Intel Security has also added a "risk score" for each threat and campaign, alongside a "media score" based on how much attention the press is giving specific threats. At the time of writing, the company has ranked CVE-2016-7200, a Microsoft Edge vulnerability which allows remote attacks to take place, Cerber ransomware, the RIG exploit kit, and the Methbot fraud campaign as among the top 10 threats facing consumers and businesses today. See also: Why did Intel buy McAfee for $7.7 billion? In a blog post announcing the launch, Intel researchers said the dashboard is the result of nine months' work. However, Intel Security plans to further extend the platform with an RSS feed and reference links about threats including the original source, blogs, and whitepapers. 10 steps to erase your digital footprint SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV More security news How to secure your IoT deployment in 10 steps Researchers discover over 170 million exposed IoT devices in major US cities How to handle changing privacy rules around the globe This Android Trojan pretends to be Flash security update but downloads additional malware Do you pass off your security responsibility to others?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 13 February 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM Intel, moving beyond PCs, seeks explosive growth in new technologies by mike rogoway Future-proofing itself: Intel envisions a future enabling self-driving cars, virtual reality and superfast 5G wireless networks. If Intel carries off its overhaul, the chipmaker will have remade its business on the fly and profited from the kind of technological change that has rendered other established companies obsolete. — Reuters Coming off the most eventful year in its history, Intel suggested that its transformation is ongoing and long-term.  With the PC market facing prolonged decline, executives at Intel's annual investor day said the company is depending on explosive growth in new markets or in established industries where it currently has a modest foothold.  The company envisions a future enabling self-driving cars, virtual reality and superfast 5G wireless networks. In pursuit of that goal, Intel pledged to invest billions of dollars in datacentres, artificial intelligence and computer networking.  "We're in a unique position in time where computing, memory and the requirements for large amounts of data are all converging," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said.  He was back at corporate headquarters in California for the Feb 9 meeting, a day after making a surprise visit to the White House to announce a US$7bil (RM31.11bil) investment to open an idle factory in Arizona.  If Intel carries off its overhaul, the chipmaker will have remade its business on the fly and profited from the kind of technological change that has rendered other established companies obsolete.  "When I look at Intel three years, five years out from now, I do believe the complexion of the company and where they generate their revenue is going to change significantly," said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Challenges abound, however, as Intel seeks to reposition itself in markets that haven't yet emerged with technologies it has yet to invent. Intel warned Feb 9 of slow growth and modestly lower profits over the next few years, weighed down by the struggling PC market.  Already, the transition has been painful: Intel eliminated 15,000 jobs in 2016 as it recalibrated in anticipation of the PC market's slide. It moved jobs and spending to new sectors.  And Intel warned Thursday that it will be some time before the fruits of its efforts become apparent. The company said it expects sales growth in the low single-digit percentages in each of the next three years, weighed down by continued declines in the PC market. Intel also said operating profits will be modestly lower.  Investors weren't pleased: Intel shares slid 2.5% Feb 9 to close at US$35.46 (RM157.60).  Intel's current business consists primarily of two segments: PCs, which supply most of its revenue, and datacentres, which deliver half of Intel's operating profits. Intel dominates both markets thanks to its industry leading microprocessors, with succeeding generations of technology crafted by its researchers in Hillsboro.  The PC market has been in decline for years, undermined by new mobile devices and the absence of compelling features to prompt consumers and businesses to upgrade their desktops and laptops.  And though Intel's datacentre business grew 8% last year, the company had been targeting annual growth of 15%. Intel said Feb 9 its long-term forecast is now a little north of 10%.  To compensate for those disappointments, Intel said Thursday it expects a huge boost in other markets: wireless technologies, computer memory and the emerging class of connected appliances and equipment called the Internet of Things.  Those businesses represented less than 5% of Intel's revenues last year. By 2021, though, the company envisions their share of its potential market doubling, tripling or quadrupling.  It may be unrealistic to expect those new segments to make up that large a share of Intel's business, Zino said.  "Even if you see that double-digit growth pace, it's probably not going to be big enough given the sheer size of Intel that it's going to move the needle," he said.  However, Zino said that even with the more modest growth and profit forecasts Intel issued Feb 9, the company's datacentre business is robust and has huge growth potential and by itself could fill the void created by the fading PC market.  Indeed, Intel said that it will start putting the first chips from each new generation of processor technology in datacentre products. Historically, PCs had been first to get Intel's new chips.  "This is a company that is going to be heavily driven and dominated by the datacentre business," Zino said.  At Thursday's meeting, investment analysts pressed Intel on its spending plans and declining profit margins. Krzanich, the CEO, said investors should cheer the company's investments.  Intel spends US$10bil (RM44.44bil) or more each year to upgrade factories in Oregon and elsewhere that give the company its lead in computer chip technology. With the PC market ebbing, Krzanich said Intel needs to find new areas where it can capitalize on its enormous investments.  "The minute you stop growing," Krzanich said, "you're basically saying over time the likelihood you'll run out of the ability to afford those factories and then that leadership will slowly diminish." — The Oregonian/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Taiwan’s HTC posts seventh consecutive quarterly loss One bot to rule them all?

Ten Exciting Features Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 12 February 2017 at 09:18 PM EST. 22 Comments The Linux 4.10 kernel didn't end up being released today, but was pushed back by an extra week. However, in looking forward to next weekend, here are ten of the features that excite us about Linux 4.10. See The New Features & Exciting Changes Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel for our complete and original look at the new features and changes to Linux 4.10. But for those short on time, here are ten features that get us cheering for Linux 4.10: 1. Nouveau Boost support. The open-source NVIDIA DRM driver has initial support for allowing supported graphics cards to hit their "boost" clock frequencies for achieving higher performance. The re-clocking is still done manually and static, while at least now booting the system with the NvBoost option can allow achieving higher clock speeds. This boost support delivers noticeable performance gains as shown by our own benchmarks. 2. Initial mainline Intel GVT support. Intel developers have spent years working on Xen/KVM Graphics Virtualization Technology for allowing guest VMs to use their native OS Intel drivers for accessing the underlying Intel graphics hardware of the host. With Linux 4.10 this initial support is in place, but will continue to be refined over the coming kernel cycles. 3. More AMD Zen/Ryzen enablement. Through various pull requests there's been efforts for getting the AMD Ryzen processor support squared away in the mainline Linux kernel. Stay tuned for my AMD Ryzen Linux benchmarks in the weeks ahead. 4. On the Intel side, there is Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support. TBM3 is supported by Broadwell-E CPUs and future processors for being able to boost to even higher frequencies for single-threaded workloads. The Linux 4.10 kernel finally has a Turbo Boost Max 3.0 driver although it's going to be made better in a later kernel release. 5. EXT4 DAX iomap support and XFS iomap support. This makes the DAX I/O code-paths utilize the iomap framework rather than their older code-path, which then allows for more efficient block mapping, PMD page fault support, minor bug fixes, and improvements. DAX is the direct access support in the Linux kernel for file-systems to have more efficient, direct read/write access to persistent memory storage devices. 6. Better support for the Microsoft Surface 3/4 devices. 7. More ARM platform support including the Snapdragon 808/810, Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 5X, Pine64, Droid 4, and others. There is also early work on the NVIDIA Tegra P1 / Parker. 8. Improved Raspberry Pi 3 support. The Raspberry Pi VC4 DRM driver also picked up new features for bettering its open-source graphics stack. 9. ATA Command Priority support. The priority modes include normal priority, isochronous deadline-dependent priority, and a high priority. The high priority mode signifies that there should be an "attempt to provide better quality of service for the command. The device should complete high priority requests in a more timely fashion than normal and isochronous requests." 10. While the GCN 1.0/1.1 (SI/CIK) hardware support is still experimental / disabled-by-default for the AMDGPU driver, there have been various Radeon Southern Islands and Sea Islands improvements this cycle. There have also been more AMDGPU improvements around PowerPlay / power management. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Kaby Lake Vs AMD Ryzen; Which processor Is The Best? Staff WritterFeb 12, 2017 06:46 PM EST Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email (Photo : Getty Images) AMD has basically affirmed that the Zen-based Ryzen R7, R5, and R3 CPUs (codenamed SR7, SR5, and SR3) will be distributed beginning March 2 or directly after their GDC 2017 introduction so normally Intel needs to stick to this same pattern with its Kaby Lake bets. Also, undoubtedly new Core i7 and i5 chips on the stage are coming out soon boasting of the 14-nanometer FinFET process, another report said.

Kaby Lake and 14nm processors will fill in as Intel's immediate response to the rising test that the AMD Ryzen chips are turned out to be, as indicated by WCCFTech. They will be quicker and energy efficient in the meantime with hyper-threading alternatives accessible, and the last is the conspicuous partner to the Summit Ridge processors' overclocking feature. A similar report did not say when precisely are Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K coming out however the other juicy details have been given. But, what likely to be the real draw of this Kaby Lake mid-ranger is the pricing, which WCCFTech said should be near that of the Ryzen R5 or amongst $250 and $350. Presently the Kaby Lake-X flagship bet is undoubtedly the i7-7740K, which a similar report named as the fastest quad-core processor when unpacked. The chip will occur of the Core i7-7700K so the specifications have been knocking up - 8MB of L3 cache, 112W of TDP rating and the base speed of 4.3GHz that can be boosted to 4.5GHz, basically affirming that the chip is upgraded for hyper-string. With respect to the pricing, a similar report guessed that Intel plans to introduction the i7-7740K bearing a similar tag of the i7-7700K when it initially took off. At that point, the last will be marked down and the ploy will fill in as the immediate test to Ryzen's leader R7 CPUs that AMD will make accessible in 8-center/16-thread variation, as per Wewunik  AMD versus Intel.

Cassie is a dynamic walker, meaning that it walks much more like humans do than most of the carefully plodding bipedal robots we're used to seeing. This makes it better at handling the kind of diverse and complex terrain that we walk over all the time without even thinking, a talent that's going to be mandatory for robots that want to tackle the different environments and situations that they'll need to master to be actually useful around people. IEEE Spectrum How UPS trucks saved million of dollars by eliminating left turns UPS, the world's largest shipping and package delivery service, has trucks deployed all over the world, delivering as million as 15 million packages each day. And these UPS trucks apparently never take a left turn. In the US, and other countries where you drive on the right side of the road, right turns are free, but for a left turn you need to wait for a green light. The idea is simple - removing the turns means less idling at signals, and less fuel consumption... Gadgets 360 PayPal increasing several fees starting in March Buying and selling items on the internet is about to get a bit more expensive if you use PayPal to transfer money. The San Jose-based digital payment platform announced it will be increasing some of its fees starting on March 29, 2017. Among the increased fees is a currency conversion charge increase from 2.5 to 3 percent on top of the exchange rate established by PayPal's bank. Meaning customers will pay three percent more than the bank's currency conversion difference when exchanging money internationally. MLive.com TeraHertz transmitter delivers 105Gbps wireless speeds via single channel A team of Japanese scientists have developed a TeraHertz (THz) transmitter that is capable of transmitting digital data at a rate of 105Gbps (Gigabits per second) over a single channel using the 300GHz band, which they claim could power a future generation of Mobile Broadband and Satellite links. ISP Preview Most of the web really sucks if you have a slow connection A couple years ago, I took a road trip from Wisconsin to Washington and mostly stayed in rural hotels on the way. I expected the internet in rural areas too sparse to have cable internet to be slow, but I was still surprised that a large fraction of the web was inaccessible. Some blogs with lightweight styling were readable, as were pages by academics who hadn't updated the styling on their website since 1995. But very few commercial websites were usable (other than Google). danluu.com 33C3: Edible soft robotics Certainly one of the more entertaining talks of the 33rd Chaos Communications Congress was [Kari Love]'s talk on her experiments in mixing food with function. In [Kari]'s talk at the 2016 Hackaday Supercon, she talked extensively about working on soft robotic for NASA. At the 33C3, her focus was twofold: on a fun side project to make mobile robots out of stuff that you can eat, and to examine the process of creative engineering through the lens of a project like this. Hackaday Excessive radiation inside Fukushima fries clean-up robot A remotely-controlled robot sent to inspect and clean a damaged reactor at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant had to be pulled early when its onboard camera went dark, the result of excess radiation. The abbreviated mission suggests that radiation levels inside the reactor are even higher than was reported last week -- and that robots are going to have a hell of a time cleaning this mess up.

He carefully uses his fingernail to pick up the tiny black speck inside and place it on the hotel café table. At one cubic millimeter, this is one of a line of the world's smallest computers. I had to be careful not to cough or sneeze lest it blow away and be swept into the trash. IEEE Spectrum How to setup a secure VPN server on Raspberry Pi or DigitalOcean Today we will talk about setting up your own VPN server. Don’t these tutorials already exist? Possibly yes, but they are kinda blurry, and I will try to address all the issues you might run into.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 February 2017 by Military News Intel Corporation Plans Seismic Change to Data-Center Chips For many years, when microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) would introduce a brand-new manufacturing technology, it would use that technology to build chips for mass-market personal computers such as thin-and-light laptops. In contrast, the company’s high-performance data-center processors would get the newer technologies much later. To put that in perspective, Intel began shipping the first personal-computer chips manufactured using its 22-nanometer technology in late 2011, but it didn’t introduce the first data-center chips built using that very same technology until late 2013 — a two-year gap. The same goes for the company’s 14-nanometer technology: Intel shipped the first personal-computer chips built on 14-nanometer in the second half of 2014, but it didn’t start shipping the first data center-oriented chips built on 14-nanometer until the first half of 2016 — once again, a roughly two-year gap. Intel Data Center Group (DCG) chief Diane Bryant says this practice will change going forward. Intel’s Diane Bryant. Image source: Intel. “Data Center First” Bryant described Intel’s current strategy as “Data Center First.” Although Intel’s DCG revenue is still smaller than the company’s client computing group (CCG) revenue, the PC market doesn’t really have much of a growth future, while growth opportunities for DCG are much clearer. It’s no wonder that, going forward, Intel will prioritize DCG ahead of its other business units. Over the long term, I fully expect that DCG revenues will overtake CCG revenue as DCG revenue grows and CCG revenue declines. According to Bryant, the first products to use Intel’s 10-nanometer++ technology — its third-generation 10-nanometer technology — as well as the first products to use Intel’s 7-nanometer technology will be data-center chips, rather than personal-computer chips. This approach also implies that Intel’s data-center chips won’t be first to use Intel’s 10-nanometer or 10-nanometer++ technologies. In fact, in another column, I’ll explain why I don’t think Intel will use either of those technologies for its main server processor lines at all. Why didn’t Intel do it sooner? Given that PCs have been in a slump for some time, with DCG essentially helping to pick up the slack, a natural question that comes to mind is, “Why didn’t Intel do this before?” Bryant answered this question quite nicely. “Historically, there were two limiters to going first” with Intel DCG to a new manufacturing technology, she said, indicating that DCG simply didn’t produce chips in enough volumes to make such a strategy viable in the past. “You need a lot of wafers going through the factory in order to get a new process technology up and running; we didn’t have the volume back then. We clearly have the volume now,” Bryant explained. Next, she said that “die size” — or the physical area of the chips produced — had been the second of these “limiters.” “You need a small enough die size to ramp a new process technology, given the defects are naturally higher at that time,” she elaborated. Indeed, Intel’s smallest 14-nanometer Broadwell-EP server processor, launched in March 2016, measures in at roughly 250 square millimeters — with the largest, for comparison, measuring in at 454 square millimeters — while its first 14-nanometer client processor, Broadwell-Y, launched in the second half of 2014, measured just 82 square millimeters. To get around this problem, Bryant explained, Intel is using a new silicon packaging technology called Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge, or EMIB for short. EMIB, Bryant said, “allows [Intel] to cut up the Xeon die and debug just a piece of it at a time.” “So that combination is allowing us to go first on a next-generation process node,” she said. Business and financial implications This move is going to have some interesting business and financial implications. The bad news, according to Intel, is that by migrating the server chips to the newer manufacturing technologies, gross profit margin is going to take a hit. As Bryant explained, “[T]hose early wafers on a new process node are very expensive and then that reflects back, obviously, in operating margin.” The good news, though, is that Intel is going to be facing quite a lot of competition from many companies for data-center business, and so giving its products every competitive advantage possible is going to be critical to defending its market share and product average selling prices simultaneously. That, I suspect, is why Bryant indicated that this will be an “overall win for the data center group and a win for the corporation.” Offer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 February 2017 by Military News Intel Corporation Expects to Grow Client Computing Group Profit Margin A little while back, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) merged its PC client group business with its mobile group to form its client computing group. CCG is Intel’s largest business by revenue, generating nearly $33 billion in sales during 2016. Most of that revenue comes from sales of processors and related components into personal-computer systems, although the company has seen reasonable success from the sale of chips that power cable gateways and, more recently, cellular modem chips into Apple ‘s(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. Navin Shenoy, general manager of the company’s client computing group. Image source: Intel. At Intel’s Feb. 9 analyst day, company management went over its financial expectations for this segment for 2017 — and beyond. Let’s take a closer look. Next year’s expectations Intel says it expects CCG revenue during 2017 to drop by a mid-single-digit percentage, which I take to mean between 5% and 7%. It’s worth noting that the chipmaker had originally expected flat-to-low single-digit revenue growth for this segment in 2016 when it provided a preliminary forecast at the end of 2015, and then it revised its guidance down during the year to call for a revenue decline, but it ultimately ended up seeing CCG revenue grow by 2% for the year. The company’s revenue forecast appears to be in line with its overall personal-computer industry unit forecast, which the company acknowledges is lower than what some of the estimates from third-party analysts have published. What this suggests is that Intel is not only taking what it refers to as a “cautious outlook” on the total addressable market within the personal-computer market, but that it also doesn’t expect a repeat of last year’s average selling price performance in which it saw its processor average selling prices rise, helping to offset the industrywide unit decline. As far as CCG profitability goes, Intel says it aims to see CCG operating margin outperform CCG revenue growth. Or, put another way, it expects operating-margin growth. How Intel will grow CCG operating margin longer term In a previous column, I went over why Intel expects its profit margins in its fast-growing data-center group (DCG) to deflate in the coming years . Two of the drivers expected to hurt DCG’s operating margin going forward — namely adopting newer, more expensive manufacturing technologies before CCG does and taking on a larger part of the company’s shared operating expenses — should serve as tailwinds to CCG operating margin going forward. First, if Intel is allocating more of its shared operating expenses to DCG and away from CCG, then this should have the effect of lowering CCG’s operating expenses. Lower operating expenses, all else being equal, means that more of each dollar of revenue gets turned into operating profit — in other words, higher operating margin. Next, if Intel’s personal-computer processors will adopt new manufacturing technologies only after DCG has had the opportunity to break them in, then CCG should get the benefit of higher manufacturing yields for newer products. Higher yields mean a lower effective cost per chip, which for a given selling price means higher gross profit margin. Higher gross profit margin, assuming fixed operating expenses, means higher operating margin. CCG is a cash machine, not a growth engine It’s clear that Intel is now running its personal-computer chip business for maximum profitability, not for growth. Now, this doesn’t mean the chipmaker can just halt all investments in future products or even get complacent — Intel can’t maintain its profit engine here if it builds bad products or even builds good products but markets them ineffectively. But what it does mean is that CCG is going to have to be more careful with each of its research and development dollars, and it’s probably only going to adopt new manufacturing technologies for very high-volume products once the costs of those new technologies has come down considerably. CCG is still going to be extremely important for Intel over the long term, but that importance will — if Intel is successful — continue to diminish in the years ahead. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Photogrph by Marc O'Sullivan Cratloe pupils’ prizewinning badger project Share ! tweet PUPILS from St John’s National School in Cratloe were the overall winners at the Intel Mini Scientist Grand Final, held in the Helix at Dublin City University. A special award for best visual display went to pupils from Bridgetown National School. Now in its 10th year, the competition gives pupils from fourth to sixth class the chance to explore science through project-based learning and exhibitions. The Cratloe project was an investigation into the behaviour and habitat of the Irish badger. The four winning pupils looked at the association between badgers and the spread of bovine TB and an alternative to culling was studied, in the form of vaccination. The pupils also developed their own badger repellent, based on their investigations. The winning pupils were Sean O’Brien, Marc O’Brien, Eoin Carey and Shane Leahy. As part of the prize for the overall winning project, the school will receive a grant of €1,000 from Intel. Minister Richard Bruton addressed the pupils at the prize-giving ceremony. “Science is all about asking questions about how the world around us works, asking how to improve the way the world works and finding new ways to do things differently. “Today is a day to celebrate some of our best young people, some of the best primary schools in the country and some of the best ideas. WB Yeats said that education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire and competitions like this provide you the opportunity to light that fire.” Cratloe principal, Dr Susan Frawley said she was delighted for the boys on their achievement, as it’s not every day that an award of such stature comes to their school. She said the boys were very enthusiastic and motivated from the start and that their project, The Badger – Victim or Villain, is a credit to them. “They left no stone unturned, every aspect of the badger’s life was researched, examined and written into their project. Science is very much to the fore in the school. There is a keen interest from teachers and pupils alike in the whole area of science. Every year, teachers and pupils get involved in the Intel Mini Scientist Competition, Discover Primary Science and Maths, Engineers Week, visits from Declan Holmes of Science Ireland, visits from Geoff Hunt from Heritage Schools and the Green Schools Programme,” she said. Dr Frawley praised Noelle Gleeson, the science co-ordinator in Cratloe school, and all the teachers for their hard work and dedication to the education of pupils, especially in the area of science. Class teacher, Bernadette Kennedy and Ms Gleeson said the staff are so proud of the four boys on the winning team. “Their enthusiasm and passion for the topic was commendable and inspirational from the outset. They’ve worked very hard since September and their knowledge of badgers and other wildlife has grown immensely. In total, there were 27 projects prepared by the children in the school for the regional competition and the Intel judges praised the very high standard of all the projects. “Overall, the Intel Mini Scientist Project Competition is a very worthwhile and valuable experience for all primary school children,” they said. The boys on the Cratloe team said they decided to complete a project about badgers because it was something different that people don’t know much about. “There are three sides to the story – the farmers’ side, the badgers’ side and our side. We feel people have only always thought the badger is a dangerous animal that spreads disease. But while they can spread disease, so too do other wildlife. They are not dangerous either, unless they are cornered. “We even put our hands into a badger set. When we took a photo of the set, we could see the badgers’ eyes shining in the picture. When it was announced that we won, we were shocked. We didn’t realise how big an achievement it was until the minister, Richard Bruton, said we were first in all of Ireland. It was unbelievable. There were so many other great projects. We’re now creating a repellent for badgers,” the boys declared. There were also celebrations in Bridgetown National School, after fourth and fifth-class pupils, brothers Eden and Trinity Minehan, Seàn McMahon and Emily O’Doherty were awarded the Best Visual Presentation Award at the final for their project, The Secret Lives of Crows. They designed and devised experiments for their project, investigating the question ‘do crows have facial recognition?’. The Bridgetown students first qualified out of their school and then along with others at the regional final in Shannon last November. There were 24 projects from all around the country at the national final. A spokeswoman for the Bridgetown Parents’ Council said the children were delighted they managed to “scoop” such a major prize. Sarah Sexton, head of STEM programmes at Intel Ireland, was delighted with the success of this year’s Mini Scientist Grand Final. “The projects on display are all winners in their own right and are a showcase of the months of hard work by thousands of young people across Ireland. Each student competing is a fantastic role model of creativity and enthusiasm and has done a remarkable job in sharing their work. We are very proud to be at the heart of the Mini Scientist competition and look forward to seeing all that will be made possible by these young people in the future.

Feb 12, 2017 09:55 AM EST | Andrew Davis Tags Intel, Intel Coffee Lake, intel kaby lake, amd ryzen, Intel 8th gen processor, kaby lake, Coffee Lake Although Intel hasn't revealed details about its 8th-gen processors, what is known so far is that it will be 15% more powerful than the Kaby Lake. (Photo : RedGamingTech/YouTube) Intel teased in a Twitter post an 8th-gen chip, another refinement to the 14nm process. Reportedly code name "Coffee Lake," this was also unveiled during Intel's annual investor meeting, wherein they promised that it will be 15 percent more powerful than the newly released "Kaby Lake." When we already imagined that we could move on to the 10nm process, Intel wasn't done yet. The company planned 2 further refinements to the 14nm process: the first was Kaby Lake and the second being the 8th-generation processor, although it hasn't been confirmed yet that it will indeed be "Coffee Lake." 8th Gen Intel Core on the 2017 roadmap. Better every year at #Intel. pic.twitter.com/8LHH0yxqd4 — Intel Official News (@intelnews) February 9, 2017 Intel spent most of 2016 talking about its Kaby Lake, ultimately revealing it during the CES 2017. And now they are teasing us with yet another more powerful variant that is part of the 2017 roadmap for the second half of the year.        According to Digital Trends, 3 14nm+ chip families were supposed to be launched in the second half of 2017 going into the first quarter of 2018, this being Kaby Lake-X, Skylake-X, and Coffee Lake. The high-end Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X were supposed to ride the Gamescom 2017 on August. This leaves us with Coffee Lake. The question now is: Could this be really Coffee Lake? Coffee Lake was rumored to be a set of a 6-core mainstream processor with improved design and will include "architectural enhancements." Well, it is not "Cannon Lake," simply because its architecture was based on a 10nm process node. Intel's 8th-gen processors will be based on the 14nm+ processing technology that was used in the 7th-gen chips. Relatively, the smaller the process, the more efficient the processor will be. This will allow you to squeeze more transistors onto the same-sized piece of Silicon. PCMag reports that there could be 4 variants of Intel's Coffee Lake: for ultra-low power Coffee Lake-U, for mainstream desktop Coffee Lake-S, for notebooks Coffee Lake-H, and for enthusiast desktops Coffee Lake-X. But Intel wasn't willing to reveal more outside than what they have posted on Twitter. But the product roadmap "leak" last September 2016 noted that the 8th-gen chips won't come out until February 2018. Well, it could be that the roadmap wasn't real at all or that Intel is likely making their first move as the AMD Ryzen will soon hit stores. We will have to wait for this year's conventions, Computex or CeBit, which Intel might use to showcase the teased 8th-gen chips, Coffee Lake. © 2017 Auto World News, All rights reserved.

Intel has revealed that its 8th-generation Core processors, due in the second half of 2017 will once again be built on a 14-nanometer process -- yes, for the fourth time in a row. The company is shy on what these new chips will entail, but it's claiming that it'll manage another 15 percent performance improvement (in SysMark tests, anyway) like it did with the 7th-generation Core designs you see now. AnandTech notes that the upcoming refresh might focus more on the low-voltage U- and Y-series chips you see in very thin and light laptops, just as you saw with the initial 7th-gen processors late last year. That has yet to be confirmed, however.

Intel says that future process uses will be "fluid" depending on the segment they're targeting, and that data centers will get first crack at these upgrades. Don't be surprised if the Xeon line gets first dibs on 10nm, then, or if only some mainstream chips make the leap at first. The decision might be necessary given the challenges of shrinking large CPUs down to a 10nm process, but it's likely to leave Intel feeling nervous. After all, mobile giants like Qualcomm are releasing 10nm processors this year. While mobile tablets probably won't outperform most laptops any time soon, this could narrow the gap enough that you might be tempted to skip buying a conventional Intel-based PC in the right circumstances.

 The hottest new corporate PR strategy is giving Trump credit for stuff he didn't do Jordan Weissmann, Slate Feb. 12, 2017, 8:14 AM 10,884 facebook linkedin twitter email print Brian Krzanich with Donald Trump. Getty Images/Pool On Wednesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stopped by the Oval Office for a photo op with President Trump and announced that thanks to the new administration’s business-friendly policies, his company would invest $7 billion to finish a new chip factory in Arizona employing thousands of workers. The publicity stunt raised a few eyebrows, since Intel first pledged to build the plant back in 2011 , and while the project was later paused, industry watchers did expect the company to finish it eventually. “This would have happened anyway. This was always part of their plan,” one analyst told the Washington Post . “But obviously the current administration and Intel are going to try to get some political gain out of it.” This appears to be the hot new survival strategy in corporate America, at least according to the Financial Times. Fearful that they might become the target of an angry tweet, corporate chieftains are being told to give Trump news he can brag about instead, such as new factory openings or hiring—whether or not the White House actually had anything to do with it. Per the FT: Lawyers and public relation experts are advising their S&P 500 clients to take a leaf from the US president’s media playbook and find ways to deliver Mr Trump news he can claim as personal victories. “People have understood that Donald likes to win and they need to play into that,” said another lawyer, who worked for Mr Trump during a high-profile bankruptcy case in the 1990s. “The basic strategy is to look at whether you have made an announcement in the past that you can rehash” to align with the president’s election promises. It has seemed obvious for a while that this would become standard operating procedure during the Trump years. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son demoed the playbook back in December when he stood side by side with the then-president-elect to announce that his company would invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs. Donald Trump and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. Brendan McDermid/Reuters It soon emerged that the money would come from a tech fund the Japanese telecom giant had started with Saudi Arabia in October. The obvious subtext of the meeting was that Son, whose company owns the majority of Sprint and has long dreamed of a merger with T-Mobile, was trying to curry some favor with the new administration on the cheap. General Motors seemed to pull a similar move later on after Trump threatened the company with his border tax, announcing that it was moving some manufacturing to the U.S. from Mexico (something it had already been doing). As the FT notes, “GM is not the only one making old promises new. A string of chief executives have recently vowed to create thousands of jobs and invest billions of dollars in the US. Amazon, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Foxconn and Bayer have all touted new jobs in the past few weeks.” So here we are. Trump's economic policy is a toxic combination of tax cuts and deregulations that will enrich shareholders and already wealthy executives, paired with bellicose trade rhetoric and publicity stunts to give the impression that he is creating jobs for average workers. Out of fear or self-interest, corporate America appears to be playing along with the charade. Read the original article on Slate. Copyright 2017. Follow Slate on Twitter.

Here's the deal. Pictured here is the MacBook Pro unveiled in October 2016.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple may be preparing new motherboard configurations with Intel's Kaby Lake processors for the next-generation MacBook Pro models set to launch this year. Less than four months since the launch of Apple's much-touted MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the rumor mill is again churning in anticipation of the next MacBook models. The company's latest macOS 10.12.4 public beta holds precious hints in this regard, referencing an exciting change in the processing department. The Pike's Universum blog spotted three motherboard identifiers that are not tied to any current MacBook Pro models, but use the same processing power management data as the existing 13- and 15-inch models released late last year. The files were not present in previous macOS versions, just the latest 10.12.4 beta. MacBook Pro With Kaby Lake The 2017 MacBook Pro laptops will most likely pack Intel Kaby Lake processors, adding some extra oomph. The faster Kaby Lake chips would make perfect sense, since Apple used Skylake processors for the MacBook Pro launched in late 2016. MacBook Pro models with Kaby Lake under the hood would also fall in line with recent reports indicating that Apple was slightly bumping the processing power for the upcoming models. Kaby Lake would not offer a groundbreaking improvement over Skylake, but minor improvements would nonetheless be in tow. New Identifiers Referenced In macOS 10.12.4 The Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C identifier likely refers to the two upcoming 13-inch MacBook Pro models with function keys, Apple-centric publication MacRumors points out. These models could feature Kaby Lake processors with a Turbo Boost speed of maximum 3,400 and 4,000 MHz, respectively. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 could be for three 13-inch models of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. These models could have Kaby Lake processors with Turbo Boost of up to 3,500, 3,700 and 4,000, respectively. Lastly, Mac-551B86E5744E2388 could be for three 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar variants. These models could have Kaby Lake processors with a Turbo Boost of up to 3,800, 3,900 and 4,100 MHz, respectively. Pike's Universum also verified the performance bias setting that each motherboard had and said they're likely not for desktops such as the Mac Pro or iMac. macOS 10.12.4 Apple first seeded the macOS 10.12.4 beta 1 to developers on Jan. 24 and released the first public beta of the software a few days later. The software update should bring a number of notable improvements over the previous version, including the Night Shift mode borrowed from iOS. The new-generation MacBook pro models will most likely make their debut after the macOS update is final and official, which should occur by early March. It remains unclear for now just when Apple might choose to unveil the 2017 MacBook pro models, but the WWDC event in June might be a possibility. Other rumors, however, also hinted at a potentially later launch in the second half of this year. As always, it is highly recommended to take all leaks and rumors with a hefty grain of salt until Apple officially confirms it. The references spotted in the macOS 10.12.4 beta offer valuable clues, but nothing is set in stone just yet.

A look at his statements during a press conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing." President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walks off at the conclusion of a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) THE FACTS: Officials said an operation last week that resulted in the arrest of more than 680 immigrants in various cities was a routine enforcement action like those undertaken during the administration of Barack Obama, who deported an unprecedented number of people as president. More specifically, David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out such large-scale operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report. In this Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017, photo released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows foreign nationals being arrested this week during a targeted enforcement operation conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) aimed at immigration fugitives, re-entrants and at-large criminal aliens in Los Angeles. Immigrant advocates on Friday, Feb. 10, 2017, decried a series of arrests that federal deportation agents said aimed to round up criminals in Southern California but they believe mark a shift in enforcement under the Trump administration.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Razer today launched an updated model of its Blade notebook which promises increased power and performance. The notebook weighs 4.3 pound and measures in at 0.7 inch and yet it features Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display. This is the first Razer Blade notebook with an optional 14 inch 4K display and an Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor under the hood. The notebook is capable of retaining its thickness despite the upgraded components due to its unibody aluminum construction. It also features the NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics processor with 6GB of DDR5 VRAM and 16GB of RAM. The notebook can be configured with SSD storage of up to 1TB. It features Thunderbolt 3 and the Razer Chroma keyboard. The 4K display is a nice option and even though it drives up the notebook’s price, it’s going to be worth the expense for customers who need a UHD display and don’t really care much about the battery life. For some, that’s a tradeoff worth making. Razer’s updated Blade notebook with a 14 inch Full HD display is now available for purchase via the company’s website in the United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, and France for $1,899.

Over the past three or four years the cloud industry has worked hard to stress the point that it takes security very seriously and it is often better protected than data in on-premise servers. But there continues to be a gut feeling among some users that still keeps them worrying about data integrity and that should be a chance for a reseller to step into the breach and ease their passage to the hosted world. The potential role that the channel should play has been highlighted by Intel Security, which has just released its second annual cloud security report. The vendor found that the UK is one of the most risk-averse when it comes to cloud adoption. Some of that is caused by a skills shortage making it harder for customers to move to a hosted environment, but there are also real concerns about moving sensitive data into the cloud. “Security concerns and the skills shortage seem to be holding UK organisations back when it comes to cloud adoption. Yet while our research clearly demonstrates that businesses in the UK are the least likely globally to implement a proactive cloud-first strategy, that is not preventing cloud from being adopted across the business. This often leads to shadow IT practices which make it difficult for IT to get a firm control over corporate data in the cloud," said Stuart Taylor, UKI regional director, channel at Intel Security. The Intel research found that 40% of cloud services were now being commissioned without the involvement of the IT department and the shadow IT problem was also adding to security headaches. “With more data shifting across to the cloud, it is essential that the correct security controls are put in place. By moving towards a cloud-first strategy, organisations can encourage the adoption of cloud services to increase flexibility, reduce costs and set up proactive security operations. To this end, we work closely with our channel partners to ensure they are in a position to advise end users on the steps needed to secure cloud deployments," he added. “Our channel partners understand that taking a proactive stance is key. Whether implementing integrated security solutions to ensure visibility across an entire organisation’s services, using authentication best practices or thwarting advanced targeted attacks through threat intelligence sharing, our partners are able to help companies go beyond initial protection by ensuring the correct technology is in place to rapidly detect threats and correct their systems when necessary. However, this focus on the threat defence lifecycle must go hand in hand with shifting the defender-attacker dynamic," he said. Intel Security's discoveries The firm got a fairly good insight into the current attitude towards cloud: Trust now outnumbers distrust for public clouds by more than 2-to-1. ·  49% of professionals slowed cloud adoption due to a lack of cybersecurity skills. ·  65% think Shadow IT is interfering with keeping the cloud safe and secure. ·  52% indicate a malware infection can be tracked to a cloud application. ·  62% store sensitive customer information in the public cloud.

The company is upgrading the CPU inside the device, to offer a better performance. The company is also launching a new 4K variant of the device, which will make some games look much better. Razer’s latest Blade device now comes with Intel’s 7th gen Kaby Lake processors, which means you will be able to get slightly improved performance on the device. Of course, Intel’s 7th gen processors aren’t a significant upgrade from the 6th gen processors, but the improvements can be noticeable in some cases — especially when you’re gaming. The Razer Blade is also getting a new 4K display option later this year. The new 4K UHD touchscreen option will be available for the Blade’s 14-inch variant, which means you will get the best picture quality while you are gaming. Razer will still continue to offer the Full HD display, but if you are willing to spend a bit more, you’ll probably want to get the 4K UHD display which is shipping from Q2. Razer’s Blade device comes with some other powerful features, including 16GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM running at 2400MHz, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage, and Killer Wireless-AC. The company has also released a video showcasing some of the new features of the improved Blade: The new Razer Blade with the Full HD display is available right now from Razer’s official store, starting at $1,899. The device will also be available in select retail stores starting February 20th. The 4K variant will be available from Q2, pricing details regarding the 4K variant is yet to be available.

Single page Print Aorus' GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G graphics card reviewed Flying high by Jeff Kampman  10:08 AM on February 13, 2017 If you've followed Intel's Kaby Lake launch, you'll already be familiar with Gigabyte's Aorus sub-brand. Much as Asus' Republic of Gamers products are meant to put a more gamer-friendly face on products like motherboards, laptops, peripherals, and more, Aorus is where builders will find Gigabyte's flashiest and highest-performance products. The Aorus eagle already appears on laptops, motherboards, and peripherals, and now Aorus is adding a graphics card to its lineup: the GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G. Readers feeling déjà vu on first sight of the XE 8G (as we'll call it from here on out) are justified, since most of the underpinnings of this card come from the already-superb Gigabyte GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming we reviewed last year. The card's cooler and the fans that move air through it are unchanged from the Xtreme Gaming card. That's a good thing, since Gigabyte's trio of 100-mm overlapping fans is both quiet and effective. Like any respectable modern graphics card, the XE 8G stops its fans at idle for silent running. At least from the fan side, the differences of the XE 8G are all skin-deep: an RGB-LED-backlit Aorus logo on the side of the card, a cooler shroud that's a couple centimeters deeper than the XG card, a restyled quartet of light pipes above the central fan, and subtle gunmetal-and-orange accents. The taller cooler shroud means the XE 8G is a true triple-slot affair, but its 11.5" (293 mm) length should be plenty ingestable by most modern cases. Builders looking to double up on these cards will want plenty of expansion slots at the ready, though. Flip this beast over, and the two biggest changes to the XE 8G become obvious. Aorus' engineers weren't content just to cool the GPU from the die side. Instead, the XE 8G comes with what may be a first: a copper heatsink coupled to the back of the card's PCB using a thermal pad. Aorus claims this copper plate can reduce GPU temperatures by 3° C. Since this is the age of the RGB LED, Aorus also embedded a Technicolor-backlit version of its logo on the XE 8G's backplate. The XE 8G keeps its forebear's twin HDMI outputs on its front edge for use with Gigabyte's front-panel breakout box for VR headsets. Around back, it offers three DisplayPort 1.4-ready outputs, one HDMI 2.0b output, and one DVI-D output. Pair it with the $30 VR Extended Front Panel (not included with this card), and the XE 8G will end up with three DisplayPort 1.4-ready outputs and three HDMI outputs. Stripping the XE 8G to its bones reveals the same PCB design as the Xtreme Gaming before it. Gigabyte kept that card's glorious 12+2 power phase design, and it continues to be fed by two eight-pin PCIe auxiliary connectors. Each power plug has an LED above it that'll light up in solid white if a PCIe power connector isn't plugged in. They'll also blink if the card detects a problem with the quality of the power source it's hooked up to. In regular operation, these LEDs stay off. To carry heat away from the GP104 GPU, the XE 8G's heatsink uses the same large slab of copper from the Xtreme Gaming. This plate makes full contact with the graphics chip and its surrounding GDDR5X memory. This plate doesn't extend to the power-delivery circuitry, but a group of thermal pads ensure those components are still transferring heat to the aluminum fins of the heatsink. Instead of the straight, uniformly tall fin design of many graphics card coolers, the Xtreme Edition's fins have a zig-zaggy shape that's claimed to increase the surface area and potential heat-transfer ability of the heatsink. Remove a few more screws, and the XE 8G's backplate lifts away to reveal more thermal pads for the power-delivery hardware on the back of the card and the RGB LED hardware for the backlit logo. The copper cooling plate behind the GPU remains attached by way of a beefy thermal pad, and a gentle prying motion is all that's needed to lay the PCB fully bare. Strangely enough, the thermal pad makes contact with everything but the most prominent circuitry behind the GPU, so far as we can tell. The plate itself is milled thinner in areas where it would otherwise seem to make contact with that circuitry. We'll have to see whether this plate makes any difference to GPU temps during our thermal tests.   GPU base core clock (MHz) GPU boost clock (MHz) Memory clock (MHz) Memory size (MB) GTX 1080 Founders Edition 1607 1733 2500 8192 Aorus GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G (gaming mode) 1759 1898 2551.5 Aorus GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G (OC mode) 1784 1936 2600 Gigabyte GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming (gaming mode) 1759 1898 2553 Gigabyte GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming (OC mode) 1784 1936 2600 Given how many similarities we've just observed between the GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G and the GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming, it's no shock that the clock speeds of these cards are nearly identical, as well. We wouldn't put too much stock in these numbers, though, since our experience with GPU Boost 3.0 on Nvidia's Pascal chips has shown that the chip will more or less do what it wants with regard to actual clock speed, given enough cooling hardware strapped on top. We'll observe GPU Boost 3.0's actual clock speeds in a moment. The Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G will sell for $679.99, and it's already listed at Newegg as of this writing. Let's see if its performance is a dead ringer for its Gigabyte sibling's.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) Wall Street has President Trump's ear. He meets with bankers and financiers at the White House, and he has signed orders indicating that he will accommodate the industry's needs. Meanwhile, Trump's relationship with the nation's other center of big business has been tense, sometimes even hostile. Separated by culture, politics and a long, cross-country flight, Silicon Valley and the new administration have been experiencing compatibility issues. The contrast suggests how the president's connections in business and his experience in real estate could influence his economic policies. "The tech industry and the Trump administration are talking past each other as opposed to talking to each other," said Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures. Trump's first three weeks in office have made the difference clear. He sought to impose a ban on all immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, an action that prompted outrage from Silicon Valley, where many firms rely on foreign engineers. [How Microsoft avoided billions in taxes, and what the GOP says it will do about it] A few days later, Trump ordered a review of restrictions imposed on the financial sector after the crisis and delayed a rule intended to require retail financial advisers to act in their clients' best interests. Analysts said the actions signaled the White House would be friendly to Wall Street. The financial sector is well represented among Trump's cabinet and his advisers. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, White House senior strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Treasury secretary nominee Steven T. Mnuchin have all worked at Goldman Sachs. So did Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager who advised Trump during the campaign. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao spent time at Citi and Bank of America. The technology sector does have at least one well-placed spokesman among Trump's confidantes in billionaire Peter Thiel. "Peter is, I think, influential with Trump," said economist Stephen Moore, who advised the president during the campaign. "He’s, sort of, the point man when it comes to the concerns and needs and so on of these Silicon Valley companies." Trump also formed an advisory council of corporate leaders after his election, which includes a couple of delegates from Silicon Valley: Tesla's Elon Musk and IBM President Ginni Rometty. Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick quit the group last week in response to Trump's immigration order. Financiers, however, outnumber them on the panel. The group is chaired by Stephen Schwarzman, a founder of the private equity firm Blackstone. [Trump may be ditching conservatives on one of the issues they care about most] Other members include Jamie Dimon, the head of J.P. Morgan Chase, and Laurence D. Fink, chairman of the mammoth money manager BlackRock. Patomak Global Partners chief executive Paul Atkins is also on the council -- his firm provides consulting services to the financial sector. To some degree, the discrepancy is attributable to politics. Anecdotally, there are more Republicans working in Manhattan than in the Bay Area, and Democrats in the technology industry made no effort to conceal their distaste for Trump during the campaign. "Most of the CEOs are pretty hard-core Democrats," Moore said. "You have to search far and wide to find people in Silicon Valley who believe in the things that Trump talked about." Said Ganesan: "The tech industry, during the presidential campaign, was far more vociferous in its opposition and disdain for the Trump candidacy than I think other industries were." Yet Ganesan, the venture capitalist, argued that the technology sector should find ways of working with Trump. "Ultimately, both the tech economy and the Trump administration need each other," Ganesan said. "America’s leadership in the world is driven by technology." Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association -- a lobbying group that represents large technology companies -- agreed, predicting that entrepreneurs in technology would eventually find common ground with Trump's administration on areas such as regulation and trade. U.S. digital exports "can create a competitive amount of economic value and competitiveness in the United States, and that’s the exact kind of thing that he’s been talking about throughout the campaign," Beckerman said. "Who seems to be getting the love in the first few weeks is not necessarily an indication of the long game of the next four years." Former commerce secretary William M. Daley, whom President Barack Obama brought on as chief of staff in part to help the him improve his relationships with corporate America, said that Trump's personal relationships probably accounted for some of his apparent preference for bankers. [Trump said they were ‘getting away with murder.’ Now they might be getting a tax break.] "If you take his whole career back to his father, it’s a pretty closed sort of world," Daley said. "He probably knows every banker, because he’s probably tried to borrow from every one of them." While both New York and San Jose are redoubts of the economic elite, the "whole mindset" of doing business is very different between the two cities, Daley said. He said that Trump probably feels more comfortable in the staid, managerial world of finance, real estate and blue-chip corporations, in contrast to the more unpredictable and entrepreneurial world of computing. Financiers "want to live in a world that’s not as chaotic as the Silicon Valley crowd likes to live in," said Daley, a former J.P. Morgan banker who is now a managing partner at the Swiss hedge fund Argentière Capital. "In the Silicon Valley world, they’re all over the place. Every day is a new game plan." Daley pointed out that besides Trump's hotel in Las Vegas, his golf resort in Los Angeles and his recently completed Vancouver building, most of his properties are on the East Coast or overseas, limiting his exposure to the technology sector's culture and clout. "It's partly because Trump is a creature of New York," Moore said. "He's dealt with Wall Street his whole life." business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Designed to deliver fast and power-efficient processing, they have a variety of uses, including for automotive, industrial automation, pro audio visual and vision systems. As the “things” become more connected and able to share volumes of real-time data among themselves, data become more difficult to process. Information coming in from sensors and cameras in buildings, factories, homes and vehicles at an increasing rate can no longer be adequately handled by microprocessors or microcontrollers alone. High-performance processing devices such as Intel’s FPGAs are able to collect and send data, and make real-time decisions based on the input from IoT devices. FPGAs can be programmed to deliver the specific level of computing and functions required by different IoT applications. The Cyclone® 10 FPGAs – Cyclone® 10 GX and Cyclone® 10 LP – have their own unique features to address different design team needs. Cyclone 10 GX is unique among other low-cost FPGAs as it can support 10G transceivers and hard floating point DSP (digital signal processing). It offers 2-times the performance increase over the previous generation of Cyclone. The architectural innovation in the implementation of IEEE 754 single-precision hardened floating-point DSP blocks can enable processing rates up to 134 GFLOPs (giga floating-point operations per second). This is important for engineers needing higher performance using the FPGA for applications such as motion or motor control systems. Markets for Intel Cyclone 10 GX include those where high I/O performance and core speed are key requirements. Uses include industrial machine vision and smart city applications that provide surveillance in parking lots , on roads and on bridges. Cyclone 10 GX is also well-suited to support pro AV technologies, such as video streaming applications. Motor-driven systems account for more than two-thirds of industrial energy consumption, and their efficient operation is vital to the smart factory. Cyclone 10 GX FPGAs enable cost-savings when using motors and drives, power assembly, computer numerical control (CNC), machine tools and robotics. By using FPGAs such as the Cyclone 10 GX, operators can benefit from significant reductions in overall cost of ownership across entire product lines. For example, operators can use Cyclone GX to lower their bill of materials costs by integrating industrial networking and functional safety in a single chip. Designers using Cyclone GX and Cyclone LP FPGAs in industrial settings can more easily reach compliance under the Machinery Directive safety standard known as IEC 61508 by working with Intel, the first FPGA supplier to obtain device and tool qualification under this important industry standard. The Intel Cyclone 10 LP is the perfect solution for applications where cost and power are key factors in the design decision. These systems typically use FPGA densities that are sub 75K LE and chip-to-chip bridging functions between electronic components or I/O expansion for microprocessors. Cyclone 10 LP can also be used for automotive video processing used in rear-view cameras and in sensor fusion, where data gathered while the car is on the road is combined from multiple sensors in the car to provide a more complete view of what is happening. The Cyclone 10 FPGA family will be available in the second half of 2017, along with evaluation kits and boards, and the latest version of Quartus, the Intel FPGA programming software.

As we get another day closer to the imperious Mobile World Congress, vendors throughout the telecoms market need to make sure everyone knows how busy they are in preparing for 5G. The rest of the year sees a constant jostle among vendors to show they’re the ‘first’ to launch an era-defining, ‘end-to-end’ solution to solve all your mobile woes; but in the build up to MWC that frenzied PR machine kicks into overdrive. Nokia is no exception, and has updated its cunning plan again with claims ahead of MWC it has successfully conducted the world’s ‘first’ connected based on the Verizon 5G Technology Forum pre-standards. The tests were conducted over its self-proclaimed 5G-ready AirScale radio access, running on the Intel-driven Nokia AirFrame data centre platform, coupled with an Intel 5G trial platform acting as an end-user device. Based on the associating comments coming from Nokia’s head of 5G business line, Harold Graham, Nokia isn’t prepared to downplay the significance of the trial results. “This first 5G connection is a true landmark for the telecommunications industry, and yet another mark of Nokia’s capabilities in 5G,” he humbly said. “With its low latency and significant capacity and speed increases, 5G will deliver a variety of new and innovative applications, and Nokia is playing leading roles in all aspects of the total 5G proposition. This ‘first’ highlights our commitment to being on the front line in providing our customers 5G-ready technologies so that they can seize early market opportunities by building 5G-enabled applications.” Along Nokia’s road to 5G feature a couple of additional announcements from the Finnish kit vendor ahead of MWC. It confirmed it will be launching ‘4.9G’ services later this year – also known as ‘gigabit LTE’ – as well as a whole bunch of massive MIMO antennas and RRHs to optimise resources and deliver gigabit speeds. It also says it will be giving a ‘world-first’ (there’s that word again) demonstration of Cloud Single RAN, which will be running 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G radios over its hardware. So there’s that to look forward to as well at MWC. Y’know, if that’s what you’re in to. Daily Poll What would you consider the biggest roadblock for autonomous vehicles?

Mark Walton (UK) - Feb 13, 2017 2:09 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 175 Share this story Intel's eighth-generation Core CPUs, codenamed Coffee Lake, will launch in the second half of 2017—far earlier than the 2018 launch period suggested by supposed product roadmaps leaked last year. At its Investor Day event last week, Intel confirmed that its 8th-gen chips will once again be based on a 14nm process, much like Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake before it. The first Broadwell chips were released way back in 2014. Intel officially abandoned its previous "Tick-Tock" strategy—with each "tick" representing a die shrink and each "tock" representing a new microarchitecture—in early 2016, and instead promised a three-phase model of Process, Architecture, Optimization. But now, with Coffee Lake, it seems Intel might have abandoned that new model, too. Technically, Kaby Lake is the "Optimization" to the "Architecture" of Skylake and the "Process" of Broadwell, which makes the early launch of Coffee Lake on 14nm something of an anomaly. Further ReadingIntel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K review: Is the desktop CPU dead? Intel is promising around a 15 percent jump in performance versus Kaby Lake, although it hasn't noted whether this refers to desktop or mobile chips. Intel promised a similar performance jump between Skylake and Kaby Lake, but this was largely based on a bump in base clock speed for desktop chips; IPC (instructions-per-clock) remained identical. Where Intel will find the required performance improvements given it's stringing out 14nm for another year remains to be seen, although—as AMD has demonstrated with its Bristol Ridge CPUs—there are efficiency gains to be had with some clever engineering. Intel is keeping schtum about the full Coffee Lake lineup, but it's expected to include a six-core CPU as part of the standard range of i7 products. Currently, Intel only offers more than four cores in its Xeon and Extreme Edition ranges, which typically retail at much higher prices. The Coffee Lake chips will go head-to-head with AMD's upcoming Ryzen CPUs, which launch in March. Ryzen will feature eight cores and 16 threads in its top-end part, with six- and quad-core versions making up the rest of the line. Pricing for Ryzen is yet to be announced. Intel's highly anticipated Cannon Lake CPUs—which are based on a new 10nm process—do not currently have a release date. However, when they do eventually arrive, Intel has said that "Data centre [is] first for [the] next process node," meaning enterprise users will get their hands on their chips before consumers. Intel also noted that future process uses will be "fluid," depending on the market segment, meaning 14nm may be sticking around for longer than some had hoped. Further ReadingThe desktop CPU isn’t dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Further ReadingIntel forges ahead to 10nm, will move away from silicon at 7nmThe first 10nm chips consumers will get their hands on won't come from Intel but from Samsung and Qualcomm. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 SoC will be built on Samsung's 10nm process, enabling a 30 percent smaller die size and a claimed 40 percent reduction in power consumption. No devices using the Snapdragon 835 have been announced, but the chips are in production and are promised to arrive in the first half of 2017.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News World Hyperscale Data Center Market – Opportunities and Forecasts, 2015-2022 Hyperscale Data Center The press releases (PRs) on “Hyperscale Data Center Market” added by Big Market Research will enable major enterprises unlocks the real-time data pertaining to the overall industry performance across different regions. Request sample report @ goo.gl/HMoniW Hyperscale data center is designed to offer a single, largely scalable compute architecture, which is developed from small, individual servers called nodes that offer computing, networking, and storage solutions. These nodes are grouped together and managed as a single entity. The main idea behind developing hyperscale architecture is to start with small infrastructure to keep the initial investments minimal. With increasing demand, new nodes can be added to the cluster to expand the initial infrastructure. Hyperscale data centers are largely adopted by key companies, such as Amazon and Google, thereby emerging as one of the fastest growing technology in the IT infrastructure world. In May 2015, Intel announced the launch of new Intel Xeon Processor, which securely processes and analyzes enormous volumes of data in the system memory. Enquire about report @ goo.gl/TdfKYZ Efficiency is one of the key factors to be considered in a hyperscale data center, in addition to the design and layout of the facility. Designing is a very important factor as it helps to minimize the inefficiency at the rack, node, and facility level. Hyperscale data centers usually have compute nodes ranging from thousands to tens of thousands. In such a hyperscale data center, a small error in design can significantly increase the cost of computation. The other elements of the data center, such as power, HVAC, networking, and layout of racks, also affect its computation cost. Hyperscale data centers are implemented across various industries, namely, IT & telecom, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), government utilities, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and others. IT strongly supports the growth of the banking sector, thereby enhancing the economic growth. Hyperscale data centers improve the competitive efficiency of the banking sector. The increasing adoption of hyperscale data center in BFSI application is expected to generate maximum revenue by 2022. In addition, in the manufacturing industry, huge amount of data is generated on the operation and shop floor, which can be analyzed to enhance the production practices. Thus, the manufacturing sector is expected to be the fastest growing application sector, with a rapid CAGR of 23.7% over the analysis period.

While the company is best known for its gaming peripherals and hardware, Razer has been releasing highly polished laptops for a few years now. Sure, the Blade and Blade Pro are powerful systems designed for portable gaming rather than everyday work, but Razer does have one laptop that competes strongly with ultraportables from the likes of Dell, HP, Apple, Lenovo and Asus. The Blade Stealth is smallest and sleekest laptop in Razer’s line-up, boasting a 12.5-inch display and powerful yet efficient hardware. You won’t find a dedicated GPU inside this machine, but you do get the latest Intel U-series Core processors and other high-end components typically found in other ultraportables of this size. Combined with an elegant, well-constructed chassis, the Blade Stealth is a laptop that should be on your radar. The first generation Blade Stealth was introduced at CES 2016 as a unique gaming laptop/ultrabook hybrid. The idea was gamers could carry around this portable laptop, then plug it into the Razer Core – a Thunderbolt 3 graphics card housing – to transform it into a gaming machine at home. It was a clever idea, but the Core didn’t catch on as much as Razer would have liked, mostly due to its high price tag. With the new Blade Stealth, Razer is more focused on the machine's strengths as an ultraportable laptop for a wide range of consumers not just gamers on the go, calling it “the ultimate ultrabook.” The design is largely the same as the previous model, but with a handy internal upgrade to Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and a larger battery. The exterior of the Blade Stealth didn’t require an update for the most part. Razer has mastered the design of beautiful black metal exteriors; their laptops are some of the most attractive and well built on the market. Heavily inspired by MacBook Pros, the Blade Stealth stands out with a simple yet classy and premium design that just looks and feels like an expensive piece of hardware. When forking out more than $1,000 on a product, this is the sort of experience you expect to receive. Razer uses “aircraft grade” aluminium for almost the entirety of the Blade Stealth’s CNC-machined chassis. This creates a beautiful, uniform look around the base and lid of this laptop, and the (mostly) single-piece construction adds to its seamless visual appeal. The only parts of this laptop that aren’t metal are the glass display, the rubber feet, and the plastic keyboard keys. Usually Razer products give a good balance between gamer elements and a more stealthy design. The Blade Stealth falls into the latter category, as this laptop’s all-black matte finish is understated in an appealing way. The only highlights are the striking illuminated acid green logo on the lid, and the green inserts to the USB ports. This color combination looks excellent, especially as most laptops these days opt for one of many shades of silver. The downside to an all-black laptop is it quickly becomes a fingerprint magnet. The lid, the keyboard surround, and especially the glossy glass touchscreen quickly accumulate visible finger grease that requires constant cleaning. The glass is relatively easy to keep in pristine condition, but the metal parts are harder to maintain. Someone who gets frustrated with a dirty laptop will not enjoy the Blade Stealth’s sleek finish. While Razer hasn’t attempted to break any portability records like the HP Spectre or Asus ZenBook 3, the company has still created a very slim and light laptop. The Blade Stealth, at 1.29 kg (2.89 lbs) heavy and 13.1mm thick, is slimmer than the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro and Dell XPS 13. It does this while including a comparable battery to the MacBook Pro, and a cell slightly smaller than the XPS 13. The Blade Stealth features a basic selection of ports. A Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port for charging, connecting to the Razer Core, and use as a general Thunderbolt port is seen on the left, along with a USB 3.0 Type-A port and a 3.5mm audio jack. On the right is another USB 3.0 port and, surprisingly, a full-sized HDMI 2.0a port that makes it easy to connect the Blade Stealth to external displays. I would have liked to see perhaps an SD card slot and an additional USB port, but generally this port selection will be adequate. This laptop is powered on by a centered power button above the keyboard, while speakers flank the keyboard on either side. Many laptops these days include either side- or bottom-firing speakers, so I appreciate Razer’s work to integrate these speakers such that they actually point towards your ears during work. Like most laptops, these speakers don’t have great range but are acceptable and produce a good level of volume. The cooling solution on the Blade Stealth is simple. It consists of two small vents on the bottom of the laptop, along with a row of vents near the hinge assembly. There is only one fan situated on the right-hand side, which intakes air from the bottom and exhausts out the hinge. This fan is mostly off and therefore silent during regular use, although heavy workloads will see it spin up into a quiet whine. Despite not using the fan all that often, the Blade Stealth’s metal chassis isn’t hot to touch, indicating the passive cooling system in this laptop is well designed. The only major complaint I have with the Blade Stealth are the enormous bezels around the 12.5-inch display. This ultraportable is clearly a 13-inch-class body, yet the display seems small and dominated by massive black bars around every side. A 13.3-inch display and possibly even a 14-inch display would easily fit inside the space allocated to the current 12.5-inch panel, and this is a change I hope Razer will make in future models. Smaller bezels look better and provide a better experience.

But on Friday, California-based chipmaker GlobalFoundries announced a $10 billion project in China, showing how the center of gravity continues to shift across the Pacific. The new advanced-semiconductor factory, in the central Chinese city of Chengdu, is only the most recent in an array of investments, often by major multinationals, into China with the support of the Chinese government. The projects have become markedly more sophisticated, making more modern microchips, memory chips or flat-panel displays. In 2013 Beijing announced a major initiative to expand the country's ability to produce microchips, which act as the brains of everything from guided missiles to smartphones. Also driving the companies, according to analysts, are new guidelines urging Chinese electronics makers to buy chips made in China. Since China has begun focusing on semiconductors, the provenance of advanced chips has become an increasingly fraught political issue. The election of President Donald Trump has further increased pressure on companies, several of which have announced plans to build facilities in the United States. In Intel's case, it was a recommitment to an earlier plan the company had announced. "Almost all of the large semiconductor enterprises in the United States have received investment offers from Chinese state actors," according to a report from the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a think tank based in Germany. Although analysts remain unsure of how quickly China might be able to close a huge gap with companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States, the funds have been slowly attracting new plants. A semiconductor industry group said in a recent report that it was tracking the production of more than 20 semiconductor manufacturing plants in China.

Reuters/Joshua Roberts A senior White House official has denied answering whether US President Donald Trump will defend national security advisor Michael Flynn. This comes in the wake of reports claiming Flynn had conversations with a Russian diplomat before Trump was inaugurated as the US president. On Friday, Trump refused to answer directly whether he supports Flynn, saying he would be looking into the claims concerning the national security advisor’s associations with Russia. Nevertheless, Trump has maintained that he has confidence in Flynn and that he wanted to “keep moving forward.” On Dec. 29, Flynn had a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Although Flynn initially refused discussing the issue of sanctions with the Russian official, he has now admitted that he did. The contradiction in his claims, along with those made by US Vice President Mike Pence, was first reported by the Washington Post. Flynn also conceded that he made several calls to the Russian ambassador. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller said he could not answer regarding Trump’s confidence in Flynn. "It's not for me to tell you what's in the President's mind," Miller said. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said Flynn would need to offer clarification on his contradicting statements regarding his conversations with Kislyak. "General Flynn has said up to this point that he had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador. I think now he's saying that he doesn't remember whether he did or not," Christie said, speaking with CNN. Christie had headed Trump’s transition planning prior to the US presidential election. Meanwhile, the White House has said it will be issuing a new immigration order. This comes after Trump’s travel ban was voted against by a federal judge and a three-judge panel. “Right now we are considering and pursuing all options,” Miller said, speaking with FOX Television. Trump’s travel ban stemmed from an executive order he had signed on Jan. 27. As part of the order, citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries were denied entry in the United States. Refugees from all countries were not allowed entry for 120 days, while citizens from Syria were banned indefinitely. “It's a political decision," Trump said, speaking with reporters. “This is just a decision that came down, but we're going to win the case.” The White House could either issue a new order or file an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. “The president’s powers here are beyond question,” Miller said. “We are contemplating new and additional actions to ensure that immigration is not a vehicle for admitting people into our country that are hostile to its nation and its values.” Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Hillary Clinton weighs in on court’s decision on Trump’s executive order Travel ban: US appeals court rules against Donald Trump's order Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 ‘Better Call Saul’ season 3: Bob Odenkirk reasons show’s late coming 0 Shares 2 'Better Call Saul' season 3: Gus Fring's modest return to the world of Jimmy McGill 0 Shares 3 Guns N’ Roses rock Melbourne, apologise over 'Hello Sydney!' mistake 0 Shares 4 LG G6 to settle with Snapdragon 821 chip 0 Shares 5 NBA Trade Deadline: Raptors, Clippers trying to acquire Danilo Gallinari from Nuggets 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Leaked pictures from South Africa set 0 Shares 7 ‘Peaky Blinders’ season 4 confirmed 0 Shares 8 Roger Federer reveals three keys to longevity, diet regimen, day-to-day schedule, eating habits 0 Shares 9 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Lothbrok brothers are ‘gonna be at each other’s throats’ 0 Shares 10 ‘The Walking Dead’ season 7, episode 9 spoilers: What to expect 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed NAB survey shows stronger Australia economy Woolworths and Microsoft assure faster online service Apple Inc. reaches AU$909 billion market value Iron ore prices witness surge to reach US$90 Etsy brings good news for creative entrpreneurs, DYIers CSL revenue approaches US$600 million More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance Man's dead body found in Sydney factory Small 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Adelaide Australian man whose girlfriend died in jet-ski crash pleads guilty Killer clown sentenced to 6 months for terrorising pregnant British woman with axe Australian community destroyed by bushfire Ku Klux Klan leader's wife, stepson charged with murder More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Jeremy Lin injury update: Brooklyn Nets PG ready to return post All-Star break NBA Trade Deadline: Cavaliers interested in Lakers guard Lou Williams Raptors acquire Serge Ibaka from Magic for Terrence Ross and future draft pick Adam Voges retires from Tests with batting average of 61.87 Reggie Jackson trade: Pelicans, Magic and Timberwolves vying for Pistons point guard NBA Trade Deadline: Warriors could sign Larry Sanders, not looking for trades More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More More NES Classic Editions soon; ‘Fire Emblem Heroes’ available on iOS & Android Samsung Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6s: Camera comparison [VIDEO] 'The Last Of Us 2' is 'a story worthy of Joel and Ellie' 'Final Fantasy XV' director hints at PC compatibility 8Pack OrionX: The most expensive gaming PC Researchers call to end long work hours for Australians More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Justice League' cast updates: Laurence Fishburne ends speculations; explains why he won't be in the DC movie 'Wonder Woman' spoilers: Showrunners' Twitter activity sparks fan theories that Arnold Schwazenegger might join the cast soon Marvel gets fans in stitches in new 'Team Thor' spoof video, featuring roommate Darryl [Watch] 'General Hospital' spoilers for Feb. 16, 2017: Nina grows suspicious; Liz takes a stand; Kiki and Dillon reconnect 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' spoilers: New planet details 'Orphan Black' season 5 news: Tatiana Maslany and the clones return as final season gets a premiere date More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

For the first time in far too long, we have the prospect of an AMD processor that's not only competitive with Intel's latest and greatest, but perhaps potentially a better value in some cases, too. Following-up on our report of leaked Ryzen models earlier, we now get some rumored performance characteristics of one particular chip, the ~$389 Ryzen 7 1700X. The 1700X could become AMD's best bang-for-the-buck Ryzen processor in the enthusiast segment. It is rumored to cost $110 less than the 1800X, with the only trade-off (that we know of) being a 200MHz reduction in base frequency (from 3600MHz). As the "X" in the model number designates, however, the 1700X includes support for AMD's Extended Frequency Range (XFR) tech, just like the top-end 1800X. Apparently, WCCF Tech was able to dig up some Ryzen 7 1700X Sysmark and CPU Mark numbers from the benchmarks' databases and had some impressive results to share. On the single-threaded front, the 1700X comes close to the 3.20GHz Intel Core i7-6900K, but falls a bit behind the 4.2GHz Core i7-7700K. Compared to the 8-core FX-8350 from AMD, the Ryzen 7 1700X is allegedly an impressive 37% faster. Things begin to get more interesting with the other tests though, potentially highlighting the significant architectural improvements AMD has made with Ryzen. With an Integer math test, the Ryzen 7 1700X simply cleans house, even beating out Intel's high-end Core i7-6900K, which is a ~$1,000 8-core monster clocked at 3.2GHz. In this specific test, the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X manages to outperform the Intel Core i7-7700K (4-core at 4.20GHz) by a massive 85% - that is if the numbers are to be trusted, of course. A steady stream of recent "leaks" like this one, that paint Ryzen in a favorable light, has led some to speculate that Intel's sudden touting of its next-generation Core i7-8700 series means that AMD does in fact have something unbelievably HOT on its hands. Throughout all of the testing done, AMD's Ryzen chip comes out ahead more often than not. There are some cases where the beefiest Intel chips do strike back hard, though, especially with the physics and prime numbers tests. However, one more interesting result is in the encryption test, where AMD's Ryzen 7 1700X beats out the 8-core i7-6900K as well. Encryption has traditionally been an area where Intel's processors have been exceptionally strong. Excited for Ryzen? Let us know in the comments.  And stay tuned to HotHardware for more Ryzen info as it becomes available.

WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday held up Intel's plan to invest more than $7 billion in an Arizona factory as a win for his economic agenda, but it's also a reminder that not all corporate commitments come to fruition. Trump was the second president to celebrate the computer chip maker's attempts to expand its domestic production at the same facility in Chandler, Ariz. In 2012, Obama went to the factory's construction site and celebrated that the plant would produce “some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth.” “Let's stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas,” Obama said at the time. “Let's reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America.” But by 2014, however, Intel had pulled back from finishing the factory. The company said Wednesday that it expects to open the plant known as “Fab 42” within four years. “We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand,” said William Moss, an Intel spokesman. “We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business.” Like Obama, Trump declared it a win for workers. “We're very happy, and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy,” Trump said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an Oval Office visit with Trump that the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich said he made the announcement from the White House because “it's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” But Intel has not been a universal fan of Trump's policies. It was among the tech companies that filed a legal brief that challenged the president's 90-day ban on travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. The announcement was made as Intel has shed jobs. Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocused its business toward microchips that power data centers and internet-connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: CrossOver Android Preview brings Windows apps to Chromebooks 0 by Surur  @mspoweruser Aug 26, 2016 at 18:46 GMT6 months ago Codeweavers has announced that the Tech Preview of CrossOver for Android is now available, allowing ChromeOS users with Intel processors to run Windows applications on their laptops. The app uses WINE API translation technology and supports apps as sophisticated as Office 2010, Quicken and DirectX9 and Steam, but does not support every Windows application. Minimum specs are Android 5, the Google Play store on Chrome, an Intel, not ARM processor and 2 GB of RAM. The APK is being distributed via the Google Play Store where testers can sign up to be beta testers. ChromeOS is a Google-created operating system popular in the US education environment, where much of the world is browser based, but virtually unknown elsewhere. Google has recently added support for Android apps on ChromeOS and brought the Google Play Store to a select number of ChromeOS laptops. This has brought millions of Android apps to the platform, but unfortunately most of these apps are designed for touch, and are not optimised for keyboard and mouse, unlike Windows Applications, making Crossover welcome news for dedicated ChromeOS fans. See the technology in action in a video below: Codeweaver also makes Crossover for the Mac and Linux with the same functionality, suggesting while this development is interesting it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Windows market.

 10 things in tech you need to know today Shona Ghosh Feb. 9, 2017, 9:19 AM 2,442 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CEO Brian Krzanich.REUTERS/Jason Lee Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Thursday. 1. Intel has thrown its weight behind President Trump. Speaking at the White House, CEO Brian Krzanich promised $7 billion to complete the construction of an Arizona factory and said he supported Trump's tax reform policies. 2. Augmented reality startup Magic Leap will present its smart glasses to its board next week, but still doesn't have a prototype. Engineers are "scrambling" to build a working version of the product. 3. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Scottish students that the company doesn't support the immigration ban. Cook received an honorary degree from the University of Glasgow on Wednesday and acknowledged Apple wouldn't exist without immigration. 4. Social media app Fling burned through $21 million in less than three years. The founder spent money on expensive flights, parties, and Michelin star meals, according to insiders. 5. Uber is partnering with Zipcar in Boston for a new service called Uber Xchange. Drivers will be able to rent ZipCar vehicles at a reduced rate if their own car is out of commission, or if they just want to try out Uber. 6. Facebook is shutting hundreds of Oculus VR pop-ups in US retailer Best Buy because no one was trying it out. The company is shutting 200 of its 500 in-store demo stations. 7. A French man is suing Uber for $45 million over an alleged flaw that sent his wife notifications of his whereabouts. She eventually suspected him of an affair, leading to the collapse of their marriage. 8. Pinterest will now let you photograph real-world items so you can buy them online. Called Lens, the new app can recognize items you snap, then pull up information from Pinterest alongside. 9. Snapchat has hired an engineer to stop Facebook copying its product. Laurent Balmelli cofounded Strong.Codes, which makes it more difficult to reverse-engineer code. 10. Facebook has poached an MTV exec to help it create its own programming. Former executive vice president and head of scripted at MTV Mina Lefevre confirmed she would be helping to build the company's "original content ecosystem."

By Kelly McSweeney | February 13, 2017 -- 14:20 GMT (06:20 PST) | Topic: Innovation Image: Dr. Eijiro Miyako Japanese researchers are developing unmanned aerial vehicles (a.k.a. UAVs or drones) that can pollinate flowers to help assist the declining bee population. A few years ago, using a flying robot to substitute a bee wouldn't have been worthwhile because a single bee can pollinate thousands of plants each day, and UAVs couldn't come close to matching that pace. But there have been several recent advances in swarm robotics . Now a single pilot can control many drones at once, so a swarm of robotic bees just might work. Read also Humans can now use mind control to direct swarms of robots Utah teen launches consumer drone that can fly over 70 mph AT&T's flying COWs are better than they sound Birds do it. Bees do it. Can drones do it? Cheap 3D vision bringing robots into the real world This new swarm technology was showcased during the Super Bowl halftime show, where hundreds of Intel's drones provided a unique backdrop for Lady Gaga's performance. (Although due to regulations and weather, the drone portion had been pre-recorded.) Drone light shows are a nice way to showcase swarm tech, but it would be even better to use coordinated drones to solve the bee shortage, which is an environmental and agricultural crisis. Drones were named after bees, after all. Honey bees pollinate a surprisingly large amount of the fruits and vegetables that we eat, adding up to billions of dollars in crop production. Bees are dying at alarming rates, and several species are now officially endangered. Most efforts to solve this problem involve saving the bees by limiting the use of pesticides and other chemicals, but this new approach focuses on helping the remaining bees by lightening their workload. The key to the new bee-like robot is a special gel that it uses to pick up the pollen from plants. Eijiro Miyako, a chemist at Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), was inspired to use an old ionic gel that he had stored after a failed experiment a decade ago. The gel is conductive and just sticky enough to pick up pollen. So, Miyako and colleagues applied the gel to the bottom of an off-the-shelf $100 quadcopter. Rather than adding the gel to the drone's smooth plastic surface, they applied it to horse hairs that mimic bee fur. The gel-covered hairs provide maximum surface area for grabbing pollen and they generate an electric charge to keep the pollen in place. In a research paper published in the journal Chem, the researchers described experiments where they used the hairy drones to take pollen from one flower and deposit it on another. "The findings, which will have applications for agriculture and robotics, among others, could lead to the development of artificial pollinators and help counter the problems caused by declining honeybee populations," Miyako said in a press release. "We believe that robotic pollinators could be trained to learn pollination paths using global positioning systems and artificial intelligence."

(Charles Reed/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via AP) Pablo Martinez Monsivais President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participate in a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is patting himself on the back for immigration and job-creation initiatives that started before he took office. A look at his statements during a press conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing." THE FACTS: Officials said an operation last week that resulted in the arrest of more than 680 immigrants in various cities was a routine enforcement action like those undertaken during the administration of Barack Obama, who deported an unprecedented number of people as president. More specifically, David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out such large-scale operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.

This app creates a virtual multi-monitor workspace for machines running MacOS 10.11 or higher that is viewed specifically through the Oculus Rift Development Kit v2. A version for the retail release of Facebook’s VR headset isn’t expected to arrive until later in 2017. Costing $20, the new app enables Mac owners to strap on the Oculus Rift and view their MacOS desktop across up to three virtual displays. The catch is that the app will work on “modern” Macs that include discrete graphics chips. That is quite an amazing feat given the Oculus Rift isn’t officially supported on Mac machines. More: Oculus Rift replacement accessories are finally available in its online store Why? Because Macs typically don’t have the graphics chip component required to run the Rift. For example, the 21.5-inch iMac relies on Intel’s integrated graphics while the 27-inch models have an AMD Radeon R9 M300 Series component, which isn’t advertised as VR-ready. The latest MacBook Pros rely on integrated graphics as well and the expensive cylinder-shaped Mac Pro desktops sport dual AMD FirePro D-Series graphics chips, which don’t meet the Rift’s requirements either. But it seems that Cindori is working around the current limitations. The company said it created a custom “state-of-the-art VR framework” promising a smooth experience on recent Macs with a discrete graphics chip. That rules out all models that rely solely on integrated Intel graphics. The actual hardware requirements to run the app are unknown. However, here are the minimum and recommended specs needed to use the Oculus Rift: Minimum Recommended Processor: Intel Core i3-6100 AMD FX 4350 Intel Core i5-4590 Graphics card: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti AMD Radeon RX 470 Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 AMD Radeon RX 480 Alternative graphics card: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 AMD Radeon R9 290 Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 AMD Radeon R9 290 Memory: 8GB 8GB Video output: HDMI 1.3 at 297MHz HDMI 1.3 at 297MHz USB ports: 1x USB 3.0 2x USB 2.0 3x USB 3.0 1x USB 2.0 Oculus VR placed its plans to support MacOS and Linux on hold a while ago. Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey said in March 2016 that Oculus would resume its efforts to support MacOS again when Apple releases “a good computer.” He clarified by adding that Apple may release a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700 discrete graphics chip but it still doesn’t meet the Rift’s requirements. “It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritize high-end GPUs,” he said. “If they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we’d love to support Mac. But right now, there’s just not a single machine out there that supports it.” For now, it seems, VR can be enabled on modern Macs with discrete graphics through the new app. Users can play games, watch movies, work on spreadsheets, and more in a VR environment. Support for the HTC Vive headset is planned for sometime in 2017.

The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)More WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is patting himself on the back for immigration and job-creation initiatives that started before he took office. A look at his statements during a press conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing."

Inside, NVIDIA's new GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of GDDR5 is included, and 16GB of DDR4 system RAM.   You can configure up to 1Tb of SSD storage, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity is included, and the beautiful Razer Chroma keyboard of course.   Razer's new Blade starts at $1899 with the 1080p display, and is available right now in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, and France through Razerzone.com, but the more expensive higher-end 4K model won't be coming until at least April.   Recommended for You Razer's stolen Valerie laptops in China for $22,000...

Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} February 13, 2017 3:20pm   Comments Share: Related NVDA Paul Singer's Latest 13F Shows Big Changes In Apple, Western Digital 5 Misguided Valentine's Day Gifts For Stock Traders In Light Of Yesterday's Layoffs At Activision, Think Like A Long-Term Investor (Seeking Alpha) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported February 9 fourth-quarter earnings and revenues that exceeded estimates, with the company posting record revenues for 2017. The company said deep learning on its GPUs, a novel approach to AI, is used in varied applications, ranging from self-driving cars, early cancer detection and weather prediction. Datacenter and gaming revenues rose notably. Consistent Churner Of Upside Earnings Surprise Based on data from StreetInsider.com, Nvidia has been consistently beating earnings estimates since the third quarter of 2010. That would mean 26 straight quarters of earnings outperformance. Has the company's successful execution got anything to do with industry-specific factors. If so, rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) would have also capitalized. At least going by fundamentals, it doesn't look so. AMD's Checkered History AMD has had a stellar 2016, as it beat earnings estimates in each of the fourth quarters of 2016. Ahead of that, the company had reported either in line or below-consensus results for the seven quarter prior to that. In fact, the company's story began souring since 2006, as it faced intense competition from Intel in the traditional chip market and could not stand up against Nvidia in the graphics chips market. Related Link: The Consensus On NVIDIA Is Still Pretty Positive No Parallels Among Other Rivals Intel, which cannot be termed as a direct competitor to Nvidia, has done better than AMD, as it has reported largely better than expected earnings. However, there has been exceptions, as it reported in line earnings per share in the first quarter of 2015 and second quarter of 2013. Intel, meanwhile, reported below-consensus earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2013. Ambarella Inc (NASDAQ: AMBA), which competes with Nvidia in the market for chips for drones, driverless cars and other next-gen connected devices, comes close to its rival in its success with respect to delivering earnings surprise. Ambarella went public in October 2012, and in all the subsequent quarters as a public company, it had managed to beat earnings expectations (16 straight quarters).

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 02.13.17 in Personal Computing Comments 1272 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Razer has launched a new Blade for folks needing a blend of power and portability. The latest 14-inch model is the company's first with an (optional) 4K screen, and is also packing Intel's latest Core i7-7700HQ CPU, giving it a bit more speed with the same power consumption. Even with the upgraded components, the new model has the same thickness (0.70 inches) and weight (4.3 pounds with a 4K screen) as the last model, thanks to the unibody aluminum chassis. The new blade also has the last model's NVIDIA GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of DDR5 VRAM, along with 16GB of DDR4 RAM minimum, SSD storage up to 1TB, Thunderbolt 3 and the color-tastic Razer Chroma keyboard. NVIDIA's latest laptop GPUs are now nearly as powerful as its desktop models, but some reviewers found the last 14-inch Blade to be somewhat weak at the top-end 3,200 x 1,800 resolution, so it's not likely to be better on a 4K (3,840 x 2,160) display. The battery life was also middling on last year's QHD Blade, so don't expect a huge improvement there, either. Gallery: Razer Blade 14-inch 2017 Model | 11 Photos 11 +7 Though gamers will need to think carefully about the 4K option, it's nice for video or graphics pros who do GPU rendering and need a UHD screen, but not necessarily tons of battery life. There aren't many other models out there with the same combination of size and specs, but one that comes to mind is the Dell XPS 15, which is just a touch heavier and will also be available with a 4K screen (albeit a 15-inch one) and Core i7-7700 CPU for $2,199. However, that model has lesser NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics. As you'd expect, the 14-inch Blade ain't cheap -- the Full HD model is now available in the US, Canada, UK, Germany and France at Razerzone.com, starting at $1,899 (£1,799) and coming elsewhere in March. The 4K model is likely to be considerably more and it won't arrive until at least April of 2017.

Trump, tech titans talk H-1B visas overhaul After Trump's Taiwan talk, China trains guns at US automakers Trump tells tech czars he's an ally In his book on deal making, President Trump offered a key piece of advice on getting what you want: Promise big. “I play to people’s fantasies,” he said in 1987’s “The Art of the Deal. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.” Some of Asia’s biggest deal makers already understand that principle — and are making big promises accordingly. In recent months, Alibaba’s founder, Jack Ma; the Japanese tech investor Masayoshi Son; and the head of Foxconn, Terry Gou, have made big, public plans to invest in America. Together, the deals proposed would help to create more than a million new American jobs and tens of billions of dollars in new investments. Their promises have set off a host of other offerings from Asia in recent weeks — even if those offerings are not entirely new or solid. Toyota Motor of Japan promised last month to spend $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, which would essentially match its previous spending levels. News reports that Samsung of South Korea may also build an American plant won praise from Trump on Twitter. Samsung said it continued “to evaluate new investment needs in the US that can help us best serve our customers.” In contrast, American firms have made largely symbolic or modest promises to keep a small number of jobs in the United States, while European companies have been mostly silent. Only Intel seems to have borrowed a page from the Asian tycoon playbook, as its Chief Executive, Brian Krzanich, appeared with Trump to announce a $7 billion Arizona plant that was conceived in 2011 and then delayed. The promises from the big Asian business leaders will be tough to keep, experts say. But they show that Asia’s tech titans see a familiar figure in Trump. American leaders have largely shied from interfering in individual business decisions, instead relying on competitiveness to keep American companies ahead in a global market. But Trump’s focus on job protection, tariffs and the dictating of terms to business leaders is closer to the more mercantilist outlook that Ma, Son and Gou see to varying degrees in China, Japan, Taiwan and other places in Asia. “They see where this guy Trump is coming from, and, at a visceral level, identify with him,” said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. “It plays directly into their style,” he said. “These guys are political animals. They live in Asia, where things are different. There’s more autocracy and more connected transactions. In the US, people still expect things to be fair.” The Asian executives come from a region Trump accuses of using unfair trade practices and stealing American jobs — and all three have a lot to lose. It is not clear whether their lofty promises will lead to better treatment from the Trump administration. Alibaba, which has shares that trade in the United States, has been under fire there for the fakes that proliferate on its Chinese sales platforms. It also has an eye toward expanding into places like Hollywood. Son’s SoftBank owns Sprint, the American telecom company, and has long desired to expand. Foxconn — a Taiwan-based company with many factories in China — assembles iPhones and other gadgets for Apple, which Trump has said should make its products in America. Foxconn also has plants in Mexico that benefit under the North American Free Trade Agreement. A SoftBank spokesman said, “Son was greatly encouraged by the economic agenda of the new administration, and he intends to invest significant resources in the US in the years ahead.” A Foxconn spokeswoman said that the company was evaluating an investment in America and that it expected a new American project would create “many direct and indirect job opportunities.” An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment. Of course, the United States has a long history of supporting its homegrown industries. Still, East Asian governments often intervene more directly in business, and many of Trump’s proposals suggest he wants to adopt similar strategies. In China, government officials give public and financial support to building up industries to make the country less dependent on exports. In Japan, the government is supporting a new effort to build an aerospace industry. In South Korea, the government has lavished subsidies and tax breaks on its largest exporters, like Hyundai and Samsung.

Credit: Apple Most Popular I started personal computing on an Apple II circa 1977. It was a big step up from the Heathkit and Radio Shack DIY projects I tinkered with in grade school. When IBM introduced the IBM-PC circa 1981, I semi-defected, and in 1984 I became bi-computeral (you know why). My company functioned in a computer multiverse for some time. Macs were for art, music and publishing; PCs were for business; DEC minicomputers were for science, math and engineering. The minicomputers went away by 2000, and then we were just Mac and PC. In 2006, shortly after Macs became Intel inside and Parallels Desktop (a utility that enabled users to run Windows programs on a Mac) debuted, we became a 100% Apple shop, and we never looked back. For more than a decade, if Apple manufactured it, we purchased it – in bulk. There was no reason to hyper-evaluate the new specifications; we just sent a purchase order to Tekserve (now T2 Computing) for as many of the new Apple devices as we needed (and maybe a few we didn't need). There are so many Apple devices in our offices, someone once said, "It looks like Steve Jobs threw up in here." That was then. What malevolent force could entice me to seriously consider a PC? What wickedness could tempt me to contemplate a transitioning back to Windows? What could possibly lure me to the dark side? Only Apple itself has such power. My iPhone 7 Plus Chronicle On September 7, 2016, I stood on line for an hour to pick up my brand new iPhone 7 plus. I had made an appointment to be one of the first to pick one up because I was still a blind faith follower of the cult of Apple. There was going to be an issue with the headphone jack (well documented in my first treatise of dissent, "Apple iPhone 7: Are You F#$king Kidding Me"). But being one of the faithful means putting aside common sense. The moment I started to transfer information from iCloud, I was in trouble. Some apps worked, others were greyed out, and certain features were hit or miss. Two factory resets and four hours later, I called Apple Care. After 30 minutes on hold, I was told that my iPhone must be defective and needed to be replaced. What? "OK, I'll just go to the Genius Bar and have it replaced." "No, sorry," said the Apple Care person, "we don't have any extra iPhones at the stores; you'll have to send it back to us." "But because of the 'new phone every year' plan you sold me last time, you took my iPhone 6 Plus back. What will I do for a phone for the five to seven days you're telling me it will take for me to get the replacement?" (Note: Because I review technology as part of my job, I had plenty of other smartphones, but if this happened to most people, they'd be offline for a week.) It took two tries for Apple to send me a new phone. The first replacement was lost in shipping, and the second is the one I'm carrying now. I was without an iPhone for about two weeks. To make matters worse, Apple charged my credit card $950 for each phone, so although I had no iPhones, Apple put $2,850 of charges on my credit card, saying it would refund the difference when the missing phone and the bad phone were returned (which it ultimately did). How could Apple not have replacement phones available for the inevitable number of defective phones it might sell? Here's a better question: Did Apple sell too many defective phones for its supply of replacements? With the number of iPhones Apple sells, some are bound to be defective – but this was not an isolated incident. My MacBook Pro Chronicle I wrote my second treatise of dissent, "Apple MacBook Pro 2016: WTF?," about the all-singing, all-dancing 15-inch MacBook Pro before I received my unit. Here are two videos you may enjoy about unboxing my second MacBook Pro and its battery life. Second? Yes, second. I'm writing this article on my third 15-inch MacBook Pro because the first two were defective. After I waited more than two months past the promised delivery date, Unit #1 arrived with a bad "E" key. After three hours on hold with Apple Care (I should have taken a screen shot, because no one believes that I actually let it go that long, but I did), I was told that there was no way to fix it at any Apple Store in the area and there were no replacement units available. I had to return it to T2 Computing for replacement. T2 was awesome, BTW. Apple could take a customer service lesson from them. Unit #2 lasted about two hours past its unboxing and battery life video shoot. It crashed so hard that even the techs at T2 could not bring it back to life. Their head tech said, "This MacBook is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late Mac. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-MacBook." The Odds of Bad Units What are the odds of receiving one bad iPhone and two bad MacBook Pros in any six-month period in the post-iPod era? What happened to Apple Care? What happened to Apple's customer service? What is the point of the Genius Bar if it doesn't have the genius to repair or replace brand new defective units? Insane Design Decisions Who is making decisions about dongles and jacks at Apple? To be incompatible with the competition is expected. But for Apple's products to be incompatible with thousands of dollars' worth of equipment that Apple forced you to purchase borders on insane. If the iPhone 7 series has only one lightning connector because the future is wireless, then why doesn't Apple's flagship 15-inch MacBook Pro have a lightning jack too? Fanboys may keep buying its products no matter what, but normal consumers are going to have a hard time with this kind of nonsense. And what was the motivation behind removing the MagSafe power adapter? Dongles? Disclaimer and Apology: This video is a super cheap shot at the Dongle issue. It's an old meme video, but it really made me laugh. Microsoft Surface Book Pro, Samsung Note 8 and Other Stuff There is nothing special about the 15-inch MacBook Pro (2016). I own one because it is powerful enough, features the most amount of internal storage (2TB) and the display is extraordinary. BTW, the new MacBook Pro (2017) specs have been leaked and will feature Intel's Kaby Lake processors. (The 2016 models feature the older Skylake processors). This will not be a big deal unless you are really pushing your MacBook Pro to the limits. Although, the rumored 32GB of RAM is kind of a big deal. That said, if Microsoft made a Surface Book Pro with the same specs, I would take a very, very hard look at it. As for my smartphone, Samsung's new Note 8 looks amazing, and Google is doing an exceptional job with its Pixel and Android OS. Some of the most productive business apps on an iPhone are Microsoft's Office Suite and Google Apps for Business. I don't use any Apple apps on my iPhone and there are easy workarounds or excellent third-party alternatives for any Apple software I use on my MacBook Pro. Why do I need iOS and OS X? I'm reminded of Kylo Ren's last words to Han Solo in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens": "I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it." Author's Note: This is not a sponsored post. I am the author of this article and it expresses my own opinions.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News Nokia lays key 5G foundation with world’s first 5GTF connection /EIN News/ — Press Release Telecom industry’s first connection made conforming to 5GTF interface the industry-agreed specification for ‘pre-standard’ 5G applications, marking major milestone towards 3GPP NR Trial done in Oulu, Finland using commercially available 5G-ready Nokia AirScale and Nokia AirFrame and the 5G mobile trial platform for the client supplied by Intel® Further proofpoint of Nokia momentum in making 5G a commercial reality, close cooperation with Intel, and will expand towards interoperability with Intel 3GPP NR devices.               13 February, 2017 Espoo, Finland – Nokia has successfully carried out the world’s first connection based on the 5GTF ‘pre-standard’, marking a further milestone in Nokia’s momentum to make 5G a commercial reality. The test adds another key component to the development of 5G and the implementation of the first 5G applications, demonstrating the ability to provide fast pace implementation according to early standards including device interoperability. Nokia is playing a leading role in defining the path to 5G. At the end of last year it introduced 4.5G Pro and announced plans for 4.9G, providing operators with the critical increases to capacity and speed that will be needed for future 5G operations. The world’s first 5G connection, which took place in a laboratory environment in Oulu, Finland, on 23 December, used the 5GTF (Verizon 5G Technology Forum) draft specification and was made possible by Nokia’s commercially available 5G-ready AirScale radio access with the Nokia AirFrame data center platform running on Intel architecture, together with the Intel® 5G mobile trial platform as an end-user device. Data transmission on a 5G network is a significant milestone in the commercialization of the new wireless 5G technology, and indeed in the cross-industry efforts being made by all players in the 5G ecosystem to standardize all aspects of 5G ahead of full commercial service launches expected to begin in 2020 on 3GPP NR. The 5G connection marks yet another Nokia contribution to the evolution of communications: the first GSM call was made in Finland more than 20 years ago using a network built by Nokia. This tradition continued with the world’s first 3G voice call, on a commercial 3GPP system in Finland in 2001, and then with the world’s first LTE call via commercial software in Germany in 2009. Harold Graham, head of the 5G Business Line in Mobile Networks at Nokia, said: “This first 5G connection is a true landmark for the telecommunications industry, and yet another mark of Nokia’s capabilities in 5G. With its low latency and significant capacity and speed increases, 5G will deliver a variety of new and innovative applications, and Nokia is playing leading roles in all aspects of the total 5G proposition. This ‘first’ highlights our commitment to being on the front line in providing our customers 5G-ready technologies so that they can seize early market opportunities by building 5G-enabled applications.” About the solution used in the test Nokia AirScale radio access, BTS with system module and radio unit running early 5G software, with 100 MHz frequency band on 28 GHz Nokia AirFrame data center solution  Intel 5G mobile trial platform designed to support sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G Bands 2 or 4 layer MIMO Up to 800MHz channel bandwidth Designed to support all pre-standard specifications trending to a common 3GPP NR standard Video streaming over the air to the device Did you know? Nokia and Intel are leveraging their mutual technology investments in 5G end-to-end architecture to collaborate with service providers across the world and accelerate the development of 5G solutions.  Nokia collaborates with leading universities in Europe, the USA and China to make 5G technologies as viable and future-proof as possible. It also runs several 5G-related industry projects in Europe, chairs the 5G-PPP association and is running 5G innovation projects with major operators including China Mobile, NTT DOCOMO, Korea Telecom, SK Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Verizon Wireless. According to an IHS Global Service Provider Survey in August 2016, Nokia Is perceived as the top vendor in 5G research and development.

The relationship had its genesis about a year ago when Jason Hall, an active lay member of Federated Church, spoke with Faraz Mir, a Muslim colleague at Intel, about the growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the country and how this sentiment is rooted primarily in misinformation. These conversations led to visits back and forth between the mosque and church by Federated’s Pastors Andrew Headden and Bob Olmsted and MCF’s Imam Aamir and lay leader Zaid Akhter, where these faith leaders opened a dialog and shared some of the basic tenets of the two sister faiths. The two congregations met socially last Sunday at Federated Church for an inter-faith evening of food, fellowship and discussion. Conversations were deep and heart-felt as both Christians and Muslims explored the common ground of their faith traditions, identity as Americans and humanity. Saniya, an articulate high school senior from MCF, opened the evening with a beautiful speech. She expressed that her congregation is grateful for its supportive, safe community; their neighbors are very protective of them. But MCF members are still worried. Muslims are so often demonized these days and hate crimes are on the rise. Muslim Americans find themselves having to continually reassure the rest of the country that Islam is a religion of peace and that ISIS and Al-Qaeda do not represent mainstream Islam any more than the KKK represents mainstream Christianity. The inter-faith evening closed with the powerfully moving act of having a young man, another high school student from MCF, sing the “adhan”— the Muslim call to prayer — in the church sanctuary. This transformative experience reinforced for both congregations the truth that they worship the same God and are all God’s children and are brothers and sisters. The two congregations wish to continue to build friendships and explore their common ground. “I always knew the two faiths were closely related,” said Headden, “but it has been amazing exploring just how much we share in common. In fact, there is more about the Virgin Mary in the Quran than in the Gospels.” Federated’s Youth Pastor Helen Mansfield is excited about finding opportunities for the youth of both congregations to come together in joint activities and projects. When asked about his thoughts on the role of the church in responding to anti-Muslim rhetoric, Headden explained that when one religion is given a privileged status in a society, there is a danger that this can lead to arrogance, which can then be politicized and lead to public denigration of other religions. When this happens, people get hurt. “We wish to counteract this potential danger by adopting a model of servanthood and compassion,” Headden said. Federated Church is a More Light (Presbyterian) and Reconciling Ministries (United Methodist) congregation serving Placerville and surrounding areas. Its mission is to practice the love, compassion and radical hospitality of Jesus Christ. For more information call the Federated Church office at (530) 622-0273 or visit eldoradofederatedchurch.org.

(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) 8127 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 114 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Pledging "bridges of commerce" with Canada, President Trump told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday he wants relatively minor changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, adding that most of his problems with the massive trade deal involve the deal's third partner, Mexico. "We'll be tweaking it," Trump told reporters about NAFTA, which he attacked during last year's presidential campaign as a "disaster" that sent U.S. jobs to other countries. Trump did not specify what changes he would seek, but said most of the agreement's impact on U.S.-Canada trade relations is "a much less severe situation than what's taken place on the southern border:" Mexico. "We're going to work with Mexico," Trump said. "We're going to make it a fair deal for both parties." As for Canada, Trump praised Trudeau for talks that ranged from trade to counter-terrorism. "We should coordinate closely and we will coordinate closely to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent and to keep everyone safe," the U.S. president said of his northern neighbor. Trudeau, sometimes speaking in French, praised the trade pact, and said he had "productive" discussions with Trump, including the topic of "cross-border commerce." He called Canada an "essential partner" of the United States. Trudeau noted that millions of jobs on both sides of the border are depend on trade. "Relationships between neighbors are pretty complex, and we won't always agree on everything," he said, but added that at the end of the day, he believes the U.S.-Canadian relationship will remain strong. The two leaders also announced new efforts to fight drug abuse and help more women start and operate their own businesses. Trump's pledge to re-work NAFTA — or void it altogether if he does not get satisfactory concessions — hovered over his first face-to-face meeting with Trudeau. On the campaign trail, Trump regularly attacked NAFTA as a bad trade deal that sent U.S. jobs to Mexico and Canada. Trump has already clashed with Mexico, mostly over Trump's planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Strong Canada-US ties help the middle class in both our countries. Monday, I'll meet @realDonaldTrump in DC to keep working for that goal.— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 9, 2017 Trump, 70, and Trudeau, 45, are virtual polar opposites politically. Trudeau leads the Liberal Party of Canada, half his Cabinet is female and he is a backer of free trade. Canada has also accepted 40,000 Syrian refugees. Trump’s immigration order — temporarily stayed by a federal court panel — would bar any Syrian refugees from traveling to the United States, only two of his 16 official Cabinet picks are women, and he has signaled he will take a more protectionist stance on trade. At the joint press conference Monday, Trudeau demurred when asked for his thoughts on Trump's order. "The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves," he said. Trudeau suggested both he and Trump want the same thing — free and open countries where citizens are safe from terrorism — but are taking different approaches. Trump said he wants a "big, beautiful open door, and we want people to come in," but he said "we cannot let the wrong people in," and Americans want that kind of security. "We are getting such praise for our stance, and it’s a stance of common sense," he said.  "We are going to pursue it vigorously." Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, arrived at the White House shortly before 11 a.m. ET. After an Oval Office meeting, Trump and Trudeau attended what each side billed as a major act of bilateral cooperation: A "roundtable discussion" on "the advancement of women entrepreneurs and business leaders." Presidential daughter Ivanka Trump, who has made women's issues a major part of her portfolio, will also participate.

Trump said "we need to make it easier" for women to create and lead businesses, while Trudeau talked about bringing down "significant barriers" to women entrepreneurs. The president and prime minister also had a "working lunch" prior to the news conference at which trade again became a major topic. Trade with Canada totaled an estimated $662.7 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. The United States exported $337.3 billion worth of goods and services and imported $325.4 billion worth. Trudeau visited the White House last March, when he and then-President Barack Obama announced a new border agreement aimed at streamlining regulations and reducing bottlenecks at border crossings. Trudeau joked during the visit that Canada would welcome Americans seeking to flee the United States if Trump was elected, but he was more diplomatic about the prospect of a Trump presidency at a White House press conference. "The relationship, the friendship between our two countries goes far beyond any two individuals or any ideologies," Trudeau said. "I have tremendous confidence in the American people and look forward to working with whomever they choose to send to this White House later this year."

There are plenty of suggestions for entrepreneurs who want to have a fancy, romantic night out. There are even options available for people looking to send their exes glitter or dead roses. You could even try to be your own Valentine. Public speakers can use Valentine's Day to brush up on the language of love. There's a reason a word from a loved one means more than from a stranger. Tap into that tacit connection all humans have. Use all of the love in the air as motivation to speak from the heart. A genuine love story tugs on everyone's heartstrings and leads them on an unforgettable journey--make your speech a love story and take your audience for the ride. 1. Fall in Love With Your Message Why should your audience care about your topic? Start by explaining why your audience should fall in love with what you're saying. Identify where your audience stands before the talk, and then set a goal for where you'd like them to be after your talk. Speaking expert Nancy Duarte calls these the "move from" and "move to" points. You have one opportunity to take the audience by the hand and lead them on a trip from what they thought at the beginning of your talk to what they will think at the end. Make sure they know why they should fall head-over-heels for what you have to say. 2. Get Swept Off Your Feet by Your Story But it isn't enough to have a roadmap if you don't have a car. This is when you put your plan into practice--gather together your dry facts and figures to form a story. What is your data trying to tell you? "Maybe," Brené Brown says in her TED Talk on vulnerability, "stories are just data with a soul." Your story is the vehicle that gets your raw data--and your audience--from the "move from" to the "move to" point. Constructing a story involves creating a beginning, middle and end with a great cast of characters. Need a story? Find a meaningful tale to share by finding common ground. How does your work connect to the world at large? How has your message already begun to change the world? Spend time on your story and make it from the heart--your audience will respond to authenticity. 3.Inject Passion Now you have a plan and a vehicle--what's the missing ingredient? Fuel. Ignite your audience with the passion you feel for your topic. Find what's in your presentation that excites you and transfer that excitement. Now, sometimes you're just giving a presentation on something mundane or protocol for your industry. It may seem difficult to find anything that gets your motor going. But this is where proficient speakers separate from the throng. Angela Lee Duckworth's TED Talk discusses the power of passion and perseverance. The truly gifted public speakers will view themselves as a vessel for their message. Their passion comes from the knowledge that their message is valuable and necessary. This Valentine's Day, turn your presentation into a love story between your audience and your message. When you speak from the heart, sincere passion and love will come through--and it is contagious. Spread the love and speak on. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Feb 13, 2017 Advertisement

(AMD) Stock … With Insurance! View All Posts Last year’s turnaround in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is back in play and looking good for investors. But with key product rollouts looming, don’t be too Zen about the trend being your friend. Instead, control your destiny with a little insurance against AMD stock. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr As I wrote last month in front of earnings, 2016 was the best of times for AMD stock, and for good reason. Of course, 2017 is looking good as shares continue to gain on the company’s improving business trend. Shares were catapulted to new multiyear highs after fourth-quarter earnings topped Wall Street’s views. Still, the rest of the year is looking like make-or-break time for the semiconductor outfit for two reasons: Ryzen and Vega. Ryzen is set to be released in early March as Advanced Micro Devices’ new CPU for PCs and servers. The main competition is chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) — a company facing its own design challenges and whose manufacturing lead will shrink markedly with the release of Ryzen. On the conference call, Advanced Micro Devices teased investors, stating it had secured a number of high-end PC design wins for Ryzen, which is based on AMD’s next-gen Zen CPU core architecture. Advanced Micro Devices is also releasing its Vega GPU line in 2017. The product is expected to come to market during the second quarter and has its sights on gaining market share in the server and high-end PC markets. The big competition in this space is Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidia’s software dominance will be a substantial challenge for AMD to crack, but one it’s readying for with an open-source approach. Advanced Micro Devices must successfully execute for AMD stock to have any chance to keep building on its red-hot 2017. If not, it would undo a significant amount of price action. AMD Stock Chart   Click to Enlarge Since discussing AMD back in January (yellow oval highlight), shares have confirmed what we saw as a fairly common corrective move by blasting higher to new multiyear highs. It goes without saying that the price action has been very generous for AMD investors. But notwithstanding the company’s obvious business risks, there’s no reason to believe the stock’s bullish trend won’t still be friendly, and won’t still improve.

News World Americas US politics Donald Trump's national security adviser Mike Flynn reported to NSA as White House refuses to offer backing News follows adviser's alleged discussion of Russia sanctions before administration had taken office  Chloe Farand Monday 13 February 2017 20:48 GMT Click to follow The Independent US Mr Flynn is under growing political pressure after the White House declined to publicly defend him over allegations he discussed Russia's sanctions before Donald Trump took office Getty Donald Trump’s national security adviser has been reported to the National Security Agency over claims he violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  Mike Flynn has been accused by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump (DCAT) of carrying out political activities seeking to influence the White House on behalf of Turkey and its president, Recep Erdogan, while failing to register as an agent with the Department of Justice.  The news comes as the White House refused to defend Mr Flynn over his alleged discussion of sanctions with Russian officials before Mr Trump took office.  Last September Mr Flynn and his company The Flynn Intel Group, which provides intelligence services for businesses and government, signed a contract with Dutch company Inovo BV, which had contracts with the Turkish government, to keep the company informed about the transition between Barack Obama and Mr Trump in the White House.  Read more Republican senators are worried Trump is mentally ill, says Al Franken Busta Rhymes calls Trump 'President Agent Orange' in Grammy's speech Trump aide repeats unfounded claim about millions of fraudulent voters Donald Trump's policy adviser hints travel ban could be redrafted The company’s founder, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, is known for having a close relationship with President Erdogan, the Democratic Coalition said.  But neither Mr Flynn nor his company are registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires every agent to register with the Department of Justice within 10 days of agreeing to take the post.  This is part of efforts to “ensure that the US Government and the people of the United States are informed of the source of information (propaganda) and the identity of the person attempting to influence US public opinion, policy and laws”, the Department of Justice says on its website.  Failure to comply to the law under the act can result in a five-year prison sentence and up to $10,000 fine.  On the day of the election, Mr Flynn also wrote an op-ed on US political website The Hill, advocating for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish exile blamed by the Erdogan administration for inciting the military coup last summer. The Democratic Coalition said Mr Flynn's arguments were in line with the goals of President Erdogan’s government.  After July’s aborted coup, Mr Gulen fled Turkey for Pennsylvania and strongly denied charges he orchestrated or was even involved in it.  Michael Flynn: We're officially putting Iran on notice Titled “Our ally Turkey is in crisis and needs our support,” Mr Flynn wrote: “Gulen portrays himself as a moderate, but he is in fact a radical Islamist. He has publicly boasted about his 'soldiers' waiting for his orders to do whatever he directs them to do. "If he were in reality a moderate, he would not be in exile, nor would he excite the animus of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his government. “We need to adjust our foreign policy to recognise Turkey as a priority. We need to see the world from Turkey’s perspective. “The forces of radical Islam derive their ideology from radical clerics like Gulen, who is running a scam. We should not provide him safe haven. In this crisis, it is imperative that we remember who our real friends are.”  World news in pictures 29 show all World news in pictures 1/29 14 February 2017 Aerial view of the wreckage of a passenger and freight train after a crash near Bettembourg, Luxembourg Reuters 2/29 14 February 2017 A general view of rescue workers at the scene of a train collision in Dudelange, Luxembourg EPA 3/29 14 February 2017 A man walks next the wreckage of a passenger and freight train after a crash near Bettembourg, Luxembourg Reuters 4/29 14 February 2017 People wait for news of the rescue efforts at Zubao Coal Mine after a blast in Lianyuan, Hunan province, China.

Neither Mr Trump nor his aides have publicly said that Mr Flynn has the President’s confidence after it was alleged he discussed Russian sanctions with officials before Mr Trump took office. The controversy has left him in a weakened position and under growing political pressure, the Washington Post reports.  Nine former or serving intelligence officials told the Washington Post last week that Mr Flynn had conveyed to the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, that the relationship between the US and Russia would change after Mr Trump took office.  Mr Trump’s senior team and Mr Flynn initially denied the claims. Mr Flynn later said he had "no recollection of discussing sanctions and he couldn't be certain the topic never came up".  Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition, Scott Dworkin, said: “Lieutenant General Flynn, who now holds the top national security position in the White house, has years of questionable relationships working with foreign government. If we can’t trust him to be transparent by filling out a simple form how can we trust him to secure our country at the highest level.”  More about: Donald Trump White House NSA Mike Flynn Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

That is according to Intel’s second annual cloud security report, Building Trust in a Cloudy Sky, which features responses from 2,000 IT professionals. About half (45.6%) of respondents said the scarcity of infosec professionals has contributed to a slowdown in the adoption of cloud services in their organisation and, potentially, fuelled a rise in shadow IT deployments. Just 15% said security skills shortages presented no such problems to their cloud progress, with organisations employing more than 5,000 people least likely to run into this issue. “An IT organisation that is slow to deploy solutions can inadvertently encourage other departments to commission their own services,” the report says. “It can also lead to a disjointed security environment, creating more work for the security team.” Around 40% of the cloud services used by enterprises are deployed without the IT department’s knowledge, the report says. “This is not necessarily a bad thing if IT and security operations have sufficient visibility to keep the applications, data and the organisation safe and secure,” it adds. “Unfortunately, visibility of these shadow IT services has dropped from about 50% last year to just under 47% this year. This is not a very large fall, but it does affect the security posture of the organisation.” When the visibility of shadow IT services is impaired, 65% of respondents said this makes the act of keeping their data safe and secure that much harder. Enterprise cloud evolution The report also highlights a softening in attitude by enterprise IT professionals towards using public cloud to run mission-critical workloads and store sensitive data. Indeed, the number of respondents who said they distrust public cloud services has dropped from 50% to 29% since the first Intel cloud security report was published in 2016. Also, 85% of survey participants said they store “some or all” of their sensitive data in the public cloud, while almost a quarter (23%) rely on it to take care of all their sensitive data. In the survey, respondents were quizzed on their use of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, as well as their private and public cloud adoption habits. The results suggest the hybrid cloud approach is increasingly favoured by enterprises, with 57% of organisations confirming deployments – up from 19% in last year’s report. Read more about cloud security Misinterpretation of the Government Security Classifications could result in the overprovisioning of public sector IT systems. Government Digital Service moves to allay public sector concerns about using off-premise services in a bid to speed up cloud adoption beyond Whitehall. In line with this, the number of organisations using private cloud has fallen from 51% to 25% over the same period, and there remains a degree of trepidation from enterprises about going all-in on public cloud. Raj Samani, CTO for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) at Intel Security, said IT departments can ill afford to hold back on embracing cloud, particularly as it may encourage shadow IT deployments to thrive. “Shadow IT is a significant issue in the UK especially and enterprises are leaving themselves more vulnerable than if they adopted a proactive cloud strategy,” he said. “Attackers will look for the easiest targets, regardless of whether they are public, private or hybrid. Integrated or unified security solutions that provide visibility across all of the organisation’s services could be the best defence. “Rather than having to react to security threats brought about by unregulated cloud adoption from other departments, IT departments should consider working with the wider enterprise to adopt a cloud first strategy that proactively builds security into its core.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Staid Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home, was not the best place for the automaker to mount a defense against Silicon Valley challengers keen to upend the car industry, and he needed to move. "Nobody knows how the world is going to look" in the coming years, said Harms, a bearded 41-year-old dressed in a gray cardigan over a crisply pressed white shirt. "The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change." So he packed up and took his team to Berlin, where increasingly urgent attempts to tap into a growing tech scene are part of German carmakers' efforts to ride a digital wave sweeping the industry -- before it rolls straight over them. Autonomous driving, electric cars and ride-hailing apps from Silicon Valley, like Uber, are reshaping transportation. Young people no longer feel as compelled as previous generations to own cars. And Wall Street shows scant respect for automakers and their global manufacturing prowess: The market value of Google, which is building a driverless car, is more than double that of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen combined. At stake is the fate of the German economy, Europe's largest, at a time when the region is only beginning to emerge from a decadelong economic malaise. Germany, in particular, is as dependent on its carmakers as Michigan is on Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. Non-German carmakers have readily embraced Silicon Valley through partnerships and investment deals. Fiat Chrysler, for instance, is working with Google on self-driving cars. General Motors has poured $500 million into Lyft, the ride-booking service. And Volvo, the Swedish automaker owned by Geely of China, provided the chassis for Uber's recent driverless car tests. By contrast, Germany's automotive giants have favored a more confrontational approach. That has been backed by many locals, who have so far rebuffed Uber's aggressive local expansion plans that have often run roughshod over domestic regulation, and by German politicians eager to please some of the country's biggest employers. BMW, for example, is working with the chipmaker Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car of its own by early in the next decade. It has also formed a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to allow vehicles to automatically adapt to their owners' preferences. To combat the likes of Tesla, the California electric automaker, BMW is planning to expand its i Series line of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles. Since 2014, it has sold 100,000 of the i3 model, which runs on batteries and has a lightweight carbon-fiber body. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, has similarly been investing in digital alternatives. Of the three automakers, it has also been the only one so far to become an active partner with Uber, albeit in a limited deal where it provides a set of its autonomous vehicles to the ride service. The German carmakers' digital plans have led to increased collaboration between what have long been staunch rivals. In 2015, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi unit joined forces to buy Here, a digital mapping unit of Nokia, for about $3 billion. While not a household name, the Berlin-based company provides about 80 percent of the built-in navigation systems for cars in North America and Europe, and is the only large-scale competitor to Google Maps. "The future of Germany as an industrial nation depends on how companies succeed in bringing the manufacturing and digital worlds together," said Frank Ridder, research leader for Germany, Austria and Switzerland for Gartner, a technology research firm. Taken together, the carmakers' digital reboot is aimed at rejuvenating Germany's vaunted industrial base. About one-fifth of jobs in Germany are in manufacturing, double the portion in the United States. But factory jobs as a percentage of total employment have been declining for years, prompting the government to dole out hundreds of millions of euros in research and development funds to meld traditional manufacturing with the latest technology. The initiative, called Industry 4.0, reflects a dawning realization that Germany's historic success may not necessarily help the country thrive in a smartphone-centric world. The experience of Volkswagen is a case in point. The company, which is still dealing with its emissions cheating scandal, is the world's biggest automaker, but was the slowest of the three to embrace the digital age, and is now trying to catch up. That is where Harms comes in. A former consultant at Capgemini, he joined the carmaker in 2008 and is now chief executive of MOIA, a new Volkswagen service that sits somewhere between ride-hailing services and traditional city bus networks. Unlike Uber, which has often run into resistance from officials in Europe, MOIA plans to cooperate with local governments and act as an extension of existing public transportation networks. Instead of lumbering buses following fixed routes, Harms said, MOIA shuttles will adjust their destinations and schedules according to customer demand. The vehicles will be electric, and in the future, some may be self-driving. MOIA has yet to sign any deals, but it is negotiating with cities including Hamburg and Berlin. It hopes to expand quickly into the United States and China. In smaller cities, Harms said, MOIA could offer an inexpensive form of public transportation, even though rivals like Uber and Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service, are already well established in many of these locations. "The whole mobility market -- transportation as a service -- is just at the beginning," Harms said. Volkswagen's recent push into new digital frontiers has taken on added momentum since Matthias Mueller took over as chief executive after the emissions scandal. Under Mueller, Volkswagen has set a goal of selling at least 2 million electric cars a year by 2025 as it tries to rebuild its image and reduce its dependence on diesel cars. In June, Volkswagen bought a piece of the ride-hailing business by investing $300 million in Gett, a taxi-hailing service. But for Harms, the carmakers' best hope of survival is if they can prove the value of owning big factories, even though most previous efforts by the industry -- and other traditional sectors -- to compete with digital upstarts have proved unsuccessful. "A vehicle is extremely sensitive. You can't put out a beta version and then two weeks later an update," he said. "We are the ones who already know how to do it very well."

Close share panel Image copyright Freelancer Image caption Matt Barrie was trying to help his mother set up a website It was doing a favour for his mother that gave entrepreneur Matt Barrie the idea for setting up a business that is now worth more than A$400m ($300m; £243m). His company and website Freelancer has a simple concept - it connects people who have work they need doing with others who compete to do the task by submitting the fee they would charge. Founded just eight years ago in Sydney, today the website has more than 22.5 million users around the world, both freelance workers and those seeking their services. Jobs advertised on Freelancer include everything from help with building a mobile phone app, to writing a company report, designing a tattoo, and help with gaining publicity for something. US space agency Nasa has even used the website since 2015, allowing people to bid to help design items for the International Space Station, including a new robotic arm. It is a pretty good success story for a 43-year-old who admits that when he came up with the idea for Freelancer he was "a broken man". 'Wrong fit' In 2006 Mr Barrie had walked out of his first start-up - a Sydney-based firm called Sensory Networks that made computer chips for security equipment. He was not feeling good. Image copyright Freelancer Image caption Site users submit photos from around the world - this one is from Maccu Pichu in Peru "People used the product but everything was wrong with how we sold it," he says. Despite a blaze of publicity and the support of venture capitalists (VCs), the marketing proved too tough, and the company was struggling. So Mr Barrie quit. "You feel you have let your VCs down, the board, your friends that you hired, your family," he says. Sensory Networks went on to survive without Mr Barrie, and was eventually bought by chip giant Intel in 2013 for $20m, but he says that back in 2006 he "really felt like a failure". Image copyright Freelancer Image caption Freelancer had humble beginnings After a few months of "decompressing", Mr Barrie was beginning to think about his next move when the 2007 global financial crisis swept in. "The whole world was collapsing. Businesses weren't getting funded anymore. I thought, 'what am I going to do with myself?'" he recalls. He decided to take advantage of the enforced downtime to build a website for his mother, a wholesale art and craft supplier. He wanted to include a directory of the stores she supplied, thinking it might encourage others to want to be included. The first Excel spreadsheet had 1,000 rows. Faced with that, Mr Barrie decided to outsource the data entry side of things to local kids. But even offering A$2,000 overall, nobody came running. "I looked around, asked a few people, and they'd say, 'oh it's boring.' I'd reply, 'I know it's boring! That's why I want you to do it.'" Image copyright Freelancer Image caption Matt Barrie broke the bell when the company floated in 2013 After four months Mr Barrie started searching online in desperation for cheap data entry, and stumbled upon a site based in Sweden called Getafreelancer. "It was the ugliest site you have ever seen in your life. I eventually figured out how to post a job," he says. "I went to get lunch, and came back to 74 emails from people saying you're offering A$2,000, I'll do it for A$1,000, A$500 and so on… I thought it was a scam." He eventually hired a team in India who did the job in three days for A$100. "I thought was incredible, a whole army of people out there, many from emerging markets. I looked at all the projects on the website. It was like an ebay for jobs. I thought wow. Image copyright Freelancer Image caption Matt's colleagues had fun when he was on the cover of Australian business magazine BRW Mr Barrie was so impressed by the concept that he decided to set up his own version. The VCs who had flocked to his first start-up were far more cautious this time round, and banks were unwilling to loan to a web-based business with no physical, recoverable assets in the event of failure. In the end a friend who had sold his own firm stumped up the money, and Mr Barrie first secured workers via Getafreelancer, before then buying that business. Freelancer, whose entire operation is cloud-based using Amazon Web Services, has since gone on to buy up 18 other rival sites. Its directly employed workforce now totals 570 people. 'Ultimate meritocracy' Sites like Freelancer have faced criticism for driving down prices for professionals trying to sell their services, but Mr Barrie counters that the company has had a huge, positive impact on millions of people in developing countries. "You can be somewhere where your average wage is A$2 a day," he says. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Matt Barrie says he is a workaholic "The average project [on Freelancer] pays A$200. "You can make your month's salary in a few days. It's the ultimate meritocracy. It's up to you to figure out what you want to do." And it is also not necessarily the lowest bidder who wins the job - Freelancer says that 47% of the projects on its site are awarded to "the median bidder or higher". Entrepreneur Emma Sinclair, co-founder of human resources software business Enterprise Jungle, says firms are increasingly looking to hire non-staff to complete projects rather than carry out the work in-house. "Nearly 35% of today's total workforce is comprised of non-employee workers and this is set to continue to grow," she says "Sites like Freelancer are therefore very well-placed to service both the growing on-demand labour force looking for work, as well as the corporates who are hiring them. "It is an invaluable marketplace for talent, with an all-important rating system to weed out the poor or unreliable performers." On a day-to-day basis Mr Barrie is, by his own admission, a workaholic. "I live this, I breathe it. I get up in the morning and start work. I'm often in the office until 10pm. "I've had several offers to sell - one formal. I had a good think, and said I couldn't think of doing anything else."

In his first three weeks in office, President Trump has launched a dizzying flurry of actions, dominating the headlines and sparking controversy. But to his frustration, he has begun running smack into constraints mandated by the Constitution and imposed by political reality. Without acknowledging he's being forced to trim his sails, the president is moving to delay some campaign promises and downsize others, steps that sometimes have been overshadowed by a continued stream of the defiant tweets that marked his political rise. A moratorium on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations? While insisting the administration will prevail over a federal judge's decision blocking implementation of the executive order he signed, the White House is drafting a narrower version designed to avoid some of the judicial objections. Confront China? In a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping late Thursday — and in a wake of a diplomatic firestorm over Trump's post-election conversation with Taiwan's leader — Trump explicitly endorsed the "one China" policy. Immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act? Now he says crafting a replacement, an issue that divides congressional Republicans, may extend into 2018. To be sure, Trump has taken steps that have had immediate consequences, from pulling out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal (though it hadn't taken effect yet) to clearing the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.

"He lived in a world where, by and large, he got his way, and when he didn't get his way, he would sue people or they would sue him," says Tom Cronin, a Colorado College political scientist and co-author of The Paradoxes of the American Presidency. Trump seems "annoyed" by the steep learning curve, Cronin said, and is discovering "He can't quite sue the Senate." On CBS' Face the Nation Sunday, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller said the president was assessing his options on the immigration ban. "For one thing, we can take the case to the Supreme Court on the emergency stay; we can go back to the district court and we can have a hearing on the merits," he said. "Additionally, we're considering new and further executive actions that will enhance the security posture of the United States." Trump is the first president in history never to have served in the government or the military before moving into the White House. That was a potential vulnerability he turned into an asset during the campaign, portraying himself as a no-nonsense business leader with the strength and skills to negotiate deals and manage the economy in ways that had eluded his presidential predecessors. "I alone can fix it," he declared in his speech to the Republican National Convention in July. And he is hardly the first president who has been frustrated by the limits of his authority and the power of others. Last year, federal courts blocked an executive order signed by President Obama offering some protection to an estimated 4.3 million illegal immigrants who were parents of U.S. citizens or lawful residents. In 1998, the House of Representatives impeached President Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was acquitted by the Senate. But Trump's impatience, his combative persona and his preference for unilateral action — characteristics that may have served him well in the real estate business — have brought more confrontations with a sharper edge than other modern presidents in the early days of their tenure. He hasn't shown the traditional public deference for the co-equal branches of government, deriding a "so-called judge" who ruled against him in the immigration case and labeling Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer as "head clown." It's just possible that memories of that moniker may not be helpful when Trump needs to lobby Schumer for support on legislation. "Being head of a family business is just about the worst preparation imaginable for the institutional constraints of Washington," says William Galston, a veteran of the Clinton White House staff. "Donald Trump is in for a set of experiences that will be entirely novel to him." Read more:  USA TODAY The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Aide Stephen Miller takes vigorous Trump defense to TV Sunday shows Trump team assesses legal options on travel ban So far, Trump hasn't moderated his rhetoric or tempered his tweets. On Saturday night, he bashed the news media. "I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful!" On Sunday morning, he turned his fire on billionaire Mark Cuban, a critic who endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president last year. "I know Mark Cuban well," Trump wrote. "He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!" However, he has moderated some of his policy positions, from the timetable for repealing Obamacare to the specifics of the immigration ban. Trump told reporters he continues to believe that waterboarding was effective in interrogating terror suspects, but he said he would defer to Defense Secretary James Mattis, who opposes them. After meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, European Union leaders said they had been assured the United States would uphold the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump denounced during the campaign. The president's meeting Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will test Trump's new, more skeptical stance toward expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank. Charlie Black, a Republican consultant who has known Trump for years, predicts that some of the skills the president honed negotiating real-estate deals will end up working in the Oval Office as well. "He had a lot of wins and losses," including some that demanded patience in negotiations with banks. His strengths as a salesman could be used to persuade members of Congress, Black says: "He ran into barriers before. He'll have to adapt to them."

His project examines the DNA in cancer cells. (Courtesy of Prathik Naidu) By Moriah Balingit By Moriah Balingit February 12 Follow @ByMoriah They are digging into the structure of the genes behind cancer, studying the mysterious forces of the cosmos and developing software to read emotions. The 40 finalists of the Regeneron Science Talent Search who arrive in the District next month represent the pinnacle of science research among teens. Their projects could translate into important developments in science and medicine. Four are from the Washington area: Prathik Naidu, of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County; David Rekhtman, of Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda; and Sambuddha Chattopadhyay and Rohan Dalvi, both of Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring. [From 2016: These teen scientists, vying for $1 million in scholarships, will give you faith in the future] The contest, previously known as the Intel Science Talent Search, has a new name and a new principal sponsor. Regeneron, a biotechnology company, was started by two talent-search finalists. The contest’s aim is the same. Fellow finalist Emily Peterson, 17, of New York, conducts research at the Living Skin Bank, housed in the Stony Brook School of Dental Medicine, in summer 2016. Peterson's research examines a protein that appears to be critical for wound repair and hopes her research will someday be used to improve how doctors treat burn victims. (Courtesy of Emily Peterson) “We are looking for the future scientific leaders of this country,” said Maya Ajmera, the president and chief executive of the Society for Science & the Public, which produces the science talent search. The teens in the competition are more than lab geeks. Many work part-time jobs and throw their skills and time into volunteering. Some have founded nonprofit organizations dedicated to classical language and computer science. Nearly half are athletes, and several edit student publications. [From 2016: Meet the teen who just won $150,000 for inventing a device to diagnose lung disease] “The kids are incredibly well-rounded. They not only do science research, but they are involved in all aspects of the world around them,” Ajmera said. “They want to make the world a better place, and they see this as a steppingstone.” All finalists will receive $25,000 scholarships. The top prize comes with a $250,000 scholarship. Here is a look at some of the finalists: When Prathik Naidu, 17, envisioned becoming a research scientist, he saw himself in a white lab jacket. He performed his first experiments using a chemistry kit he got for his birthday in his parents’ kitchen, donning miniature goggles. Then he spent a summer at Johns Hopkins University, where he discovered computational biology, a field in which scientists use computers to make predictions and process large amounts of biological data. They are more prone to be found hunched over a computer than a petri dish. “That’s what really got me interested in bridging the gap between computer science and biology,” Naidu said. Naidu’s project, developed during a summer internship at MIT, examines the genes of cancer cells in a three-dimensional way with software he built himself. “This gives us an unprecedented insight into the inner working of cancer cells, something that we haven’t be able to see before using normal techniques,” Naidu said. His passion for computational biology has taken him to an international conference in Dublin, where he was the only high school student to present research. It also led him to establish a computational biology conference, hoping to get middle and high school students excited about real-world applications of computer science. He has applied his love of computer science to an entirely different field: ancient languages. He is the founder of the Classics Project, which aims to promote Latin and Greek in the classroom and in veterans’ homes. Naidu has led groups, with veterans reading classics such as “The Aeneid.” “If I learn something cool, then someone else should know it, too,” Naidu said. If he could spread his excitement about computer science or the classics to a younger generation of students, “that could create the next generation of young scientists or young researchers or young change-makers.” Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, 17, sees himself not only as a budding physicist but also as an explorer akin to the movie character Indiana Jones. Rather than chasing relics in booby-trapped temples in Peru, Sambuddha is probing mysteries of the far reaches of the universe — theoretically speaking. “It’s very much like being like Indiana Jones,” Chattopadhyay said. “You’re on the forefront of putting stuff in museums, but just in a different way.” Chattopadhyay’s project explores dark energy, “an enigmatic phenomenon that is causing the accelerating expansion of the universe,” he said. Physicists discovered dark energy in the late 1990s, but have had difficulty quantifying it and understanding it. “We’re very much in the dark of how to deal with dark energy,” Chattopadhyay said. He said his research “may provide a viable path to understanding dark energy in the future.” Outside the laboratory, Chattopadhyay helps Blair High put on a math tournament for middle schoolers and performs Bengali songs and poetry. After his school day ends at Whitman High, David Rekhtman, 18, leaves campus for an unusual activity: research at the National Institutes of Health. There, Rekhtman, who is in the second year of a special high school internship program at NIH, helped discover something that could lead to an important breakthrough in cancer treatment. Rekhtman’s project examines the potential of immunogenic cell death in cancer treatment, which he explained as training “the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells.” The approach could come with fewer side effects than common cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. “It’s better to use your own body to fight disease than it is to use many many different kinds of drugs,” Rekhtman said. Rekhtman experimented with heating cancer cells using a laser, a simple approach that appeared to prompt an immune response, at least within the confines of the lab. Now, the technique is being tested in clinical trials at NIH, where researchers will test its effectiveness in real patients. Rohan Dalvi, 17, has been drawn to biology for a simple reason: “I really like that it’s sort of driven by the desire to improve human lives,” he said. Dalvi spent the summer of 2015 at a genetics lab at Johns Hopkins University, where he grew deeply fascinated by the “interactions between the molecules.” For his project, Dalvi worked with researchers in a Georgetown University chemistry lab, where he aided them in developing a faster and more efficient technique for gauging the size and structure of biomolecules — the molecules that make up living organisms. It is a long way from being refined, but Dalvi said if it is ever adopted on a large scale, it could accelerate drug research. Developing a new drug can be a tedious game of hit-or-miss, so a new tool that can analyze molecules faster and more efficiently could be a game-changer. Dalvi said the new technique has the potential to look at the structure of a drug molecule and its ability to bind to a protein at the same time. That could give researchers clues to how effective a drug would be. The technique could also give researchers a better sense of how proteins function, aiding them in studying diseases and developing better treatments. “We can potentially understand the mechanisms on a molecular level that underlay some of these diseases,” Rohan said. *** When Emily Peterson was in elementary school, she started an organization to buy teddy bears for young burn victims at Stonybrook Hospital in New York, an effort inspired by her firefighter father. She recalls the first time she delivered a bear to a patient, a 3- or 4-year-old boy covered in bandages. “I remember walking into the room. This little boy was just crying and screaming to his parents because it hurt so badly,” said Peterson, now 17, a senior at Smithtown High School East in St. James, N.Y. “It really opened my eyes to how severe it can be and how devastating it could be to someone’s life.” As an eighth grader, she learned about a researcher’s work on improving and speeding up recovery for burn victims while she made waffles for an awards ceremony at the burn center. She then discovered her calling: to improve the lives of burn victims. Peterson started her research at 16 at the Living Skin Bank, part of the Stony Book School of Dental Medicine. She has focused on probing the function of a special protein, called lecithin-retinol acyltransferase, or LRAT, that plays a role in wound repair. Her research suggests that the absence of the protein could play a role in skin cancer because cancerous cells do not express the protein. Emily hopes her work will help doctors develop better treatments for burn victims. Much of the foundational treatment, she said, has not changed for centuries and still involves an abundance of patience and extreme pain. She said her work with burn patients will continue to drive her efforts. “I’ve met the person who my research is going to affect someday and I know the problem that’s it’s going to help,” Emily said. “Once we gain enough knowledge about the healthy wound-healing process, we’ll be able to improve that in burn victims.” *** Students in developing countries face plenty of challenges in getting an education: a lack of books and pencils, and in some cases, a teacher. Krithika Iyer, 17, of Plano, Tex., said some students are now relying primarily or exclusively on donated laptops and tablets, loaded with software, to get their education without a teacher who can explain difficult-to-comprehend subjects and encourage them when they feel challenged. So she created an app that can read a student’s face through a camera and help gauge whether a student is comprehending a subject or growing frustrated. “When there’s no teachers, you really don’t get the social atmosphere,” Iyer said. “This is trying to take into account the student’s emotional response.” Iyer said emotional cues are critical to help teachers discern whether a student is absorbing a topic, and she aims to try to replicate that with the app. If a student is alone and struggling, the app could develop a feature that prompts a message suggesting a student take a break or directing the student to less-challenging materials. Iyer said the app could help keep students in the virtual classroom. Working alone, some could be tempted to give up. “It will allow them to have a social atmosphere because the system will take in their emotions and will give them more humanlike response,” Iyer said. “When they reach that critical stage of frustration, where they just want to give up, if there’s a system that can understand that they’re frustrated and do something about it, that will keep them engaged.” local education Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Roston - Feb 12, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 9/10 Pros Extremely thin and light Excellent design Display handles light glares like a champ Cons No touchscreen option Lenovo’s popular X1 lineup has grown substantially over the years, and one of the newest products to flesh out its wares is the ThinkCentre X1, an all-in-one Windows desktop PC comprised of a single thin, lightweight display. This monitor, despite its slim profile, packs a bunch of hardware, including a 6th-gen Intel processor and a pair of 5W stereo speakers. The model’s quite attractive upon first look, but does it maintain its appeal over the long haul? Hardware The X1 lineup is known for its thin yet powerful laptops. It’s no surprise, then, that the ThinkCentre X1 features an exceptionally thin profile, at least as far as all-in-one desktops are concerned, as well as a very light weight. Unlike many competing model, which are usually heavy and thick, the ThinkCentre X1 appears at first glance to merely be a thin monitor, one held up by an attractive but decidedly utilitarian silver pipe stand and a flat metal base. You can easily pick up the ThinkCentre X1 with a single hand, and despite its large 24-inch display, it doesn’t take up much room on a desk. Rather than using a rounded or tapered rear design, Lenovo went with an angular, blocky construction. The computing hardware is packed into the lower, thicker portion of the display, while the rest of the monitor is very thin (0.4in), lending it a minimalist visage. The model is made with an aluminum-alloy chassis. Most of the ports are located directly beneath the hinge, which allows the display to be tipped forward and backward a substantial degree. Thanks to the display’s anti-glare treatment, the monitor has great visibility even with bright light shining directly onto it. The rear ports include the power and Ethernet offerings, meaning the cables that are likely to stay plugged in all the time are tucked away where you rarely have to see them. The rear ports are joined by a few on the left side of the display, including a pair of USB 3.0 ports for items you connect and disconnect frequently; one of the two ports supports rapid charging, as well. This side also holds an optional card reader and the audio jack, while the right side sports three buttons, including the very large power button. Tucked away neatly into this slim display are a pair of 5W stereo speakers, as previously mentioned, which include Dolby Audio, as well as dual-array microphones and a webcam with a built-in cover. This cover can be opened and closed easily via a small tab on the top of the display, addressing the privacy concerns some have regarding always-visible integrated cameras. It’s small attention to details like this that help win the ThinkCentre X1 points over some competing models. As we’d expect from an X1 product, the design is spot-on in all regardless, making this model quite attractive from a visual standpoint. The all-in-one wouldn’t look out of place in a business environment, nor would it clash with a modern-style home office or classic wooden desk. Arguably less attractive but no less functional is the included keyboard, a big black wireless offering with big keys and hinged rear feet to elevate the unit. The model is powered by a couple AAA batteries, and it works via a wireless receiver dongle plugged into one of the USB ports. There’s nothing to dislike about the keyboard, it just visually falls flat compared to the angular, sleek beauty of the display. The wireless mouse is similarly basic in design, itself also powered by a pair of batteries (AA, in this case), but with a rubber-like texture that’s comfortable to grip. The mouse is black in its entirety save for the scroll wheel, which is crimson. There is a large white Lenovo brand stamped on the back of the mouse, however. Finally, Lenovo promises that the ThinkCentre X1 is durable, a boasting point the company has for many of its products. In this case, we expect you won’t be likely to drop the unit — durability comes in the form of withstanding pesky office dust, a whole ten years’ worth of exposure. Lenovo says this ThinkCentre was able to operate without issue in the company’s test chamber with up to 4.4lbs of dust. TECH SPECS Processor: Up to 6th Generation Intel® Core™ i5 Processor Operating System: – Windows 10 Home – Windows 10 Pro – Lenovo recommends Windows 10 Pro – Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (pre-installed through downgrade rights in Windows 10 Pro 64-bit) Graphics: Intel® HD Graphics 520 Memory: Up to 16 GB, 2133 MHz, DDR4 Storage: – 2.5″ HDD (500 GB) – 2.5″ SSD (128 GB / 192 GB / 512 GB) – 2.5″ OPAL SSD (256 GB) Camera / Microphone / Speaker: – 1080p / Dual Array Microphones – 2 x 5W with Dolby® Audio – Skype™ for Business Certified Display: 23.8″ FHD IPS Anti-Glare 250 nits Dimensions: – Without Stand: 22.44″ x 1.3″ x 14.17″ – With Orchid Tilt Stand: 22.44″ x 9.45″ x 17.75″ Weight: – Without Stand 8.8 lbs – With Orchid Tilt Stand 11 lbs Kensington Lock Privacy Camera Lock Stand Orchid Tilt Stand: Tilt Angle: -5° ~ 45° Ports: – Side: — 2 x USB 3.0 Ports (including 1 x USB rapid charge) — 7-in-1 Card Reader(Optional) — Headphone and Microphone Combo — Power-on – Rear: — LAN-in — Power DC-in — 3 x USB 3.0 Ports — 1 x Intelligent DP Port WiFi: 2 x 2 WiFi 802.11ac + Bluetooth Software & Performance Lenovo offers the ThinkCentre X1 with both Windows 7 and Windows 10 options, and the preloaded software you get will depend somewhat on which of the two you choose. Our review unit features Windows 10, and per Lenovo, included things like the company’s own REACHit, SHAREit, Solution Center, Companion 2.0, and Bluetooth Lock. There are also some third-party offerings like CyberLink PowerDVD Create, Power Producer, and Power2GO, McAfee LiveSafe, a Microsoft Office trial, a LiveSafe trial, My Timeline, PC Device State, Rainbow, the ThinkVantage Password Manger, and more. You can uninstall these applications if you’d like, or just reinstall Windows yourself. The ThinkCentre X1 was used for everyday business tasks, which included things like word processing, photo editing, uploading/downloading, ample Web browsing, and similar. I also streamed both music and videos, sometimes while doing the above tasks, and never ran into any performance troubles. The system is quite snappy, though no doubt your particular experience will vary depending on your model’s hardware configuration. Our review unit featured the Intel Core i5-6200U processor option. Things we like There’s a lot to like about the ThinkCentre X1, but areas in particular that stand out include the excellent hinge, stand and base, the combination of which is highly attractive, minimalist, and functional. The display is also excellent if your tastes skew toward the ‘matte’ side of the spectrum, as this X1 model can handle overhead light glares and direct sunlight without issue. Of course, the model also wins points for its lightweight and thin design. Issues We didn’t encounter any issues when reviewing the ThinkCentre X1, but there are a couple things users should be aware of. The first ‘issue’ is the maximum brightness of 250 nits, which is perfectly fine for daily use, but may prove lackluster for graphic designers, photographers, or others who need a very bright display. The second potential downside is the lack of a touchscreen option. Conclusion The Lenovo ThinkCentre X1 is a well-rounded all-in-one PC that pays attention to details both big and small, and the end result is a model suitable for many users. There are some sticking points, such as the lack of touchscreen, but they largely come down to personal preference. This model is a great option for someone who needs an everyday PC or work system that won’t take up much space on the desk while offering more display real estate and ports than the average laptop. The ThinkCentre X1 is available from Lenovo’s website starting at $824 USD.

Home News Artikel Videos Community Forum Erweiterte Suche Home --> News --> Prozessoren 12.02.2017, 12:10 | Quelle: PCWorld <<< News >>> AMD FX- & A-Serien CPUs bleiben Athlon, Sempron, FX & Co. sollen Mainstream-User bedienen Anfang März werden die neuen AMD Ryzen Prozessoren für Enthusiasten und High-End Gaming auf den Markt kommen, aber was passiert mit dem aktuellen CPU- und APU-Sortiment? Diese werden nicht sofort von den Ryzen CPUs abgelöst, sondern sollen PC-Anwender mit begrenztem Budget bedienen, denn Ryzen wird - für AMD-Verhältnisse - im hochpreisigen Segment positioniert. Anzeige So soll denn auch die FX-Serie, die aktuell teuersten Prozessoren, nicht durch die neuen CPUs mit Zen Mikroarchitektur ersetzt werden, sondern zu attrativeren Preisen angeboten werden, berichten Analysten. Ähnliches gilt für die APUs der A-Serie, die ebenfalls weiter in das Budget-Segment verschoben wird. Schließlich werden die Raven Ridge APUs mit CPU-Teil auf Zen-Basis auch bald kommen. Die Kompatibilität mit dem bereits bestehenden Sockel AM4 hilft bei diesem Übergang, denn dadurch können lat AMD-Sprecher auch bestehende Plattformen mit einer Ryzen CPU aufgerüstet werden. Der Sockel AM4 unterstützt z.B. sowohl die neuen Prozessoren als auch die letzten A-Serie Chips der siebten Generation. Die Beibehaltung der aktuellen Prozessoren ist natürlich sinnvoll, damit AMD nicht nur das High-End Segment von Intel Core i5 und i7 angreifen kann, sondern ein komplettes Produktsortiment für alle Preisbereiche anbieten kann. AMD Ryzen wird über kurz oder lang die Anzahl der bisherigen CPUs im niedrigpreisigen Bereich reduzieren, aber bis zur kompletten Ablösung der aktuellen CPU-Generation wird noch etwas Zeit vergehen. Schließlich sind die Einsteiger- und Mainstream-Segmente große Märkte - zu groß, um sie bereits bei der Ryzen-Einführung zu ignorieren. Nach Angaben eines Analysten soll die Übergangsphase zwischen neun und zwölf Monaten andauern, bis die Zen-Prozessoren von oben bis unten alles abgelöst haben. Die Bedienung aller Preissgmente könnte die aktuell positive Entwicklung von AMD im Bereich der Mikroprozessoren unterstützen. Im letzten Jahr kletterten die Marktanteile von AMD nach Angaben von Marktforschern von 12,7 auf 13,6 Prozent, während Marktführer Intel im Vergleich von 2016 zu 2015 von 87,1 auf 86,3 % Marktanteile fiel.

With an agenda designed for senior executives and board members, the conference will examine how businesses are reinventing their business models to address digital transformation and the leadership changes and transformative technologies executives are embracing to ensure the future of their organizations. “Through research we are conducting here at the Center for Digital Transformation, we have identified that it is not enough to invest in digital initiatives alone. To embrace digital transformation fully requires a comprehensive effort to operate as a digital company. It demands leadership from the top; a commitment to building a digital enterprise; business model innovation and, a new talent pool,” said Vijay Gurbaxani, founding director of the CDT and Taco Bell Professor of Business and Computer Science at the Merage School. The 2017 Road to Reinvention conference will explore critical issues that senior executives must consider in 2017 as they lead their company’s reinvention journey. The program will feature keynote presentations, one-on-one interviews, and panel discussions with experienced executives including: • David Baga, Chief Business Officer, Lyft • Craig Boundy, CEO, Experian • Mic Bowman, Principal Engineer, Intel • Michael Chui, Partner, McKinsey Global Institute • Doug Dooley, Venture Capitalist, Venrock • Thomas Gewecke, CDO & EVP of Strategy and Business Development, Warner Bros • Martin Giles, Partner, Wing Venture Capital and Senior Industry Fellow, Center for Digital Transformation • Vijay Gurbaxani, Founding Director, Center for Digital Transformation • Paddy Hannon, Chief Technology Officer, Edmunds.com • David Karpook, Strategic Business Consultant, Planon Software • Bill Maurer, Dean, School of Social Sciences and Director, Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion • Mike McNamara, CIO, Target • Julie Merges, Chief People Officer, Edmunds.com • Raj Minhas, VP and Director, Xerox PARC's Interaction and Analytics Lab • Mark Moore, Assistant General Counsel, Silicon Valley Bank • Jody Mulkey, CTO, Ticketmaster • Tingting Nian, Assistant Professor, UC Irvine’s Paul Merage School of Business • Mike O’Brien, Vice President of Corporate and Product Planning, Hyundai Motor America • Eugene Park, Chief Product Officer, Edmunds.com • Andy Policano, Dean's Leadership Circle Professor and Board Director for Rockwell Collins and Badger Meter • Philip Potloff, Chief Digital Officer, Edmunds.com • Dan Rabinovitsj, COO, Ruckus Wireless Business Unit, Brocade • Basit Sheikh, Vice President, Emerging Technology Group, Capital Group • Willy Shih, former President, Consumer Digital Business, Kodak and current Robert and Jane Cizik Professor at the Harvard Business School • Gregory Spierkel, former CEO, Ingram Micro and Board Director for PACCAR, MGM Resorts International, and Schneider-Electric • Allen Webb, Editor-in-Chief, The McKinsey Quarterly Structured as a one-day executive forum, the Road to Reinvention will provide participants with new knowledge, contrasting viewpoints and actionable insights from peers who are building and reinventing organizations to succeed in the digital economy. The conference sessions will highlight the specific challenges that companies face on the road to reinvention: how technology is changing competition; new business models; the business impact of the Internet of Things; the role of the CEO and Boards in leading digital transformation; navigating amidst constant change; and providing a view into the future. The 2017 Road to Reinvention conference is made possible by generous sponsors including: Brocade (Platinum Sponsor); Cognizant, Technossus and Trace3 (Gold Sponsors); Accenture, Avanade, Avasant, Experian, Hitachi Consulting, Innominds, Liferay, Slalom, Telogis and UPS (Silver Sponsors).

The Department of Finance confirmed that the minister met with senior executives from Facebook, Intel, Apple, Google and PayPal on an investment promotion visit to Silicon Valley. It said that during the meetings the minister updated the companies on economic and political developments in Ireland. He also took the opportunity to discuss a number of tax issues. Among these were the state’s response to developments in the Apple state aid case. He also spoke to the executives about a European Commission proposal for harmonisation of the corporate tax base — known as the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). Want to read more?

In his first three weeks in office, President Trump has launched a dizzying flurry of actions, dominating the headlines and sparking controversy. But to his frustration, he has begun running smack into constraints mandated by the Constitution and imposed by political reality. Without acknowledging he's being forced to trim his sails, the president is moving to delay some campaign promises and downsize others, steps that sometimes have been overshadowed by a continued stream of the defiant tweets that marked his political rise. A moratorium on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations? While insisting the administration will prevail over a federal judge's decision blocking implementation of the executive order he signed, the White House is drafting a narrower version designed to avoid some of the judicial objections. Confront China? In a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping late Thursday — and in a wake of a diplomatic firestorm over Trump's post-election conversation with Taiwan's leader — Trump explicitly endorsed the "one China" policy. Immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act? Now he says crafting a replacement, an issue that divides congressional Republicans, may extend into 2018. To be sure, Trump has taken steps that have had immediate consequences, from pulling out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal (though it hadn't taken effect yet) to clearing the way for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.

"He lived in a world where, by and large, he got his way, and when he didn't get his way, he would sue people or they would sue him," says Tom Cronin, a Colorado College political scientist and co-author of The Paradoxes of the American Presidency. Trump seems "annoyed" by the steep learning curve, Cronin said, and is discovering "He can't quite sue the Senate." On CBS' Face the Nation Sunday, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller said the president was assessing his options on the immigration ban. "For one thing, we can take the case to the Supreme Court on the emergency stay; we can go back to the district court and we can have a hearing on the merits," he said. "Additionally, we're considering new and further executive actions that will enhance the security posture of the United States." Trump is the first president in history never to have served in the government or the military before moving into the White House. That was a potential vulnerability he turned into an asset during the campaign, portraying himself as a no-nonsense business leader with the strength and skills to negotiate deals and manage the economy in ways that had eluded his presidential predecessors. "I alone can fix it," he declared in his speech to the Republican National Convention in July. And he is hardly the first president who has been frustrated by the limits of his authority and the power of others. Last year, federal courts blocked an executive order signed by President Obama offering some protection to an estimated 4.3 million illegal immigrants who were parents of U.S. citizens or lawful residents. In 1998, the House of Representatives impeached President Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was acquitted by the Senate. But Trump's impatience, his combative persona and his preference for unilateral action — characteristics that may have served him well in the real estate business — have brought more confrontations with a sharper edge than other modern presidents in the early days of their tenure. He hasn't shown the traditional public deference for the co-equal branches of government, deriding a "so-called judge" who ruled against him in the immigration case and labeling Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer as "head clown." It's just possible that memories of that moniker may not be helpful when Trump needs to lobby Schumer for support on legislation. "Being head of a family business is just about the worst preparation imaginable for the institutional constraints of Washington," says William Galston, a veteran of the Clinton White House staff. "Donald Trump is in for a set of experiences that will be entirely novel to him." Read more:  USA TODAY The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Aide Stephen Miller takes vigorous Trump defense to TV Sunday shows Trump team assesses legal options on travel ban So far, Trump hasn't moderated his rhetoric or tempered his tweets. On Saturday night, he bashed the news media. "I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka. To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful!" On Sunday morning, he turned his fire on billionaire Mark Cuban, a critic who endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president last year. "I know Mark Cuban well," Trump wrote. "He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls. He's not smart enough to run for president!" However, he has moderated some of his policy positions, from the timetable for repealing Obamacare to the specifics of the immigration ban. Trump told reporters he continues to believe that waterboarding was effective in interrogating terror suspects, but he said he would defer to Defense Secretary James Mattis, who opposes them. After meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, European Union leaders said they had been assured the United States would uphold the Iranian nuclear deal, which Trump denounced during the campaign. The president's meeting Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will test Trump's new, more skeptical stance toward expanding settlements in the occupied West Bank. Charlie Black, a Republican consultant who has known Trump for years, predicts that some of the skills the president honed negotiating real-estate deals will end up working in the Oval Office as well. "He had a lot of wins and losses," including some that demanded patience in negotiations with banks. His strengths as a salesman could be used to persuade members of Congress, Black says: "He ran into barriers before. He'll have to adapt to them."

Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 02/13/2017 — Software defined perimeter (SDP) which is also known as a "Black Cloud", is an approach to computer security which is evolved from the work done at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) under the Global Information Grid (GIG) Black Core Network initiative around 2007. Software defined perimeter is a security framework that has been developed by cloud security alliance, a not-for-profit organization promoting security assurance within cloud computing. This framework is based on the Department of Defense's "need-to-know" model. The mentioned model states that all endpoints attempting to access a given infrastructure must be authorized and authenticated prior to entrance. Successful network-based attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and lateral movement and server vulnerabilities attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting are lowered due with the adoption of SDPs. Get Sample Report Copy: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=16916 The global software defined perimeter is driven by the growing demand for cloud-based software defined perimeter solutions as it is cost-effective and feature more scalability in comparison to the traditional software defined perimeter. Organizations are rapidly deploying security testing solutions either on-premises or on cloud to ensure efficient security solution to the organization. Moreover, organizations are increasingly adopting these solutions to minimize human intervention in security functionalities and enable synchronization between security policies and enterprises' dynamic computing environment which in turn is boosting the deployment of software defined perimeter.

The decision to move the former COO into the CEO role was driven by a shift in Romonet's operating model as it gears up to deliver on new global customers who came on board in the last quarter of 2016. "The company faces new challenges as its brand strength continues to grow," commented Reeves. "While our commercial focus will continue, our prime objective is delivering the highest quality analytics and business information to our customers who are rapidly expanding their global data center estates and require long-term predictive financial and operating performance models." A former Chief Information Officer at Balfour Beatty, Reeves brings years of directing complex global technology projects and large company relationship management. He will work closely with Romonet's CFO, Richard Rowson, who, as the former CFO at Global Switch, brings industry credibility and customer validation. Rowson was influential in leading recent successes with new customers in Asia and Europe. Rick Skett re-joins Romonet having previously held roles of both Head of Marketing and Chairman in the past. Prior to that, Skett enjoyed a 30-year long career at Intel. His previous positions included EMEA Group Marketing Director and UK & Ireland Country Manager. Co-founder and Executive Director, Zahl Limbuwala, continues to serve on the board with a direct focus on developing global customer and strategic partner relationships as well as maximizing Romonet's visibility as an industry leader. "This marks the next stage of Romonet's evolution, and the market's investment in predictive analytics," said Limbuwala. "We have proven to both save money and energy while increasing performance and it is exciting to now be delivering this service to the companies that underpin global data center innovation."

Just as it did last year, Lenovo is expected to unveil a new Miix 320 at MWC 2017 this month. The number will tell you that it’s an upgrade to last year’s model and, while that might be true, it isn’t as huge a jump as it might sound. Lenovo has quite a few lines under its Miix brand, all of them sporting screens that detach from their keyboards. The Miix 3XX line differs significantly both in design and in specs. It doesn’t sport a kickstand design like a Surface and more a traditional hinge like an ASUS Transformer. It also doesn’t pack a punch, aimed squarely at the budget market. The Miix 320 is of a similar bent, though it steps up the game in some aspects and offers more options than its predecessor. The processor is still an Atom, now an Intel X5-Z8350, a slight bump up. RAM, however, can either be 2 or 4 GB. The 10.1-inch display now has a 1280×800 option in addition to 1920×1080. There’s also a USB-C port, in line with recent computing trends. In terms of design, its biggest change is the relocation of the speakers, now facing front and at the bottom. The Lenovo Miix 320 might not wow in terms of specs, but its price tag might. It’s expected to start at $220, more or less, on par with its specs. Of course, that depends on the configuration options, which also includes a LTE connectivity for ultimate mobility.

Twitter Facebook Expert: Line between cyber crooks and cyber spies getting more blurry Actors who steal for cash and also work on government payrolls will increase over next five years, former assistant U.S. attorney says Tim Greene (Network World) 13 February, 2017 21:12 - - - - print email Comments Cybercriminals acting on behalf of national governments and nation-backed espionage agents carrying out cybercrimes for cash on the side is the future of security threats facing corporations and governments, says the former top U.S. attorney in charge of the Department of Justice’s national security division. Morrison & Foerster John Carlin “I think this blending of criminal and national security, whether it’s terrorists or state actors moonlighting as crooks or state actors using criminal groups as a way to distance themselves from the action, I think that is a trend that we saw increasing that’s just going to continue to increase over the next three to five years,” says John Carlin, now an attorney with Morrison & Foerster. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box He says that as a result, cooperation between businesses and law enforcement is vital to catching these foreign adversaries. What seems a simple criminal act may actually be traceable to an act of espionage or terrorism. For example, he cites the case of Ardit Ferizi, who stole personal information from a U.S. internet hosting company and sought $500 in bitcoin or he’d release it to the public. It seemed a simple extortion, but when it was reported to the government, it turned out to be more complicated. It seems Ferizi was conspiring with a well-known cyberterrorist, Junaid Hussein, who was number three on the Pentagon’s kill list among ISIL terrorists. Ferizi’s job was to get personal information from businesses in order to create an assassination list of individuals that held government jobs. The list of names and addresses would be turned over to Hussein, who would distribute it to ISIL affiliates in the U.S. via Twitter who would carry out the murders, Carlin says. The $500 extortion attempt was apparently Ferizi’s freelancing for a little cash on the side, he says. Ferizi was extradited to the U.S., tried, convicted and is spending 20 years in prison. Hussein was killed in a drone strike. “That’s the type of case where I think sometimes people don’t realize what the risk is,” Carlin says. “If a company knew that was a terrorist group, they would definitely report it … but because you don’t work with government to connect those dots, you don’t always know on your end alone.” He spoke about another case in which the Department of Justice filed criminal charges against five officers in China’s People’s Liberation Army for committing economic espionage. It’s unlikely they’ll ever come to trial, so what’s the point? “We did that both to bring the terms to the table and show we can figure out who did it and when we do there will be consequences and also by making it public,” he says. Filing the charges also drew attention to the fact that the U.S. is declaring this type of activity illegal, even though there’s not much they can do about it in court. Not taking action would tacitly condone it, he says. “Otherwise you’re creating, under international law, essentially an easement that says, ‘OK it’s OK to use your intel services to steal this type of information.’ In some ways this was a giant no-trespassing sign; get off our lawn.” And he says the tactic was effective. There’s been a decrease in China’s use of military and intelligence services to target private companies. When China’s President Xi Jinping met with former President Barack Obama last year after the charges had been filed, he agreed to the principle that the military should not be used to steal private information for private gain. The internet of things poses a different kind of threat, he says. The IoT is plagued by the same problems the internet itself is: it was never designed with security in mind and largely neither are IoT devices. Just as add-on security technologies protect conventional networks and devices, such add-ons are needed for IoT. The consequences are already large – witness the use of internet-connected cameras and routers to launch 1TB Mirai DDoS attacks last year. And they are only getting bigger, he says, with the growing reliance on computers in cars, passenger-less vehicles, the proliferation of drones and medical devices implanted in our bodies. That’s “a massive, massive increase in the surface area of items that will be at risk if they’re connected to the internet,” Carlin says. “I think of an actual case that we were involved with, what one terrorist did with one truck in Nice. It doesn’t take too much imagination to think what a terrorist group could do if there was an automated fleet of trucks.” He says progress is already being made. Cybersecurity experts are being assigned to the design teams for cars. Government will start looking at what regulations are already in place that can be applied to IoT gear. New legislation and regulations may be needed. Civil liability for insecure devices may be used to encourage better security on devices out-of-the-box. “You’re trying to reach the right balance,” he says. He says the DoJ has started educating manufacturers about the threats. “It’s not good for the brand if you end up being compromised,” he says. Everyday consumer products and private companies are “on the front lines of national security threats.” 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

[Photo: Flickr user mathiaswasik] More from POV Why We Need Scientists On Social Media, Now More Than Ever Gender Equality Isn’t Political—See Utah For Proof How Trump Can Save NASA By Keeping It Grounded Ineke Mushovic 02.13.17 5:00 AM This story reflects the views of this author, but not necessarily the editorial position of Fast Company. Late last month, a leaked draft of an executive order from the Trump Administration hinted that the Oval Office was considering granting federal contractors a sweeping license to fire or refuse to hire lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people on the basis of religious belief. Two days later, amid intense public backlash, the White House said it had shelved the order. But it was a clear signal that Trump and his allies considered compromising LGBT Americans' civil rights, and still might do so, despite overwhelming evidence that policies allowing businesses to discriminate are bad for those very businesses. So now companies face a test: As the government backs away from protecting LGBT workers, will their employers continue to step up and do so instead? Discrimination Has No Winners So far, there's reason for measured optimism. States that have passed anti-LGBT laws in recent years, like North Carolina, have suffered fierce blowback. By one estimate, HB2 has cost the state between $77 million and $201 million in tourism and tax revenue alone. It also cost Governor Pat McCrory his job. As a result, politicians and business leaders see North Carolina and McCrory as a cautionary tale. In fact, the NCAA now requires potential host cities and counties to fill out a questionnaire that includes this question: "Does your city, county/parish, and/or state have provisions that allow for refusal of accommodations or service to any person?" By one estimate, [North Carolina's anti-LGBT bill] HB2 has cost the state between $77 million and $201 million in tourism and tax revenue alone. While nondiscrimination laws may spook legislators, companies large and small agree that diversity is good for business. Good managers and entrepreneurs all know what gets results: Create a shared vision, build a great team, create an open atmosphere for creativity, and attract and retain great employees. And business owners know that they're most successful when they serve the public—and that means all of the public. According to an April 2015 poll conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for the political think tank the Center for American Progress, two-thirds of small business owners said companies shouldn't be able to deny goods or services to LGBT customers based on the owner's religious beliefs. And 59% of small business owners opposed laws allowing individuals, associations, or businesses to legally refuse service to anyone because of their own faith. Today, many corporations are putting these beliefs into practice by drawing up policies to protect their LGBT employees. According to the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index (CEI), 82% of Fortune 500 companies have explicit nondiscrimination policies covering sexual orientation and gender identity. And with transgender issues in the spotlight, many businesses are focusing on ways to support their transgender employees in particular. It actually isn't that difficult: Update nondiscrimination policies. Make sure whatever protections your company has in place when it comes to gender, race, and sexual orientation also explicitly include gender identity. Provide inclusive health care for employees. 50% of Fortune 500 and 73% of CEI businesses offer transgender-inclusive health care coverage. Offer to educate. 86% of CEI-rated businesses have training programs that specifically include gender identity in the workplace. Adopt guidelines to support inclusion. 387 major businesses have adopted gender-transition guidelines for employees and their teams, so there's already no shortage of examples for best practices (this organization has some useful resources). Fighting Discrimination Doesn't Have To Be Political Many of these inclusive businesses aren’t located in blue-state bubbles. According to the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, five of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies with high scores for equality—including Chevron, General Motors, Ford, and Walmart—are headquartered in states with few legal protections for LGBT people. Many of these inclusive businesses aren’t located in blue-state bubbles. Nor are companies moving forward alone; they’re putting their money where their mouths are and urging governments to keep up. When businesses in Tennessee, Georgia, and Texas learned of discriminatory legislation in their states, they were among the first voices to reject that legislation. In response to a sweeping anti-LGBT bill, SB 6, the Texas Competes coalition of more than 1,200 businesses came forward to support LGBT protections. The group is now warning that Texas could lose up to $1 billion if the state passes the measure. Tennessee Thrives, another coalition of businesses like the Hospital Corporation of America, FedEx, Jack Daniels, and Country Music Television, is calling on the state to oppose a proposed law that would allow mental health counselors to refuse patients treatment based on the therapist's religious or personal beliefs. And last year, the outcry against Georgia’s proposed bill, HB 757, which would have given faith-based organizations in Georgia the option to deny services to LGBT people, came from giants like Salesforce, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, Intel, and Home Depot. All urged the governor to veto the bill. And he listened. We're about to learn whether the business consensus in favor of diversity can win over state and government officials who oppose it. That seems like it should be a no-brainer, but it won’t be easy. A newly released report by my organization, the Movement Equality Project, finds that the majority of states don't have laws protecting transgender people from discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public places. When our communities create level playing fields where everyone has the chance to thrive, that isn't "getting political"—it's the American dream. And several states, like North Carolina, have recently passed anti-LGBT laws that support letting businesses turn away customers and even fire LGBT employees. More are now considering bills that would limit bathroom access for transgender people and make it impossible for them to update identity documents, among other restrictions. But while state legislators and federal bureaucrats spend time worrying about who's using which bathroom, businesses can and must affirm what they already know works. By standing firmly against anti-transgender discrimination in the public sphere and creating a positive, transgender-inclusive environment in the workplace, companies can protect both their employees and their profits. Because ultimately, this isn’t just about the bottom line. When workers are judged on their skills and creativity, and not how they identify or whom they love, everyone wins. When our communities create level playing fields where everyone has the chance to thrive, that isn't "getting political"—it's the American dream, and it’s good business.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here BENGALURU: Flutura Business Solutions, an IoT (Internet of Things) focused data analytics firm, has raised Rs 50.13 crore, or $7.5 million, in a fresh round of funding led by Vertex Ventures, the venture capital arm of Singapore Government's investment company Temasek Holdings. One of the largest rounds recently raised in the IoT sector, it also saw participation from private investment fund Lumis Partners and the startup's existing investor The Hive, a Palo Alto-based seed fund. Flutura specialises in decision analytics for the energy and engineering sector, leveraging the industrial IoT technology and counts Henkel, Siemens, and Philips Solar among its clients. The Bengaluru-based company will utilise the funds for global expansion. This is Vertex Ventures' second investment in India in the past six months, after it led a round of $6 million for customer analytics startup CloudCherry in September. Vertex Ventures' investments in India are made out of its South Asia fund, which also looks at opportunities in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. What sets the company apart is the confluence of IoT and data analytics in a manner that it can change the way very large companies function globally, says Ben Mathias, managing director of Vertex Ventures, India. The startup's data science solution offers assistance to large industrial manufacturers in the form of predictive maintenance to predict possible failure in machines and also to increase operational efficiency by monitoring various signals through sensors. Flutura has also partnered with large machine manufacturers such as, Hitachi, Dell, Intel and SAP to deliver its analytics solution over cloud and on-premise. It specialises in providing edge intelligence and central intelligence to machines, meaning that large equipment can be trained to react in certain ways in given situations.An example of Flutura's analytics is the intelligence it can provide to disengage a certain part of a machine that indicates likely failure, and to send an alert to replace the faulty part. "The industrial IoT sector, that we are targeting, has a huge untapped opportunity and our existing solution of providing analytics to predict machine failure is only the beginning of what could be done," says Flutura CEO Krishnan Raman. With backing from Vertex Ventures, Flutura will expand geographically in the UK, and extend product offerings to its existing set of customers, Raman said. The startup has a strong presence in the US, India and Japan. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now! FROM AROUND THE WEB Want to post your ad?

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Juliet Eilperin By Juliet Eilperin February 12 Follow @eilperin President Trump has embarked on the most aggressive campaign against government regulation in a generation, joining with Republican lawmakers to roll back rules already on the books and limit the ability of federal regulators to impose new ones. After just a few weeks in office, the new administration is targeting dozens of Obama-era policies, using both legislative and executive tactics. The fallout is already rippling across the federal ­bureaucracy and throughout the U.S. economy, affecting how dentists dispose of mercury fillings, how schools meet the needs of poor and disabled students, and whether companies reject mineral purchases that fuel one of the world’s bloodiest conflicts. The campaign has alarmed ­labor unions, public safety advocates and environmental activists, who fear losing regulations that have been in place for years, along with relatively new federal mandates. Business groups, however, are thrilled, saying Trump is­ responding to long-standing complaints that a profusion of federal regulations unnecessarily increases costs and hampers their ability to create jobs. Under Trump, “there’s great optimism that all of them will be addressed,” said Rosario Pal­mieri, vice president for labor, legal and regulatory policy at the National Association of Manufacturers. Trump and congressional Republicans are working to strip rules away at an unprecedented rate. One of the most powerful levers is the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives lawmakers the power to nullify any regulation within 60 days of enactment. Before Trump took office, the Congressional Review Act had been successfully used only once, to overturn a Clinton administration ergonomics rule in 2001. So far this year, the House has moved to nullify eight new rules and is considering dozens more. Two of those measures — which would loosen environmental restrictions on waste-mining companies and financial disclosure requirements on oil and gas firms — have cleared the Senate and are on their way to the White House for the president’s signature. A more extensive assault on government regulation is likely to come. On Jan. 30, Trump signed an executive order that requires agencies to offset the cost of every significant new regulation by eliminating existing regulations or making them less onerous. The order declares that “the total incremental cost of all new regulations” issued this year “shall be no more than zero.” That sets a far more stringent standard than recent Republican administrations have attempted, experts on regulation said, leaving a slew of Obama-era rules in limbo. “It’s clear as can be that they intend to reduce the level of regulation,” said James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, who said the directive marks the first explicit attempt to contain the costs of federal mandates. “If successful,” Gattuso said, “it would be the first time in a generation,” since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. According to the White House Office of Management and Budget, the cost of federal regulations has grown every year since 1982. Republicans of all stripes have long railed against what they say are crippling economic effects. “Overregulation has stemmed economic growth and job creation,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer recently told reporters. (Reuters) Making sure government rules “are meeting their intent and not stifling job creation at the expense of whatever they were intended to do is something that should be smart and welcome by everybody,” he said. The administration’s anti- regulatory push goes well beyond a technical review, how­ever. “It’s a much more aggressive rollback attempt than we’ve seen in recent years,” said Tevi Troy, who served George W. Bush as a senior White House official and in two Cabinet-level agencies. He noted that many conservatives have long been disappointed that the Bush administration did not do more to “clear out some of the regulatory underbrush.” [With days left in office, Obama ushers in dozens of policies] Votes under the Congressional Review Act have come at such a rapid clip that liberal interest groups feel pummeled. After the House voted last week to overturn a planning rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management, Defenders of Wildlife spokeswoman Haley McKey issued a statement headlined: “The Congressional Review Act Claims Latest Victim.” Meanwhile, the Trump White House is employing an executive tactic that dates to the Reagan administration: issuing a 60-day freeze on new regulations. The tactic is a mainstay of new administrations. George W. Bush initially delayed 90 Clinton-era rules, and Barack Obama delayed, altered or rescinded more than two dozen of Bush’s actions. Within a week of Trump’s inauguration, the new administration withdrew 24 significant rules that were about to be sent to the Federal Register for publication, regulatory analyst Curtis Copeland said. The new administration also delayed the effective dates of roughly 250 others, including 30 Environmental Protection Agency rules that were frozen in a single day, with no opportunity for public comment. And although White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus’s Jan. 20 memo called for a 60-day regulatory freeze, some regulations already are being delayed longer than that. An Agriculture Department rule tightening animal welfare requirements for organic livestock and poultry was just delayed from March 20 until May 19. As a result, groups that had finally settled long-fought battles are feuding once again. Take the issue of the rusty patched bumble bee, whose population has shrunk 87 percent since the mid-1990s. On Jan. 11, the Obama administration declared it would be added to the endangered species list. Last Thursday — a day before those protections were set to take effect — the Trump administration said it would postpone the listing until at least March 21. [Obama to top aides: “What are we doing on bees?”] Ryan Yates, director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau, said the group is “pleased that the administration is taking a second look.” If the bee is declared endangered, he said, farmers in parts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota would be subject to severe penalties for killing or harming the insects through “normal farming operations” such as plowing and pesticide use. As an alternative, Yates said, the Farm Bureau is open to discussing a strategy for voluntary conservation. But voluntary plans are inadequate, said Rebecca Riley, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Riley said the group is weighing whether to challenge the delay, which was issued without the normal 30-day period for public comment. “We don’t want to reach a point of no return for the rusty patched bumblebee,” Riley said in an email, “but further delay could dash our last, best chance to keep this bee around.” Incoming agency officials are also signaling significant shifts in the way some industries are regulated. In November, the EPA sent out a lengthy request to nearly 20,000 oil and gas companies, asking them to gauge their emissions of methane within 60 or 180 days, depending on their facilities. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas linked to climate change. Matthew Hite, who represents gas processors as vice president for government affairs at the GPA Midstream Association, called the request “unnecessary and duplicative” and estimated that complying would cost each processor nearly $3 million. Since Trump took office, EPA officials have been granting companies that ask for it a 90-day extension. Several oil and gas officials said they expect the methane survey to be scaled back significantly or abandoned altogether. Meanwhile, Michael S. Piwo­war, the acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he has instructed staff to determine whether it is “still appropriate” to require manufacturers to certify that they do not use minerals from conflict-ridden areas such as Congo, where armed groups accused of massive human rights violations profit from their trade. Some major U.S. firms, including Intel and Tiffany & Co., have embraced the policy, but others have said complying with the disclosure rule is costly and complicated. Lawrence Heim, managing director at Elm Sustainability, an auditing firm that consults on conflict minerals, said he has seen “a notable slowdown” in the demand for doing “due diligence” on the origin of minerals, as manufacturers apparently place bets that the rule will soon disappear. Implementation of Trump’s Jan. 30 executive order will be left in large part to the White House budget director. Nominee Mick Mulvaney, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, could be confirmed as soon as this week. A coalition of liberal groups that include Public Citizen, NRDC and the Communications Workers of America has challenged the order in court, calling it “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with the law.” They predicted the order would force the government to eliminate critical public protections. Spicer called those claims “wildly inaccurate,” saying they make “a ton of assumptions . . . on what may or may not happen in the future.” Whatever happens in court, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) predicts Trump’s executive order will cause “complete chaos.” Huffman noted that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration briefly declined to issue critical regulations for the opening of fishing seasons off both coasts, unnerving commercial fishermen who rely on the government to set the annual guidelines. “Apparently members of the new administration don’t understand some regulations are critically important for the economic sector, and businesses depend on them,” Huffman said. Some industries are openly worried about what the directive will mean for them. Commercial drone manufacturers, for example, waited four years for the Federal Aviation Administration to issue its first rule integrating drones into public airspace. The FAA has been planning to tackle bigger questions, such as whether drones may fly over people’s heads or travel long distances. Brian Wynne, president of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, said he fears that the answers to those questions will be delayed. The “current inaction,” he said in a statement, could prevent drone “operations, such as news reporting, disaster relief and public safety, from becoming a reality.” Many companies, however, foresee huge benefits from the regulatory rollback. Eric Myers, chief executive at Oil City Iron Works in Oil City, Tex., said he’s seen a flood of new orders since Trump took office. The company makes metal castings for equipment used in energy, mining, farming and transportation — industries expected to benefit from Trump administration actions. “It’s not happening in a tidal wave,” Myers said in an interview, “but it is coming.” politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

This is going to be an insane time for high-end/enthusiast customers who haven't been able to cough up the $2000+ required for a HEDT from Intel in the form of the Core i7-6950X and compatible motherboard.   The 6C/12T offerings in the Ryzen range are also going to shake up the Core i3/i5 markets - with the Ryzen 5 1500 offering 3.2/3.5GHz for base/turbo clocks respectively - unlocked for overclocking like all Ryzen CPUs, and just $229. The R5 1600X costs $259, bumping the clicks up to 3.3/3.7GHz, respectively.   If you don't have that type of cash to splash around but still want to see what Team Red has to offer with Ryzen, then the R5 1400X or even the R5 1300 could be the one for you. The R5 1400X is a 4C/8T part with a base/turbo clock of 3.5/3.9GHz, respectively - but with a price tag of just $199. The lower-end Ryzen R5 1300 retains the same 4C/8T goodness, while its clocked get downgraded to 3.3/3.6GHz, but its price is knocked down to just $175.   AMD is expected to unleash Ryzen in the coming weeks, and we are preparing for months of work ahead of us here at TweakTown.

Innovation is a priced commodity — a skill that is much sought after with the startup boom. And at its heart are students, trying to do their best to seek out a better future, both for themselves and the community. This is probably one of the reasons why there are umpteen number of competitions, synergies and symposiums conducted by various colleges to nurture students’ grey cells. One of the yearly events of the Startups Club, a platform for startups in their early stage, is the Startups Club Demo Day, which allows young innovators from a chosen city to pitch their ideas to experts from various industries. This time, however, the event was taken to 10 different cities and involved 94 startups. Of these, 12 made it to the final round that was held in December at IIT Madras Research Park. In the finals, a team of undergraduate students beat all odds to win the first prize. Twenty one-year-old Adarsh Warrier pursuing electronics and communication engineering and twenty-year-old Abhishek Satish pursuing electrical and electronics engineering at VIT University won the competition for their their innovative product called KAI, which is a minimalistic wearable that enhances one’s interaction with the digital world through intuitive gesture input. “The idea came to me while applying for the Intel IoT Roadshow Hackathon held in Pune in 2015. That’s where I built the first prototype along with my team mate, Adarsh. It was well received there and led us to pursue the idea further,” explains Abhishek. Describing the experience of winning, he says, “I believed it was a Miss Universe repeat where Steve Harvey read the names out in the wrong order. I was hungry for a win, but against those full-time entrepreneurs, our odds felt bleak. But once it sunk in, we were beyond ecstatic!” Speaking about their brain child, Adarsh explains, “KAI actually stands for ‘hand’ in Tamil. It had initially started out as a ‘cool’ hackathon project — aspiring a breakthrough in gesture recognition products, at least in the Indian market. It was inspired from realistic science fiction depictions of advanced technology, some of which can be seen in movies such as Iron Man and Minority Report.” Taking their project further, the duo aspire to take up entrepreneurship under the banner of their own startup — VicaraTech — and hope to go into crowd funding and production soon. Discussing their plans for the future, Adarsh says, “We have currently charted out a roadmap for ourselves and look forward to tying up with partner organisations who could greatly enhance their offering with the help of our product (for example: a CAD software + KAI bundle). At the end of the day, we strongly believe that unbridled innovation has been our fortitude, and we hope it will help us sail through the rough seas of an undeveloped hardware ecosystem that still plagues our country.” Post a Comment More In Education education Related Articles << Previous Story A potted history of skilling in India Next Story >> She’s no spring chicken Please Wait while comments are loading...

"Essentially the entire article from start to finish. *They have the this big blockbuster announcement on Friday which was obviously sensationalistic and it would have a huge impact if it were true that Russia and Vladimir Putin had invaded the U.S. electric grid* by placing malware within the utility system in Vermont." "They induced the governor of Vermont and Senator Pat Leahy (D-VT) to make these really bombastic statements about how this thug Vladimir Putin was trying to steal the heat to make Vermonters suffer during the winter. It turned out that the malware found was actually on a single laptop totally unconnected to the grid. Then it turned out that the Russians had actually nothing to do with this malware. Then it turned out that what was on the laptop probably wasn't malware at all. *So the story just collapsed one step after the next in the grandest humiliation possible."* Meanwhile, Greenwald goes on to point out, as we did late last week, that the latest "Intel Report" from the "Intelligence Community" was nothing more than a repeat of their previous allegations, which were and continue to be, "*completely unaccompanied by evidence."* *"The report that came out today was just another set of repackaged conclusions from the intelligence community, which may or may not be true, that were again completely unaccompanied by evidence.*  And when you simply point that out, that the intelligence community keeps just repeating itself over and over...without providing evidence that can be evaluated whether or not it's true, that means you must love Vladimir Putin, that you're probably working for the Kremlin, when, in fact,* it's just the basic kind of skepticism that all journalists should be exercising."* *"We shouldn't accept government claims unless we see evidence that it's true.  Particularly, when the consequences are so grave.*  You have John McCain saying Russia has engaged in a act of war, Nancy Pelosi is accusing journalists of being accomplices of Russia who reported on the story.  Which is basically every media outlet in the country. * These are really serious charges and we should see evidence for that."* With that, here is the full interview with Tucker Carlson for your viewing pleasure: » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Geo Beats - on January 2, 2017< > Embed Washington Post: Trump's Position On Russia Raises Suspicions About His Business Dealings With Russia 01:15 The Washington Post's editorial board recently noted that Donald Trump's position on Russia leads to persistence of "darker suspicions" about his dealings with the nation.

Massive amounts of training data can be processed on very powerful platforms to create wonderful generalized models, which can be extremely accurate. But this in and of itself is not yet optimal, and there’s a movement afoot to move the intelligence and part of the learning onto the embedded platforms. Certainly, the cloud offers the most power and data storage, allowing the most immense and powerful of systems. However, when it comes to agility, responsiveness, privacy, and personalization, the cloud looks less attractive. This is where edge computing and shallow learning through adaptation can become extremely effective. “Little” data can have a big impact on a particular individual. Think how accurately and how little data is required for a child to learn to recognize its mother. A good example of specialized learning is when it comes to accents or speech impediments. Generalized acoustic models often don’t handle this well, resulting in customized models for different markets and accents. However, this customization is difficult to manage, can add to the cost of goods, and may negatively impact the user experience. Yet, this still results in a model generalized for a specific class of people or accents. An alternative approach could begin with a general model built with cloud resources, with the ability to adapt on the device to the distinct voices of the people that use it. The challenge with embedded deep learning occurs in its limited resources and the need to deal with on-device data collection, which by its nature, will be less plentiful, unlabeled, yet more targeted. New approaches are being implemented such as teacher/student models where smaller models can be built from a wider body of data, essentially turning big powerful models into small powerful models that imitate the bigger ones while getting similar performance. Generative data without supervision can also be deployed for on-the-fly learning and adaptation. Along with improvements in software and technology, the chip industry is going through somewhat of a deep learning revolution, adding more parallel processing and specialized vector math functions. For example, GPU vendor nVidia taking has some exciting products that take advantage of deep learning. Some smaller private embedded deep learning IP companies like Nervana, Movidius, and Apical are getting snapped up in highly valued acquisitions from larger companies like Intel and ARM. Embedded deep learning and embedded AI is here. Todd Mozer is the CEO of Sensory.

It’s a day similar to any other day but has been set aside for couples traditionally. These long distance apps for Valentine’s day will make you forget that you’re far away from your beloved partner. However, there’s no app that can substitute the feeling of being with your partner. On the positive side, you can use your phone as a tool for you and your special someone. It may not give you the same feeling but it will surely let you hear what you want to hear and see what you want to see. Best Long Distance Apps For Chatting Other than being useful, chatting with your special someone is definitely fun. The fact that you can send your other half some naughty messages while both of you are at work can prove its uniqueness. Thanks to the technology we have today, we no longer have to wait for multiple days before our message arrives at its destination. However, you need to play it safe. In other words, making private conversations with people special to you should remain completely private. On the positive side, there are plenty of apps out there such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp that offer extra secure encryption. Facebook Messenger Download Link WhatsApp Download Link BlackBerry Messenger Download Link Allo Download Link Best Long Distance Apps For Real Time Video Calling MaxPixel Nothing can make a loving person happier than making him/her see the person he/she loves. After all, people learn better when they see an example, we’re visual creatures. In addition, we recognize faces long before we understand anything in this world. Furthermore, there’s a lot of fun to be had if both people in the relationship have space where they can toggle on the camera. On the positive side, there are all kinds of ways a smartphone can share video in real time. In this case, we’re recommending the Google Duo app. Google Duo app has an outstanding video quality in addition to being very straightforward. It is perhaps the most simple app that doesn’t have the extra features present in other video calling software. In fact, the said app is also encrypted which makes the romantic conversation secure as possible. Google Duo Download Link Best Long Distance Apps For Computers Things change significantly if you own a computer or even a tablet. Apps such as Skype or Hangouts will bring you to the big screen territory and make video calls. However, if both parties have an Apple, FaceTime is the way to go. Furthermore, Skype and Hangouts both offer full-screen video accompanied by audio. It’s available on Apple and Windows computer. On the other hand, Hangouts provide a wide array of features such as video calling and texting.

Check out the previous Homeland recap here. Well, if you’ve been feeling like this season of Homeland has started out a little slow… this week’s episode certainly ends with a bang. Sekou gets released from prison — which means Carrie’s crazy blackmail ploy worked! She and Reda tell Sekou the only condition of his release is that he not talk to anyone about the case. He seems to go along with it: “I’m out, aren’t I?” But at a welcome-home party, a couple of buddies think he sold out the cause and jokingly check him for a wire. That makes Sekou mad enough to put his kufi cap back on and record a new video insisting he’s no snitch, and that he’ll always protect his Muslim brothers and sisters. RELATEDHomeland Recap: Armed & Dangerous Carrie later gets a call from Reda: Sekou has posted more videos, and they could land him back in jail. So Carrie pays Sekou a visit and asks him to take those videos down. She and Sekou then get into a philosophical debate about the war on terror, with her wanting to know why he posts “ugly” things like dead American soldiers, and him saying it’s necessary to wake people up. She tells him she’s lost some friends in this war (again, RIP, Brody) and she wanted to help free Sekou “because this whole country went stupid crazy after 9/11, and no one knows that better than I do.” Good scene! She apparently convinces Sekou, because the next day, when he goes back to work as a delivery-van driver, he’s taken the videos down. His buddies question him about it — and they might not be joking anymore — but Sekou shrugs it off, saying, “You gotta choose your battles.” Someone may have chosen a battle with him, though: As he steers his delivery van through Manhattan, boom! The van explodes, killing Sekou and sending an all-too-familiar plume of smoke floating above the city. But a season of Homeland doesn’t really start until something blows up, right? RELATEDGeneral Hospital Vet Books Homeland Arc, Prompting Spinelli Recast So who planted the bomb? We get a clue from (of all people) Quinn, who’s still paranoid about the building across the street. He takes photos of a black-hatted guy emerging from the building, and even breaks into the guy’s apartment to investigate further. Carrie brushes off his concerns, but Quinn grabs her car keys the night before the van explosion and follows Black-Hatted Guy as he drives off. He sees Black-Hatted Guy enter a parking lot full of vans with “Medina Medley” printed on the side… the same kind of van Sekou was driving. Let’s take a look at what else went down in “A Flash of Light”: OLD FRENEMIES | Saul’s still in the back of that police cruiser in the West Bank when it takes a sharp turn and he’s suddenly kidnapped, stuffed in a van and blindfolded. But don’t worry: It’s a clandestine meeting he set up with… Majid Javadi! Remember him? He’s the Iranian intelligence agent from Season 3 who masterminded the Langley bombing, and who Saul sent back to Iran as a double-agent. Saul asks him if the Iranians are running a covert nuclear program. Javadi claims not to know; he’ll ask around, but he warns Saul, “The news might not be so good.” When Saul gets back to his sister’s house, she wants to know where he’s been, and is angry he used her as a cover for work. But as Saul prepares to catch a plane home, he’s visited by… Etai Luskin. (What is this, Ghosts of Seasons Past?) He’s that Israeli ambassador from last season, and he also wants to know what Saul was up to last night. His sister lies and says he was home all night, but Etai still wants to give Saul a ride to the airport. In the car, Saul says he’d love to stay and chat, but he has to get back to the U.S. Etai tells him there’s no need to rush: “Your flight has been cancelled.” Uh-oh. He takes Saul to a secure location and places him in a sparse room with a cot and a desk, telling him Mossad operative Tova will be there in the morning: “You f–k with us, we f–k with you.” But later, he comes to tell Saul he can go home after all: “There’s been an attack in New York.” Is this just a temporary reprieve, though? WICKED LEAKS | Dar Adal is being so blatantly villainous this season, I want to call him Darth Adal. He sabotages Keane’s press conference by leaking word to the press that she’s “willfully ignoring” proof of Iran’s nuclear cheating. She confronts him, demanding to see Saul’s full report from Abu Dhabi. Then she turns to Carrie and asks if she has any dirt on Dar they can “leverage” against him. Playing dirty before she even gets into the White House… I like it! Carrie keeps her lips shut, staying loyal to the CIA (and Saul), but that doesn’t stop Dar from dropping by Franny’s school for a chat. He says he knows Carrie’s been advising Keane, and curtly tells her to “stand down.” But she fires back: “You stand down!” Dar drops a not-so-veiled threat on her: “I don’t think you understand how vulnerable you are.” She comes right back with: “I don’t think you do.” Cue the Carrie Mathison trademark chin-tremble. A Carrie vs. Dar war is definitely brewing here… and I can’t wait to see how it plays out. Further Intel: * This Week in Franny Cuteness: How adorable was it when she saw Quinn at home and declared, “It’s snack time”? Plus, I loved her description of Dar Adal as “a man with painted hair.” Even Darth himself had nice things to say about the girl: “What a great child. Striking hair.” * Black-Hatted Guy did spot Quinn in the lobby of his building, and threatened to call the police. Will that slip-up come back to bite Quinn? * We still don’t know what’s up with Farhad Nafisi and that cigarette pack of his. But it was featured prominently in the “previously on”s, so it must mean something. * When Reda questions the shady methods Carrie used to get Sekou out of jail, she promises nothing like that will ever happen again.

Reply Alichat says: February 12, 2017 at 7:32 PM Did the timing in the episode seem off? The episode opens with Saul still being skirted away at night, which was the night (or day) in which Carrie blackmailed the FBI guy. Suddenly it’s the next day, Sekou is out, Quinn is (with one hand) breaking into the room of the guy spying on Carrie……room search….meeting with PEOTUS……Sekou posts…….Dar threatens…..Quinn worries….Carrie meets with Sekou….Quinn follows the guy…..the next morning Sekou’s truck explodes…..which all seems to take place between 24 and 36 hours. All the Saul scenes seemed to be within a 12 or less hour period. Plus Frannie seems to know Quinn, which seems odd as well. How many days has he been in the house? Has he had interaction with Frannie? Can we get him some new clothes please? How many days have passed since the season began??? Reply Kevin says: February 12, 2017 at 7:37 PM One of the most shocking hours of Homeland that people were blown away for two reasons – the return of Javadi from Season 3 (worst of the series) and killing off Sekou. Reply Bobby Mathis says: February 12, 2017 at 7:49 PM This show has gone full boring and a far left propaganda. I hope this is the last season. Reply Morgan Gray says: February 12, 2017 at 8:06 PM Shame on you. Just because you don’t like it (or don’t get it at this time) doesn’t mean the rest of us (or some of us) aren’t willing to wait and see. If you want to take your toys and go home please do. You don’t like it so stop the series. Seriously? Reply dysturbed says: February 12, 2017 at 8:31 PM Unless they change their mind, your hopes won’t lead to anything, since months ago they renewed the show through season 8. Reply Kevin says: February 12, 2017 at 9:55 PM This isn’t the last season for Homeland. Really hope the series would end after eight seasons and Showtime better announce it at some point in time. Reply Jim says: February 13, 2017 at 12:26 AM Really? Because Carrie doing her “liberal thang” just propagated a terrorist attack on NYC. We must be watching different shows, because that’s a strong argument for doing things the FBI’s (or Trump’s) way the show made right there. But Homeland’s always been about balancing ideals and personal conscience with ugly realities and the necessity of making horrible choices, so how did you even get this far watching it if you’re too thick to pick up on that? Reply Funnibone31 says: February 13, 2017 at 6:07 AM The slow burn paid off…this episode was fantastic, and next week looks like things are about to get stressful. Reply DD says: February 13, 2017 at 7:58 AM “We still don’t know what’s up with Farhad Nafisi and that cigarette pack of his” – I think the cigarettes made Saul think of Javadi, so he set up the meet with him (he said something to him about his cigarettes when they met). Didn’t Saul drive a car to his sister’s house? Why did he need a taxi to get to the airport?? Also, why was there a Palestinian flag outside the “jail” the Israeli guy put Saul in (which would have caused a HUGE diplomatic incident by the way)? Why does all the footage of the West Bank look like its from the 1950’s? Reply larry says: February 13, 2017 at 8:01 AM After being there since day 1, I stopped watching after the first episode this season due to the hard left the dumb writers took. People forget that most of us watch tv to escape every day life for a bit not to have politics jammed down our throat. Homeland always did a great job with the Islamic terror threats and managed to show how innocent Muslims become collateral damage. There were so many different avenues to go this year. One would have been the lone wolf terrorist problem that this country faces. Another could have been the Iran deal showing how the Iranians are ignoring the terms. In other words, they could have stayed true to real life. The Carrie character was great because she believed in what she was doing, yet felt remorse for the lines she had to cross. This new Carrie is nothing more than a left wing liberal moron…….. Reply Wendy says: February 13, 2017 at 9:44 AM This episode felt like the story finally started after a very slow setup – So that’s a good thing. Very worried Quinn is going to be framed or killed based on the preview for next week. Can’t understand all the sad sensitive puppies whining about the themes and any parallels (or not) to current events? This show has always twisted current events to explore the tangled messy webs of spy craft, politics and diplomatic relations and the toll it takes on those protecting the homeland. Reply IKS51 says: February 13, 2017 at 11:48 AM The empty cigarette box in the trash can of the Mossad operations room told Saul that Farhad Nafisi had been there before (several hours or a day) although they all pretended it was Nafisi’s first visit there at that location. Of course someone from the team might prefer the same brand. But it may be a brand that isn’t easy available in Abu Dhabi or the box may have got a tax-stamp that gives proof that it was brought in from abroad.

The project has produced some great smartphones in the past and the Pixel and Pixel XL are no different. When the two smartphones released late last year, the demand from smartphone fans led to the Pixel ad Pixel XL being sold out. Thankfully, it appears that Google finally has more in stock as the Pixel , Pixel are now back in Google Store. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL has some amazing specs and features that had countless tech fans excited. The demand for the phones though was a lot greater than Google expected which is why in the weeks after the release most of the Pixel and Pixel XL variants were sold out. Google Nexus fans have to be ecstatic though as the two popular smartphones are already back in stock and available for purchase. Google Pixel, Pixel XL Available In Stock at the Google Play Store According to 9 to 5 Google, the Pixel and Pixel XL are back in the Google Play Store where tech fans can buy them. What’s great is that all the color variants for the Google Pixel are available which gives consumers more options to choose from. The colors available are Very Silver, Quite Black and the limited edition variant Really Blue. John Solinap | The Bitbag There is some disappointing news that comes with the restock of the Google Pixel. This is because the same report mentions that unfortunately the 128GB variants for the two smartphones are still not available. Users will just have to settle with the base 32 GB internal storage variant for the Google Pixel smartphone. As for the Google Pixel XL, both 32GB and 128GB models are available but there is a downside too. This is because with regard the color variants, the Really Blue model is already out of stock for the larger Pixel smartphone. There is no news as to when the color variation will become available once again. Hopefully though, it will not take too long before it happens. With regard to the pricing for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, they are still the same as when it originally released. Tech fans better hurry though as it is not exactly known just how many Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones the Google Store has available. It will not be surprising to see the two phones sell out once again in the very near future. Be sure to check back here soon to find out more news and updates on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones as well as on the other great gadgets releasing soon.
