INTC plans to acquire MBLY for $15.3 billion, representing a premium of roughly 34% to the closing price on Mar 10. Source: Shutterstock As technology companies are looking to develop driverless cars and gain an edge over others, demand for auto part suppliers seems to be increasing. Several players in the space perked up on the news as evident from their buoyancy on the market. Auto stocks that recently gained on the announcement include Delphi Automotive PLC (NYSE:DLPH), Denso Corp (ADR) (OTCMKTS:DNZOY), Visteon Corp (NYSE:VC) and BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA) with roughly 4%, 2.3%, 5% and 2% addition, respectively. Blueprint of INTC’s Driverless Initiative Mobileye, a developer of vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), controls a large section of this market. With the acquisition, INTC aims to position itself as a leading technology provider for highly or fully driverless cars. The company expects the vehicle systems, data and services market to be worth $70 billion by 2030. Anticipating growth in the industry, a number of other companies specializing in the autonomous driving technology and hardware, become viable options for tech giants for mergers or acquisitions. As a result, deals between tech companies, auto manufacturers and auto suppliers have been increasing lately. In January, Intel acquired a 15% stake in HERE, a digital mapping service, while Daimler AG (OTCMKTS:DDAIF) partnered with Uber Technologies to provide autonomous parts. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) invested $500 million in ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. and the companies are developing autonomous electric taxis. The company also acquired Cruise Automation — a startup engaged in developing autonomous vehicle software — last year, for $581 million. Other Self-Driving Plans A number of companies intend to have self-driving cars on the road by 2020, subject to regulatory approvals. Per CB Insights, a tech market intelligence platform, financing in the auto tech startup sector was over $1 billion in 2016. Growth in this sector is expected to be steep and auto stocks are likely to benefit significantly if the premium for MBLY is any indication.

The sequel to last year's $2000 Tag Heuer Connected, the Connected Modular 45 is another beast of a smartwatch, with a huge 45mm face and a lot of Intel inside. And according to the Verge, even more Intel is coming to the watch later this year — in the form of a new, genderless artificially intelligent assistant. Image: Tag Heuer The Connected Modular 45 will already have Google's AI built-in, thanks to running Android Wear 2.0, but it's going to be powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor. According to Jerry Bautista, vice president of Intel's New Technology Group, that means the Connected Modular 45 should be able to run Intel's future virtual assistant. Bautista didn't give the Verge many details on the AI, and when reached by email, Intel declined to provide Gizmodo with any further information. We do know, at least, that it will have contextual responses like Siri and Google's AI, and it will supposedly be able to extrapolate and understand data provided by the smartwatch. The AI's personal details — which is to say, its lack of name or gender — are especially interesting, however. Apple, Amazon and other companies with digital AIs have faced some criticism for their decision to "feminise" their digital assistants. Even Google, who notably has given no human-like name to Google Assistant, still has the AI default to a feminine sounding voice. While studies show women and many men prefer the sound of a feminine voice when uttered by a robot it still remains puzzling, as scientists agree women's voices are no easier to understand than men's. Intel's decision to eschew gender in the pursuit of an AI almost feels like a radical departure as a consequence, and in our society, where gender is normally expressed in extremely binary ways, it will be curious to see how Intel expresses its AI's agender nature. What does an agender robot even sound like? Wall-E? Eve? Bender Bending Rodríguez? We won't know until the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, which ships later this year, receives an update to include the new AI. [The Verge] Comments falconxev @falconxev Mar 15, 2017, 11:48am "studies show women and many men prefer the sound of a feminine voice when uttered by a robot" Tailoring a product to be what's perceived as more 'correct', despite that not actually being what the market wants.

Send Comments & News Tips Sign In Sections Published Since 2000 TPM dc TIMELINE: Flynn Lobbied For Turkish Interests In The Thick Of The Campaign SHARE TWEET PIN-IT Comments Bookmark Mikhail Voskresenskiy ByAllegra KirklandPublishedMarch 13, 2017, 4:31 PM EDT Documents recently filed by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn detail the work his consulting firm was doing that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey” while he was serving as a top Donald Trump campaign adviser, and that continued after he was named the designated national security adviser to the President-elect. Between August and December 2016, Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm run by a Turkish businessman, according to Flynn’s filings last Tuesday under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The FARA filings show that Flynn held meetings with senior Turkish officials, and that his firm did research and produced promotional material for Inovo while he working for the Trump campaign and sitting in on classified briefings. Flynn Intel Group’s final payment to contractors working on the Inovo project came in December, almost a month after Trump named Flynn to serve as national security adviser. The White House has framed Flynn’s lobbying work a non-issue, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer calling it a “personal matter, a business matter.” Top administration officials were directly notified twice about the lobbying, however. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) warned Vice President Mike Pence in a November letter that Flynn’s company was “hired by a foreign company to lobby for Turkish interests,” while Flynn’s lawyer informed White House counsel Don McGahn about the firm’s work during the transition. Below is a timeline of the work Flynn and his firm were doing for Inovo in the heat of the 2016 campaign and into Donald Trump's transition to the presidency. Aug. 9, 2016: Seven months after Flynn became an adviser to the Trump campaign, the Flynn Intel Group entered into a contract with Inovo owner Ekim Alptekin. Flynn Intel’s task was to conduct research on Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused of orchestrating a failed coup against him last year (the firm also pressured U.S. officials to take action against Gülen as part of this work). Flynn’s team would conduct research, contract a PR team and check in with Inovo weekly to discuss progress. Sep. 15, 2016: Flynn Intel Group’s general counsel, Robert Kelley, filed a lobbying disclosure report with Congress. FARA dictates that U.S. firms that do lobbying work on behalf of a foreign corporate client are covered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and don’t need to register separately under FARA. Flynn Intel “concluded” that its work was covered under these provisions, according to the company’s subsequent FARA filings. Sep. 19, 2016: Alptekin and Flynn Intel Group met with the Turkish ministers of foreign affairs and energy so that the firm could better understand “the political climate in Turkey at the time,” according to the FARA documents. The Associated Press reported that this discussion with happened at an undisclosed hotel in New York during the United Nations General Assembly. October 2016: Flynn Intel partner Bijan Rafiekian met twice on undisclosed dates in October with Miles Taylor, National Security Adviser to the House Committee on Homeland Security, according to the filings. Those meetings took place at Taylor’s office and at Flynn Intel’s Alexandria, Virginia office. An anonymous U.S. official told the Associated Press that in one of the meetings, the Homeland Security Committee representative rejected pressure from the firm to have that panel investigate Gülen. Oct. 4, 2016: FARA filings show Flynn Intel made its first consulting payment to retired FBI agent Brian McCauley. Oct. 18, 2016: McCauley found himself at the center of a controversy involving Hillary Clinton's private emails. In emails released by the FBI, an agent initially offered a State Department official a "quid pro quo" not to classify a particular Clinton email related to the Benghazi attacks in exchange for restoring two spots for the FBI at the Baghdad embassy. McCauley identified himself as the FBI official who made the offer, but said he retracted it as soon as he realized the email in question had to do with Benghazi. McCauley ultimately received a total of $28,000 from Flynn's company through early December. Nov. 8, 2016: On Election Day, Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill calling Gülen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to his home country, as the Turkish government has requested. That article was “based” on the Flynn Intel Group’s research for Inovo and a draft was submitted to the company ahead of publication, according to the firm's FARA filings. But the firm denies that Inovo, Turkey or any other entity asked Flynn to write it. After Flynn’s FARA filings were made public last week, The Hill added an editor’s note saying that neither “Flynn nor his representatives disclosed” his work for Inovo when he submitted the essay. Nov. 14, 2016: Flynn Intel receives its final payment from Inovo for $145,000. Nov. 17, 2016: Trump names Flynn as his national security adviser, later releasing a statement saying his intelligence expertise "will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration." Mid-November 2016: According to the FARA filings, Flynn disbanded his firm and closed its sole office on an undisclosed date soon after his role in the Trump White House was announced. Dec. 1, 2016: Flynn Intel files a final public disclosure report terminating its registration as a lobbyist for Inovo. Dec. 16. 2016: Flynn Intel makes its final payment on the Inovo project: $7,500 to White Canvas Group, a firm providing open source Internet consulting services. The payment chart shows that Flynn's son, Michael G. Flynn, was also a paid staffer on the project through November. The younger Flynn was removed from the Trump transition team in early December after using his Twitter account to denigrate Islam and promote the "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory. March 7, 2017: Flynn Intel retroactively registers with FARA, saying that “further review” and the desire to “eliminate any potential doubt” caused the firm to determine its LDA registration was insufficient. “Because of the subject matter of the engagement, Flynn Intel Group's work for Inovo could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey,” the filing reads. Read the full supplemental statement to the FARA filing below.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apollo lake touchscreen mini PCs are coming soon 03/10/2017 at 5:37 PM by Brad Linder 13 Comments Over the past few years a group of Chinese manufacturers that had been making Android-powered TV boxes with ARM-based chips have started offering small, cheap Windows PCs powered by Intel chips. Then things took a turn for the weird in 2015, when some companies started adding touchscreens and batteries, blurring the lines between TV boxes, tiny desktops and tablets. Now it’s time for the 2017 refresh. Mini PC DB got the scoop on a new all-in-one mini PC with an 8 inch touchscreen display, Windows 10 software (or Ubuntu Linux), and an Intel Apollo Lake low-power processor. This particular model is coming from Shenzhen EC Technology and it’ll likely be sold under the company’s ECDREAM brand. But I suspect we’ll see a bunch of similar computers with Apollo Lake chips in the near future, because when one Chinese manufacturer does this, it usually means a bunch of others are already working on something similar. The ECDREAM model will reportedly be available with a choice of Intel Celeron N3350, Celeron N3450, or Pentium N4200 processors. Each model features Intel HD graphics with support for 4K video playback. Other features include support for up to 8GB of RAM, up to 128GB og eMMC and/or up to 128GB of M.2 SSD storage, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, HDMI and VGA output, and five USB ports (one USB Type-C, two USB 3.0, and two USB 2.0). The display features a 1280 x 800 pixel IPS panel, and the system features a 10,000 mAh battery, which should let you unplug the computer and keep using it for at least a few hours at a time. According to Mini PC DB, the ECDREAM computer should be available in about a month for around $450.

This could be because a bitly user has reported a problem, a black-list service reported a problem, because the link has been shortened more than once, or because we have detected potentially malicious content. …. bitly suggests that you: (1) Change the original link, and re-shorten with bitly (2) Close your browser window (3) Notify the sender of the URL Also: Got a click-jacking attempt (noScript) when clicking on the “I’m not a robot”.

That’s the highest price ever paid to acquire an Israeli tech company — and also the highest paid for a self-driving tech company. To be more specific, as per the agreement, a subsidiary of Intel will be acquiring all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash (an equity value of around $15.3 billion, and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion). So, I guess that those wondering about the long-term prospects and strategies of Intel have their answer — Intel is banking on capturing a large market share in the self-driving vehicle and machine learning spaces. (Rival NVIDIA is of course pursuing a similar strategy as well.) The press release provides context: “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data, and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. This transaction extends Intel’s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on the company’s strengths in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the device. …  ”The combined global autonomous driving organization, which will consist of Mobileye and Intel’s Automated Driving Group, will be headquartered in Israel and led by Prof. Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO. The organization will support both companies’ existing production programs and build upon relationships with automotive OEMs, Tier-1 suppliers and semiconductor partners to develop advanced driving assist, highly autonomous, and fully autonomous driving programs. Intel Senior Vice President Doug Davis will oversee the combined organization’s engagement across Intel’s business groups and will report to Prof. Amnon Shashua after the transaction’s closing.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich commented: “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers. Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Interesting news — though, not completely surprising. Intel has been making overtures suggesting such a move in recent times. The acquisition is expected to be closed within the next 9 months according to the press release on the matter. Both of the companies’ Boards of Directors have approved the deal.

The $63.54-per-share cash deal marks the largest purchase of a company solely focused on the self-driving sector and could significantly alter the competitive landscape among key technology and systems suppliers, including chipmakers Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc. and systems integrator Delphi Automotive Plc. Mobileye's shares jumped 30 per cent to $61.3 in late morning US trading, while Intel's shares were down 2 per cent. Shares of Delphi, which has partnerships with both companies, were up 3 per cent. The deal underscores the expanding alliances between automakers and their suppliers as they race to develop self-driving cars, a concept that once seemed a science-fiction dream but is drawing closer to reality. While Intel is known for hardware chips and Mobileye for collision detection and mapping software, the merger promises to create an expanded portfolio of technologies needed for driverless vehicles. It also strengthens Intel's position in the sector against rival chipmakers Nvidia and Qualcomm. The Intel-Mobileye portfolio includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "It's an area where [Intel] has had very little presence — the automotive market, and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added.   The offer represents a premium of about 33 per cent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday.

Now, the company's Sky X9E3 laptop really stretches the definition of what can be classified as a mobile device, packing a Intel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K desktop processor, a pair of Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards in SLI, and support for up to five internal storage devices. Buyers can choose from three Intel seventh-generation Core i5 or Core i7 desktop processors. The CPU gets data from up to 64 GB of memory ensconced in four DDR4 SODIMM slots. Three NVMe M.2 drives and two 2.5" SATA drives can come along for the short ride from wall outlet to wall outlet. The big bruiser has a pair of Killer E2400 Gigabit Ethernet jacks along with three antennas for Wi-Fi connectivity. Eurocom lets buyers choose between Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 graphics cards, available singly or in SLI pairs. The graphics card (or cards) splatters pretty pictures on one of four different 17.3" displays, ranging from a rather pedestrian 1920x1080 unit with a 60 Hz refresh rate all the way to a 4K display with G-Sync. Interestingly, there's a middle-ground option at 2560x1440 with 120Hz refresh. If the onboard display doesn't pack enough pixels, the Sky X9E3 can connect to up to four external monitors via a pair of DisplayPort connectors, one HDMI jack, and one HDMI or USB 3.1 port. There are three methods for powering the machine: a single 330W power brick, a pair of 330W units with an additional converter box to tie them together, and a massive 780W charger that weighs 3 lbs (1.3 kg) all by itself. The laptop comes with an eight-cell 89 Wh battery, though given the desktop-class hardware and the specifications of the power bricks, the battery life probably isn't competing with Microsoft's Surface Book Pro. The Sky X9E3 is available now with prices starting around $2300 with a Core i5 processor, GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card, 16 GB of DDR4 memory, and a 1 TB hard drive. Buyers might also need to spring for a new laptop bag to hold the machine's bulky dimensions of 17.1" x 12.3" x 1.9" (or 43 cm x 31 cm x 4.7 cm) and and 12.1 lb (5.5 kg) weight. Eurocom didn't say if that figure includes the aforementioned giant power brick. Tags: Graphics Systems Mobile computing Gaming Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous-vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. Last October, Qualcomm announced a US$47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about US$3 billion in 2015 to US$96 billion in 2025 and US$290 billion in 2035. Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German carmaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Sceptics have questioned whether car companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Analysts raised concerns on Monday about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Loop Capital Markets analyst Betsy Van Hees. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair." Still, industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors wrote on Monday that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise". The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car". Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assistance systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. Founded in 1999, Mobileye accounts for 70 per cent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German carmaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye had also partnered systems integrator Delphi Automotive, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems.

What makes this Siri competitor special according to the chipmaker is the fact that it is genderless.  Intel’s New Technology Group VP Jerry Bautista said at the launch event that Intel is preparing a genderless digital assistant for the andro that will arrive later this year. Though Bautista did not expound on how this genderless nature would be possible, he did drop a few details about the AI assistant. It is said to be smart enough to adjust reminders based on the user’s current activities. Like if one is staying up late at work, the AI will move the home reminders to a later time when the user has already left work. It will also be capable of extrapolating and answering follow-up questions like Google’s Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri. Lastly, it will not have a name, as first reported by The Verge.  Tag Heuer’s new smartwatch actually runs Android Wear 2.0, so it already has Google Assistant built-it. Hence, it isn’t clear why Intel is creating a smart assistant for the device. However, Bautista says Intel is going to differentiate its own AI assistant from rivals by making it smarter in its own way. Intel’s decision to come up with a genderless AI assistant could be met with positive responses from consumers. According to Gizmodo, Apple, Amazon and other companies that have their own digital assistants have gotten some criticism and faced backlash from people who are questioning their decision to use the feminine voice and names for their technology. And though Google chose to have a simple and non-human name for its assistant, it still utilizes a female voice for its digital aide.  Tag Heuer’s Connected Modular 45 smartwatch is powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor. It comes with 1.39-inch 400 x 400 AMOLED display, a modular design and a battery that can last up to 30 hours on paper. The device also features Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC and GPS connectivity. The timepiece starts at $1,600 and is scheduled to start shipping later this year — no specific date given yet.  Related Stories Intel Venturing Into Self-Driving Technology TAG Heuer Connected 2 Debuting Next Week Microsoft Debuts Revamped Cortana; Now Better Than Apple’s Siri?

CEO Brian Krzanich and Mobileye founders Prof. Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram, a day after Intel announced a deal to acquire the Israeli maker of chips for car cameras and driver-assistance features for a whopping $15 billion. “Israel is quickly becoming a world technology powerhouse and this is not happening by chance,” Netanyahu said. “This is a vision we believe in, and lead, together with a free economy.” The acquisition announced Monday — at a price that represented 35 percent premium to the market value of Mobileye — is the biggest ever for a tech company in Israel; it is also the largest deal to date involving semi-autonomous and autonomous driving technology. Netanyahu said the achievement is due to the “brains of the people who sit around this table”. Brains combined with a free economy and low taxes and bureaucracy were essential components for deals like that to happen, he said. Intel is not buying Mobileye to take it, he said, “but to expand the company, here,” and give it the tools to manage the developing sector of autonomous vehicles. “The fact that is it happening here is a diploma of honor also to the talent that is here in Israel and also to the faith in Israel as an economy.” Ziv Aviram, President and CEO of Mobileye, speaks at a conference at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Jerusalem, November 23, 2016. (Miriam Alster/Flash90) The deal will lead to thousands of added jobs and revenue to government coffers, he said. He added that after speaking with Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, Israel will lower taxes for citizens, and the decision to do so has been made easier because of the extra revenue from the deal.

After Arrow revealed plans to follow up on its Qualcomm-backed DragonBoard 410C SBC with three more Linux ready, open spec 96Boards SBCs, one of the boards — the Chameleon96 — has been detailed on RocketBoards.org. The Cyclone V based, 85 x 54mm Chameleon96, which is the first 96Boards form factor SBC to include an FPGA, was also announced by SecureRF, which is offering its quantum-resistant cryptography technology on the board (see farther below). Chameleon96 (click image to enlarge) We have more details on the Chamelon below. The two other Arrow boards, which have yet to be fully documented, are the Meerkat and the Oxalis. The Meerkat runs Linux on a dual-core, Cortex-A7 NXP i.MX7D, which also includes a Cortex-M4 MCU, and offers an Arduino-ready mezzanine add-on board. Like the Chamelon96, the DragonBoard 410C, and most other 96Boards offerings, the Meerkat is a Consumer Edition board with 40-pin low-speed and 60-pin high-speed expansion connectors. The upcoming Oxalis board is a larger 96Boards Enterprise Edition (EE) board, such as the AMD A1100 based Lemaker Cello. The Oxalis taps NXP’s single, 800MHz Cortex-A53 based QorIQ LS1012A, which is billed as the world’s smallest 64-bit ARM SoC. 96Boards EE is typically aimed at higher end server operations, but the Oxalis is “optimized for battery-backed or USB-powered, space-constrained networking and IoT applications,” says Arrow. No OS support was listed, but Linux is the typical install on LS1012A boards. Last June, Arrow joined with eInfochips to announce a $279 SD 600eval board based on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 600. This was rumored to be originally called the DragonBoard 600. A product page is still posted on the eInfochips website, and Arrow has a shopping page, but it’s still listed as out of stock. The board was notable for being the first to comply with the 100 x 85mm Extended version of the 96Boards CE spec.   Chameleon96 The Chameleon96 runs Debian Linux on a Cyclone V SE SoC from Intel PSG (Programmable Solutions Group), the new post-acquisition name for its Altera FPGA unit. The SoC, which like the Xylinx Zynq-7000 combines dual 800MHz Cortex-A9 cores with an FPGA subsystem, can be found on boards such as iWave’s iW-RainboW-G17D module. It offers lesser FPGA powers (110K LEs) than Intel PSG’s newer, dual-A9 based Arria 10 SoC, and far less ARM and FPGA performance than its quad-core Cortex-A53-based Stratix 10. Chameleon96 block diagram (click image to enlarge) Interestingly, the Chameleon96’s video processing, based on Intel Video Suite for FPGA, uses the FPGA subsystem rather than the ARM subsystem. It can drive 60fps 1080p streams via HDMI and encode such video via a two-lane MIPI-CSI camera interface. The use of the FPGA fabric for video processing “allows development of custom IPU/GPU/VPU solutions,” says Arrow. Chameleon96 detail views (click images to enlarge) The Chameleon96 ships with 512MB of DDR3 SDRAM, with optional 1GB, linked to the ARM Hard Processor System (HPC). Other ARM-linked I/O includes a microSD slot, a serial UART interface, a warm reset button, and 4x user LEDs. You will also find a micro-USB OTG port and two USB 2.0 host ports, but you can’t use the OTG and host ports at the same time. An audio interface supports PCM/AAC+/MP3/WMA, ECNS, plus optional Audio+ post-processing. The FPGA subsystem provides the HDMI output, as well as a wireless module that includes 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1, backed up by antennas and dual LEDs. There’s also a micro-USB connected USB Blaster II JTAG cable. Both subsystems connect to the low- and high-speed connectors, although in the latter category, the only FPGA-linked interface is the MIPI-CSI2 interface. This is said to be the sole 96Boards non-standard component on the board. The low-speed connector provides UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, and GPIO, while the high-speed offers USB 2.0 host, SPI, I2C, and GPIO, as well as MIPI CSI-2. A 12V DC input is provided, and there’s also an Altera Enpirion PowerSoC power management chip. The board can be made compatible with Arduino using an add-on mezzanine board, one of a growing list of 96Boards mezzanines that are now available.   SecureRF’s quantum resistant cryptography The Chameleon96 board’s FPGA subsystem is also home to SecureRF’s quantum-resistant Ironwood Key Agreement Protocol and Walnut DSA Digital Signature Algorithm reference design. These Public Key methods are specifically designed for reduced footprint, low-energy IoT deployments. The Ironwood protocol is based on a 128-bit security Diffie-Hellman-like authentication protocol, which is said to be resistant to potential attacks by attackers using new quantum computers for cryptography hacks. The SecureRF technology also includes secure boot, secure firmware updates and secure firmware delivery.   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for Arrow’s Chamelon96, although it appears it might be formally launched this week at Embedded World in Nuremberg, Germany. For now, more information may be found in the Arrow blog announcement and RocketBoards.org’s Chamelon96 wiki.   Related posts: 96Boards-like SBC offers wireless and Ethernet First 96Boards CE Extended SBC taps Snapdragon 600 Two 96Boards SBCs debut, including one with AMD's ARM… Tiny SBC runs Android and Linux on Snapdragon 410 96Boards SBCs host Intel Joule and Curie IoT modules Quad-core, Cortex-A53 hacker SBC runs Linux and Android ARM/FPGA module runs Linux on Arria 10 SoC First "96Boards EE" SBC debuts with AMD ARM SoC 96Boards SBC gains AOSP build from Linaro Dev board runs Linux on Altera ARM+FPGA SoC (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

This results in dramatically faster large-scale analytics and transactions without significantly increasing development and management overhead. Get the GridGain White Paper. Intel has agreed to acquire Mobileye, a developer of autonomous vehicle technology, for US$15.3 billion in cash, the companies announced Monday. Intel will integrate Mobileye's computer vision and mapping technology for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles into its Automated Driving Group, to be led by MobileEye CTO Amnon Shashua. Intel SVP Doug Davis will oversee engagement across various Intel groups, and report directly to Shashua. The combined company will be the leading technology provider in the autonomous vehicle industry, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Wall Street analysts in a Monday conference call. "We believe this combination will accelerate this auto industry innovation by delivering the world class edge-to-edge solutions at a much lower cost [and] faster time to market," he said. <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14897125706227" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762537&amp;cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14897125706227" border="0" alt="" /></a> Lucrative Market The market for the vehicle systems, data and services market will reach more than $70 billion by the year 2030, Intel has estimated. The agreement extends Intel's strategy to invest in data-intensive opportunities that build on its strengths in cloud computing and connectivity to devices. Autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day by 2020, the company estimated, creating large-scale opportunities for Intel Xeon processors, EyeQ4 and EyeQ5 SoCs, high-performance FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), memory, high-bandwidth connectivity and computer vision technology. The acquisition will be accretive to earnings and cash flow immediately, and it will be funded with cash from its balance sheet, Intel said. The deal has been approved by both companies' boards of directors. Mobileye, founded in 1999, is one of the world's leading suppliers of computer vision solutions for advanced driver assist systems, with more than 16 million cars worldwide using its EyeQ chips. The company had revenue of $358 million in 2016 and non-GAAP net income of $173 million, or 73 cents a share. The Mobileye name and brand will remain intact, except for a slight logo change to reflect the Intel integration, Shashua and Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram said in a memo to employees. The company's relationships with OEM customers, Tier 1 partners and STMicro, its EyeQ roadmap and its after-market division operations, will not be interrupted. The acquisition strengthens Intel's aim to become a major supplier to the semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicle market, building upon its initial acquisition of Wind River from 2009, according to Jack Nerad, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book. Wind River's embedded devices are used in vehicle infotainment and telematics, which are key building blocks in semi-autonomous driving, he said. "Intel sees vehicle computing as a growth area at a time when its desktop and laptop opportunities may have peaked," Nerad told the E-Commerce Times. Other Relationships Intel and Mobileye have been working with BMW on self-driving cars, making theirs one of a dozen or so ventures involving technology firms with automakers, Nerad noted. The three companies announced an agreement in January at the Consumer Electronics Show to begin testing a fleet of 40 autonomous vehicles by the second half of 2017. The cars will feature Intel Go solutions for autonomous vehicles, including Xeon processors, Intel Arria 10 FPGAs and Intel solid state drives. BMW last month entered a deal to use Mobileye's road experience management technology to crowdsource mapping information for BMW's 2018 vehicles equipped with advanced driver assist system technology. The pace of consolidation in the autonomous vehicle industry could have a limited impact on competition down the road, as various teams work on their own unique sets of technologies, observed Steven Polzin, director of mobility policy research at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research. "It also begs the question of the relative merits of retaining a competitive and arguably creative set of players versus the consequence that new knowledge will not necessarily be shared," he told the E-Commerce Times, "perhaps delaying the pace of innovation and/or introducing the inefficiency of duplicative learning experiences."

When the $15.3 billion, all-cash deal closes later this year, Mobileye will become an Intel subsidiary in a self-driving technology market that the chipmaker believes could grow to $70 billion by 2030. The deal was generally well-received among analysts, who said the merger should put Intel ahead of the pack in the race to develop the critical components for safe and reliable self-driving cars. Some, however, said that Mobileye has fundamental problems that Intel will have to resolve to make its investment pay off long term. However, both Intel and Mobileye hailed the deal, saying they can work collaboratively toward improving self-driving car technology well into the future. 2 of 12 What Intel Is Buying According to the companies, Intel will acquire Mobileye for $15.3 billion in cash it already has on its balance sheet. The deal has been approved by the boards at both companies. Upon completion, Mobileye will merge with Intel’s Automated Driving Group and be led by Prof. Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chairman. 3 of 12 Why Intel Made the Acquisition In a statement, Intel said it is acquiring Mobileye to expand its presence in the automated car business. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he believes the combined company can create a highly desirable “cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” 4 of 12 Why Mobileye Signed the Deal It’s easy to say Mobileye signed the deal to cash in on its development efforts to date, but it goes beyond that. Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram said the Intel buy will dramatically ramp up its efforts in mapping, data centers and computing platforms, among other technologies. 5 of 12 Intel Sees a Huge Market Opportunity Intel believes the Mobileye buy is a sound investment. The company says the self-driving car market could grow to $70 billion by 2030, and it believes its solutions, with Mobileye’s inclusion, could nab a sizable chunk of that revenue. 6 of 12 Diversification to Give Intel New Look Several analysts wrote in research notes to investors March 13 that Intel’s acquisition signals a change in the company’s makeup. While Intel is still heavily involved in building processors, it’s also trying to diversify its business. The Mobileye underscores the diversity in the company’s business model. 7 of 12 Mobileye Focusing on Next-Generation Technology Mobileye is focused on car technology and next-generation technologies that could complement that. For instance, it has a technology called Road Experience Management that features sharable, high-definition maps for car fleets. It also is working on cloud-based tools for car localization and navigation technology. 8 of 12 A Sign of Things to Come? In an interview with The New York Times March 13, Gartner analyst Martin Birkner said the Intel acquisition could kick off an arms race in the self-driving car market as other prominent companies look to make strategic acquisitions in this field. While Birkner didn’t point to any specific deals, he believes consolidation will happen rather quickly. 9 of 12 Some Negative Implications Not everyone is so sure that the deal makes sense. In fact, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry told investors in a note March 13 that Mobileye is a potential problem for Intel because of massive research and development costs and so far no return on Mobileye's investments. He believes “Intel has now inherited Mobileye’s problems,” but won't be able to fix those problems. Analyst group Semiconductor Advisors noted the acquisition might prove to be “a small incremental net negative” for Intel’s revenue and profit figures. 10 of 12 Intel Won't Close the Deal for at Least Nine Months Don’t expect this deal to close anytime soon. Intel said in a statement it believes the deal will require nine months for the companies to get regulatory approval. In the meantime, they will both operate independently and will not share resources. 11 of 12 How the Deal Affects the Self-Driving Car Market Looking ahead, the market may be affected in dramatic ways. Intel now may be slightly ahead in self-driving car technology, putting its chief rivals Nvidia and Qualcomm on notice. Several analysts believe Nvidia and Qualcomm will respond by boosting their investments in self-driving cars. 12 of 12 10 Reasons the Samsung Galaxy S8 Will Be a Hot-Selling Smartphone Samsung has scheduled a media briefing on March 29 to introduce its Galaxy S8 smartphone, which is predicted to have the latest Qualcomm 835 processor.

Mobileye shares trading in New York were poised to surge more than 30% on the news. × Intel buys Israeli self-driving car firm for $15 billion Intel is snapping up self-driving car firm Mobileye in a deal worth $15.3 billion. The chipmaker confirmed the acquisition Monday, March 13, 2017, saying it will pay $63.54 per share in cash for the Israeli tech firm. Mobileye shares trading in New York were poised to surge more than 30% on the news. LONDON (CNNMoney) — Intel is snapping up self-driving car firm Mobileye in a deal worth $15.3 billion. The chipmaker confirmed the acquisition Monday, saying it will pay $63.54 per share in cash for the Israeli tech firm. Mobileye shares in New York soared 29% to $61.20 in midday trade, while Intel stock was down more than 2%. “Together we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on a call with investors following the announcement of the deal. Jerusalem-based Mobileye has already been working with Intel and BMW to develop a fully autonomous, self-driving vehicle. The company is a leader in collision prevention sensors that alert drivers if a pedestrian is in the road, or if they’re approaching another car too quickly. The technology uses artificial vision sensors placed in the cars, which Mobileye says act like a “driver’s third eye.” By 2030, Intel expects the vehicle systems, data and services space to be a $70 billion market. Mobileye was founded in 1999. Its technology helps cars navigate on and off ramps independently and even pass other vehicles without input from a human driver. It employs about 660 people. The company says that more than 10 million vehicles worldwide are equipped with its technology. Mobileye offices in the U.S., China, Germany and Japan. The deal is expected to close within the next nine months, subject to regulatory approvals, and boost Intel’s earnings right away. Tech companies have been heavily investing in the auto industry and racing to develop self-driving cars, including Alphabet’s Google, Tesla and Uber, which bought autonomous truck company Otto last year.

Name: Subject: Message: New Balance RunIQ and PaceIQ review by David Imel2 days ago 7.9 183 4 A fitness watch and headphone combo that offer great hardware and high price tags Rating Full Article Comments 299.99 Buy at Amazon Positives 5ATM water resistance Solid battery life Stylish yet durable design Solid GPS tracking in Strava Negatives Occasionally laggy and buggy Buttons not programmable No Android Wear 2.0 yet MyNB app is basically a big New Balance advertisement Rating Battery 8.1 Display 8.2 Performance 7.1 Software 7.2 Design 8.8 Bottom Line 7.9 7.9 RunIQ and PaceIQ by New Balance The New Balance RunIQ provides a solid Android Wear and fitness watch experience at a premium price, but lacks the recent Android Wear 2.0 update and can experience lag and stuttering when utilizing more than a couple sensors. The PaceIQ are a decent pair of Bluetooth earphones that cost more than they should and lack bass. Fitness watches – they’re what many wearables have migrated towards since the inception of the technology, as they can provide us useful information and metrics such as heart rate, step count, and now even reps from your weights. While we’ve seen a steady development in the functionality of this hardware, much of the core components have remained the same. Battery technology has gotten slightly better over the last couple years, but that is mainly due to software, not hardware. So what does one watch offer over the many, many others available on the market? Often it will be slightly custom software, sometimes an extra button, but most of the time, it is a minor tweak to both these things. So what has New Balance, a shoe company, done to make their watch stand out? There’s quite a lot going on here, from the specialized hardware buttons to the sensors made to track your body to a super finite degree. With a built-in GPS, optical heart rate monitor, a solid water resistance rating, and integrated Strava running software, there is a lot to like here. Since it runs Android Wear, you still get all the same benefits of the OS, including the ability to download music directly onto your watch. So does the RunIQ warrant its high $300 price tag? What about New Balance’s PaceIQ fitness earbuds? Find out in our full New Balance RunIQ and PaceIQ review! See also: Best fitness trackers 4 days ago Design There’s no doubting that New Balance is aiming this watch at the sports/fitness crowd here. It has a relatively large 1.39-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 400 x 400 that shows up great in direct sunlight, and doesn’t need a separate proximity sensor to dim the screen when you don’t need it. The pixel density comes in at 287ppi, so while you’re obviously not going to get smartphone resolution on this thing, it is still more than decent for a smartwatch. It doesn't feel a huge amount larger than a traditional sports watch Though relatively thick, it doesn’t feel a huge amount larger than a traditional sports watch. Quite honestly, there are a number of traditional watches that are much more hefty than this thing, even with all the included internals and sensors. The bezel raises slightly from the surface of the touchscreen, likely to protect it from getting smashed if you trip while on a run. The casing is made of a hard plastic which feels very solid for what it is, and would likely only come away with a number of scratches and scuffs if you were to land on it directly. Though, if this were the case, your wrist would likely be in a lot more trouble than your watch. Unfortunately, the three physical buttons aren't reprogrammable There are three buttons attached to the right side of the device, each with varied functionality. While it would have been nice to be able to be able to reprogram these to your own liking, New Balance it really pushing running functionality with the watch. A quick tap of the top button will instantly launch Strava, which is interestingly built right into the watch, with no separate app “technically” required on your phone in order to view current metrics, though you will have to download the full Strava app in order to see your route and historical data. This app in particular is full-fledged, with four different screens showing distance, time, BPM, steps, and a lap counter. There are also music controls built in here, which syncs with Google Play Music to play whatever tracks or playlist you run to best. The center lug essentially works as a ‘back’ button, returning you to previous screens without the need to swipe applications away. This will also turn on and off the screen depending on if you’re sitting on the watch face home screen. You can also hold the button while on the home screen to open up the app menu, where you will be able to select the local apps that have custom functionality with Android Wear. There isn’t much functionality past this, but it is another method of interactive with the watch if you would prefer not to swipe around the display. Don't miss: Best Android Wear watches 1 week ago The bottom button controls playback of music. When you tap it, you get the option to play music either on the watch, or from your phone. Since you can store music files locally on the watch itself, there becomes very little need to actually take your phone with you on runs. The manufacturer says you should be able to store up to 50 hours of music locally on the device, meaning you should be able to load up all your favorite playlists to take with you on your favorite trails. While this is a feature embedded into Android Wear itself and not part of the watch, it is still quite useful, especially for a watch that is so focused on running. The top of the watch features stationary time markers, which more or less align with the marks on an analog Android Wear watch face, but prove a bit redundant since this is already provided on the screen. This is more than likely provided solely for the aesthetic of the device, and we’re not necessarily complaining that it is included. One of the best parts of the RunIQ's design is the strap One of my favorite parts of the RunIQ’s design is the strap. The included watch strap is a soft rubber one, which has an incredibly high amount of cutouts to be locked into place. Since the rubber is relatively stretchy, in combination with the super high amount of cutouts, it is extremely easy to get a good fit. Never once did I feel that I was forced to wear the watch too loosely or too tightly around my wrist – it always seemed to fit just right. The rubber also makes it so those who sweat during intense workouts will not have to worry about damaging the device. These bands are interchangeable, so you should be able to swap it out with a color that matches your style. The model we have for review was black on black, and while I personally think that it is the most understated and professional color available, some may want to swap it out for one of the other colorful options offered by the company. The bottom of the device reveals the heart rate sensor which flashes green while active, as well as the inductive charging plates which magnetically attach to the included charger. I’m personally a big fan of the way this device charges. The magnets hold the watch to the charger quite securely so it won’t fall off from a bump, but you can still grab the watch and go without the need of any locking/unlocking mechanism. The watch's charger is very well designed While some watches like the Moto 360 offer angled charging docks that allow you to use your watch as a bedside clock as you sleep, the security and strength of the magnets in this device make it feel more secure on my desk. The 410mAh battery charges pretty darn quickly, so you should be able to get a solid charge out of the device if you’re only home for a shower and have to run out again. The watch is rated for waterproofing up to 5ATM, so while you shouldn’t go deep sea diving with this thing, it will do fine for casual swimming and running in the rain. With Apple touting the ability to swim with the Watch Series 2 as one of its primary features, we think it’s important to mention that quite a lot of watches with waterproofing exist, and the New Balance RunIQ is just one of those options. Features and performance One of the most marketed features of the New Balance RunIQ is that is was developed in partnership with Intel. It uses an Intel Atom Z34XX to compute all of that data from the sensors as well as run the OS, and while such a big name demands big performance, we did notice a number of issues when using some of the more data intensive parts of the watch. When doing simple things like notification mirroring and music playback, the watch worked just fine, smoothly informing me of all those Allo messages (don’t hate) and emails I get on a daily basis. Related: Best GPS running watches 4 weeks ago Strava on the RunIQ is pretty glitchy The biggest performance strain I experienced presented itself when I launched the integrated Strava app, which is completely confined to the watch, though you can sync this data with the Strava app on your phone. For the most part, Strava offers the functionality and metrics you’re likely to use while on a run. While I would say that the app works pretty flawlessly while using it, backing out to the home screen while the app is paused caused the device to freeze up, and then start opening other apps and features at random. I had to just let the watch die before I could use it again at this point, as it was launching and closing Strava over and over again without me pressing anything. While this could just be some random bug that I encountered in the semi-custom software that New Balance has running on top of Android Wear, I think the 512MB of RAM in tandem with the Atom Z34XX SoC on board the device is not quite enough to store all the services that are accessed when using the application. The Strava app in particular launches the watch’s on-board GPS, heart rate sensor, and pedometer all at the same time. Intel’s Atom Z34XX chip is made to be able to handle all of these sensors on the fly, though it is seldom that devices utilizing the SoC will use all these services at one time, and may take some more tweaking or require more voltage in order to perform the necessary calculations. I can’t say that the performance issues I experienced were all due to Intel or the New Balance team, but I can say that this thing needs just a bit more power in order to utilize all its sensors to the required level. The only other major performance issue I encountered had to do with the speed at which the watch mirrored notifications. I’ve owned a 1st Generation Moto 360 since it launched way back in 2014, and I’ll sometimes feel the watch buzz with a notification before I even see my phone light up. The RunIQ did not offer quite the same experience in my testing. Often it would be one to two full seconds after my phone received the notification that the watch would alert me of the same thing. While this is not a huge issue for a lot of users, seeing the information on my phone’s lock screen before my watch received the same message created a redundancy which was more annoying than anything. I have to assume this issue is due to whatever Bluetooth module the company has opted to use in the device, but one can never be too sure with these things. Just know that in my personal experience, this issue did exist, so if instant notification mirroring is a make-or-break feature for you, you may want to look elsewhere. LG Watch Sport and Watch Style review Which smartwatches will get updated to Android Wear 2.0? The RunIQ runs Android Wear, so you have access to all the features that come along with that software. New Balance’s offing is currently slated to receive the Android Wear 2.0 update that many have been fawning over since LG released the Watch Sport and Style last month, but the device is currently running the older Android Wear version 1.5. Of course, the consumer-ready version of Android Wear 2.0 was just released a couple weeks ago, so we know this device couldn’t have launched with it out of the box. Still, it’d be nice to see a brand new Android Wear watch running the latest version of Google’s smartwatch OS. If you’re wondering about battery life, New Balance says you can expect to get 24 hours out of this thing with normal use, or about five hours of active GPS usage. While I obviously didn’t go running for 5 hours to test this because I am a technology journalist, the regular usage I experienced actually surpassed the 24 hour mark. I was generally seeing about 30 hours or so on each charge, and that is actually with the ‘always on’ display feature enabled. That is pretty impressive coming from a 410mAh battery, and proves that Intel’s Atom Z34XX chip can be quite efficient when it wants to be. That said, efficiency and performance are almost mutually exclusive factors, and caused the performance issues that we discussed earlier. Software The New Balance PaceIQ runs Android Wear. This is essentially the same software across a number of different watches, but there are a few small tweaks including additional built-in software among other things. The RunIQ in particular has a full blown Strava app built right in, which utilizes the built-in GPS, heart rate sensor, pedometer, and more to give you the most accurate information possible regarding your run. I tested this app multiple times, and have to admit I had more issues with it than I would have liked. While the activity the app actually tracks is chock full of metrics and useful information, it really is hit or miss right now whether the app will tell you the activity was tracked or not. I ran with just the watch on five separate occasions, and three of these times the watch told me that I did not have enough GPS coordinates to be tracked. Initially I thought this may have been due to the fact that I didn’t have the Strava app downloaded on my phone, but then I continued to have occasional issues. The activity was actually tracked on my phone even if it said it wasn’t though, so this seems more like a minor software bug. That being said, the paths tracked on Strava were quite accurate, so it seems the onboard GPS does do quite well when it works. I did a couple of factory resets and the GPS seemed to work better after that point, but the fact that it is randomly buggy still needs to be said. Hopefully these issues will be fixed with the Android Wear 2.0 update, but we will have to wait and see if that is the case. Requiring the Strava and New Balance apps for your phone did leave me a little frustrated, though. New Balance markets this watch as if you don’t need your phone at all, but that’s really not the case. While you can’t exactly view all of your intricate metrics about your run on a small screen like this, it still felt like I was tracking a lot of this information for no reason if I didn’t have the Strava mobile app. I would have liked if you could at least view historical data about your runs on the watch, but it seems that they only optimized it to be able to view what is going on in the moment. The in-app music browser worked well for switching songs and adjusting the volume, but the tracks listed stopped reflecting what was actually playing past the first song. I first noticed this when Maneater by Hall and Oates started playing and I wanted to turn it up. I tried skipping back and forth between different music and jumping in and out of the music browser, but the watch never updated with the current song. This was also probably a minor bug and will hopefully be fixed in the future. New Balance does offer an app for your smartphone, the MyNB app, which allows you to sync a lot of the data from the watch to your device. The app will ask all about you: what sports you are into, your gender, birthday, and even what kind of clothes you wear. I found this a bit invasive, as they are obviously trying to figure out how to best market your apparel, but you can skip this step entirely, so don’t fret too much if you would prefer not to answer these questions. From here, you can read a huge amount of content related to running and fitness, and can spend “New Balance points” on new clothes and shoes. The navigation in the app is actually pretty great, and uses smooth animations to get you where you need to go. While it’s obvious that this was originally designed as a shopping app, the company has gone ahead and slid RunIQ integration right into it, which in my opinion is probably better than making a whole separate app to bog down the Play Store. The app will prompt you to connect your Strava account to the watch, and for some reason is required to get Strava working on the watch itself. The app will get a lot of documentation detailing how to use the watch, and you can also modify things like the color theme and distance information shown on the face of the watch on the fly, though that is essentially all it does for you besides being a New Balance shopping app. The MyNB app is basically a big New Balance advertisement What is most frustrating about the MyNB app is the fact that you need to have it installed for setup of Strava on your RunIQ. Besides being able to change a few colors on the watch and connect your Strava account, the app is essentially used completely for shopping. After you connect Strava through this app you can essentially get rid of it, but it seems incredibly cumbersome that you should be forced to install a standalone app that does almost nothing. After this you can download Strava and use that like normal, but why should you have to use a separate app to use Strava? Since this is Android Wear, you would think you would be able to use Strava like on any other smartwatch, but New Balance seems to think forcing the MyNB app is a better way to sell its shoes and accessories. Of course, if Strava isn’t your thing, you can always use one of the many other fitness apps available for Android. This is Android Wear after all, so if you like, you can make use of Runtastic or Endomondo as well. Yes, New Balance has partnered with Strava for this particular watch and if you don’t use it the top lug on the unit is essentially useless, but you do you. Other apps will work just fine. New Balance PaceIQ earbuds While the RunIQ smartwatch can be purchased on its own, the company designed it in tandem with the PaceIQ earbuds. These are Bluetooth earbuds that were designed with Jabra, and are actually based on the the Jabra Sport Pace. See also: Jabra Sport Pace Wireless review There is a button on the side of the left ear bud that will give you statistics from your watch, so you’ll never have to look down to get all the statistics while on your run, which is a great feature considering focusing on anything except your path is pretty dangerous when running. Unfortunately, pushing a button that goes directly into your ear is a bit uncomfortable, and you do have to exert a decent amount of force into your ear before the button actually clicks. As far as sound quality goes, the headphones are pretty decent. The mids and highs were especially good, but the bass and lows left quite a bit to be desired. Especially for a set of headphones designed specifically for running, you would think the company would want to make bass an integral part of the design, but I didn’t particularly feel that was the case here. Perhaps with a decent equalizer you could get a good mix out of these things, but I feel they should emit these frequencies right out of the box for those that want to just grab them and go. New Balance says you should be able to get about five hours of playback time out of these things, but from the testing I did, it was more accurate to say I got around four. Calls through the headset will definitely drain the battery a bit faster due to activating the on-board microphone, but they sounded fine. I would say that these things are a bit quiet, so if you’re in a busy coffee shop you probably won’t be able to hear the person you are talking to very well, but if you are just out for a run or walk they should do ok. In terms of shape, these things are great. When I originally put them on, I had the absolute hardest time getting them to fit correctly. I realized a bit later that I was attempting to wear them completely wrong though, so make sure you actually read the manual and see how to get the best fit. They come with four different sets of buds to get the best fit with your ear, so you can change those out and decide which set you like. The hoop that goes around your ear is protective enough to keep them from falling out of your ears, but is also not obstructive to the point where it puts pressure on your ears. I generally can’t wear regular buds without some sort of fastening to my ears since I have particularly slippery insides (you probably didn’t need to know that), but the hoops keep them on safely and securely. There is also a small plastic clip which is used to keep extra wire from flinging around while on a run, and I feel that this is an absolutely essential accessory. It is very small and extremely easy to lose however, so I would have liked for New Balance to have the clip hang off the headphones themselves or something of that caliber in order to keep them safe. I haven’t lost mine, but I could absolutely see how that would be the case, especially with someone that isn’t good at keeping track of their technology. Should you buy one (or both)? The New Balance RunIQ comes in at $299.99 USD, which is a bit of a steep price to pay for something that doesn’t necessarily offer a ton more features over something older like the Moto 360 Sport. This watch really does feel premium, however. Even if the lugs on the side of the watch don’t function like that on a traditional sports watch, they still give off that “premium” look that have demanded such an inflated cost from traditional watches over the years. The extremely adjustable and customizable band also gives you the option of letting the world know you’re a fitness junkie or looking a bit more professional. Buy the New Balance RunIQ Buy the New Balance PaceIQ earbuds There are some caveats that keep me from recommending this thing whole-heatedly, though. The biggest one being that it’s feature with the biggest focus feels a bit lacking. For a fitness watch that is marketed as completely separate from your smartphone, it should not require a device application to actually record and view historical data. It would be nice to be able to view and compare your old runs on the watch itself, as though the Strava and MyNB smartphone apps are extremely well made, they should not be required for someone that doesn’t want to have their phone on them all the time. Performance and bugginess are the RunIQ's main issues The other major issue for me is performance. While Intel’s Atom Z34XX chip gave me faith that the company really knows how to do efficiency, I think that that chip needed to be clocked higher to produce the performance needed for a device like this. This would have needed a bigger battery if that was the case, and while it almost seems like a joke to be asking for a bigger battery at this point, smartwatch battery capacities have essentially not improved whatsoever since their introduction in 2014. Looking at this from the perspective of purely being a piece of fitness tech, there is quite a bit to like here. It has all the bells and whistles you’re probably going to need for running and other exercise, but the integrated GPS has issues displaying data on the device itself, though this may be a minor software bug for now. The heart rate monitor and pedometer work great, but is that enough to make it this a great fitness watch? It’s comfortable and water resistant, can be used anywhere, and should last long enough to track the entirety of almost any workout, so those are positives that do give this thing a bit of desirable characteristics. With all that being said, should you buy one, even if only for the fitness tracking it provides? At the moment, my answer is no. If this thing had launched alongside the Moto 360 Sport, I would be much more inclined to say yes. The New Balance RunIQ is effectively a more premium version of that watch with a few more bells and whistles, and for someone who may have wanted the best of the best at the time, this would have been it. Unfortunately, by the time this thing actually launched the market was much more inflated with other options that can do the same things to the same caliber or better at a price that can either match or beat it. The New Balance PaceIQ spells a very similar story for the brand. Coming in at $109.99 USD, they fall into a very similar pricing structure as something like the Jaybird X2s or X3s. And while they offer a great fit and nice battery life, they really don’t have any one ‘killer’ feature that would make me drop my X2s and pick them up. If you have the watch, they do offer functionality that you won’t be able to get from any other headphones, but is this something that you absolutely need? The New Balance RunIQ and PaceIQ are very capable pieces of hardware that offer many of the same features as competing technology on the market, but don’t offer any ‘killer features’ that make them worth the price the company is asking. If you’re a fitness junkie who needs something right now, they may be worth a look, but it would be well advised to look around the market for more updated competitors such as the Huawei Watch 2 and the Jaybird X3s. 299.99 Buy at Amazon Features News Reviews Android Wear, Android Wear 2.0, New Balance, new balance runIQ, New Balance PaceIQ Android Wear, Android Wear 2.0, New Balance, New Balance PaceIQ, new balance runIQ David Imel David Imel  is a 21 year-old technology enthusiast hailing from Smartville, Califorina.

Ford bought computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS AC in August and BMW invested in transit app Moovit in 2015. Daimler AG and GM have also opened research and development centers in the country. Advertisement Israel’s emergence as a center for automotive technology got a vote of confidence on March 13 when Intel Corp. said it would pay $15 billion for Mobileye NV, a Jerusalem-based maker of chips and software for driverless cars. It will be the largest takeover of an Israeli tech firm and follows a series of deals and partnerships inked in recent years by major tech and auto companies. “The deal proves in a dramatic manner that our vision is coming true. Israel is becoming a global technology center, not only in cyber, but also in the automotive area,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. Israel had already singled out the automotive technology sector as a possible economic boon, allotting it 250 million shekels (US$68 million) for the next five years. At least five major car manufacturers have made investments in Israel. Ford Motor Co. bought computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS AC in August and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG invested in transit app Moovit in 2015. Daimler AG and General Motors Co. have also opened research and development centers in the country. The Mobileye deal went far beyond the $4.7 billion sale of fiber-optic company Chromatis Networks Inc. to Lucent Technologies Inc. in 2000, which was the country’s biggest tech deal before Mobileye. Founders Ziv Aviram, who is also the CEO, and Chairman Amnon Shashua, will share just under $1 billion from the sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Dec. 31. Shmuel Harlap, the largest shareholder, will make $1 billion, according to Bloomberg data as of April 1, 2016. Netanyahu’s Director General Eli Groner said the autonomous tech sector could potentially boost economic growth by 50%. Popular Now Five Elements to Include in a Compelling Business Case First Look at Trump Budget Isn't Pretty: Commentary Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement Fast Track Israel is not renowned for its car-making industry, once turning out fiberglass-shelled cars that were briefly popular in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the country is now benefiting from the automobile industry’s increasing focus on software rather than hardware. In Israel, the automotive technology sector currently counts about 350 startups, according to industry monitor IVC Research Center, with the potential, according to Gruner, to grow bigger than the cybersecurity industry, which drew 15 percent of global capital raised by the sector in 2016, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a group that promotes Israel startups. Argus Cyber Security, based in Tel Aviv, in January announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies to protect cars from hackers. Otonomo Technologies Inc., a data platform that tells users when to stop driving due to a malfunction and can call emergency services when there is an accident, is working with nine car manufacturers, including Daimler. Aquarius Engines, which has designed and developed an engine to generate electric power, is working with Peugeot SA and three other automobile companies. Gal Fridman, chairman of Aquarius Engines, said the deal “definitely makes our lives easier.” “It validates Israel’s ability in technology in the automotive industry, traditionally American and German and not at all Israeli,” Fridman said. “Mobileye has dramatically helped us open the door wider into this industry.” Growing Pains The autonomous sector is expanding even as Israel’s tech sector suffers from growing pains. Although the country’s tech industry grew faster than gross domestic product nearly every year between 1998 to 2009, in the five years following it surpassed national growth only once, in 2012. The Finance Ministry acknowledged in a report last year that the industry that fueled Israel’s economy for the past two decades was stagnating. Mobileye has also had its issues. Last year, Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla Inc. stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the breakup. After the Mobileye acquisition was announced, Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who have been reducing corporate taxes, announced they would consider further cuts. “We view this deal as an indication that the more attractive Israel is for foreign investors, the more tax revenue we will generate,” Groner said. Tax breaks are already part of the government’s program to encourage global technology companies to do more research and development in Israel as other countries vie for companies like Intel to put down roots on their soil. “The deal will increase the attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups,” said Jon Medved, founder of OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform based in Jerusalem.

This is a timepiece that both embraces its Swiss roots (it is assembled in the La Chaux-de-Fonds workshop) and makes a giant leap forward in watch tech. While it's assembled in Switzerland, the project is clearly a Silicon Valley collaboration — the result of a years-long partnership with Intel hardware and Google’s Android Wear operating system. The marriage is clear in the product: This watch is able to host both digital and mechanical modules that attach to the watch’s lugs. In short, users will be able to switch from a smartwatch to a mechanical one. PREVIOUSLY: Tag Heuer and Google Team Up to Take on the Apple Watch Both modules will be the same size, 45mm, which is 1mm smaller than the original Connected. The electronic module has received quite a few upgrades, too. Powered by the Intel Atom processor Z34XX series, the watch now operates on Android Wear 2.0. This gives it the ability to run standalone apps — including Android Pay — without the need for a smartphone nearby. Users will be able to connect their watches to the Internet via Wi-Fi and cellular networks, connect to GPS, and store images on 4GB of flash storage in the watch. Note: those early adaptors with the original Connected will be getting a software update to 2.0. Phew. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touchscreen and is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Another unique feature: water won’t pass through the headphone jack (yes, there's a headphone jack). Intel promises a 30-hour battery life.  The smartwatch’s cases, straps, lugs, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of up to 56 versions. The TAG Heuer Studio is a watch face configurator that will give shoppers the ability to customize their watch by picking from 30 different faces, and give them the option of adding and removing specific features, such as the SuperLuminova effect on the hands and changing the colors of specific details. All in all, TAG Heuer promises up to 4,000 unique configurations for the Connected Modular 45. Best of all, by making the transition from smartwatch to mechanical watch seamless, TAG Heuer still maintains the classic notions of watches as heirloom pieces while remaining completely technologically relevant. MORE: 40 Watches Your Grandkids Will Fight Over The original Connected was launched with the promise that wearers could trade it in for a mechanical Carrera for a $1,500 premium. Likewise, TAG Heuer is launching Modular 45 with two compatible mechanical modules, but more will follow. Available now is the Calibre 5, with time-and-date automatic movement, and the Calibre 02T, the company’s entry-level tourbillon. The watch is available starting today at $1,650. Eleven standard models will be available, but up to 56 references will be available on demand, including titanium, ceramic, and gold-plated components. The chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module is at the top of the range and will be offered in a deluxe box set that includes a connected module and an additional black rubber strap. Price tag: a cool $17,000. [tagheuer.com] Topics: Watches Want More? Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest adventures, workouts, destinations, and more.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Klint Finley. Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 03.14.17. 03.14.17 Time of Publication: 2:36 pm. 2:36 pm Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived Mobileye AI isn’t just changing internet services, cars, robotics, and healthcare. It’s changing the computer chip market too. This shift was underlined on Monday when Intel said it would pay $15.3 billion to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes chips and cameras for cars and trucks, including the self-driving variety. The purchase will be Intel’s second largest ever, following its $16.7 billion acquisition of chip-maker Altera in 2015. The Altera buy was also driven, in part, by the recent rise of machine learning, where machine can learn discrete tasks on their own. These are enormous acquisitions in many respects. After acquiring Mobileye, Intel will move its autonomous driving team to the Mobileye’s headquarters, not vice versa. In other words, Intel is letting Mobileye take over a growing wing of its company. The world’s largest chip maker knows the market is changing rapidly, and it’s determined to change with it. As long as PCs and servers dominated the computing landscape, Intel reigned supreme. But PCs now share the stage with phones, tablets, drones, TVs, smart thermostats, and, yes, cars. For the most part, the smartphone and tablet revolution sidestepped Intel in favor of chips from ARM, and though these gadgets still connect to data centers in the cloud, where Intel chips are still dominant, this hegemony is now being threatened by the rise of chips suited to running neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including recognizing images and translating from one language to another. Typically, neural networks analyze data with help from graphics processing units, or GPUs, chip originally built to help power video games in the late 1990s, and most of these are supplied by Intel rival nVidia. But other companies are exploring more specialized chips for machine learning. Last year, Google unveiled its own AI-focused chip called the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPUs, and Microsoft revealed that it uses Altera’s customizable chips to power its own AI applications. That’s why Intel acquired Altera. But increasingly, specialized AI chips are also needed in devices, including cars. Think of it this way: companies need chips in the data center to train the neural networks, and as these machine learning models get more complex, they will also need chips in the devices to help execute the models. Once a company teaches a system to recognize detailed images, for instance, it will need a way of running a system on a phone or a car. With this in mind, Intel has bought-up mobile-focused AI chip company Movidius and now Mobileye. Plus, it has already makes the RealSense 3D camera for drones, cars, and any other gadget that needs artificial eyes, and it has acquired drone-makers Ascending Technologies. You saw some of the fruits of these efforts during the Super Bowl half time show this year. Intel is determined not to miss the next chip wave the way it missed the switch to mobile. But there are obstacles aplenty. Microsoft recently revealed that it’s exploring the use of ARM chips in its data centers, another push against Intel’s hegemony in the data center. However the battle of the chips plays out, one thing is certain: the market isn’t what it used to be. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

As leaks had suggested, the Android Wear 2.0 from TAG Heuer has been launched at an uncannily expensive price of $ 1700, which roughly amounts to INR 1,12,000. Intel and TAG Heuer have come together to introduce this all-metal customizable modular Android wearable. The successor of the TAG Connected, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 will have customizable lugs as well as interchangeable straps. Moreover, the watch can be customized before it is bought. The customization allows you to choose from a range of 500 styles and 56 different versions (11 standard models offered in-store with an additional 45 upon request) of the watch. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has  a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch-screen display with a round flat tire. The ring surrounding it consists of all the requisite antennas for WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is equipped with Intel’s Atom Z34XX processor. TAG Heuer and Intel claim that the Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch has a batter life of up to 30 hours. Among other features, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has NFC, enabling it to make contact-less payments, and it can track your location and fitness using onboard GPS. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has a 2.5D sapphire crystal cover with a titanium case. The second-gen smartwatch from TAG Heuer packs 4GB of RAM and is water resistant up to 5ATM. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is also fitted with a small microphone which allows the user to communicate with it via voice recognition (aka, it has the Google Assistant!). TAG Heuer’s CEO, Jean-Claude Biver, said This innovative, unique and distinctive TAG watch is at the forefront of the latest technologies available in Silicon Valley and, at the same time, a genuine Swiss watch, bearing the Swiss Made label While it costs a lot, the makers have offered a series of options to users in terms of buckles (black PVD or titanium), bracelets (ceramic, titanium, leather or rubber), 30 dial options and the watch’s lugs. Given that its predecessor swept the market with its launch, all eyes will be set on how the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 does on the sales front. likethis What's your reaction?

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Friday March 17, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Making autonomous car play, Intel offers US$15 billion for Mobileye AP  Wednesday, March 15, 2017, 12:07 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ DETROIT -- Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than US$15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of US$10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about US$2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems.

Be careful how you customize it: some options will set you back many thousands of dollars. Didn't buy an iPhone or an Apple Watch Edition because you were waiting for a worthy alternative from Google? Maybe you own a Pixel now. You might want to check out the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. That's because the Swiss luxury brand's second smartwatch, launched on Tuesday, is partly designed by both Google and Intel. The Modular 45, which starts at $1,650 and can nudge $17,000 depending on the options you select, is the gorgeous timepiece you'd expect from Swiss engineers. But it also appears to be a showpiece designed to make Google's Android Wear platform look its best. True to its name, the Modular 45 is modular: you can choose from among 56 lugs, straps, and buckles that can be swapped out in seconds with no tools required. Material options for the straps include rubber, leather, titanium, and ceramic in many different colors, so you can go as gaudy or classy as you wish. The watch module itself even has separate versions: the main Android Wear-powered smartwatch, and two mechanical watches if you want the latest from Tag Heuer but don't want to wear what amounts to a smartphone on your wrist. And this truly is a smartphone alternative for many activities. An Intel Atom processor, Android Wear 2.0, and a full suite of antennas (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, and GPS) mean that you'll be able to complete payments, log your workout, and browse your calendar, email, and much more without tethering the Modular 45 to a larger mobile device. Intel and Google representatives joined Tag Heuer at a press event in San Francisco on Monday night, where they detailed the division of labor that makes the Modular 45 tick. Intel worked on packing in the chips and sensors, a challenge for the watch's full-metal case, which inherently blocks RF signals. Tag Heuer itself was responsible for the design, and Google brought the operating system, which, as far as I could tell from a brief demo, is pretty much stock Android Wear. There's a 1.4-inch AMOLED multi-touch display with a tenth of an inch of sapphire crystal on top of it, which makes for a marked improvement over the Modular 45's predecessor, the Tag Heuer Connected. Inside is an Intel Atom Z34 processor, 512GB of memory, 4GB of storage, and all the sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, tilt detection, microphone, vibrations and haptics engine, and ambient light sensor. There's also a 410mAh battery, with up to 25 hours of life and a charging time of under two hours. To customize watch faces, you can use the new Tag Heuer Connected app on your phone to chose from among 30 different pre-selected designs that approximate stately mechanical faces, or you can customize individual components to create your own look. Speaking of customization, the physical components you choose will greatly influence the Modular 45's final price. Rubber bands are the cheapest, while you can select diamond-encrusted bands and a titanium finish for the watch face to push the price past $6,000. And if money is truly no object, you can opt for a $17,000 package that includes both the titanium Android watch module and a mechanical one, as well as leather and rubber straps. Those prices make the $1,250 Apple Watch Edition seem like a downright bargain.

Recommended for You Google’s New Tool Says Nearly 80 Percent of Roofs Are Sunny Enough for Solar Panels The Entrepreneur with the $100 Million Plan to Link Brains to Computers Scrutiny Intensifies on the Warrantless Collection of Americans’ Communications How to Upgrade Judges with Machine Learning Facebook’s AI Chief: Machines Could Learn Common Sense from Video Intel’s proposed $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that supplies carmakers with a computer-vision technology and advanced driver assistance systems, offers a chance to measure the scale of this rebuild. In particular, it shows how valuable on-the-road data is likely to be in the evolution of automated driving. While the price tag might seem steep, especially with so many players in automated driving today, Mobileye has some key technological strengths and strategic advantages. It’s also developing new technologies that could help solidify this position. Mobileye uses a single camera, together with a proprietary computer chip and some clever software, to provide various advanced driver assistance features. Its systems can, for example, identify the speed limit from road signs, or identify vehicles and pedestrians for an automatic braking system.  David Keith, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who studies technology adoption in the automotive industry, says besides offering a simple, low-cost solution, Mobileye has amassed a huge amount of data—something that is vital to the machine learning that underpins automated driving today. “Their technologies are highly reliable, honed over millions of miles of driving experience, which competitors cannot easily replicate,” he says. It isn’t hard to see why Intel should want to enter the auto market. The increasingly capable computers, sensors, and wireless connections now found in vehicles are enabling big changes across that industry. Meanwhile, Intel has seen its position of dominance eroded in recent years as desktop and laptop computers fade in importance, and as different types of computer chips have become more popular. Competitor Nvidia has already captured a sizable share of the growing auto market. Mobileye’s technology can automatically identify lane markings and curbs. Keith adds that Intel will aim to use its hardware expertise to develop the increasingly sophisticated fusion systems—combining cameras, radar, and possibly laser sensing, or lidar—needed bring fully automated vehicles to market. If your car is capable of identifying a road sign or a pedestrian on the road ahead, there’s a good chance it already uses one of Mobileye’s chips for the task. The company’s vision systems are a simple, low-cost solution that offers surprisingly sophisticated sensing. The company therefore offers Intel a good way into the automated driving market, which promises to grow as the technology matures in the coming years.  For its vision system, Mobileye employs deep learning, a machine-learning technique that has given computers powerful new capabilities in recent years. This involves capturing images as cars drive around, and annotating them to identify things like road markings, traffic signs, other vehicles, and pedestrians. The images are fed into a big neural network, which is tweaked until it can reliably recognize the relevant elements of an image. If Mobileye’s system is unable to identify something, it’s usually possible to simply annotate some new images and add them to the learning data set. What do you think driving will look like in 10 or 20 years? Tell us what you think. This isn’t to say that it’s perfect, or all that’s needed for automated driving. Tesla had been using Mobileye’s vision technology for its Autopilot semi-automated driving system until last year. The companies ceased working together after a fatal accident involving a car controlled by Autopilot. In the fallout from the crash, the carmaker criticized the vision system provided by Mobileye. Executives from Mobileye countered that its technology was never meant to be used in this way. Technology now under development at Mobileye could help automated cars drive more safely in the future. In December, I met with Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s CTO, and Shai Shalev-Shwartz, VP for technology. They explained how Mobileye is now using reinforcement learning, a technique inspired by the way animals learn through experience, to teach computers how to drive safely in complex and subtle situations (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2017: Reinforcement Learning”). As part of this effort, Mobileye is developing a simulated driving environment to enable learning. It hopes this will become the standard environment for testing automated driving software. They also explained that Mobileye is working with several carmakers on a way for them to share the data collected with other companies for a price. This could help accelerate (no pun intended) progress toward fully automated driving. The result could be a transformation of transportation as we know it. Indeed, the prospect of profound disruption has caused a stampede for technology and talent among automakers, suppliers, and startups. Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, agrees that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye shows how critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry’s future. But he adds, “It’s also evidence of the degree to which demand for talent is outstripping supply in the autonomous vehicle space.” Tech Obsessive?

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Mar 14, 2017 at 12:11PM It's been clear for some time now that the automotive industry is on the verge of evolving more over the next two decades than it has in the past hundred years. Further proof came Monday morning when Silicon Valley pushed more chips onto the table with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announcing it would acquire Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), a leader in developing driverless car technology. By the numbers Intel's deal to purchase Mobileye came with a $15.3 billion price tag, a hefty sum that valued Mobileye at $63.54 per share. That's a 34% premium to Mobileye's price at Friday's close, and is the driving force behind the company's 30% surge in stock price Monday morning. While this move was unforeseen, it does make a lot of sense and is just one of many recent big moves in the automotive industry. Intel already had made a move to buy a 15% stake in digital map-making company Here International B.V., to own more navigation technology. Samsung Electronics made its own move a week ago when it closed an $8 billion deal to purchase Harman International, a company devoted to designing and engineering connected products and solutions for automakers. Even the automotive industry's own General Motors spent roughly $1 billion to purchase Cruise Automation to ignite its own self-driving research, and has invested $500 million in ride-hailing company Lyft in its effort to bulk up smart mobility projects. Ford's Fusion testing self-driving technology. Image source: Ford Motor Company. A big step forward In the press release announcing the acquisition, Ziv Aviram, Mobileye co-founder, president and CEO, said: We expect the growth toward autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers. By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry. What's in it for Intel? Intel paid a hefty price tag for Mobileye, which generated a modest $358.2 million in revenue last year. But Intel is getting a serious foot in the door of markets it wants to dominate in the future. Image source: Intel Corporation Mobileye acquisition presentation. Mobileye brings a lot to the table in that regard with its thoroughly respected expertise in self-driving sensors and technology, as well as numerous partnerships with the largest automakers in the business. Mobileye is a leader in advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) technologies and has a portfolio of vision, sensor fusion, mapping, and driving policy products. And if you're going to get into the automotive industry, which is plagued by capital-intensive operations and historically low margins, this is the place to be. Consider that during 2016 Mobileye generated 76% gross margin, 48.3% adjusted-EBITDA margin, and 34% operating margin, thanks to its low fixed costs and less intensive marketing and SG&A costs compared to OEM (original equipment manufacturer) automakers. As a bonus, Mobileye is expected to be immediately accretive to Intel's non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow. Intel management also believes it can wring out $175 million in cost synergies annually by 2019, which will only improve margins in the years ahead. With Intel making a significant push into self-driving vehicle technology, the company now has the products to offer automakers a larger and more complete package of components, which could help seal future contracts. The future of the automotive industry is autonomous vehicles, and it's going to be a lucrative market in a couple of decades -- Intel is just the latest tech company to spend billions carving out its spot in the coming automotive evolution, but it certainly won't be the last.

Mobileye Computer processing giant Intel has outlined its intention to expand into the driverless cars market with the acquisition of Israeli technology business Mobileye.14 Mar 2017 M&A Corporate TMT Diversified industrial Advanced Manufacturing & Technology Europe Asia Pacific Intel announced that it had agreed a $15.3 billion deal to buy Mobileye on Monday in an acquisition which will see Intel's automated driving division integrated into Mobileye. Mobileye develops technology that helps advanced driver assistance systems to 'see'. Intel said the combination of Mobileye's technology and expertise with its business has the potential to "deliver driving solutions that will transform the automotive industry", including "advanced driving assist, highly autonomous and fully autonomous driving programs". "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. "The combination of Intel’s high performance computing and connectivity solutions with Mobileye’s best in class computer vision technology will put us in a position to accelerate innovation for car-makers and lead in delivering the technology foundation for highly and fully autonomous driving." Krzanich said growth in driverless cars will spur the generation of mass volumes of data. "Our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every technology and every industry," he said. "At four terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3,000 people. Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population. This massive amount of data requires all of Intel’s assets to provide the cost-effective high-performance solutions our customers need. The addition of Mobileye to our family provides the data path to our computing solutions becoming the intelligent set of eyes that will allow a vehicle to see and define the world around it." Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive of Mobileye, said that the company expects to see "transformative" growth in the driverless cars market. “[Autonomous driving] will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers," Aviram said. "By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centres and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry." The deal is subject to approval from regulators and is expected to be closed "within the next nine months", Intel said. Intel is not the first major technology company to look to move into the connected and driverless cars market. Google and Apple are both developing autonomous vehicles, while last November Samsung Electronics announced that it had agreed to buy in-vehicle technology supplier Harman International Industries in an $8 billion deal. Car manufacturers have also taken steps to strengthen their propositions in the market. BMW, Daimler and Audi group together acquired Nokia's Nokia Here mapping unit, and BMW also has a joint venture with SGL Group which is aimed at enabling the car manufacturer to utilise carbon technologies in electric vehicles.

Adar 19, 5777, 3/17/2017   MainAll NewsTechnology & HealthMobileye CEO: We will be an example to the world Mobileye CEO: We will be an example to the world Company bought by Intel for $15 billion pledges to reduce fatal car accidents with revolutionary self-driving technology. Contact Editor Gary Wllig, 14/03/17 18:31 Using Mobileye Moshe Shai/FLASH90 One day after US computer chip giant Intel agreed to buy Israeli car technology firm Mobileye in a deal worth more than $15 billion, Mobileye CEO Ziv Aviram met with Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, Yediot Ahronot reported. "When we established Mobileye, we had an absurd little dream, to fight against the traffic accidents which claim the lives of a million and a half people each year," Aviram said during his meeting with Katz. Now that Mobileye is part of "the giant machine of Intel, we will establish the largest center for autonomous cars right here in Israel. We will be an example to the world. We are very excited about the transaction and it is very important for us. I would like to thank the media for their positive coverage and well-wishes [for us]." Yaniv Garty, the General Manager of Intel Israel, said: "All of Intel's global operations in this field will be managed from Israel. This is a vote of confidence both in the company and in Israeli regulations. It will take more time to close the deal." Mobileye is the world leader in autonomous car technology. Last year, car company BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Mobileye, which also develops systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Mar 15, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Intel to buy Mobileye, move into autonomous cars AP, DETROIT, Michigan Intel is to buy Israel’s Mobileye in a deal valued at about US$15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The deal, announced on Monday, combines Mobileye’s market-leading software — which processes information from cameras and other sensors — with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, would allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all of them use Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Intel’s involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way people travel, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” Carone said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place, Krzanich said. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye chairman and cofounder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp is to pay US$63.54 for each share of Mobileye NV, a 34 percent premium on its closing price on Friday. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at US$15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he said. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships last year. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a US$300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co invested US$500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2171 times. Comments will be moderated.

Intel has agreed to buy the Israeli company for $15.3 (14.3 billion euros) which could give it a dominant role in the autonomous-driving sector. It is the biggest technology takeover in Israel’s history and the largest purchase of a company solely focused on self-driving. The price represents a premium of around 33 percent to the Friday closing price of Mobileye’s shares. Intel to Acquire Mobileye: https://t.co/od1jaLXi3L pic.twitter.com/ARTTcdDCQ7— Intel Official News (@intelnews) March 13, 2017 Intel is known for hardware chips and Mobileye for collision detection software. Speaking about the deal to unite Intel’s processors with Mobileye’s computer vision, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich likened it to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car”. He called it “a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” adding: “Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving.” #Intel buys #Mobileye in $15.3B deal, moves its automotive unit to Israel https://t.co/G52gnBodLM— KMH (@Korey_Michael) March 13, 2017 Ziv Aviram, Mobileye’s chief executive, said: “When you look at the combined assets of both companies, you see that they are really complimentary to each other.” Analyst reaction “It’s an area where the company (Intel) has had very little presence – the automotive market, and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets who has a “buy” rating on Intel shares. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical … The price seems fair,” she added. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. Not a science-fiction dream Carmakers and their suppliers have been expanding alliances in the race to develop self-driving cars, a sector that once seemed a science-fiction dream but is drawing closer to reality month after month. Mobileye and Intel are already working together with German carmaker BMW on putting a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road later this year. Intel moves into automated driving with $15 billion acquisition of machine vision leader Mobileye https://t.co/CIUjaAajE1 pic.twitter.com/71DcERZF55— Forbes (@Forbes) March 13, 2017 The merger promises to create the most complete portfolio of technologies needed for driverless vehicles, including cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning and cloud software, as well as the data-centres needed to manage all the data involved. Latest deal Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads into the market for autonomous driving components, including Intel, Mobileye and rival Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Intel Corp. ( NASDAQ: INTC – Free Report ), Mobileye NV ( NYSE: MBLY – Free Report ), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA – Free Report ), General Motors (NYSE: GM – Free Report ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ”Buy” stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: Are More Driverless Car Deals in the Future? On Monday, semiconductor chip maker Intel Corp. ( NASDAQ: INTC – Free Report ) announced a huge move in the self-driving car race, buying Israeli firm  Mobileye NV ( NYSE: MBLY – Free Report ) for a reported $15.3 billion. The deal values Mobileye at about $63.54 per share, which is a 34% premium to its closing price last Friday. MBLY stock skyrocketed around 30% to $61.35 per share in morning trading on Monday, while shares of INTC were down about 2% to $35.22 per share. Intel plans on integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s renowned operations, and the combined entity will be run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua. The deal will combine Intel’s processors with Mobileye’s renowned computer vision, making it the biggest purchase of a company that’s solely focused on the self-driving market. Not only is this acquisition a huge deal for Intel, but it’s also an endorsement of both the Israeli tech scene as well as the entire self-driving vehicle industry as a whole. Big-name automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA – Free Report ), General Motors (NYSE: GM – Free Report ), among many others, are racing to get a self-driving car model on the road, while tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL – Free Report ) and Uber sprinting just as fast to perfect the technology behind the cars. Last year, GM spent $1 billion to speed up its self-driving program with the acquisition of Cruise Automation, while Uber recently bought self-driving truck maker Otto for $680 million last August. These two transactions are just the tip of the iceberg, and with 2020 fast approaching, we should expect even more deals from the biggest players in the driverless car market If the necessary regulations are in place, 2020 is the year every company, tech and automaker, in the race plans to have a working self-driving car-or fleet-on the road. Intel and Mobileye already have previous ties, having partnered with German automaker BMW AG to test about 40 self-driving cars on the road. It will be interesting to see which automaker will be lucky enough to be able to utilize the new entity’s technology. The deal will add to Intel’s adjusted per share earnings, and is expected to close in the next nine months. 5 Trades Could Profit „Big-League” from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington’s changing course.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News Why Intel Needed To Own Mobileye – Even If It Overpaid Shutterstock photo Painfully, Intel (INTC) has little to no presence in mobile devices, save for a few modem chips here and there. Most everything on mobile devices is ARM-based due to its lower power consumption and cheaper costs. Intel and its -x86 platform simply cannot compete on price or power performance. Having realized this, Intel has decided to do what any company in its position should do — try and buy its way into the future, acquiring Mobileye (MBLY) for $15.3 billion. No Matter the Cost The acquisition, which is being billed as helping Intel turn into a data company (whatever that means), isn’t likely to move the financial needle for Intel anytime soon.  Mobileye generated just $240.6 million in revenue in fiscal 2016. By comparison, Intel’s full year revenue was $59.4 BILLION and its Data Center Group (which Intel is saying Mobileye will fit into) had $17.2 billion in sales. The Israeli-based Mobileye generated $108.4 million in GAAP net income in 2016, making the deal worth 141 times net income. That isn’t exactly cheap, even if Mobileye is growing revenues at 46% year over year. This deal is about the future of the car, one that will generate more data (thus needing more computing power) than at any time in history. Intel said cars could generate as much as four terabytes of data per day, so it’s important cars have the computing power to understand and make sense of all that data. Mobileye is best known for its role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), having worked with companies like Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), BMW (in conjunction with Intel) and others to bring self-driving cars to the forefront. (In 2017, another 6 OEMs will come online using Mobileye’s chips, according to Jefferies analyst David Kelley.) Limited Impact This deal isn’t likely to hurt Nvidia (NVDA), which makes GPUs for self-driving cars or Qualcomm (QCOM) or NXP (NXPI), which also makes chipsets for cars. Chips for ADAS systems and the cameras that go into them is a much smaller market than being the brains of a self-driving car platform. However, it’s clear that Intel needed to do something to get into this space, or risk losing out like it did with mobile devices. There is still the risk that car manufacturers will cut Mobileye’s units out of its cars (as happened with Tesla), but with Intel’s muscle behind it, that seems less likely to happen. Mobileye has deals with a number of auto manufacturers, including Volkswagen and BMW, enough to get its EyeQ chips into 16 million cars by the end of 2016.  Ultimately, this is a deal Intel had to do. It missed out on buying Nvidia when it should have, as it was too focused on the Altera acquisition. It can’t buy AMD (AMD) because of the implications for the PC market and -x86 chips. The PC market has had little to no growth for quite some time now, leading PC chip makers to wonder what’s next. Intel’s latest acquisition of automotive chip maker Mobileye shows that under Brian Krzanich, Intel is focusing on the future — no matter what it costs.

It will be the largest takeover of an Israeli tech firm and follows a series of deals and partnerships inked in recent years by major tech and auto companies. “The deal proves in a dramatic manner that our vision is coming true. Israel is becoming a global technology center, not only in cyber, but also in the automotive area,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a text message. Israel had already singled out the automotive technology sector as a possible economic boon, allotting it 250 million shekels ($68 million) for the next five years. At least five major car manufacturers have made investments in Israel. Ford Motor Co. bought computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS AC in August and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG invested in transit app Moovit in 2015. Daimler AG and General Motors Co. have also opened research and development centers in the country. The Mobileye deal went far beyond the $4.7 billion sale of fiber-optic company Chromatis Networks Inc. to Lucent Technologies Inc. in 2000, which was the country’s biggest tech deal before Mobileye. Founders Ziv Aviram, who is also the Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman Amnon Shashua, will share just under $1 billion from the sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Dec. 31. Shmuel Harlap, the largest shareholder, will make $1 billion, according to Bloomberg data as of April 1, 2016. Netanyahu’s Director General Eli Groner said the autonomous tech sector could potentially boost economic growth by 50 percent. Fast Track Israel is not renowned for its car-making industry, once turning out fiberglass-shelled cars that were briefly popular in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s. However, the country is now benefiting from the automobile industry’s increasing focus on software rather than hardware. In Israel, the automotive technology sector currently counts about 350 startups, according to industry monitor IVC Research Center, with the potential, according to Gruner, to grow bigger than the cybersecurity industry, which drew 15 percent of global capital raised by the sector in 2016, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a group that promotes Israel startups. Argus Cyber Security, based in Tel Aviv, in January announced a partnership with Qualcomm Technologies to protect cars from hackers. Otonomo Technologies Inc., a data platform that tells users when to stop driving due to a malfunction and can call emergency services when there is an accident, is working with nine car manufacturers, including Daimler. Aquarius Engines, which has designed and developed an engine to generate electric power, is working with Peugeot SA and three other automobile companies. Gal Fridman, chairman and chief marketing officer of Aquarius Engines, said the deal “definitely makes our lives easier.” “It validates Israel’s ability in technology in the automotive industry, traditionally American and German and not at all Israeli,” Fridman said. “Mobileye has dramatically helped us open the door wider into this industry.” Growing Pains Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The autonomous sector is expanding even as Israel’s tech sector suffers from growing pains. Although the country’s tech industry grew faster than gross domestic product nearly every year between 1998 to 2009, in the five years following it surpassed national growth only once, in 2012. The Finance Ministry acknowledged in a report last year that the industry that fueled Israel’s economy for the past two decades was stagnating. Mobileye has also had its issues. Last year, Elon Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla Inc. stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the breakup. After the Mobileye acquisition was announced, Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who have been reducing corporate taxes, announced they would consider further cuts.  “We view this deal as an indication that the more attractive Israel is for foreign investors, the more tax revenue we will generate,” Groner said in a phone interview. Tax breaks are already part of the government’s program to encourage global technology companies to do more research and development in Israel as other countries vie for companies like Intel to put down roots on their soil. “The deal will increase the attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups,” said Jon Medved, founder of OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform based in Jerusalem.

(LULU) Stock After Earnings Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Tesla Inc (TSLA) GameStop Corp. (GME) Stock Is the Next Blockbuster — Time to Sell View All Posts When I last checked in on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) back in late February, the company was on the verge of lifting the embargo period for reviews on its much-hyped new CPU. Ryzen was supposed to be an Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) killer, both in terms of price and performance. Considering the pre-release hype, the end of the embargo period appeared to be a solid opportunity for bullish AMD options traders. The reality was a bit different. Click to Enlarge AMD stock plunged in the following week, as nearly every major PC and review publication essentially said that while Ryzen was impressive for its price point, the new CPU failed to live up to the extreme hype currently in the market. Furthermore, in a rare move, Intel quickly cut prices on its competing i7 processors to mitigate the damage from AMD’s new price war. As the analysts reservations piled onto the mounting PC reviews, AMD stock eventually hit a low of $12.38 on March 6. Unfortunately, barring a major development this week, the March $15/$16 bull call spread I talked about on Feb. 27 isn’t going anywhere. But the AMD stock price appears to have once again found its feet, and the shares are poised to trade north of $14 once again today, making the March $12.50 put sell a winner (well, as long as the shares don’t plunge again this week). Which begs the question, is AMD once again a potential bullish options play? The sentiment backdrop certainly seems to suggest so. Yes, AMD had a bad review week when compared with pre-Ryzen release hype, but the CPU is still a major competitor in the market — enough so that Intel was forced to cut prices. What’s more, despite a few vocal reviews last week, analysts remain largely in wait-and-see mode. According to Thomson/First Call, 11 of the 26 analysts following AMD stock still rate the shares a “buy” or better — the same configuration as before Ryzen was released. Additionally, the average 12-month consensus price target has risen from $11.79 on Feb. 27 to its current perch at $11.92. It’s a small bump, but still a bullish one, and there is plenty of room for improvement$13.91 on Friday. Furthermore, there is still a very real threat of a short-squeeze situation for AMD stock. As of the most recent reporting period, roughly 104,000 shares of AMD stock were sold short, representing more than 13% of the stock’s total float. If the shares can bounce back from their post-review selloff, it could create enough doubt for these short sellers to begin buying back their positions. Finally, AMD options traders remain firmly bullish on the shares. At last check, the April put/call open interest ratio rested at 0.57, with calls nearly doubling puts among short-term options. Once again, more than a few of these calls could be hedges for short positions, but the outlook remains bullish for AMD stock. Checking in on implieds, April options traders are pricing in a move of about 16% for AMD stock, placing the upper bound at $16.24 and the lower bound at $11.76.

This tale, however, is a blockbuster, and Intel’s $15-billion acquisition will entrench Israel as a leader in the highly competitive autonomous car industry. The acquisition announced Monday — at a price that represented 35 percent premium to the market value of Mobileye — represents the biggest ever for a tech company in Israel; it is the largest deal to date involving semi-autonomous and autonomous driving technology. The creation of a joint enterprise in Jerusalem will spawn additional entrepreneurs in the field and create a go-to country for investors who will be seeking to find the next blockbuster, according to analysts and industry players. Mobileye was founded in 1999 by Prof. Amnon Shashua, a professor in computer science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an expert in computer learning and machine vision; and Ziv Aviram, a businessman with a knack of turning companies around from loss to profit, and restructuring organizations. The two aimed to use technology to increase road safety by helping avoid collisions, as opposed to mitigating the severity of collision-related injuries on which the auto industry was focused at the time. The technology the two developed — a single-lens camera with a chip — was inspired by human vision, which uses just one eye for depth perception such as shading, texture and motion. This camera became the primary sensor that is used in their array of products that help drivers avoid collisions and also in future-enable autonomous driving. The “Mobileye” mounted on a car windshield, May 27, 2015. (Shai/FLASH90) Mobileye systems, which combine the use of the camera with chips, algorithms and electronic circuits, can alert drivers of potentially dangerous situations, such as when a car leaves its lane, or when a collision may be imminent. It also can identify such collisions by breaking without any driver intervention; adapting cruise control and enabling other automated features such as assisting the driver to keep in his lane; and navigating traffic jams. It is these latter technologies that can make up the building blocks of the semi-autonomous or fully autonomous driving that companies are in a frenzied race to achieve. The Intel and Mobileye deal continues a trend of blockbuster merger and acquisition deals, as incumbents look to acquire semi-autonomous and autonomous driving capabilities, said Kerry Wu, a senior mobility analyst at CB Insights, a New York-based data firm. Automakers from GM to Toyota and Volkswagen have been acquiring start-ups and taking stakes in technologies in an effort to stay at the cutting edge of developments. GM bought Cruise Automation, a San Francisco-based developer of autonomous vehicle technology in 2016. And Ford invested in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company in February. Auto-tech start-up financing topped $1 billion in 2016 with sector financing reaching a “frenzied pace,” according to CB Insights. “All of these buyers, Intel included, are hoping to position themselves as next-generation automotive suppliers of silicon, vehicle electronics, and other automotive technologies,” said Wu. A car drives past the offices of Israeli car tech firm Mobileye in Jerusalem on March 13, 2017. (AFP/Thomas Coex) Mobileye’s advantage over competitors in the field is that its founders early on realized the potential of the new market and created a focused technology that managed to penetrate the difficult market. “They identified a huge market opportunity: that of using computer vision and applying it to assisted driving,” said Elan Zivotofsky, a general partner and head of investments at the Jerusalem-based VC fund OurCrowd. “They did this long before there was even talk of autonomous driving vehicles. So they identified the market and developed deep, core technology for that market. They didn’t build cars, but created a core technology that was critical — and is becoming even more critical — to the industry.” Mobileye’s one-camera technology “is cheaper and allows a quick and easy installation of the camera, which simplifies the process,” said Aner Ravon, cofounder and chief product officer at Zirra, a market and company analysis firm based in Tel Aviv. “The technology is also simple to understand and use, and that is what caused so many car manufacturers to integrate it into their cars.” Some 15.7 million vehicles worldwide have Mobileye’s camera installed and its technology is available with 21 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), according to data provided by Mobileye. Amnon Shashua, CTO, co-founder and chairman of Mobileye. May 27, 2015. (Moshe Shai/FLASH90) “Mobileye was created in Israel because it is a prime example of a company that incorporates multidisciplinary fields, which is what Israel is good at: integrations,” said Eden Shochat, a partner at Aleph VC, a venture capital fund. “You can be a really good software engineer and a really good hardware engineer, but only in Israel will you find people that can do both and work easily and well in teams together that get along. That kind of ability stems directly from the tech teams that work in the Israeli army. Israel also has a way of thinking: get things done, and combine multiple talents to do this.” Mobileye’s systems combine computer vision and machine learning and semiconductor knowledge and complex software development — all of them are areas in which Israel is known to excel, said OurCrowd’s Zivotofsky. “The Israeli ecosystem is good at developing deep core technologies that are challenging to reach and require a multidisciplinary know-how and engineering,” he continued. “The key is then applying that technology to a large market opportunity.” What the founders also did right was to focus on building a very large scalable company, Zivotofsky said, and they stayed focused on their market. “They focused their technology on a very large market opportunity, and did not get distracted by other areas or other applications for their technology.” The company received an investment of $130 million from Goldman Sachs in 2007 and listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, with the IPO still the largest VC-backed auto-tech exit to date. Mobileye’s revenue in 2016 totaled $358 million, up from $241 million a year earlier. Profits rose to $108 million from $68 million. The acquisition follows a partnership that Mobileye, Intel and BMW struck up in July last year, in the field of autonomous cars. And in January of this year, the companies forecast that a fleet of about 40 autonomous BMW cars would be on the roads by the second half of 2017. Intel’s aggressive positioning in the automotive industry stems from its need to find a new growth engine. Its PC and data center, still the largest source of revenues for the US giant, are witnessing a decline in growth. Last April, Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich laid out the company’s new strategy of transforming Intel from a PC company to one that powers the cloud as well as billions of smart, connected computing devices. “After missing out somewhat on the mobile-device era, Intel is aggressively pursuing new avenues of growth in emerging sectors, such as the Internet of Things and the automotive space,” said CB Insights’ Wu. “The company has clearly recognized that it has been slower to capitalize on auto-tech trends in connected cars, computer vision, and autonomous driving — the latter especially when compared to other semiconductor players like Nvidia.” Nvidia Corp. is a Santa-Clara based firm that develops chips for the mobile computing and automotive market. Late last November, Intel established its Autonomous Driving Group (ADG), solely dedicated to self-driving efforts; and it also announced that it would invest $250 million in autonomous driving start-ups through its Intel Capital arm. Ziv Aviram, president and CEO of Mobileye, speaks at a conference at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Jerusalem, November 23, 2016. (Miriam Alster/Flash90) “Intel is looking for something big, beyond the chips it makes for personal computers, which are not a growth market for Intel anymore. They were desperately looking for something,” said Zirra’s Ravon. “The autonomous car industry is one of the most relevant for Intel, which will allow it to grow a huge market in the field.” The acquisition will combine the best-in-class technologies from both companies, spanning connectivity, computer vision, data center, sensor fusion, high-performance computing, localization and mapping, machine learning and artificial intelligence, according to Intel. The acquisition of Mobileye will accelerate the future of autonomous driving, Krzanich said on Monday. “Together, we can improve performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” The joint company will be able to leverage Mobileye’s computer vision expertise with Intel’s high-performance computing and connectivity prowess, the companies said. They “fit like a glove and complement each other, each one bringing its own capabilities to the game,” said Ravon. “Intel can build around Mobileye a whole ecosystem for autonomous car technology. Sometimes the terms of the deal are such that you just can’t say no. The premium price offered and the value package Intel can offer with regard to enabling Mobileye to attain the dream of self-driving cars was, by enabling the investment of huge amounts of money, just too good to be passed over.” By pooling their infrastructure and resources, the companies expect to enhance and accelerate their combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms, they said. “Never before has an Israeli company been acquired by a foreign giant in which the Israeli technology will be playing such a significant part of its future strategy,” said Zirra’s Ravon. “This is a super strategic acquisition of which Israel can be proud.” The deal is good for both sides, said Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of BlueStar Indexes. “Mobileye could have continued on the path it was on, but would have faced steadily increasing competition from Nvidia, Google, and others. Being part of Intel — with the Mobileye management running Intel’s global autonomous driving business from Jerusalem — gives them scale and resources that they couldn’t have achieved on their own.” This acquisition is not a “sellout,” said Schoenfeld, but proof that Israeli companies can scale up to a $10 billion-$15 billion valuation, “where they have substantial control of their destiny.” There are challenges ahead, however, especially from companies like Google that are developing disruptive technologies in the field. “Mobileye dominates the present-day playing field where Google is taking a very ambitious approach to reshaping it,” said Ravon. “The challenge is to stay ahead of other disruptive technologies. Whereas Intel and Mobileye represent the evolution of the car industry — their systems are installed in the current car industry, working with current production lines, and work within the cars — Google is choosing a completely different model in which it is creating an operating system for the self-driving car from start to finish. It is a technological battle between evolution and revolution.” The US firm will support Mobileye’s production programs and build up its relationships with car suppliers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Intel said. The combined organization will be headquartered in Israel and led by Shashua — Mobileye’s cofounder, chairman and chief technology officer — the two companies announced Monday. The fact that the joint activities will be based in Israel is further testament to how much Intel believes in Mobileye’s capacities. This step will also help to create a critical mass for the fostering of a new generation of talent. “The broader impact of the deal, beyond the taxes Israel will be getting, is the ability of this new Mobileye/Intel center of excellence to create a local critical mass of knowledge and people who will then go on and create their own machine learning and vision companies,” said Aleph’s Shochat. The acquisition is also testament to the fact that Israel is able to “foster the growth of large companies that compete successfully on a global scale,” Zivotofsky said. “Investors will be even more convinced that Israel is the go-to place in their quest for the next Mobileye. Public market investors that bought Mobileye shares have made nice returns and will be part of the next tech Israeli company too. That is the best way to foster increased investment in Israeli companies.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Amnon Shashua, co-founder and chairman of Mobileye arrives to a Mobileye and Intel Workers Conference in Jerusalem, March 14, 2017.

The Blizzard Edition Of The Samadhi Tech Update (Seeking Alpha) Related MBLY From Mobileye Purchase To 5G Modems, Intel's Investments Could Hurt Chances Of Positive Returns Big Winner Of Intel-Mobileye Deal: Blackberry? The Vetr community has upgraded $MBLY to 2-Stars. (Vetr) Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital says Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)’s deal to buy Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) is a critical step in the transformation of the chip maker beyond being just a PC company. Intel agreed to buy Israel-based Mobileye for about $15.3 billion, as part of its move to expand in the fast-growing market for fully autonomous vehicles. Van Hees, who reiterated Buy rating and $42 price target on Intel, noted that the deal puts Intel in a leading position in an end market that is more predictable and steady with considerable long-term growth opportunities. “We weren't surprised by the pending acquisition given INTC’s already strong partnership with MBLY and view it as a considerable positive as this leap frogs INTC’s position within the nascent autonomous car market and opens INTC up to $70B system, data, and services TAM by 2030,” Van Hees wrote in a note. From the deal, Intel gets a strong base business with deep design-win pipeline and enhanced MSS and revenue opportunities through superior AD platforms. Intel also sees considerable recurring revenue streams in mapping and data services and expects to achieve cost synergies rising to $175 million per year by 2019. Lessons Learned From Past The combined global autonomous driving organization, which will consist of Mobileye and Intel's Automated Driving Group, will be headquartered in Israel and led by Prof. Amnon Shashua, Mobileye's Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO. Van Hees says Intel might have learned some lessons from the unsuccessful track record with its prior acquisitions and may have opted for the reverse integration. Shares of Intel closed Monday at $35.16, while Mobileye ended at $60.62.

The US chipmaker will pay $15.3bn (£12.5bn) for the Israeli company, which develops autonomous driving systems, as it looks to move into a market it believes could be worth as much as $70bn by 2030. Explaining the deal, Intel said that as cars "progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels". According to the BBC, the company believes that by 2020, "driverless cars will generate 4,000GB, or four terabytes, of data a day that can be mined for information". Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, says: "It's an area where [Intel] has had very little presence - the automotive market - and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said. Earlier this month, Nissan tested its self-driving electric Leaf car, which it hopes to make available by 2020. Google and Uber have also extensively tested driverless cars and Apple is reported to be running trials.

Twitter Facebook Why Intel put a smartphone chip in Tag Heuer's $1,600 smartwatch Smartphone chips can extend the life of smartwatches, so they won't need to be replaced every few years Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 14 March, 2017 22:15 - - - - print email Comments Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It's not clear yet, but Intel's powerful chip in the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,600 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn't outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel's Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable's shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch's heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches -- like the one made by Tag Heuer -- have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel's thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. Tag Heuer is stressing the "Swiss made" aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won't pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn't a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

The deal may have been inspired by QualComm’s decision last fall to purchase chip maker NXT for $47 billion. NXP is the largest maker of computer chips for the automotive industry. Computers and cars are in convergence mode and no one wants to get left behind. The MobilEye transaction is expected to close in 9 months time. MobilEye was deeply involved with the development of the original Autopilot system for the Tesla  Model S that debuted in October, 2015. But when Joshua Brown was killed on a Florida highway 8 months later while his car was operating in Autopilot mode, the relationship quickly fell apart with both companies pointing accusatory fingers at each other. That setback has not kept MobilEye from controlling 70% of the market for autonomous driving systems, however. MobilEye is currently working closely with Delphi, one of the largest Tier One automotive suppliers. It is also cooperating with BMW on autonomous driving technology. The Bavarian automaker plans to have 40 self driving test cars on the road using MobilEye components later this year. Until recently, MobilEye has relied on chips manufactured by European chip maker STMicroelectronics but intends to use Intel’s fifth generation chips in the autonomous driving system it is developing for BMW. In a joint press release, the two companies say the deal is expected to “bring together Mobileye’s leading computer vision expertise with Intel’s high performance computing and connectivity expertise to create automated driving solutions from cloud to car.” “This acquisition will combine the best-in-class technologies from both companies, spanning connectivity, computer vision, data center, sensor fusion, high-performance computing, localization and mapping, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Together with partners and customers, Intel and Mobileye expect to deliver driving solutions that will transform the automotive industry.” The automotive industry is seeing a lot of transformation these days as companies race to get self driving cars on the road. The only question is, who will buy them? Building autonomous cars with internal combustion engines is just flat out stupid. Only electric cars lend themselves to the self driving revolution. Yet mainstream car makers are reluctant to build many electric cars and largely refuse to pay for the infrastructure needed to help them appeal to mainstream car buyers. The answer seems to be that the car companies themselves intend to own and operate fleets of self driving cars. Some business models suggest there is more money to be made from doing that than actually selling cars direct to consumers. We may actually be watching the beginning of the end of the private automobile. Tomorrow’s cars will be as much computers on wheels as transportation devices. Intel thinks self driving cars will generate 4 terabytes of data every day by the year 2020 and it expects its chips to play a major role in collecting, disseminating, and processing all that digital information.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Tag Heuer Modular 45 Smartwatch Takes Modularity To A New Level Posted: Mar 14 2017, 1:41pm CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   Gallery 15 images   The first luxury connected watch with Swiss Made label. The Tag Heuer Modular 45 is designed, developed and assembled in Switzerland by TAG Heuer. Today, luxury Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer unveiled the second generation of its connected watch, with its partners Intel and Google. In Switzerland, the press conference we reported live from, was held near the highly symbolic Rütli Meadow in the heart of Switzerland, was led by Jean-Claude Biver, CEO of TAG Heuer & President of the LVMH Group Watch Division, accompanied by Josh Walden, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the New Technology Group at Intel, and David Singleton, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. Don't Miss: Find a NES Classic in stock online Jean-Claude Biver, TAG Heuer CEO & President of the LVMH Watch Division, said: "After the huge success of the first TAG Heuer Connected watch, today I am very proud to present the Connected Modular 45. This is a Swiss watch which embodies the luxury codes of tomorrow, and which not only enables you to connect to the future, but also to connect to eternity thanks to its simple and smart modular design. This innovative, unique and distinctive watch is at the forefront of the latest technologies available in Silicon Valley and, at the same time, a genuine Swiss watch, bearing the Swiss Made label. It is the incarnation of our leading position with luxury connected watch and with this high level of technology.” “Engineering the next wave of smart and connected devices with iconic partners is a core strategy for Intel,” said Josh Walden, Senior Vice President and General Manager, New Technology Group, Intel. “We are thrilled to continue our strong collaboration with TAG Heuer. With innovative design and technology, the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 redefines the capabilities of a luxury smartwatch.”  “The first generation of the TAG Heuer Connected pushed the boundary of what is possible when you combine traditional watchmaking and cutting-edge technology,” said David Singleton, Vice President of Android Engineering at Google. “We’re excited to work with TAG Heuer again to create a new powerful connected watch that demonstrates the ongoing innovation of TAG Heuer’s craftsmanship and the Android Wear platform." Why choose Brunnen with the view on the Rütli, in the heart of Switzerland as the symbolic place in which to launch the watch?  Rütli in German means "Little meadow". It is Switzerland's founding legend and considered a national monument. Back in 1291, it was in this clearing, just above Lake Lucerne, that the representatives of the primitive cantons took the oath of Rütli to seal their alliance. Over time, the Rütli meadow has become a "national shrine". Here, on the 1st August every year, Switzerland celebrates an official national holiday. It was this deep-rooted connection to true Swiss values that Jean-Claude Biver wanted to highlight by gathering his partners from Silicon Valley and the world press here. What is the essence of the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 watch? The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 has been designed and engineered in the pure Swiss watchmaking tradition. It is a luxury Swiss watch which benefits from over 150 years of Swiss expertise, savoir-faire and heritage as cultivated by TAG Heuer, a watchmaker based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, the cradle of Swiss watchmaking (and a UNESCO World Heritage site). For more than 150 years, TAG Heuer has been inventing and manufacturing elegant sports watches here, including some of the most accurate chronographs produced by the Swiss watchmaking industry. Why the Modular 45 is Swiss Made Just like the brand's famous mechanical chronographs, the Connected Modular 45 has been designed, developed, and assembled in the TAG Heuer Manufacture, in La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland, in the same spirit and with the same high standards as a luxury product with Swiss Made quality. The same techniques, the same meticulous finish, the same attention to the minutest detail, the same exacting standards. This Swiss rigour and accuracy, this watchmaking expertise has earned it the "Swiss Made" label, the guarantee of the highest standards of Swiss quality. The original concept of modularity: only a luxury and avant-garde watchmaker could offer this. Above all, the connected watch is a Carrera Model. It fits in this famous TAG Heuer collection, the perfect representation of avant-garde, Art of Manufacture and accessible luxury. Measuring an elegant 45 mm in diameter, the design of the TAG Heuer Connected Modular is primarily that of a genuine watch whose lugs, strap, buckle and, in particular, case - its central module - are interchangeable elements. Made from satin or polished grade 5 titanium, or plated with 18K 5N rose gold, or in black ceramic, with or without diamonds: after choosing a watch from the 56 different versions available from its launch (a selection of 11 standard models are systematically offered in store + 45 others on request), the entire exterior of the watch can be customized. This customization will enable a multitude of combinations in terms of materials and colors. For the choice of strap alone, there are no fewer than 18 references available, made from rubber, natural leather or anthracite grey leather, titanium or ceramic.  You can complete your connected module by purchasing a Swiss mechanical movement module such as a 3 hands calibre 5, or the most prestigious of Grande Complication timepieces, the ultimate expression of the watchmaker's art – the tourbillon. But not just any tourbillon. The manufacture chronograph Tourbillon Heuer 02-T, with a titanium and carbon case, COSC certified. TAG Heuer is today the only manufacture in the world able to reach this level of production. In this way, you can very easily change the heart of your watch – the module – from a connected watch to a mechanical watch, and back again, to suit the occasion and your mood. Ultimately, this watch has all the elegance of a genuine timepiece, all the characteristics and the level of finish of a magnificent Swiss watch on your wrist.  The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 simplifies your life, thanks to our engineering collaboration with Intel. Incredibly practical, the built-in GPS enables you to track your journeys and sporting performance, with no need for your phone: all the information you need is right there on your wrist. All this technology can also be taken with you into water, thanks to its 50m water resistance. So you can swim, run, ski, explore, and live life to the full. The watch also makes your day-to-day life easier, saving you time, as you can make contactless payments using its NFC chip and the Android Pay app- means you can use your watch to pay directly at enabled points of sale.  Finally, screen uses OLED technology which offers incredible resolution and amazing colors, providing high contrast to stunning effect on the highly sophisticated watch dials – you won't believe your eyes! The modularity concept extends to the watch's software, with dial customization. The brand has developed 30 watch dials, all retaining TAG Heuer's identity, some of which are inspired by historical pieces such as the famous panda dial, drawing on the brand's great heritage. Colored white, black, light grey, anthracite grey, chocolate brown, navy blue or gold, with sunray finish, skeleton dial, 3 hands, GMT, a chronograph with 1, 2, or 3 counters, plus a date and day window, these dials are interchangeable with a single swipe of the finger.  The TAG Heuer Studio dial configurator also offers customers the chance to create their own dial, just like a watchmaker. In the blink of an eye, you can choose your standard dial with its functions, and customize all the colors, the look of the metals on the indices and hands, the details in SuperLuminova™ and the lacquered tips for the finishing touches!  With TAG Heuer Studio, you can coordinate your watch to match your business suit, your running gear or even your swimsuit. And if you fancy setting the wallpaper to show one of your own photos – perhaps a photo of a loved one, a beautiful sunset or a fond memory – you can give your creativity free rein, because anything is possible. Thanks to interactive counters, customers can choose to display up to three of their favorite apps on the dial: the number of steps taken, the number of calories burned, the dollar rate, free time before the next meeting... these are just some of the many options depending on your interests. Everything you need, at your fingertips.  A new TAG Heuer Connected app available on Android, with iOS support coming soon The new Companion app is designed to help you get started with your new watch and make the whole experience nice and easy. To take advantage of all the options available on these watches, Android users can download the new TAG Heuer Connected app to preview the various dials available and benefit from TAG Heuer Studio on a larger screen. You can also set your watch screen to show one of your own photos using this app. Coming soon TAG Heuer will soon be launching a brand new world exclusive time management experience: as modular as the watch faces, its unique watch display and companion app understand your plan for the day, and show you what you need to know about your meetings, tasks, calls, plans, travels and more. This isn’t about remembering to swing by for flowers at 6pm anymore – the new experience adapts to your schedule, and if you’re behind, it’ll still remind you when you’re on your way, even if that’s 15min later than originally planned. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is redefining time, for an experience that reflects the modern lifestyle. Stay connected and experience a watch that reflects what time means to you. TAG Heuer has worked closely with Intel and Google to create a luxury watch which combines connectivity and smart technology with Swiss watchmaking expertise. The watch is powered by an Intel Atom processor Z34XX series and operates on Android WearTM 2.0. Power meets technology, like in a modern GT car. TAG Heuer collaborated with Intel to engineer the smart technology behind the watch's superior performance and multitude of connectivity options including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and NFC, and which also enables users to benefit from a wide range of functions offered under the Android Wear operating system. The motherboard is produced in Switzerland.  The final assembly step and testing are completed in TAG Heuer’s own workshop in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Featuring 4 GB of storage memory and a latest-generation lithium battery providing more than a full day of power, the TAG Heuer Connected is fitted with a small water-resistant microphone enabling the wearer to communicate with it using Google Assistant, as well as a sapphire crystal touchscreen, to be used alongside the command crown at 3 o'clock. What if the phone is off? No problem: the watch will continue to compute, display and exchange information while you have a Wi-Fi connection and so remain in contact with the Cloud. Naturally, the applications installed on the watch (music, timer, alarm, pedometer, etc.) remain active even when no connection is available. Thanks to the very latest Android Wear 2.0 update, iPhone users can now benefit from the almost infinite universe of platforms with apps available for download directly on that watch, and an enhanced ecosystem. The watch can easily be synchronized with a mobile phone operating on Android 4.3+ or iOS 9+. It is recharged using a contact charger. Simply place the watch on top to recharge it. Warranties and prices for Modular 45 The connected and mechanical modules benefit from a two-year warranty. This period – longer than usually offered on a product of this type - meets the same high warranty standards which luxury Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer offers for its timepieces. All the accessories (strap, buckle, lugs, charger) are covered by a one-year warranty. The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 is on sale from 1690 CHF, 1650 USD (ex.VAT), 1600 Euros, 1400 GBP, 13,100 HKD, 175,000 JPY (ex.VAT), 2300 AUD, 7350 MYR, 2400 SGD. A Deluxe box set including a connected watch (in grade 5 titanium, with titanium lugs and brown natural leather strap), complete with the prestigious COSC-certified chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module, plus an additional black rubber strap is available for a total price of 17,900 CHF/16,650 Euros/17,000 USD (ex.VAT).  The set comes in a magnificent presentation case with three drawers, complete with a desktop display stand to hold the watch and its charger.

Mobileye makes technology that allows cars to sense the world around them, so its products already power autonomous systems in many vehicles. But it’s also developing: new AI approaches for self-driving cars, simulation systems that allow vehicles to learn in safety, and data-sharing platforms that automakers use to rapidly build high-definition maps. Taken together, those factors make it pivotal in the autonomous car sector, which, combined with chip-making chops, could capture Intel a chunk of the emerging market. Do you need The Download?

Just last week we reported that Civil Liberties advocates are more concerned than ever about the warrantless collection of Americans’ communications, and representatives of the British government have warned that widespread use of big data is putting public privacy at risk. So a glimmer of good news from Facebook, which has finally announced that data about its users must no longer be used by developers to produce systems that can provide surveillance capabilities. Your Doctor App Could Amplify Your Health Anxieties On-demand digital consultations with doctors are convenient, but they could prove problematic. Technology is changing medicine, and new apps that provide a short video consult with a doctor for a small upfront fee are helping people save time by avoiding a trip to the hospital. But the app makers are observing that they’re proving popular with people who suffer from health anxieties. That raises ethical concerns: in many settings, such people would be so-called super-users who drive revenue, but here it may be more appropriate to suggest that they seek mental help. Ten Fascinating Things   American teenagers are less likely to use drugs than previous generations. The New York Times suggests that smartphones and computers may fill the void. Spinning sails, which use a physical peculiarity to generate thrust via interactions with the wind, were invented a century ago. Now they're making a comeback. When the emotions of an artificial intelligence system become more human-like, you might expect human-robot relations to blossom. That may not be the case. Researchers can now neatly determine how mammalian DNA is folded up inside a cell, revealing how parts of a genome are made readily available for use. Using laser pulses to guide electrons through semiconductors in computer chips could help make clock speeds far, far faster. In the village of Bana, Burkina Faso, locals don’t have a word for “gene”—which is making it hard to prepare the community for a malaria battle using GM mosquitoes. In the hostile conditions of Chile’s Atacama Desert, NASA has been testing a new breed of do-it-all Mars rovers. Researchers have shown that they can use audio tones to control accelerometers and influence devices like smartphones and wearables. Whether or not you meant to commit a crime can have a huge impact on the legal repercussions of your actions. Brain scans may be able to tell the difference. Happy pi day! Celebrate with 22,459,157,718,361 digits of the number. Quote of the Day "SXSW is a lot like many other events now, where people pay money to fly in from all over the world to gather in one centralized location ... but in actuality are staring at their smartphones a good portion of the time." — Tech blogger Lauren Goode observes an uncomfortable truth of our connected world, which even extends to events where human contact is practically the entire point.

Significantly, this acquisition comes as the biggest one of an Israeli tech company, at $15.3 billion. The company noted that a subsidiary of Intel Corporation will start a tender offer; to acquire all issued and also the outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye, for $63.54 per share in cash. This represents an equity value of about $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. The chip giant expects that this deal with Mobileye will close in around nine months. Intel Acquires Mobileye Mobileye is a tech company covering a wide range of services; including front and rear facing camera tech, mapping, and sensor fusion, among others. Starting from 2018, it will also start crowdsourcing the data for high definition maps; along with driving policy intelligence. In the long run, Intel will gain benefits of having a bigger range of various pieces that are needed for autonomous driving systems; along with having more relationships with different automakers. Mobileye’s CTO and co-founder, Amnon Shashua has informed that the tech company is working with 27 car manufacturers currently; including 10 production programs with BMW, Audi, and others. Meanwhile, Intel’s CEO, Brain Krzanich, said that the acquisition is a great step for the automotive industry, their shareholders, and consumers. He said that Intel Corporation provides foundational technologies; that include deciding the car’s path and making the real-time driving decisions. Meanwhile, Mobileye creates the best automotive grade computer vision and has a strong momentum with suppliers and automakers. He further added that these two companies together can boost the future of autonomous driving; and improve performance in the cloud to car solutions, at lesser costs for automakers. Biggest Acquisition by Intel Intel has confirmed that its autonomous driving division will be based in Israel; and it will be lead by Mobileye’s co-founder and CTO, Amnon Shashua. Intel’s SVP, Doug Davis will be responsible for overseeing that how both the companies are working together and report to Amnon Shashua. Working at a higher end in the self-driving market and technology can be considered as Intel’s major strategy. This way it can position itself and increase its goodwill in the emerging areas of autonomous technology and computing. Intel is not the only company that is acquiring and investing in computer vision, and autonomous technology based start-ups. The Santa Clara company knows it has a tough competition, which is why it is buckling up to raise its game. As a concluding fact, it is interesting to know that this is probably the largest Israeli tech acquisition in history. Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye is almost fifteen times bigger than the acquisition of Waze by Google, for $1.1 billion. Eventually, Intel expects a major opportunity of approximately $70 billion in the data, vehicle systems, and services market; after this acquisition.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 14, 2017 at 8:45AM For years, there has been very little intersection between Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) core businesses and Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM). Intel's revenue today comes primarily from sales of personal-computer processors, processors for enterprise and cloud servers, and networking applications. Qualcomm, on the other hand, makes most of its profit from licensing wireless technologies and patents, and generates most of its revenue by selling chips that go into smartphones and, to a lesser extent, other mobile devices like tablets. Image source: Qualcomm. For years, it has been widely known that Qualcomm was working on processors designed to attack Intel's data-center dominance; first commercial shipments are expected to begin in the second half of 2017. And for years, Intel has been going on about trying to attack Qualcomm's wireless-chip business -- achieving its first real success last year when it captured cellular-modem share from Qualcomm in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7-series smartphones. In other words, these two chip giants are on a collision course. Let's look at what each side could lose, what each side stands to gain, and what this coming battle might mean for investors in either company. Intel deals its major -- but potentially only -- blow In the past, Intel had told investors that it expected to compete broadly across the mobile-processor market. Indeed, the company said it was developing a whole stack of chips, designed to span everything from low-end smartphones to what the company referred to as "hero devices." In addition to those chips, Intel had been pursuing stand-alone cellular-modem efforts for quite some time, though with little success until recently. Investors might be aware that Intel canceled its pipeline of mobile-processor products and substantially reduced its investment levels there. (Intel said at its most recent investor meeting that from 2015 to 2017, its spending in mobile will go down about 55%.) So, Intel is, by and large, neutralized as a threat to Qualcomm's mobile-processor business. However, the company won a large portion of the cellular-modem spots inside Apple's iPhone 7 series of smartphones, which led to a reasonable bump in revenue for Intel and a corresponding decrement to Qualcomm's revenues. Qualcomm sharpening its knives Though Intel's mobile efforts ultimately translated into Qualcomm losing some business at Apple, Qualcomm's ambitions are much more significant. Qualcomm announced that it will be working with software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to bring personal computers running Windows 10 on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors to market during the second half of 2017 -- directly attacking Intel's largest business. To make matters worse for Intel (and perhaps sweeten the deal for Qualcomm), Qualcomm seems committed to developing data-center processors for now. Significant share gains on Qualcomm's part (and corresponding share losses on Intel's part) -- should they occur -- aren't likely to happen overnight. However, Qualcomm's upcoming Centriq 2400 chips have already gotten Microsoft's blessing for its internal use, which lends credibility to the notion that major data-center customers may be willing -- and, frankly, eager -- to work with alternative suppliers rather than Intel. The upside and downside for each company For Intel, the only upside I see in this contest is its potential to gain some additional cellular-modem share from Qualcomm at Apple. The opportunity likely isn't that big from the standpoint of annual revenue, and that revenue would likely come at a much lower margin than Intel's corporate average. Right now, Intel's ability to hurt Qualcomm in its core wireless-chip business seems limited. The upside for Qualcomm, on the other hand, seems greater. It can take share from Intel in the latter company's core business of personal-computer chips, as well as its data-center business, starting from essentially zero share. Intel certainly has significant resources with which to defend itself, so it's probably not prudent for investors in either company to model in substantial market-share shifts to Qualcomm anytime soon. But, in terms of which company has more to gain and which has more to lose: The answers come up Qualcomm and Intel, respectively.

Sean Williams, Tim Brugger, and Brian Feroldi (TMFUltraLong) Mar 14, 2017 at 9:26AM The stock market has been in full rally mode since the November elections, but that doesn't mean a number of great stocks haven't been left behind. After some careful weeding, our Foolish contributors have come up with three great stocks that they believe are on sale and potentially ripe for the picking. Making the list were gold miner Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY), chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and entertainment technology company IMAX (NYSE:IMAX).  Image source: Getty Images. Make your portfolio shine with this stock  Sean Williams (Yamana Gold): Great stocks come in all shapes and sizes. One great company that looks to be on sale with a share price that's now well below $3 is gold miner Yamana Gold. Yamana was tripped up in February like most precious-metal mining companies after it reported its fourth-quarter earnings results. Though Yamana wound up generating $484.4 million in sales, a 10% increase from the prior-year period, and produced a $0.01 adjusted profit per share, a nice reversal of the $0.01 per share it lost in Q4 2015, this still wasn't good enough for Wall Street. The consensus had been for $489.9 million in revenue and $0.02 in adjusted EPS. Compounded with the potential for a Fed rate hike in March (higher interest rates are usually bad news for gold stocks since physical gold has no yield), Yamana shares took a pounding. However, this recent pain is your gain if you're looking for a great stock on sale. Yamana Gold has a laundry list of upcoming expansion opportunities that are going to dramatically increase its production, help lower its all-in sustaining costs (AISC), and crank up its cash flow over the next two or three years. Image source: Getty Images. In 2018, Yamana is expected to begin seeing commercial production from C1 Santa Luz and Cerro Moro. C1 Santa Luz is capable of 130,000 ounces of gold during its first year, with an average output of 114,000 over its first seven years, while Cerro Moro is anticipated to yield 130,000 ounces of gold annually. Also, the recently acquired Riacho dos Machados mine, which produces copper as well, is expected to nearly double its gold output to approximately 100,000 ounces annually by 2018. And finally, beginning in 2019 the Chapada mine in the Suruca development is expected to add between 45,000 and 60,000 ounces of gold for four of five years. In effect, Yamana's production is going to explode higher. In terms of cash flow, after producing $0.57 per share in 2016, Wall Street is forecasting $0.88 in cash flow per share by 2019. Considering that most gold and silver miners trade at roughly 10 times their future cash flow per share, Yamana appears completely undervalued at roughly three times its future cash flow per share. Yamana does have nearly $1.5 billion in net debt, which could certainly be weighing on its valuation, but with $600 million to $800 million annual in cash flow expected, it's perfectly manageable. Yamana Gold is on sale, and value investors should take notice. Patience is a virtue Tim Brugger (Intel): Though its stock price has slowly inched up the past year a solid, if not spectacular, 16%, Intel still can't seem to get investors to fully buy into its transformation. CEO Brian Krzanich is laser-focused on transitioning to a data center first provider, yet investors can't shake the notion that Intel is still reliant on PCs for growth. Since announcing record quarterly and annual revenue of $16.4 billion and $59.4 billion, respectively, to end 2016, Intel stock is actually down 5%. What? Image source: Intel. A surprisingly strong PC market helped Intel generate its record sales, but it was its data center, Internet of Things (IoT), and security revenue that put it over the top. Better still, each of those markets represents huge growth potential in the coming months and years. While its client computing segment posted a 2% annual increase in revenue to $32.9 billion, Intel's data center group jumped 8% year over year to $17.2 billion. When you add to that a 15% increase in IoT-related sales to $2.6 billion and 9% jump in security revenue to $2.2 billion, it's clear Intel's shift away from PCs is firing on all cylinders. Despite its recent successes, Intel stock is still an incredible bargain. At a mere 12 times forward earnings, Intel remains one of the best values in the tech sector. Toss in its 2.9% dividend yield and Intel isn't just a great stock on sale -- it's one of the top long-term growth and income alternatives around. Look beyond the headlines Brian Feroldi (IMAX): Profits in the movie industry are highly dependent on blockbuster hits, which is why I never place much emphasis on IMAX's results in any given year. Thankfully, the market doesn't always approach this stock with a similar long-term outlook, which occasionally affords investors an opportunity to buy this growth stock at an attractive price. I believe that's the situation that exists today, which is why IMAX's stock is a great bargain at the moment. Image source: Getty Images. 2016 proved to be a decent year for the movie industry, but the results looked quite tame when compared to 2015's. That caused IMAX to report full-year top-line growth of less than 1%, which is hardly worthy of an applause. However, the company actually had a blowout year if you look beyond the headlines. IMAX sold a record 319 new screens during the year, bringing its backlog up to 498. That provides investors with a lot of installation visibility over the next few years. What's more, the bulk of these installs features joint revenue-sharing agreements, where IMAX gets a cut of ticket sales. That should nicely add to IMAX's recurring revenue stream as these new screens come online. Another win for investors is that IMAX is taking on the potential threat of virtual reality head-on. The company announced a partnership with Alphabet to develop a next-generation VR camera. By experimenting now, it could possibly help to develop a new immersive experience that could only be obtained by visiting one of its theaters. That promises to keep ticket sales flowing even if VR takes off.  And yet, despite a growing backlog, the new partnerships with Alphabet, a deal extension with Disney,  and a slew of blockbuster titles waiting in the wings, shares are only trading for around 24 times forward earnings estimates. With the promise of double-digit profit growth over the next five years, I'd argue that 's a bargain. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

With its new purchase, Intel is hoping to break into the driverless auto systems industry. (Photo taken from Flickr) Intel’s driverless shakeup Reuters reports that Intel has agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday. The deal could thrust the American company into the competition to develop driverless systems for global automakers. Intel has been looking to reach beyond its core computer semiconductor business, and the move promises to escalate the already high stakes among self-driving start-ups. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for driverless car systems would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Chinese to pay Kushners $400 million The family of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is set to receive more than $400 million from a prominent Chinese company that is investing in the clan’s marquee Manhattan office tower. The planned $4 billion transaction includes terms that some real estate experts consider unusually favorable for the Kushners—including both a sizable cash payout from the Anbang Insurance Group and an equity stake in a new partnership, Bloomberg reported. It is unclear whether the deal could prompt federal review, as has occurred when Anbang bought other properties in the United States, including Manhattan’s famous Waldorf Astoria. Airbnb IPO? Don’t hold your breath Airbnb might have just closed a billion-dollar funding round, but CEO Brian Chesky is in no rush to take his company public, according to Fortune. Speaking on Monday at the New York Stock Exchange luncheon, Chesky insisted that while the company is working to ensure it is ready to go public, the IPO process can take two years. Investors would do well to take Chesky’s statement with a grain of salt though, as he made a similar remark in a 2015 interview. Say goodbye to easy money The Federal Reserve is set to raise interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, signaling another nail in the coffin of its era of easy money, according to the New York Times. Economists also expect that the Fed will signal two more increases will be in the cards before the end of the year, barring any major economic setbacks. It’s not just the policy that is striking investors. Over the past month, half a dozen senior Fed officials made public comments that suggested greater collective confidence and unanimity that the economy is strong enough to handle higher borrowing rates.   Get a quick snapshot of the day’s most newsworthy business stories in your mailbox each morning.

Playing the name game with Intel’s object recognition software Object recognition tools are key for things like self-driving cars and surveillance systems, and Intel’s SXSW demo shows us how it works. Leah Yamshon (PC World (US online)) on 14 March, 2017 23:00 0 - - - - print email Intel does a lot of the heavy lifting to power some of our most-used products, working silently behind the scenes to make things run. But South by Southwest is far from a subtle, behind-the-scenes kind of place—and Intel’s pop-up lounge was full of demos that showed off what the company is doing in the AI space. My favorite demo may not have been flashy, but it showed off a key component of machine learning: object recognition. I held up a series of photos showing a wide variety of stuff—animals, people, vehicles, household items, plants—and the software correctly named it all. It also told me how confident it was in its answer, and many objects were named with 100-percent accuracy. The demo was limited to just 20 objects, but the full scale of Intel’s platform can process many, many more. This tech is key to the development of self-driving cars, and Intel has partnered with other engineers in that space to get more autonomous cars on the road. And if you’re a developer, you can even tap into Intel’s Deep Learning SDK to bring object recognition to your apps. Check out the video above for more.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too!

Intel said Monday it is buying Mobileye in a $15 billion deal, the latest push by a major tech company into autonomous vehicles. DETROIT (AP) — Computer-chip-maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven't aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It's likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup "confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors" threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That's below Mobileye's record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV's stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel's autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel.

But South by Southwest is far from a subtle, behind-the-scenes kind of place—and Intel’s pop-up lounge was full of demos that showed off what the company is doing in the AI space. My favorite demo may not have been flashy, but it showed off a key component of machine learning: object recognition. I held up a series of photos showing a wide variety of stuff—animals, people, vehicles, household items, plants—and the software correctly named it all. It also told me how confident it was in its answer, and many objects were named with 100-percent accuracy. The demo was limited to just 20 objects, but the full scale of Intel’s platform can process many, many more. This tech is key to the development of self-driving cars, and Intel has partnered with other engineers in that space to get more autonomous cars on the road. And if you’re a developer, you can even tap into Intel’s Deep Learning SDK to bring object recognition to your apps. Check out the video above for more.

Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” Topics: Intel , Mobileye , self-driving vehicles , BMW iNext Related stories: PLDT HOME unveils new TVolution Stick by Intel Davao blast blamed on ISIS-linked Maute The CIA More from this Category: BSP to keep interest rates steady SMC’s net profit jumps 80% to P52b Megawide contests JG’s bid for Clark COMMENT DISCLAIMER: Reader comments posted on this Web site are not in any way endorsed by The Standard.

(Miriam Alster /Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - After the Bank of Israel managed to rein in the shekel’s march on the dollar last week, buying up greenbacks to raise the value of the dollar against the Israeli currency, it faced a new challenge this week — one that the central bank may not be able to so easily overcome. In the wake of Monday’s announcement on the buyout of Mobileye by Intel, the dollar lost half a percent against the shekel, despite the U.S. currency’s general strength against other currencies — and that could be just the beginning, according to foreign-currency-trading experts FXCM Israel. “The Mobileye deal is likely to attract more investors to Israel,” as the “smart money” seeks out other Israeli tech investments. “The rush of investments is likely to further increase the value of the shekel,” the firm said, citing what it calls the “Mobileye Effect, which has been raising consciousness among investors around the world in the wake of the biggest tech deal in Israel’s history, and in Intel’s history as well.” According to an announcement by Intel, the company is set to buy all outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. That sum is larger than the military and defense budgets for Israel. The state is likely to take in well over a billion dollars in taxes, money that will go to close budget holes and lower taxes. The dollar has again fallen to the NIS 3.66/dollar level, after massive purchases of dollars last week brought the greenback to the NIS 3.70 level. With the resources of Intel behind it, Mobileye will be expanding — doubling its office space and its workforce — and the new clout that the company has as part of the world’s largest maker of microprocessors makes Israel a center of auto technology, and especially self-driving vehicle tech. That is likely to attract more multinationals to Israel to invest in that area — already, several carmakers, including GM and Hyundai, have research and development offices and facilities in Israel — and bring with them more cash. Last week, analysts cited the announcement that the Leviathan gas field would soon begin exporting natural gas as a factor in the shekel’s strength along with the economy’s overall positive performance. “The shekel is likely to continue appreciating in the coming months,” the analysts said. “It is hard to argue with the factors that are contributing to this, including a current account surplus of 3.9 percent in 2016, and an increase in real investments of some 3 percent during the year. Israel is also benefiting from positive investments, especially in the technology sector.” Add to that receipts from sales of natural gas that are starting to pour in. Israelis, the analysts said, need to get used to the idea that their currency is among the world’s strongest, and is likely to remain that way for some time to come. Whether the Bank will engage in more dollar buying or throw in the towel to what appears to be an irresistible force — the strength of the Israeli economy — remains to be seen. If there was one “ray of light” for the Bank in its struggle to keep the shekel down, it was the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve will decide to increase interest rates after it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. That announcement will come at 2 p.m. Wednesday, New York time, and the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter percent. While that, not too long ago, would have been enough to accelerate the dollar’s value and a plunge in the shekel, that is not likely to be the case this time, said FXCM. “It appears that the scenario of a quarter-point increase in interest rates has already been factored into the markets and into the current value of the dollar,” the analysts said. “However, there is a strong danger that the dollar will plunge, and not only against the shekel, if U.S. interest rates are not raised.”   Filed under: Currency, Economy Print Email Gmail Related Dollar Falls Again After Bank of Israel $200M Intervention Report: Dollar Could Go Through Floor Stronger Dollar, Weaker Shekel Shekel-Dollar Exchange Rate Hits Three-Year Low Experts: Dollar Could Sink vs. Shekel After Positive Economic News More in Israel Greenblatt Has 3-Hour Meeting With Netanyahu Before Leaving Netanyahu Flies to China on Sunday — on Business Ben Gurion Named Number One for Duty-Free Shopping Parents Up in Arms Over School Mosque Bowing Incident ANALYSIS: In Week of Middle East Talks, Trump Envoy Avoids Disruption OP-ED The Intelligence Committee’s Hearing On Russia Won’t Satisfy Democrats A Head Start on Discrimination Antidote to Amalek More Can Be Done for Missing IDF Soldiers Mitzvos and “Making It” More Than a Buzz Cellphone Withdrawal Down the Conspiracy Rabbit Hole Laziness isn’t why People are Poor, iPhones Aren’t why they Lack Health Care.

Twitter Facebook Why Intel put a smartphone chip in Tag Heuer's $1,600 smartwatch Smartphone chips can extend the life of smartwatches, so they won't need to be replaced every few years Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 14 March, 2017 22:15 - - - - print email Comments Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It's not clear yet, but Intel's powerful chip in the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,600 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn't outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel's Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable's shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch's heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches -- like the one made by Tag Heuer -- have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel's thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. Tag Heuer is stressing the "Swiss made" aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won't pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn't a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

By Sun Motors 14th March 2017, 11:40 am Updated: 14th March 2017, 11:41 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments MULTINATIONAL corporation Intel have injected themselves into the autonomous car industry. The American technology company announced it will buy Israel’s Mobileye in a deal valued at about £12.3 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. Getty Images 3 Intel will buy Israel’s Mobileye. The deal announced late on Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centres and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous car systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. EPA 3 The purchase will push Intel to the front of the driverless vehicle race. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in the United States, with nearly all using Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different automakers. It also makes software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts.

SILVER LINING Some relief for diesel drivers with announcement of free future valuations Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. AP:Associated Press 3 Uber joined in partnership with Volvo as part of autonomous vehicle research. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay £52.39 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 per cent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at £12.6 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in life-saving electronics. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a £247 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested £124 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a £820 million purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI.

MacBook Pro latest rumours - release date, UK price and specs In October we saw a new MacBook Pro with Touchbar, but we're expecting another update in 2017 and it might come powered by AMD, not Intel. Read the latest rumours on the 2017 MacBook Pro specifications, price and UK launch date. All the information you need about the new Apple MacBook Pro By Marie Brewis | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the 2017 MacBook Pro release date? What are the rumoured specifications? All about the MacBook Pro 2016 How much does the MacBook Pro cost in the UK? In October Apple unveiled its long-awaited MacBook Pro with a fancy new Touch Bar, but we won't be waiting as long for the next update.New MacBook Pros with updated processors - potentially Intel Kaby Lake chips - are expected this year, . We outline the 2016 MacBook Pro UK release date, price and specification, plus new MacBook Pro 2017 rumours. See also: Best laptops 2017. Also see: Apple October Event as it happened | MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review When is the 2017 MacBook Pro release date? KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is predicting updated MacBooks with Intel Kaby Lake processor later this year. Kuo says new 12in MacBooks will enter mass production in Q2 (March), potentially with a new 16GB RAM model. Meanwhile new 13- and 15in MacBook Pros will begin mass production in Q3 (July). In Q4 (September) we could see a high-end 15in MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM as "the most significantly redesigned product this year". What are the rumoured specifications? The notion of new MacBook Pros in 2017 is backed up by a new Bloomberg report. It says a new model is planned for later this year but it might herald a shift away from Intel processors. According to people familiar with the matter the chip, codenamed T310 and built ARM technology, will handle low-power functionality and work along the main Intel processor. This move could mean better battery life as moving the 'Power Nap' feature to the new chip will use even less power. Apple's ARM-based T1 chip is already in the latest MacBook Pro - see below. But what about AMD Ryzen? An article on Arcitosh.com suggests "AMD’s new Ryzen 7 CPUs look to promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel and offer a nicer philosophical fit for Apple." The current MacBook Pro isn't much faster than the model it replaced, since Apple looks to provide performance while conserving battery life. Arcitosh suggests that rather than producing its own or using Intel's chips to look for the ultimate performance per watt, it could instead use AMD's Ryzen CPUs.  As with Microsoft and the Surface Pro 5, Apple is apparently considering AMD for the 2017 MacBook Pro. In fact, it could be powered by the upcoming Raven Ridge APU - a combination of Ryzen chipsets for CPU and Vega-based chipsets for GPU. Raven Ridge was originally planned for 2018 but an updated roadmap shows a 2017 release instead. Watch this space for more updates. All about the MacBook Pro 2016 In October 2016 on the week of the Apple laptop's 25th anniversary, Apple announced the best MacBook Pro yet. There are 13- and 15in models with new all-aluminium designs that are significantly thinner and lighter than their predecessors, just 14.9mm thin and 3lb for the 13in model and 15.5mm and 4lb for the 15in model. The new MacBook Pros, available in Silver and Space Grey, have a two times larger Force Touch trackpad and a new context-sensitive Retina display Touch Bar that replaces the row of Function keys. Touch ID is also built-in with Secure Enclave and protected with Sapphire glass. The new Touch Bar consumed most of Apple's demonstration, and it does look cool. What functions it offers entirely depend on the app you're in. For example, you might get emoji in the Messages app, favourite sites in Safari, and options to reply or delete in Mail. In Photos are useful editing controls, and we particularly like the look of the quick type function in relevant apps, which may speed up typing. The keyboard itself has also been improved, with new second-generation Butterfly-style switch mechanisms that are more responsive and offer better travel. The new MacBook Pro is a sixth-generation Skylake machine with a 2133MHz Intel Core i7 inside (you can opt for a Core i5 in the 13in model). There's up to 2TB of storage via a superfast SSD, and in the 15in model AMD Radeon Pro graphics with up to 4GB VRAM (the 13in model has Intel Iris graphics). Apple says the 15in model is 130 percent faster than its predecessor on graphics, 60 percent faster for gaming, and 57 percent faster for video editing. The 13in model, meanwhile, is 103 percent faster than its predecessor for gaming, and 76 percent faster for both video editing and 3D graphics. The display is better than ever, now 67 percent brighter with 67 percent higher contrast and 25 percent more colours. Each MacBook Pro is fitted with four Thunderbolt 3 ports that can go up to 40GB/s. Each of these ports can be used for power or as Thunderbolt, USB-C, DisplayPort, HDMI or VGA connections. How much does the MacBook Pro cost in the UK? The new MacBook Pro comes in three models, all available direct from Apple. 1. 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and Touch ID, 2GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, Intel Iris Graphics 540, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 2x Thunderbolt 3.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 14, 2017 6:12 AM PT Credit: Tag Heuer More like this TAG Heuer's Connected Modular 45 is the Android Wear 2.0 watch you want but... TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45: Hands on with the swankiest Wear watch of all Intel pursuing new chips as it plots a wearables future Video Levi's and Google Jacquard bring you a connected jacket you'll actually wear Do smartwatches need upgrades every few years like PCs? It’s not clear yet, but Intel’s powerful chip in the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45, a US $1,650 luxury smartwatch, will ensure the wearable isn’t outdated anytime soon. The smartwatch, which runs Android Wear 2.0, uses Intel’s Atom Z34XX, a smartphone chip. The Atom processor seems like overkill but extends the wearable’s shelf life and adds processing power for artificial intelligence, a feature Google is building in Android Wear. The watch has a 1.39-inch AMOLED touch screen, and modularity is a big selling point of the wearable. The smartwatch’s heads, straps, and other parts can be easily swapped, and buyers have the option to pick up one of 56 versions. The smartwatch can be turned into a mechanical watch by replacing the head. Swiss watches—like the one made by TAG Heuer—have been treated like family heirlooms and passed down from generation to generation. Keeping the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 relevant for as long as possible was part of Intel’s thinking. Like in PCs, smartwatches could need upgrades as chips age and applications demand more resources. The Atom chip will last over multiple versions of Android Wear, said Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager for the New Devices Group at Intel. The processor also brings many valuable security features to the chip, which are important for mobile payments via NFC, Bautista said. Later in the year, Intel plans to add AI features to the smartwatch via apps. For example, the smartwatch will be able to approximate when a person needs to buy milk by analyzing trends from multiple data sources. Those applications will need processing capabilities on the device, and the Atom chip can handle those needs. TAG Heuer is stressing the “Swiss made” aspect of the smartwatch, and the wearable has interesting tech in it. It has Wi-Fi, GPS, and 4GB of flash storage, and it can run applications like Google Fit. It is water resistant for up to 50 meters, partly because all the parts have been engineered into a compact cylindrical structure. Water won’t pass through the headphone jack, a unique feature. The NFC goes through the face of the watch. The interfaces can also be customized. A smartphone chip in the smartwatch does affect battery life. In tests, the smartwatch ran for about 30 hours before needing a recharge, according to Intel. Intel last year said it would start making Atom smartphone chips. Older smartphone CPUs are now getting a new lease on life in devices like smartwatches. The company is optimizing chips and developing software to fit the profile of devices, Bautista said. The wearables unit isn’t a major division at Intel, unlike PCs, IoT, or servers, but the unit wants to develop software and analytics tools as the world becomes increasingly connected. Collecting and developing software for biometric data is unique to wearables, which is why Intel is interested in the area, Bautista said.   The TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch will be available worldwide starting on Tuesday.

The deal, announced on Monday, combines Mobileye's market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel's hardware, data centres and its own software, giving car companies a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous car systems. Share this story Intel's purchase of Mobileye is the latest push by a major tech company into autonomous vehicles. File picture: Carlos Osorio / AP Photo. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye's leadership position, officials from the companies said. Carmakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye's software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different carmakers. It also makes software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in vehicles on the road today. What does Intel bring to the party, then? Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centres, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Carmakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. "If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving," said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit.

The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise." The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc . Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC , which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING 'EYES' AND 'BRAIN' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

It continues the dubious traditions of word salad branding and smartwatches that cost an arm and a leg, in this case $1,600. That’s $100 more than 2015’s Tag Heuer Connected, but what’s a Benjamin between low-tier luxury watch friends? Jerry Bautista, vice president of New Technology Group at Intel insists that this is much more than an Android Wear module in an expensive body. He says that Intel worked with Tag to build this watch like any other expensive mechanical watch, with exacting standards on the internals. The “modular” part of this watch denotes that you’ll be able to customize a ton of the parts of the watch before you buy it. You can choose different colors, “modules, horns, bracelets, and buckles.” And when the tech inside inevitably becomes obsolete, Tag will let you swap out the module for something mechanical or trade the whole kit in for a Heuer 02T Tourbillon Chronograph. (Tag’s trade-in program sounds weird, but it’s kind of clever, as Dan Seifert wrote in 2015.) Intel Before I get into the details, let me just set the context. On paper, this seems like a frustratingly good watch. It’s probably the most reasonably sized and reasonably specced Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Everything else out there so far this year is too big or has terrible battery life. It’s the one I would probably get and recommend... if it cost $1,300 less. It’s also an all-metal design, which is notable because Intel and Tag pulled that off without having to cut out NFC, which means this will work for Android Pay. Bautista says that the 1.39-inch AMOLED display is round without a flat tire, surrounded by a ring that contains all the necessary antennas for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It also manages to fit an ambient light sensor in, with a light pipe from the sapphire cover glass on the watch channeling down and inside to the board. Spec-wise, you’re looking at Android Wear 2.0 with Intel’s Atom Z34XX processor — they’re claiming even with ambient mode on you should get 30 hours of battery life. There’s GPS, too, though there’s no LTE or a heart rate monitor. It’s good underwater down to about 100 feet with a tympanic membrane over the microphone. Intel says it’s 13.2mm thick, which is still more than an Apple Watch but blessedly less than the massive watches other Android Wear manufacturers have been shipping lately. One last thing, and maybe the most interesting thing for most of us (aka people who can’t imagine spending $1,600 on a smartwatch): Intel is developing its own intelligent assistant that will eventually appear on this watch — and elsewhere. Bautista couldn’t tell me much about it, although he dropped some hints: It will be able to help based on your current activities instead of just the time of day. So, for example, it might realize you left work late and still give you your home reminders rather than annoy you by giving them to you when you’re still at the office. Like Siri and Google, it will be able to handle asking follow-up questions without losing context. Although it won’t be on the Tag at launch, it’ll come. It’ll also show up on other devices from companies Intel partners with, like Oakley. It won’t have a name or a gender. Its not super clear why Intel is putting its own intelligent assistant on a device that already has the Google Assistant, but Bautista insists that it’ll be differentiated and smart in its own way. Intel and Tag call it a “new experience of time,” which is precisely the sort of dangerous language that damages eyeballs from excessive rolling. I guess if Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon all have assistants, Intel just doesn’t want to feel left out. Intel Anyway, don’t buy the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 for the assistant, buy it if you like the look of the watch and don’t blink at spending $1,600 on a piece of jewelry. Google’s strategy with Android Wear 2.0 is to get as many different kinds of companies making smartwatches as it can. So I don’t have a lot of angst that an expensive Android Wear watch exists. The angst I do have is that this Tag seems like the best of the Android Wear 2.0 generation right now — everything in the sub-$500 range is either too big or has worse battery life.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Your Swiss smartwatch might very well have Intel Inside. Intel and Tag Heuer are unveiling the fruits of their alliance today with the Modular 45, a Swiss luxury watch that has all of the electronics and smarts of competitors such as the Apple Watch. The watch is modular, which means you can select the band, the buckles, and the watch face. You can also change the face on the dial by tapping on the screen and mixing and matching different options. “They’re all interchangeable,” said Tom Foldesi, vice president of connected products and technology at Tag Heuer, in a joint press conference at the luxurious St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco. Tag Heuer also held a parallel event in Switzerland. “This is a connected luxury Swiss watch. People have moved mountains to enable this project, on time and on spec.” Above: Tag Heuer’s Modular 45 watches. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Based on Google’s Android Wear 2.0 software, the watch is the second that Intel and Tag Heuer have worked on together. Among the cool features on this watch is near-field communication that lets you instantly pay for goods. Another cool feature: You can tell the watch to remind you to buy milk after work (via an app). And you don’t have to set the exact time for the reminder. The app, with its artificial intelligence, will remind you as you’re leaving work, based on its understanding of your global positioning system (GPS) data. Foldesi added, “It’s a connected watch that does not look out of place. Tech can be shoehorned into a wearable, and it may be a wearable you may not want to wear. This speaks to you as an individual.” Above: All the different versions of the Tag Heuer Modular 45 watch. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The entry-level watch costs $1,650, while the Tourbillon version of the watch costs $18,000. There are actually about 56 different possible versions of the watch, depending on what you choose in terms of faces (there are 11 of them), buckles, and straps. “Don’t drop it,” said Jerry Bautista, vice president at Intel’s new technology group, in an interview with VentureBeat. He also said that the smartwatch doesn’t necessarily take advantage of the performance side of Moore’s Law, the prediction that computing power will double every couple of years. Above: Guy Semon (left), Tom Foldesi, and Jerry Bautista. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi “You won’t have a 4-billion transistor server chip in this,” he said. “Except for the fact is that the chip was one that we once had in smartphones. There’s a phone-class processor in this watch, and that gives it good connectivity and high performance. It collects data from your body for hours at a time.” Where it does count is in the miniaturization and power management. Intel created antennae for the various Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS radios in the device by wrapping it around a band near the face of the watch. Meanwhile, the watch is encased in metal, which would otherwise make wireless reception much tougher. The battery life is about 30 hours. “With this approach, we get about 70 percent better Wi-Fi performance than we did on the prior watch,” Bautista said. Above: Tag Heuer smartwatches have Intel Inside. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The watch has a proximity sensor that can tell whether you are wearing the watch. That goes together with the near-field communication that enables you to make instant payments. If you are not wearing the watch, you might be prompted for a security code during payment. Foldesi said the design does not include a heart-rate monitor, as it is not a fitness watch and that feauture “was not a key to this.” “Luxury is like a pyramid. If you buy an entry-level car, you check off all the options,” said Guy Semon, general manager of Tag Heuer, in an interview. “You want value for money. If you buy an Aston Martin, you won’t check for what kind of GPS it has. You buy it because it is emotional. This watch is an emotional purchase. It combines the top technology of Silicon Valley and the best that we can deliver.” Tag Heuer does the final assembly of the watch at its headquarters in Switzerland. The watch is water-resistant to a depth of 50 meters. “This is a collaboration between the two companies,” Bautista said. “The engineering really goes deep.”   Above: A Tag Heuer employee shows off an Intel-based smartwatch.

Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector. The company's largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel's larger PC business. Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock "underperform", notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel's Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company's Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said that Intel has previously attempted to fold acquisitions into its structure but they have not always been the right fit. Intel's deals for embedded systems software maker Wind River Systems and McAfee exemplified that strategy. "One of the things Intel has tried to do in the past is that they've taken a square peg, and they have taken a round hole, and tried to put it in a square peg," said Van Hees, who rates Intel a "buy". Intel, which is the largest private employer in Israel, hopes to bank on its experience to maintain Mobileye's startup culture, bringing Mobileye's "quick moving, fast acting culture" into Intel's autonomous driving division, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. Intel, which has been looking to shift away from its traditional business, missed the smartphone boom in the last decade but analysts hope the company will avoid a repeat. "Investors should be pleased with the perspective that they(Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early," according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

(Nati Shohat/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - The biggest business deal in Israeli history will also bring into the government’s coffers its biggest one-time windfall ever, with the tax man collecting an estimated NIS 4 to 10 billion, mostly in income, luxury and capital gains taxes from the Israeli shareholders of the company. Even at the lower end, the ensuing proceeds will enrich the state to an extent that all Israelis will benefit – both in increased spending on public projects, as well as in lower taxes. According to an announcement by Intel, the company is set to buy all outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. That sum is larger than the military and defense budgets for Israel. Hours after the deal was affirmed by Intel on Monday, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Moshe Kachlon jointly announced that they would be lowering taxes for Israeli middle-class taxpayers. The state was already running a surplus, and the Mobileye deal provides an even greater cushion for the government. “Over the past year the Israeli economy has broken growth records,” Kachlon said at a news conference Monday. “Our economic statistics are excellent and Israelis deserve to benefit from the fruits of their hard work.” According to Netanyahu, “this deal proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is becoming an international technological powerhouse. Not only in regard to cyber, but in regard to vehicles as well.” Along with a reduction in income taxes, sources in the Treasury said that the government would increase transfer payments to several groups, including the elderly and disabled. A reduction in VAT (value added tax) sales tax is also possible. Not everyone was happy about the tax breaks. Zionist Camp MK Amir Peretz said that Israel “remains at the head of the list of countries with large income gaps. The state continues to be unsympathetic to the needy. The proceeds should be invested in social services, such as providing the elderly with more services or easing the pressure on hospitals.” Meretz head Zehava Gal-on said that “Netanyahu and Kachlon smell elections in the air, and they want to sell the public a false narrative, pretending to be giving to the poor when all they are doing is enriching the already well-off.” About an hour after Intel confirmed the deal, Kachlon spoke with Mobileye cofounder Ziv Amiram, and congratulated him. “The best news about this is that we could retain the intellectual property of the company in Israel, that Mobileye’s management will remain in Israel, the brainpower remains in Israel, and the honor remains in Israel. As a result of this deal Israel becomes a center of the development of self-driving cars. This deal displays a strong faith in Israel and the Israeli economy.” The deal was not only the largest one in Israel’s history, but the largest in Intel’s as well. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is set to visit Israel Tuesday to meet Amiram and Mobileye founder Amnon Shashua. “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” Krzanich said in Intel’s announcement on the buyout. “Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” According to Intel, the market for the vehicle systems, data and services with which Mobileye will be helping the company will be worth up to $70 billion by 2030.

With no Mac mini launches in 2016, Apple might have called it a day. Read the latest rumours about the 2017 Mac mini specs, price and UK launch date. by Karen Haslam | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? Also, what is the Mac mini?! When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? A new Mac mini is expected to launch in 2017, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015 or 2016; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide 2017 for current buying advice, and our guide to the best Apple deals. Last updated, 21 February 2017, to report on Apple's announcement of WWDC 2017, and to briefly discuss the chances of a new Mac mini appearing at the event; and previously with the news that Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete. When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? When will the next Mac mini come out? We think March 2017 is a decent bet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) There were rumours suggesting that Apple would do a low-key update to its Mac desktop range by the end of November 2016, focusing on the Mac Pro but potentially covering the iMac and Mac mini at the same time. But it seems Apple disliked the idea. Instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the company's usual spring event in March 2017. Availability of chipsets may influence the timing of the launch. The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article. The next slot in Apple's launch calendar after its usual spring event is WWDC. WWDC 2017 has just been announced, and while this event always focuses primarily on software (iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will be the headline announcements), there is sometimes room for hardware. If we still don't see a Mac mini update by this point, it's probably safe to assume that Apple has killed off the Mac mini line - a possibility we address in the next section. Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. See also: New iMac release | New Mac Pro release Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive, or dropping the headphone port from the iPhone 7. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £679, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, likely due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Read next: Mac mini vs MacBook Air  Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. Also, what is the Mac mini?! Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

Yesterday, the global semiconductor giant Intel announced that it would acquire the Israel- based startup Mobileye N.V. for $15.3 billion. Founded in 1999, Mobileye has developed computer vision software it says can propel self-driving cars into the mainstream. The value for data systems within the autonomous vehicle market will reach $70 billion by 2030, according to Intel estimates. And McKinsey projects that 15 percent of all automobiles will be fully autonomous by 2030. Last summer, Morgan Stanley estimated that the entire driverless car sector could be worth $2.6 trillion at the end of the next decade. From Intel’s point of view, its purchase of Mobileye is necessary to compete in an emerging sector ripe with opportunities. This industry is now dominated by the global automakers and upstarts such as Tesla Motors, as well as technology and ride-sharing companies like Google and Uber. If Intel hopes to continue to placate its shareholders, the company must venture beyond the hyper-competitive and commoditized semiconductor market. Analysts have noted that Intel missed the boat when the time was right to seize opportunities within the smartphone market – and its continued strength in the personal computer and server market is not a sure long-term bet. Therefore, a forward-looking eye on the self-driving market makes sense. But this acquisition is not without risk. Bloomberg’s Tara Lachaelle noted that when measured on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) basis, Intel just dived into one of the most expensive takeovers since the heady dot-com days around the turn of the century. Investors responded in kind. As of press time, Intel’s stock price was down 2 percent. Nevertheless, Intel purchased one of the world’s leading self-driving car technology firms, and one that can boast a track record of almost two decades. Headquartered in Jerusalem, the company says it has at least 450 engineers working a bevy of software systems, including the LiDAR-based driving technologies that allow an autonomous car to ‘see’ what is on the road and eliminate the bane of commuting: human error. As LiDAR (light detection and ranging) software evolves and proves to be more sophisticated, watch for self-driving cars to become more of a reality. Hence the fierce competition — and even litigation: Google, for example, recently sued Uber for patent infringement, unfair competition and the stealing of trade secrets related to autonomous cars. Tesla has also staunchly defended its turf and taken a former engineer to court for allegedly poaching employees as he launched his own self-driving car software startup. Meanwhile, the conventional automakers are considering their own chess moves, as it makes more sense for them to develop what are currently expensive software systems in-house, rather than having to license the technology or attempt what would be a far more expensive acquisition in the future. In early 2016, General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft as it viewed that ridesharing company as a ticket to continued viability in a rapidly evolving automobile market. And last month, Ford Motor Co. plunked $1 billion on an artificial intelligence company that in the future could be the brains behind its driverless cars. The rise of autonomous vehicles will most likely mean fewer cars on the roads, so everyone is scrambling to snag their pieces of the pie — and, in the meantime, creating a bubble that may burst before these next generation of cars even become a common sight on the streets.

The S&P 500 traded in its tightest range of the year, in and out of slight losses, while the CBOE Volatility index was on track to close at its lowest in more than a week. Shares of Mobileye jumped nearly 30 percent to a high of $61.51 after chipmaker Intel agreed to buy the driverless technology maker for $15.3 billion. Mobileye closed up 28.2 percent at $60.62 and Intel fell 2.1 percent to $35.16. Investors looked ahead to the Fed’s two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Traders saw a 94 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. “Other than the Fed on Wednesday I don’t see anything going on to make any (investment) decisions on,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. “Intel buying Mobileye is the story of the day, moving into that market sector,” he said, adding they advised some clients to “fade in” into Intel stocks. “We think this is a very good support point,” said Mendelsohn. Nvidia rose 2.8 percent to $101.85 while Delphi Automotive added 4.0 percent to $80.20. Both are involved in developing technology for cars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48, the S&P 500 gained 0.87 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,373.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,875.78. Citrix Systems jumped 6.8 percent to $84.93 after Bloomberg reported that the cloud-services company is working with advisers to seek potential suitors. Wynn Resorts gained 4.8 percent to $104.30 after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “buy” rating and said the company could gain a meaningful market share in Macau. About 6.14 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.93 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 48 new lows. The S&P 500’s average true range hit 5.9, its lowest of the year. The year-to-date average of that daily measure of volatility is 14.   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion A missing comma keeps Oakhurst Dairy labor lawsuit alive Out-of-staters owe Maine almost $17 million in taxes Plow drivers stranded on I-295 escape unharmed — ‘except their pride’ What snowplow drivers really think of people who drive in a storm Caribou man charged with threatening business owner Downsizing Maine’s bottle redemption program would be a recycling disaster This is no time to sow doubt about climate change I should not lose health insurance so the wealthy can get a tax cut Friday, March 17, 2017: A solution for daylight saving time, Real ID trouble, Trump stocks the swamp Thursday, March 16, 2017: Border wall a costly investment, time to consider the 25th Amendment, tax carbon emissions UMaine nursing major claims third straight national wrestling title The Bruins little ball of hate becomes a star Linebacker Hightower returns to Patriots on $43.5M deal UMaine wrestling club team captures national championship Positive mindset, determination fuel Washburn star’s track success STATE & CAPITOL Data undercut LePage claim that many dump private insurance for Medicaid STATE & CAPITOL LePage says he didn’t sign emergency budget bill because of provision he proposed STATE & CAPITOL LePage didn’t sign his own supplemental budget bill MAINE AT WAR You’ve got the wrong guy in that coffin!

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel buying Mobileye for $15.3bn By Sead Fadilpašić News  Intel is joining the autonomous vehicles race. Shares American technology giant Intel announced this Monday that it’s buying Israeli company Mobileye for $15.3 billion. With this acquisition, Intel is joining the race to produce autonomous vehicles.  This is the largest overseas acquisition in the history of Israeli companies, local media state. The company will, together with Intel’s autonomous driving department, be headquartered in Israel. It will be led by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye president and co-founder.  Both Intel and Mobileye have already cooperated with German BMW to create autonomous vehicles. They expect the merger to create a global leader in the autonomous vehicles segment. This could mean lower prices for the consumers, as well.  “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it says sin the press release. Announcing the agreement, Intel says autonomous cars have “progressed from assisted driving to being fully autonomous”, and have such become data centres on wheels. It is estimated that such vehicles will create four terabytes of data daily, by 2020.  “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030,” the report also says. “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Image Credit: StockStudio / Shutterstock Topics intel Mobileye autonomous vehicles self-driving cars acquisition Load Comments GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Among our favourite convertible Windows-based laptops is the Lenovo Yoga series, which has been tweaking its 360-degree hinge-based formula over the years. In the Lenovo Yoga 910 that means ultra power, ultra slimness and an ultra-trim bezel around the screen - which brings this fashion-focused, adjustable laptop in-line with its nearest Dell XPS competitor. The Yoga 910 is quite the ultra-laptop at first glance, then, but having used one for a week does it disappoint in the details? Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Design 323 x 224.5 x 14.3mm; 1.29kg Watchband hinge for 360-degree rotation Edge-to-edge screen with minimal bezel Grey, silver and champagne gold finishes The age of giant bezels is almost over. That's the thing that immediately sets the Yoga 910 apart from most of its competition: the edge-to-edge display style which fills to the side and upper edges with mere millimetres of the black stuff. Pocket-lint Well, it's sort-of edge-to-edge. Like any screen there has to be some bezel to contain the display, but it's the lower bezel that perplexes - because it's about 10 times thicker, like a large black bar across the bottom of the screen. It undoes some of the other three bezel edges' achievements. That aside the Yoga 910 is one ridiculously good-looking laptop. Sure, that "watchband" hinge could be a little too bling for some tastes, but we think it looks sophisticated and, especially in its grey/silver finish, understated compared to its champagne gold-colour alternative (no whacky orange colours are available for this newer generation). For a 13.9-inch laptop the Yoga 910's 14mm thickness is slim, but doesn't lead to the abandonment of the traditional USB port. There's one USB 3.0 fitting, along with two C-Type connections on the opposite side of the device. So Lenovo could have probably made the 910 thinner still by ditching the full-size port, but we prefer the future-proof yet "today-ready" out-the-box approach. The laptop's aluminium shell feels solid, while the grey finish model on review has a soft-touch finish on both its lid and interior sections. The trackpad and separate fingerprint scanner each cut their way into this material finish with more spangly embossed chamfered edging that adds to the classy look. Pocket-lint We won't dwell on the hinge as its concept is simple: use it to swivel the screen all the way around to tablet-like form; allow the laptop to stand upright in stand mode; flip it over in a v-shape for tent mode; or use it like a simple laptop with the screen titled at any given angle. It moves easily, holds into position incredibly well and is an elegant solution indeed. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: 4K screen 13.9-inch touchscreen panel 3840 x 2160 4K UHD resolution There's no doubting the Yoga 910's impressive screen. Because of the trim bezel, which we've already waxed lyrical about, the laptop can squeeze a 14-inch screen into typical 13-inch real-estate. Pocket-lint This Lenovo is almost identical in width to the smaller-screen Apple MacBook Air… it just happens to be taller, given that thicker bezel arrangement at the bottom. This size of laptop is perfect to cart around and use when on the go, or pop on a desk and use as your household laptop too. Beyond the scale, Lenovo hasn't scrimped in terms of resolution in the Yoga 910. Even at its entry-level (for the UK market) it comes with a 4K panel (3840 x 2160 pixels; elsewhere in the world there's a Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) model). There's an eye-watering amount of detail on display - we've really noticed the difference compared to our usual MacBook Air, with photos displaying that additional fidelity where available. However, such ultra-high resolution might see you need to adjust icon sizes within Windows, otherwise things can look tiny across the desktop and it makes using the touchscreen a little bit fiddlier. But it's easy to adjust as you please. Pocket-lint Brightness is ample and can auto-adjust, or you can tweak the levels using the shortcut hotkeys. Sometimes when at supposed maximum brightness, however, the system will suddenly kick in an additional notch of brightness rather than it seemingly being available via manual selection, which is strange. Reflections aren't to excess, but the screen is glossier than our day-to-day Air. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Keyboard and trackpad Full size, backlit keyboard Responsive trackpad Fingerprint scanner (Windows Hello) Given the Yoga 910 is fairly slim its keys don't have a huge degree of travel, but we've found it sufficient and comfortable with a crisp action. The way the keys sit in a sunken tray and the backlight kicks in when it's dark is in-line with other high-end laptops with full-size keys. The only downside is the small-scale shift keys. Pocket-lint The trackpad is a responsive experience, too, but can misbehave from time to time. Its setup is unusual in the laptop world: its split down the middle from left to right, with each portion of the pad acting as a traditional left/right click on a mouse - so too often we would end up with pop-up menus on screen, rather than clicking through. It's ultra-responsive for tracking, too, so navigating around the screen is fast and effective. However, sometimes mean the deftest touch will act as a click when not desired. Until you get used to it, this ultra-responsiveness might be initially irritating. Once you are used to it, however, going back to another trackpad will feel unresponsive by comparison. Pocket-lint One other addition that you'll notice on the Yoga 910 is a secondary sunken pad, beneath the right arrow key. Herein lies the fingerprint scanner for use with Windows Hello for rapid login. It's a great idea with the potential to expand deeper into secure payments and beyond. Not an essential, but a nice-to-have that lacks on much of the competition. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Over-powered performance Intel Core i5 / Core i7 options 8GB - 16GB RAM options 256GB - 512GB SSD options No discrete graphics; Intel HD built-in Now the Yoga 910 comes in various forms, with varying degrees of power available. That ranges from the £1,299 entry-level 4K model, with an Intel Core i5 and 8GB RAM, through to an Intel Core i7 with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD for £1,749. Pocket-lint We've got the maximum settings model on review, which might well be Lenovo's way to show off just how much a slender laptop can do, but it also shows off just how flawed this concept is: because of the Yoga 910's design it can't dissipate heat particularly well and, given the high-end 7500 CPU, that means the fan kicks in at the drop of a hat. And that fan noise is horribly irksome. We've been to audio labs before; we know that laptop makers test laptops in anechoic chambers to get a sense of how their fans sound. It's almost as though Lenovo bypassed that stage with the 910 as with one Edge browser window open the fan will kick in under little pressure. Sync Bluetooth with nothing else running and - even when rested on its side so the hottest area won't be touching material and therefore letting air best reach in and out of the unit - that fan noise is relentless. We're in discussion with Lenovo and awaiting a second model for review because the earlier Yoga 900 model didn't pose such issues for us. It could well be a glitch in this particular model - something a second sample and review update will address in the near future - but we suspect it's simply that the highest-end processor option is too much for this design form. Pocket-lint Our advice, therefore, would be to look for the so-called lower-power Intel Core i5 model because, frankly, there's still plenty of power on offer there. And as no models offer discrete graphics, the gap between one model and the next is unlikely to make a huge difference for most day-to-day tasks - unless you're always crunching through batches of big images or video, for example. Lenovo Yoga 910 review: Battery power With so much power under the hood and a 4K panel to render, battery life in a slim laptop is always going to take a hit. Even Lenovo thinks the 4K option will deliver a third less life per charge than the Full HD model (which you can't buy in the UK, so forget about that). Pocket-lint Actually, even with the fan whirring away, we've not found battery life to be that bad. A bit of browsing, word processing and some music playing saw a full charge dip to 35 per cent charge over around seven hours. We would expect eight hours of use per charge to be reasonable, which is better than, say, a Surface Pro 4 or similar. Verdict To look at the Lenovo Yoga 910 is an absolute triumph. That trim bezel, ultra-high resolution and great-looking watchband hinge ensure it's one of the most striking laptops on the market, without overdoing the bling. But there's a big problem with our review sample: the fan noise as a result of, we suspect, overpowering the innards in this slender design is horribly irksome. For a laptop this pricey that shouldn't be an issue; but it's a big one, kicking in with the most menial of apps open (we wouldn't cite it as an issue if it only happened when running heavy apps). It could be an isolated incident, so we'll update this review upon receiving a second, lower-power sample if we find that to be the case. That's the Yoga 910 in short: it looks great, many elements are very well considered, it's ultra-powerful and ultra-portable given its size. But all that wonderment is scuppered by going big on the power. It's like buying a supercar with a wheel missing. And that wasn't the case with our earlier Yoga 900 or fan-free Intel Core M-powered Yoga 900S models, so those are, unexpectedly, the better options to track down. The alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint Dell XPS 2-in-1 Dell has made the smallest 13-inch convertible laptop thanks to its infinity display - the minimal bezel design, which Lenovo has largely captured in its Yoga 910. Similar price points between those two do-it-all convertibles ought to see stiff competition. Read our first-look preview: Dell XPS 2-in-1 preview: The convertible king? Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro If you're not about Windows 10 and fancy Apple's latest OS X then the MacBook Pro provides a quieter, more traditional laptop experience with plenty of power to boot. There's no touchscreen, but that's where the Touch Bar comes into play, keeping the laptop's screen nice and clean as a result. Read the full review: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: A touch of brilliance or totally brainless?

And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Or is it more likely that Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013, shipping that December, and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. In addition, many of the Mac Pro's traditional creative professional audience (videographers, designers, photographers) have hung onto their ancient Mac Pro towers that predate the 2013 redesign because their old Mac Pros, which could be customised, offered more flexibility and power, at least at the time Apple launched the new-look 'trash can-style' Mac Pro. So we're long overdue an update to the Mac Pro before creative Mac professionals turn towards Windows and Linux for their workstation needs... those that haven't already turned their back on Apple, at least. Some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued, though, we look at the reasons why they think that below. If Apple is going to launch a new Mac Pro when are we likely to see it? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? Read on to find out everything we (think we) know.

And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide 2017. Updated 1 March 2017: Tim Cook has been talking about the importance of the professional and creative markets in the biggest hint yet that a new Mac Pro could be on the way... See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours Some Apple appreciators are even working on concept images and videos of what an updated Mac Pro could look like. A concept video by a French designer sees the Mac Pro take the route of looking like an iMac while borrowing a lot of ideas from the Microsoft Surface Studio. Take a look for yourself here. Will Apple update the Mac Pro? There is always going to be the question of whether Apple will turn its back on the Mac, with the iPhone becoming such a significant part of its business, and with Steve Jobs having said that the desktops days were numbered when he spoke about how the iPad would revolutionise computing. However, we can confidently say that Apple isn't turning away from the Mac desktop just yet, based on CEO Tim Cook's comments below. Further comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market either. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the 'and' between 'creative' and 'professional' could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer about the Mac Pro (or the iMac or FCP). Regarding Cooks comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He feels that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Could the same be said to apply to Mac Pro users. Regardless of nitpicking about what constitutes a 'creative professional', Cook's comments give us hope that Apple will update the Mac Pro, despite all the commentary to the contrary (more on that below). While the updated unit may no longer meet the requirements of professional creatives, and while the cost of production may not justify its existence (and the cost is probably high due to Apple building it in the US rather than outsourcing to China), we don't think that Apple is about to turn its back on a product that allows it to show off its best technological advancements. There is some evidence that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) is in the pipeline - some code in Mac OS X El Capitan was discovered that referenced a machine with the codename AAPLJ95,1. The current generation of Mac Pro was codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it seems a fair bet that the new model is also a Mac Pro. Although El Capitan has now been superseded by macOS Sierra so maybe that was just an anomaly in the code. (More on this code below). In addition, a few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect a new Mac Pro by the end of November 2016, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it is certainly possible that things have been delayed and we could still see a new Mac Pro soon. When is the new Mac Pro release date? We expect (hope that) the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017 (read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event), although it may be a more likely star of the WWDC keynote in June, since that event tends to have more of a focus on pro Macs. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013. That's nearly four years ago (although the Mac Pro didn't actually ship until that December - and supply was so restrained that most users didn't get theirs until the following spring). It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. As it turned out, Apple did unveil a new MacBook Pro at the October event, so there was something for 'creative professionals' (although whether creative pros feel that it is meant for them is another question). You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) If the new Mac Pro doesn't appear at Apple's spring press event in March, then WWDC 2017, whose dates and ticket lottery were announced in February, would be the next slot in the Apple launch calendar. While Apple tends to focus on software at WWDC, and iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will dominate the event, the launch of the 2013 Mac Pro shows there is a place for hardware at Apple's summer event if the circumstances are right. Could Apple launch a Pro iMac instead of a new Mac Pro? In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac desktop, referring only to the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" In response, Cook wrote the following (failing to mention the Mac Pro, or the Mac mini for that matter): "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important before speaking about the iMac. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why the question was asked and why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. Does this suggest that Apple will condense its Mac desktop offering into the iMac, discontinuing the Mac Pro and the Mac mini? Such a move would certainly help simplify its desktop offering. Perhaps Apple plans to do exactly that, with the launch of a Pro iMac that goes above and beyond what the 5K iMac offers currently. It's possible that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, but it's unlikely that such a model will ever meet the needs of Apple's traditional Mac Pro market, many of whom are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) Those who did upgrade to the trashcan-like Mac Pro are finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. Other professional creatives have abandoned the Mac and moved to Windows. It's a shame because these creative professionals, while a niche market, wield a lot of influence. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. Is the new Mac Pro 2017 release date delayed? When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. What are the rumoured Mac Pro 2017 specifications? Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. Ports: Thunderbolt and USB 3 The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon offering more Thunderbolt ports in the form of USB-3. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. (Read more about Thunderbolt and the Mac Pro here). Many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays. Processor: Intel Kaby Lake or AMD RYZEN 7? The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Another idea, although somewhat crazy, is that Apple could abandon Intel chips altogether and move to AMD. AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel’s i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. Perhaps more at home in an iMac then. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively, there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. An article by a video professional refers to the Nvidia GTX 1080 which is such a big deal that he thinks: "This card alone will most likely cause a shift in computer workstation ownership. However the card isn't compatible with the Mac Pro: "Even a Thunderbolt-connected PCIe expansion chassis to a Mac Pro trashcan won't help, due to the inherent bandwidth limits that Thunderbolt has as compared to the buss speeds of these GPU cards. And forget about stacking these cards in an expansion chassis… just not going to happen." Because using this card with the Mac Pro is out of the question he predicts: "a huge migration of longtime Apple users (such as me) going to Windows systems for their main workstation needs." Apple could move away from AMD with the next Mac Pro though (it has tended in the past to flit between the two graphics card manufacturers). And this time there may be a good reason: a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as KRCS and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 March 2017 by Military News Intel’s $15 billion purchase of Mobileye shakes up driverless car sector Mobileye’s technologies were originated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Licensed to Mobileye by Yissum, the Technology Transfer arm of the University. Tamir Huberman is VP Business Development at Yissum which is reponsible for all the Computer Science Researchers at the University including Prof Amnon Shashua. By Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch and Paul Lienert | JERUSALEM/DETROIT Intel Corp (INTC.O) agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye (MBLY.N) for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. „This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. „Mobileye’s technology is very critical… The price seems fair,” she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move „very far outside its core business franchise.” The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the „very expensive transaction” improved Intel’s position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye’s shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc’s Waymo (GOOGL.O) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC (DLPH.N), which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING ‚EYES’ AND ‚BRAIN’ Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the „eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems – the building blocks for self-driving cars – to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: „If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player… The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel’s biggest car importer and one of Mobileye’s earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

The chipmaker announced Monday it will acquire Mobileye for $63.54 per share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price Friday. The blockbuster deal marks Israel’s biggest acquisition, and Intel’s second-largest after its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, a field-programmable gate array technology provider, in 2015. Mobileye is a leading developer of digital vision technology, which detects objects and space surrounding a vehicle, responsible for a number of key self-driving functions such as making sure that the vehicle stays in its lane and warning drivers of potential collisions. Its chips are installed in more than 300 car models, including BMW, according to Mobileye. The Israel-based company that currently employees over 600 workers was co-founded by Amnon Shashua, a computer science professor at Hebrew University, and CEO Ziv Aviram in 1999. Mobileye flagged $358 million in revenue last year, marking a net income of $108 million. “Intel’s landmark acquisition reflects the company’s strong will to promptly enter the self-driving car market. The company has missed out on the smartphone boom, and the personal computer market is shrinking,” said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of automotive engineering at Daelim University. With an aim to shift its business model, Intel has been expanding investments in driverless technology. It recently acquired deep learning chipmaker Nervana Systems last year, and FPGA maker Altera in 2015. Intel and Mobileye had already been working together with BMW to test-drive 40 autonomous cars in the US this year. Autonomous driving technology is estimated to grow into a $25 billion market by 2025, according to global consulting firm Bain & Company. Intel created Automated Driving Group, a division dedicated to autonomous driving, spun out of the Internet of Things business last November. The chipmaker also launched a new brand for its software and hardware tools for the development of driverless vehicles, dubbed Intel GO, in January. Intel’s latest acquisition follows a slew of active acquisitions made between global information technology firms and auto parts makers. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics announced last week it had completed the acquisition of Harman International Industries, a US car and audio systems maker, at $8 billion. Last year, US ride-sharing company Uber Technologies spent $680 million in purchasing self-driving truck company Otto, established by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google executive. US carmaker General Motors acquired Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle software producer, for some $1 billion last July. Meanwhile, South Korea’s No. 1 mobile carrier SK Telecom is expected to benefit from the latest deal. The local firm is currently working with Intel, Mobileye and BMW to commercialize 5G-based autonomous driving services by 2021.

The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 per cent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. Merging 'eyes' and 'brain' Intel has a mixed record of capitalising on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 per cent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 per cent stake. Battle for self-control Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Image: Intel The wonderful networking opportunity that is working in tech 2 days ago102 Shares Sometimes, it seems as though tech workers have been placed on pedestals. How do you get to know the people behind the tech? In the current climate, tech workers can seem so celebrated that it’s hard to see them as real-life people with backgrounds and opinions. Obviously, that’s not the case. Here, Aine Munroe, a process engineer at Intel, talks us through her career path and the variety that comes with working in the STEM community. What drew you to this career area? I had completed an internship in Intel while doing my undergraduate and enjoyed it so much I came back. I always enjoyed maths and chemistry, and working in Intel as a process engineer is a daily mix of both! What’s the best thing about working in this area? Every day, I get to work on cutting-edge technology. There are lots of opportunities to solve complex problems and make improvements. What’s the most exciting development you’ve witnessed in your sector since you started working in it? Moving from 65-nanometre (nm) manufacturing to 14nm manufacturing at the Intel Ireland site has been very exciting. What aspect of your job did you struggle to get to grips with? Working in a 24/7 manufacturing environment means I work with four different shifts. It took me a while to get to know all the shifts in my area, but I attended the shift-to-shift pass-downs in the fab [plant] and gradually got to know everyone! What’s been the hardest thing you’ve had to face in your career? I had to relocate to Arizona as part of the technology transfer of 14nm technology. It was like starting a new job all over again, but getting involved with the new group from day one really helped integration into the Arizona site and it was a great experience. If you had the power to change anything within the STEM sector, what would that be? I would like to see more secondary school students considering a career in STEM. Which of your personality traits makes you best suited to your job and this sector? I like solving problems and that helps. Is there something in your personal life that helps you/has helped you in your job? I really enjoy baking, which is a science in itself. Baking is its own process, which I use a lot to compare to some of the processing we do in Intel. Need to bake your cake faster? How would you do that? You are cleaning up post-baking. Is it harder if you leave the bowls hanging around for hours? Why? How do you make connections with others in the STEM community? With so many people working onsite in Intel Ireland, I get to work with lots of people from different STEM backgrounds daily. In the morning, you might be working with a statistician on a technical paper. After lunch, it might be an environmental engineer about chemical waste. Has mentorship or coaching been important in your career? Yes, mentorship is an important part of my career. I have a mentor and I also mentor new engineers and a college student. What advice would you give to someone thinking about a career in your area? Go for it!

The company has just bought Mobileye, a pioneer in the autonomous driving sector, for a huge $15bn. See related  Tesla Autopilot review: We test Elon Musk’s autonomous tech in the UK BMW is putting IBM's Watson AI in the passenger seat You may not have heard of Mobileye – like many other automotive companies, their products are sourced by car makers and left unbranded. But since its creation in 1999, the Israeli company has become a leader in the autonomous sector. According to the Financial Times, its chips and cameras are installed in 15m vehicles, the company is in partnership with 25 automakers, and it has a 80% market share. When you see those figures, Intel’s acquisition makes a lot more sense. So why is Intel buying Mobileye? Mobileye might seem like a great company, but why is Intel buying it rather than, say, Mercedes-Benz? The answer is pretty simple. While car makers may label everything as their own, the truth is that much of the technology you see on the road today is developed by third party companies – including autonomous tech. And now, as growth in the smartphone and computer market slows, chip makers believe that driverless cars offer a new revenue stream. When you look at the amount of cars fitted with it, and the technology it’s using, there’s clearly huge scope for growth, and therefore a huge market for a chip maker like Intel. However, by buying Mobileye – a company which makes everything but chips for driverless vehicles – Intel can now offer a complete solution for car makers looking to buy driverless tech. Despite the high asking price, Intel is well aware of how much money it can make. In a speech last year, Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich said, “Together, we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving, and we see this market as growing to an over $70bn TAM [total addressable market] by 2030.” Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, told the BBC. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities". This isn’t a new trend either. For the last few years, nVidia has been hugely involved in the driverless tech market, while last year Qualcomm bought NXP for $47bn and Samsung bought Harman for $8bn.

Close Intel to buy Mobileye in $15.3B deal Viknesh Vijayenthiran Mar 14, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle Mobileye logoEnlarge Photo Intel on Monday agreed to pay $15.3 billion to  Mobileye, a leading supplier of driver assistance and self-driving technology. Mobileye’s claim to fame is its EyeQ technology which uses proprietary image recognition software to help self-driving cars see the world, and the company is already a supplier to over 20 automakers and automotive supply firms. Intel first got involved with Mobileye last summer when the two joined forces to help develop self-driving cars with BMW. As self-driving technology evolves, it will grow to rely on various data that experts estimate will average as much as 4,000 GB per day as early as 2020. The data will come from highly-detailed 3D maps, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, and advanced monitoring systems. Powerful and reliable computers will process the incoming data and then through artificial intelligence make decisions to control the vehicle. Thus, the latest deal will position Intel as a leader in the field by combining its data-crunching abilities with Mobileye’s sensor technology. In a statement, the combined companies said they will have proficiencies spanning connectivity, computer vision, data center, sensor fusion, high-performance computing, localization and mapping (via Mobileye's partnership with HERE), machine learning and artificial intelligence. As part of the deal, Intel will move its own self-driving car team to Mobileye’s headquarters in Israel. The combined team will be led by Mobileye Chairman, CTO and founder Amnon Shashua. Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. It’s why there are numerous rivals in this space including some automakers developing proprietary self-driving systems, as well as tech giants Uber, Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple (most likely), and a handful of smaller firms.

FILE PHOTO - Gameplayers demonstrate vitual reality headsets during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. on January 4, 2017.  The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise." The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo (GOOGL.O) to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O). Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC (DLPH.N), which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING 'EYES' AND 'BRAIN' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

It surfaced into the automotive scene at two occasions. The first, was when the company announced that it had split up with what appears to be the current leader in the autonomous driving space, Tesla. The second instance was when the chipmaker earlier this year announced that it was teaming up with automaker BMW and chipmaker Intel to collect high-definition map data for its self-driving cars. Today, we have learnt that Intel has agreed to buy Mobileye. $15.3 billion sounds like a pricey deal, and the move as Reuters rightfully pointed out will shake up the driverless car sector. While Mobileye is no small fry in the autonomous driving space, it is Intel who benefits the most out of this acquisition. Mobileye NV is a technology company that develops not just chips but entire vision-based technologies and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Its headquarters is located in Jerusalem, Israel and with a $15 billion dollar acquisition, it also makes Mobileye’s sale one of the biggest for the country and the largest exit in Israel’s tech industry till date. Mobileye early years The company was founded back in 1999 by Amnon Shashua. Shashua took his academic research a step further from what everyone else was up to at that time, by developing a vision system for vehicles, one that could detect vehicles on the road using just a camera and software running on a processor. It was and still is a big deal, as the price of a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system was a lot higher back then and today is a standard fitment on all self-driving vehicles that are currently under testing (except for a Tesla). The price tags for these modules have dropped by a fair margin today (earlier ones would cost as much as the whole car itself), but LiDAR prices continue to remain high, keeping today’s demand in the automotive sector in mind. The black LiDAR lump on top of this Waymo Chrysler Pacifica does not comes cheap. In times where automakers and technology giants like Google (and earlier Apple) are still struggling to push out a fully autonomous self-driving car, Mobileye’s chips are indeed worth a lot and will be a bigger deal when the self-driving race picks up in the near future. Moreover, thanks to Tesla (and its crazy videos) it is proven tech even though a software problem led to the death of a Tesla owner when using its experimental Autopilot system. So how and where does Intel come into the autonomous driving picture? Well, Intel had to step up its game. Late last year, its competitor, Qualcomm acquired NXP for $47 billion, a move that came after the company, who had already done well in Q2 2016, had now locked its horns onto the connected car, a space that is quickly growing, has fewer regulations to deal with and will pave the way for the first generation of autonomous cars. Looking at the way things are going, smartphones are the key products in the consumer electronics space (even Apple knows this) for the current day and for the next decade. It’s a product that’s closer to the customer, one that the consumer can carry about literally anywhere with them. It’s also a space that Qualcomm dominates like no other. There’s a chipset for every smartphone segment, wearable, IoT product and NXP adds to the number of platforms by adding cars to its bouquet. This also makes sense keeping Qualcomm’s designs for 5G future in mind. And by now, it gets crystal clear why Intel wants in. Intel in that same quarter saw a decline in profits, which was blamed on its restructuring. Moreover, Intel’s chips so far only connect the back end, chips that power the cloud, and on the front end for consumers, laptops and desktops. Intel’s push with processors or mobile phones was not so great and the company quickly withdrew after smartphone manufacturers like Asus themselves chose to switch over to Qualcomm. Which is why the move to acquire Mobileye at $15 billion seems like a steal of deal. It adds another platform for Intel, self-driving cars that will work with its current Intel GO platform and give them the best hardware bits in the business to offer 360 degree packages to manufacturers for autonomous cars (read Waymo). In fact, Intel is already working with Delphi to develop the same. Right now autonomous cars are the buzzword in the auto space since everyone out there is trying to push out the first wholly autonomous car, that is set for a world tied up with regulations that refuses to budge. Tesla has the perfect recipe, Uber is pursuing it, and Google along with auto manufacturers are still deciding. Heck even Nvidia is into autonomous cars and is even working with Baidu to build one from scratch. Intel’s now betting $15 billion on it so now let’s all hope it happens… soon, at least for Intel.

Mobile version Sign Up Login Home Lebanon Middle East World Business Sports Climate Change & Environment Entertainment Offbeat Culture Science Obituaries Technology Health Entrepreneurship Roundup En ع Intel Buying Israeli Car Tech Firm Mobileye for $15 Billion إقرأ هذا الخبر بالعربية by Naharnet Newsdesk 13 March 2017, 15:41 Comment 7 Tweet Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said Monday, in a deal signaling the U.S. computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm.  It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. - 'Data centers on wheels' - Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that "together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry." "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement. "It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers." The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. "As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centers on wheels," the statement said. "Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity." Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country's high-tech sector -- an industry that has given it the nickname the "start-up nation". "What's important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located," Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio. Intel has long had operations in Israel, opening its first development center in 1974.  In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

The system can be installed in your car to monitor speed limits and warn drivers of potential collisions. DETROIT — Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year’s end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver’s seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye’s technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. “They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market.” Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven’t aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel’s growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday’s deal combines Mobileye’s software with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees.

The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It’s likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup “confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors” threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That’s below Mobileye’s record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV’s stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel’s autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel.

By: Bloomberg | Updated: March 14, 2017 12:44 pm Intel will pay .54 per share in cash for Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes chips for cameras and driver-assistance features. (Source: Bloomberg) Intel Corp. will acquire Mobileye NV for about $15 billion, paying one of the highest takeover premiums this century to play catch-up in the market for technology that helps cars drive themselves. The US chipmaker will pay $63.54 per share in cash for Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes chips for cameras and driver-assistance features. The offer, the largest ever for an Israeli company, is a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. The shares surged 29 percent to $61.10 at 12:45 p.m. in New York. Intel stock dipped 1.8 percent to $35.28. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Intel is trying to accelerate a push into what many chip companies view as the next big opportunity: self-driving cars and the data they generate. With Mobileye, Intel gains the ability to offer automakers a larger package of components they will need as vehicles become more autonomous. The Santa Clara, California-based company estimates the market for vehicle systems, data and services will be worth as much as $70 billion by 2030. “They’re paying a huge premium in order to catch up, to get into the front of the line, rather than attempt to build from scratch,” said Mike Ramsey, an analyst with technology researcher Gartner. Mobileye has been pushing to sign up more carmakers for its advanced products. (Source: Bloomberg) The deal is the third most expensive acquisition in the technology industry this century, based on transactions over $5 billion and Mobileye’s trailing 12 month earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The deal gives Mobileye an enterprise value of about 29.5 times this year’s projected sales, according to Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. That’s more than 10 times the average of companies in the US benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shashua and Aviram Mobileye was founded in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram and made its name with systems that alert drivers to pedestrians, unintended lane departures and speed limit violations. The technology, which can also trigger braking to prevent an accident, counts General Motors Co. among its customers. Recently, Mobileye has been pushing to sign up more carmakers for its advanced products, such as technology that collects data from vehicle fleets to build a real-time, crowd-sourced mapping service. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. invested $100 million in 2007 for a minority stake in Mobileye. Intel will combine its existing autonomous vehicle technology unit with Mobileye and the new group will be run in Israel by Shashua, the companies said in a statement. “Shashua is the personification of car safety and autonomous driving,” said Shmuel Harlap, chairman of car importer Colmobil Ltd. and Mobileye’s biggest shareholder. “Just look at his quarrel with Elon Musk and you understand the personality.” Last year, Musk’s electric carmaker Tesla Inc. stopped using Mobileye’s systems and the two companies argued publicly about the breakup. The Israeli company expressed concerns about the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot hands-free highway driving feature, while Tesla accused the supplier of trying to block its in-house efforts to develop computer vision capabilities for cars. Mobileye was founded in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram and made its name with systems that alert drivers to pedestrians, unintended lane departures and speed limit violations. (Source: Mobileye) While Intel’s chips are dominant in personal computers and data centers, the world’s largest semiconductor maker has struggled to spread the use of its products to other areas where semiconductors based on ARM Holdings Plc. designs have prevailed. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, Intel has sought to break into everything from drones to cash registers. That hasn’t fired up Intel’s overall sales growth yet, leaving the company reliant on PCs and servers for its profit. Mobileye is the second-biggest acquisition for Intel after Altera Corp., which it bought in 2015 for $16.7 billion. As of the end of 2016, Intel held about 80 percent of its $17.1 billion in cash and equivalents overseas. It could use some or all of that to buy Mobileye, a potentially efficient use of cash that would be taxed more if brought back to the U.S. The company had total debt of $25.3 billion at the end of last year. On a conference call with analysts, Krzanich said the deal will immediately add to Intel’s adjusted earnings and cash flow. But the acquisition won’t have much impact on revenue. Last year, Intel reported sales of $59 billion compared with Mobileye’s $358 million.”We are looking beyond just the revenue it’s going to grow into,” the Intel CEO told Bloomberg Television. “If you look at where autonomous vehicles are going, you have to make a deal in order to be there in 2021 when models hit the road.” Qualcomm Rivalry In the highly competitive market for autonomous cars, Intel’s purchase is a shot at rival Qualcomm Inc. The mobile phone chipmaker is in the process of making itself the world’s biggest producer of chips used by the automotive industry through its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV. “Intel are so far behind in this space the only way they could catch up was via an acquisition,” said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Northern Trust Securities. In the highly competitive market for autonomous cars, Intel’s purchase is a shot at rival Qualcomm Inc. (Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Carmakers and technology companies are scrambling to stake out a leading market position. Intel’s chips are already in 30 vehicle models currently on the road and are being used in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles, the company said in January. Intel and Mobileye had already teamed up with BMW AG and plan to introduce fully autonomous cars by 2021. The companies are dispatching a fleet of 40 self-driving 7-Series sedans this year to hone systems for complex urban traffic. $2 Trillion Alphabet Inc.’s Google has clocked more than 2 million self-driving test miles on public roads, Tesla has gathered data from 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles, and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG has partnered with Uber Technologies Inc. Much of Mobileye’s success was to the fact that it was first in its field. (Image for representation, Source: Bloomberg) Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last year, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. Volkswagen AG is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing and other mobility services. Mercedes already offers cars that can pilot themselves at highway speeds.

In an interview earlier this year he attributed much of Mobileye’s success to the fact that it was first in its field. Intel Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan said the company expects to see $175 million a year in cost and tax savings from the transaction and that this will help cover the premium Intel is paying for Mobileye.

The cash deal of $63.54 (R832) a share marks the largest purchase of a company solely focused on the self-driving sector and could significantly alter the competitive landscape among key technology and systems suppliers, including chip-makers Nvidia and Qualcomm and systems integrator Delphi Automotive. Mobileye’s shares jumped 30 percent to $61.30 (R803) in late-morning US trading, while Intel’s shares were down 2 percent. Share this story The Mobileye logo on a screen at the post where it trades on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Intel is said to be positioning itself for a dominant role in the fast-moving autonomous-driving sector.Photo: AP Shares of Delphi, which has partnerships with both companies, were up 3 percent. The deal underscores the expanding alliances between vehicle makers and their suppliers as they race to develop self-driving cars, a concept that once seemed a science-fiction dream but is drawing closer to reality. While Intel is known for hardware chips and Mobileye for collision detection and mapping software, the merger promises to create an expanded portfolio of technologies needed for driverless vehicles. It also strengthens Intel’s position in the sector against rival chip-makers Nvidia and Qualcomm. Opportunities The Intel-Mobileye portfolio includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software, and data fusion and management. “It’s an area where (Intel) has had very little presence - the automotive market - and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” Betsy van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical The price seems fair,” she added. The offer represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 (R616) on Friday. Intel will integrate its automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations, with the combined entity being run by Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua from Israel. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the “eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car”. Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: “If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player. The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data.” Read also: Job cuts loom as Intel looks to future Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last year after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla’s Autopilot system. Intel said it expected the vehicle systems, data and services market to rise to $70billion (R917bn) by 2030. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70percent of the global market for driver- assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3million last year. Analysts said that mounting a counter-bid would be difficult because Shashua would remain in charge and the combined entity would be based in Israel. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7percent of the company. Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German vehicle maker BMW on a project to put a fleet of about 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Partnership At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery in about 2021. Mobileye has also partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chip-makers seeking to make inroads in the market. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry’s largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later this year.  Reuters Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Garsfontein reels after double killing horror 2 'I was beaten and robbed because train was late' 3 'Car thieves laugh at us' say KZN residents 4 Toilet lock-up officials 'severely traumatised' 5 Net1 boss dares state Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Mobileye’s suite of autonomous tech including cameras, sensor hardware and the software and processors that run them will be added to Intel’s current self-driving technology portfolio when the deal is finalised by the end of this year. Mobileye’s shares have been valued at $63.54 ($A84.23) per share, totalling $14.7b ($A19.5b) enterprise value, but Intel has predicted that by 2030, market opportunity in vehicle data systems will climb to as much as $70b ($A92b). Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement to employees that computing technology will play an increasing role in the automotive sector, and will eventually be considered more important than the mechanics of a vehicle. In his speech Mr Krzanich claimed that “Data is the new oil”, and added that the question of “what’s under the hood” will “increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.” Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population. “At four terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3000 people. Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population,” he said. “This massive amount of data requires all of Intel’s assets to provide the cost-effective high-performance solutions our customers need. “I believe that today’s announcement puts us in the driver’s seat to achieve our vision of creating the technology foundation on which the future of autonomous driving will be built.”  Mobileye’s centre in Israel will be used to headquarter the newly-named Automated Driving Group, and will be headed by existing Mobileye chairman Amnon Shashua. The newly-merged company will go up against the likes of Qualcomm and Nvidia in the race for automated technology development. The purchase will have obvious knock-on implications for vehicle brands who are looking to establish relationships with technology firms to co-develop self-driving tech. Mobileye has existing partnerships with Volkswagen Group and BMW Group in developing autonomous cars, which could put the heat on rival Nvidia, who is partnered with VW Group-owned Audi. The other heavy-hitter is Qualcomm Technologies, who finalised a deal to purchase car electronics manufacturer NXP, and has existing ties with both Daimler and Renault. According to Mobileye co-founder, president and CEO Ziv Aviram, Intel will now be a more lucrative option for car-makers looking to develop autonomous technologies with Mobileye on board. “By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centres and high-performance computing platforms,” he said. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” Both companies will continue with business as usual until the merger is finalised at the end of the year.

Mobileye to be sold to Intel in $15.3 billion deal - Poland Sun Volume 076/15 Poland Sun        http://www.polandsun.com   Poland News Europe News Breaking Business News Breaking Sports News Science News Breaking Sports News Lifestyle News Travel News Breaking Health News Public Health News Arts News Breaking Financial Markets News Mobileye to be sold to Intel in $15.3 billion deal Poland Sun Tuesday 14th March, 2017 • This was the latest investment by a technology company in future of self-driving cars • Mobileye makes chip-based camera systems that power semi-automated driving features • Mobileye shares rose 31 percent to $61.77 in premarket trading, Intel shares fell 1.1 percent to $35.51 CALIFORNIA, U.S. - In yet another deal that displays the increasing interest in self-driving cars, that the Silicon Valley has dubbed as the future - Intel Corp decided to buy Mobileye. The Israeli technology firm, Mobileye makes chip-based camera systems that power semi-automated driving features. The deal worth $15.3 billion, values Mobileye at $63.54 a share, which is a 34 percent premium to its closing price Friday.  After the deal was announced on Monday, Mobileye shares rose 31 percent to $61.77 in premarket trading, while Intel shares fell 1.1 percent to $35.51. The deal became one of the largest ones to date.  Jerusalem-based Mobileye is working on putting its chip-based camera systems in the center of self-driving cars of the future. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a note to employees that the deal "merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.”  Krzanich added, “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower." With a prior collaboration already in place, between Intel, Mobileye and BMW AG - to put about 40 self-driving cars on the road in test mode, the acquisition paves the way to Intel’s future in the domain. Both the companies said in a statement that the deal provides Intel with closer relationships to suppliers and car makers.  Further, Mobileye informed executives that Intel's existing automated-driving efforts will be integrated into the company, based in Israel and run by its existing leaders. The transaction will add to Intel's adjusted per-share earnings and is expected to close in the next nine months. Mobileye currently accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems.  The company employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.

"It's immoral, it's short-sighted, and it is not going to benefit this nation. We cannot lose our fundamental beliefs in human rights and human dignity." His largest piece so far, the 70-meter (230-foot)-long black rubber boat hangs from the ceiling at the National Gallery's Trade Fair Palace. The site-specific installation that went on exhibit Thursday was made in a Chinese factory that produces dinghies used by actual refugees, Ai said. The 59-year-old artist has exhibited similar works elsewhere. He used 14,000 discarded life vests collected from the beaches of Lesbos to wrap the columns of Berlin's Konzerthaus and to create lotus blossoms floating on a pond in Vienna's Belvedere park. The artist also posed as Alan Kurdi, a Syrian toddler whose lifeless body was famously photographed lying face-down on a Lesbos pebble beach. Ai was criticized for exploiting the child's tragic death. More than 1.2 million people have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe since 2015, data from the International Organization for Migration show. According to the European Commission, the Czech Republic has so far accepted 12 migrants for relocation.

The company is cutting 784 jobs at its facility in Washington County. (Laura Rauch/The Associated Press, 2010)   By Mark Scott The New York Times March 14, 2017   Today’s Business stories Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rate .25 percent, sees more increases as U.S. economy improves Lane County home sales transforms to ‘super sellers’ market, expert says U.S. homebuilders’ optimism surges to 12-year high in March McDonald’s tests mobile ordering, payments Americans spent slightly more at retail stores last month More Business »   In the world of driverless cars, household names like Google and Uber have raced ahead of rivals, building test vehicles and starting trials on city streets. But when it comes to what is under the hood, a wide array of lesser-known companies are looking to supply the technology required to bring such driverless cars to the masses. And in a $15.3 billion deal announced on Monday, Intel made a play to corner the market on how much of that technology is developed. The chipmaker’s acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles, is one of the largest in the fast-growing sector and sets the stage for increasing competition between Silicon Valley giants as well as traditional automakers over who will dominate the world of autonomous cars. The likes of Google and Uber have already invested billions of dollars in their own technology, signing partnerships with automakers like Chrysler and Volvo and sending test vehicles onto the road in a bid to cement their place in the industry. The sector is estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, according to Bain & Co., the consultancy firm. Faced with an existential threat to its legacy computer business, Intel — alongside competitors like Qualcomm — has focused on autonomous cars as a new and potentially lucrative market. Many of these driverless vehicles, experts say, will require immense computing power, including the latest microchips able to crunch reams of data in seconds to keep the cars on the road and safe. And by acquiring Mobileye, whose digital vision technology allows autonomous vehicles to safely navigate city streets, Intel aims to broaden its offerings beyond just chips to a wider suite of products that driverless vehicles will require. It hopes, as a result, to appeal to automakers that want to offer autonomous driving but lack the in-house expertise and do not want to rely on the likes of Google. “Scale is going to win in this market,” Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, told investors on Monday. “I don’t believe that every carmaker can invest to do independent development into autonomous cars.” Intel has a history with such strategic moves. It cornered the personal computer market during more than three decades, supplying hundreds of millions of desktop computers with much of their internal architecture, after dominating which microchips were used in the industry. But in recent years, Intel has struggled to find its feet as people’s habits have increasingly turned to the mobile world, where the company’s chips have lost out to rivals. Last year, for instance, the company announced that it was laying off 12,000 people, or 11 percent of its global workforce, as demand for personal computers continued to decline. While Intel still makes more than half of its annual revenue from traditional computing chipmaking operations, the company’s sales from its “internet of things” division, a unit that includes its burgeoning automaking team, grew 15 percent in 2016, to $2.6 billion, according to regulatory filings. During the last 18 months, Intel has signed partnership deals with BMW and Delphi Automotive, an auto parts supplier, to expand its presence in the field. It also acquired a 15 percent stake in Here, a digital mapping business owned by a consortium of German automakers, and announced last year that it would invest $250 million in startups working on driverless car technologies. Mobileye, founded in Jerusalem in 1999, has signed deals with several automakers, including Audi, for the use of its vision and camera technology, which uses machine-learning and complex neuroscience to help drivers — and increasingly cars themselves — avoid obstacles on the road. It also has long-standing ties with Intel. The chipmaker was a partner with Mobileye and BMW last year over efforts to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021. In January, the companies announced plans to have up to 40 autonomous cars on American and European roads by the end of this year as part of initial trials. As that collaboration grew, Intel and Mobileye executives began talking about a potential takeover at the end of December, holding meetings, mostly in New York, to complete a deal that will see Mobileye’s executives take the lead in Intel’s new expanded efforts. “This deal makes Intel a tier-one partner for the automotive industry,” said Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, a technology research company in Munich. “As the industry moves towards autonomous driving, new types of digital suppliers like Intel are developing quickly.” Intel’s efforts to stamp a claim on driverless cars represents a recognition that chipmaking rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm had moved slightly ahead in the race to provide the computing power needed for autonomous vehicles. As part of the deal, Intel said it would buy Mobileye’s outstanding shares at $63.54 a share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. The acquisition requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to close by the end of 2017. Much of Intel’s success will depend on Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, who has a doctorate in brain and cognitive sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Part of Shashua’s plan is to have cars with Mobileye’s advanced driver assist systems collect imaging and location data that can be used to create what the company calls RoadBook — a vast digital map of roadways in the United States and Europe. The goal, Shashua said, is to provide carmakers with a complete product line of digital services that go beyond what they can do for themselves. “The collaboration that we want to do can’t happen if we are two different organizations,” he said on Monday. “The collaboration already runs deep.” Despite Intel’s high hopes for autonomous cars, experts say such vehicles are unlikely to hit the roads by the end of the decade, at the earliest, because regulators are beginning to question which rules such cars should follow and because companies are struggling to make the technology work seamlessly. Uber, the ride-booking service, halted its driverless car tests in California after local officials said the company did not have the required permits, though its tests in Pittsburgh are continuing. Google’s own efforts ran into difficulties after the company’s driverless cars were involved in a spate of collisions. And in Europe, regulators are divided on the issue of self-driving cars, causing the automotive industry to complain that the delays could hamper plans to take the technology to the Continent’s streets. Still, with technology companies and global automakers making hefty — and costly — bets on autonomous cars, experts that say more deals like Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye are likely to follow as firms jostle for position. More acquisitions, said Birkner of Gartner, “are an absolute necessity.” “Carmakers and Silicon Valley companies,” he said, “are realizing that they both bring different skills to the table.” More Business articles »     RG Business Local business news sent to your inbox every Thursday.         Today’s Business stories Business Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rate .25 percent, sees more increases as U.S. economy improves Housing Lane County home sales transforms to ‘super sellers’ market, expert says Business U.S. homebuilders’ optimism surges to 12-year high in March Business Wall Street bonuses average $138,210 Business McDonald’s tests mobile ordering, payments Business Americans spent slightly more at retail stores last month Business Audi German headquarters searched in emissions probe Business EU approves proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner Business Briefly Nation     Opinion Editorial Paying for parks City officials need to build support for proposals Eugene city officials are mulling four options for improving the city’s parks and recreation system over the next 30 years.

From staff and wire reports Intel buying Mobileye in bid for self-driving car technology Intel is buying Mobileye for about $15.3 billion as the race for self-driving car technology heats up. The chip giant based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it will pay $63.54 a share in cash for the Jerusalem-based maker of camera systems for autonomous vehicles. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a message to employees that “this acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” The two companies are no strangers to each other’s technology. Last summer, they announced a partnership with BMW to create an open platform for self-driving cars. U.S. aluminum group files complaint against China China appealed to Washington to refrain from imposing sanctions on Chinese aluminum suppliers after U.S. producers filed a complaint against them in the Trump administration’s first trade case. An industry group, the Aluminum Association, accused Chinese producers of selling at unfairly low prices that hurt foreign competitors in the case filed Thursday. It asked the U.S. Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping duties of 38 percent to 134 percent on aluminum foil for consumer and industrial uses. A flood of low-cost Chinese aluminum exports has pushed global prices so low that U.S. and European smelters are closing. Producers say thousands of jobs are at risk.

Intel Corp. said Monday it will acquire the Israeli firm. (Photo: Richard Drew / AP) 10 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Mobileye NV Chairman Amnon Shashua didn’t mince words when a group of Michigan CEOs dropped by headquarters in Jerusalem 16 months ago: Silicon Valley, he said, is “not interested in automotive.” It sure is now. Intel Corp. said Monday it will acquire the Israeli maker of digital automotive cameras and sensors for $15.3 billion. The move is validation by one of the valley’s heaviest heavyweights that the battle for autonomous driving will be waged with data collected under the metaphorical hood. The global auto industry and its high-tech rivals are scrambling for leadership in the emerging mobility sector of car-sharing, self-driving cars and everything in between — and Intel’s move is a sign that the pace is quickening. At stake are positions in the $70 billion vehicle systems space and a worldwide transportation services business Ford Motor Co. pegs at $10 trillion annually. “Many of you have asked why we think autonomous cars and vehicles are so important to Intel’s future,” CEO Brian Krzanich wrote to Intel employees Monday. “The answer is data. At four terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3,000 people. “Put just one million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population. The addition of Mobileye to our family provides the data path to our computing solutions becoming the intelligent set of eyes that will allow a vehicle to see and define the world around it.” Mobileye and Intel already partner with Delphi Automotive PLC on a self-driving car system the three showcased in January at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Mobileye’s digital vision systems are the eyes transmitting the contours of the outside world to Intel processors, which then issue commands to drive the car. In a note to investors, Wells Fargo Securities LLC called the Intel-Mobileye tie-up a “positive” for the three-way partnership and said it means the “autonomous drive platform can accelerate.” Emphasis on accelerate, an apt metaphor for the mobility fervor sweeping the auto and tech industries. While President Donald Trump and his economic nationalist message cast attention on the auto industry’s traditional decision-making on plant investments, product allocation and blue-collar job creation — notes the president is likely to hit when he comes to Michigan on Wednesday — the real action in the industry continues to be in mobility. It commands increasing amounts of attention from auto industry CEOs, even as a new White House and near-record sales focus interest on the cars, pickups and SUVs that still account for all their automotive revenue and profits. And the mobility craze is proving Mobileye’s Shashua wrong: Silicon Valley is very interested in next-generation automotive because that’s where growth and profits are. More, leaders in both industries have tempered their historic arrogance and come to understand that neither has the technical capability to master mobility without the other. That’s why Google’s Waymo is partnering with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on self-driving vans. It’s also why Apple for now is scaling back its autonomous car ambitions; getting there ain’t easy. Intel’s move is a simultaneous play for two trends animating deal-making in mobility: the bids for capability and scale. Same for General Motors Co.’s acquisition of Cruise Automation, its investment in Lyft Technologies Inc. and its creation of the Maven car-sharing brand; to get capability and scale, mobility players are buying it or leveraging what they already own. What Intel’s move likely is not is the beginning of a tech industry roll-up of the auto supply space. Too many of the industry’s largest suppliers still produce low-margin commodity products for today’s car and truck business, hardly the high-margin whiz-bang gadgetry that makes a “pure play” acquisition like Mobileye so attractive to Intel. The same logic holds for automakers. The “haves” like GM, Ford, Toyota Motor Corp. and Germany’s Big Three are investing in mobility to grow their business, to answer rising demands from China and the European Union to deliver emissions-free mobility solutions in crowded cities, to fatten profit margins and reduce capital investment in traditional manufacturing. Think of it this way: California-based Intel gets the techy present and future of the next-generation auto industry without the past burdens of Old Auto baggage. The biggest beneficiaries of any trend signified by the Intel-Mobileye deal are likely to be tech startups whose expertise can strengthen the pushes for integration and scale. The biggest players in both industries — from GM, Ford and Toyota to Intel, Apple and Google — are in what appears to be a continual hunt for capability that can bolster their chances to emerge as major players in a space that accounts for little, if any, revenue and profit. Outside of the car- and ride-sharing businesses, mobility is an if-come play. But it’s real. And the surest way to know is to follow the money going after the technologies most likely to make it happen.

PHOTO: YOUTUBE Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said Monday, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant’s commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. – ‘Data centres on wheels’ – Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry”. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. “As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels,” the statement said. “Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity.” Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country’s high-tech sector — an industry that has given it the nickname the “start-up nation”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with Aviram to congratulate him, a statement from the premier’s office said. “The deal dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is being realised,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is becoming a global technology centre not only in the field of cyber but also the automotive field.” Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio that “what’s important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located”. The centre for work on the combined autonomous vehicle will be Mobileye’s headquarters in Jerusalem, the firms said. Aviram told Netanyahu that a global development centre will be established in Israel and “will be responsible all the international activity of Intel’s autonomous cars”, the statement from the premier’s office said. Intel has long operated in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

Under the agreement, a special subsidiary of Intel will begin a tender offer to acquire all Mobileye shares for $63.54 each, all in cash. Intel says the deal will allow it to combine its computing and connectivity expertise and Mobileye’s leading computer vision expertise for future semi-autonomous and fully-autonomous vehicles. In a letter to employees, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said “The acquisition of Mobileye brings together the assets of Intel’s Xeon processors, FPGAs, 3D XPoint memory, and 5G modems with the world leader in automotive computer vision. This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car.” Mobileye once provided the autonomous hardware for Tesla but split last year. Nevertheless, the company is working with numerous established automakers and startups to bring its technology to the streets, including BMW, General Motors and Lucid. Intel expects the vehicle systems, data and services market to be valued at up to $70 billion by 2030.

Global chipmaker Intel had last September spun out McAfee as a separate company with private equity player TPG owning 51% share in the new entity. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. “One of our largest sites around the world is in Bangalore. We continue to invest in that. “We are actually adding new functions into the site there,” Intel SecurityGeneral Manager and SVP Christopher Young told PTI. “Under Intel, it was primarily development centre, but now we are adding finance, IT, HR to that site as well to support the new (unit),” Young added. While Young declined to comment on investment or specific number of jobs to be created, he said the new roles will be created “over the course of the year”. “India is one of our fastest growing markets. We have been growing in the double digits over the last several years and we expect to continue that trajectory and that is across public and private sector,” he said. India is “a really unique place” as apart from contributing to global development, there is a “healthy growing local market here”, he added. “We will continue to invest heavily into that duality,” Young said. McAfee, which has been a part of Intel as Intel Security Group, had witnessed 20% year-on-year growth in 2016. It has close to 2,000 people in India with over 1,700 engineers. “Revenues are growing double digits in India, so I expect that India over the next couple years could easily be one of our top markets,” said Young, who will be the CEO of the new company. Chipmaker Intel had acquired McAfee in 2011for $7.7 billion to build security features directly into its silicon products. The company’s business had $1.1billion in revenue in the first half of 2016, up 11% increase from the same period last year.

Next Article Smart condo conundrum: Talk to appliances, or text them? Tools  Print  Email Share This JERUSALEM/DETROIT--Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers.   The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business.   It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups.   The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035.   Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price.   Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management.   "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added.   Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise."   The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end.   Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015.   Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent.   The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC, which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies.Merging 'Eyes' and 'Brain' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion.   Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car."   Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data."   Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system.   Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.   Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake.Battle for Self-Control Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year.   At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems.   Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia.   The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.

Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than US $15 billion, the companies said on Tuesday, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately US $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German auto maker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to US $70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global auto makers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that "together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry". "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement.

(AFP Photo) JERUSALEM: Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said Monday, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately $15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars.

"We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement. "It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers." The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. "As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels," the statement said. "Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel's strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity." Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country's high-tech sector -- an industry that has given it the nickname the "start-up nation". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with Aviram to congratulate him, a statement from the premier's office said. "The deal dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is being realised," Netanyahu said. "Israel is becoming a global technology centre not only in the field of cyber but also the automotive field." Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio that "what's important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located". The centre for work on the combined autonomous vehicle will be Mobileye's headquarters in Jerusalem, the firms said. Aviram told Netanyahu that a global development centre will be established in Israel and "will be responsible all the international activity of Intel's autonomous cars", the statement from the premier's office said. Intel has long operated in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended little changed in light volume on Monday, with traders eyeing a Federal Reserve meeting expected to result in an interest rate increase later this week. The S&P 500 traded in its tightest range of the year, in and out of slight losses, while the CBOE Volatility index <.VIX> was on track to close at its lowest in more than a week. Shares of Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) jumped nearly 30 percent to a high of $61.51 after chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) agreed to buy the driverless technology maker for $15.3 billion. Mobileye closed up 28.2 percent at $60.62 and Intel fell 2.1 percent to $35.16. Investors looked ahead to the Fed's two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Traders saw a 94 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. "Other than the Fed on Wednesday, I don’t see anything going on to make any (investment) decisions on," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "Intel buying Mobileye is the story of the day, moving into that market sector," he said, adding that they advised some clients to "fade in" into Intel stocks. "We think this is a very good support point," said Mendelsohn. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) rose 2.8 percent to $101.85 while Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH) added 4.0 percent to $80.20. Both are involved in developing technology for cars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 21.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.87 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,373.47 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 14.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,875.78. After the bell, U.S.-traded shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: VRX) dropped 9.3 percent to $10.98 after investor William Ackman, who had been its biggest cheerleader for two years as the share price climbed and then plummeted, on Monday said his hedge fund had sold its entire position. During regular trading hours, Citrix Systems (NASDAQ: CTXS) jumped 6.8 percent to $84.93 after Bloomberg reported that the cloud-services company is working with advisers to seek potential suitors. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) gained 4.8 percent to $104.30 after Morgan Stanley reiterated its "buy" rating and said the company could gain a meaningful market share in Macau. About 6.18 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.93 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 48 new lows. The S&P 500's average true range hit 5.9, its lowest of the year. The year-to-date average of that daily measure of volatility is 14. (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Jonathan Oatis) Serious News for Serious Traders!

Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at just over $14 billion, the latest push by a major tech company to advance autonomous vehicles that could change the way traffic moves globally. (AP/Richard Drew) Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is interviewed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, March 13, 2017. Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at about $15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology.(AP/Richard Drew) Read also: Google finally bids farewell to manual captchas But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven't aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It's likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup "confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors" threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That's below Mobileye's record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV's stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel's autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel. __________ Aron Heller in Jerusalem, Michael Liedtke in San Francisco and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.

Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than USD 15 billion, the companies said, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately USD 15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to USD 70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that "together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry". "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative," he said in the statement. tags #BMW #innovation #Intel #Israeli car tech #Mobileye #PTI #Technology #vehicles #Volkswagen #Wire News #World News Related news Business BMW to hike prices by up to 2% from April in India BY sandeep sinha Mar 16, 2017 08:19 PM World Eight injured in French school shooting, one arrested - sources BY Deepak Kumar Mar 16, 2017 07:04 PM World Trump proposes USD 1.1 trillion budget; defence spending up by USD 54 bn BY sandeep sinha Mar 16, 2017 06:42 PM Business No country for populism: Dutch PM Rutte fends off far-right's Wilders BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 03:33 PM Business Fed rate hike marks normalisation of US monetary policy: Fitch BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 12:01 PM World Apple, Google, Facebook skip legal challenge to new travel ban BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 10:10 AM Business Renault CEO Ghosn targeted in French diesel probe BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 10:05 AM Business Hawaii judge halts Trump's new travel ban before it can go into effect BY Faizan Javed Mar 16, 2017 09:59 AM Business Fed obliges markets, but Trump could play spoilsport BY Shweta Mungre Mar 16, 2017 08:58 AM News Most Popular Top News Copper to trade in 387.1-396.9 range: Achiievers Equities Preview: RBI seen cutting rates, but it will be a close call Silver to trade in 41719-42623 range: Achiievers Equities Crude oil to trade in 3534-3662 range: Achiievers Equities Are markets simply high or on a high? 10 reforms which are still work-in-progress These stocks are as hot as the coming summer, but valuations need to cool Market cheers Fed rate hike: Nifty, Midcap at record closing high Decks cleared for GST rollout from July 1 see more Video of the day See Nifty at 10,300 in March 2018 with 2 caveats; like private banks: IL&FS Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Gamechanger Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch Power your Ttade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info info@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

The purchase, scheduled to close by year's end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three-to-five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver's seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye's technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. "They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market." Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven't aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel's growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday's deal combines Mobileye's software with Intel's hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees.

Self-driving cars are widely seen as the future of transportation and a growth area, but the Intel deal depends on more than technology as it looks to expand revenue in an increasingly competitive nascent sector. The company's largest-ever deal, the $16.7 billion acquisition of programmable chipmaker Altera, has so far failed to meet its objective of helping to offset the continued decline in Intel's larger PC business. Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock "underperform", notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel's Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company's Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said that Intel has previously attempted to fold acquisitions into its structure but they have not always been the right fit. Intel's deals for embedded systems software maker Wind River Systems and McAfee exemplified that strategy. "One of the things Intel has tried to do in the past is that they've taken a square peg, and they have taken a round hole, and tried to put it in a square peg," said Van Hees, who rates Intel a "buy". Intel, which is the largest private employer in Israel, hopes to bank on its experience to maintain Mobileye's startup culture, bringing Mobileye's "quick moving, fast acting culture" into Intel's autonomous driving division, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. Intel, which has been looking to shift away from its traditional business, missed the smartphone boom in the last decade but analysts hope the company will avoid a repeat. "Investors should be pleased with the perspective that they(Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early," according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

Intel also spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, last year in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, about five years after having bought the anitvirus software maker for $7.7 billion. "We can recall few cases where so much has been spent(habitually) to buy so little," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Rasgon, who rates the stock "underperform", notes Intel has spent over $30 billion in the last few years, while only adding about $2 to $3 billion in revenue. Perhaps learning from those missteps, Intel's Mobileye deal is uniquely structured. The Santa Clara-based company's Automated Driving Group (ADG) will combine with Mobileye and will be led by Mobileye Chief Executive Amnon Shashua. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said that Intel has previously attempted to fold acquisitions into its structure but they have not always been the right fit. Intel's deals for embedded systems software maker Wind River Systems and McAfee exemplified that strategy. "One of the things Intel has tried to do in the past is that they've taken a square peg, and they have taken a round hole, and tried to put it in a square peg," said Van Hees, who rates Intel a "buy". Intel, which is the largest private employer in Israel, hopes to bank on its experience to maintain Mobileye's startup culture, bringing Mobileye's "quick moving, fast acting culture" into Intel's autonomous driving division, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call with analysts. Intel, which has been looking to shift away from its traditional business, missed the smartphone boom in the last decade but analysts hope the company will avoid a repeat. "Investors should be pleased with the perspective that they(Intel) are getting in on this trend fairly early," according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

The Intel deal may be the harbinger of more Israeli auto tech companies' success. Richard Drew/AP Israel as a lab for smart transportation An exit drought, or has Israeli high-tech matured? Israeli firm invests in Intel chip to power self-driving vehicles The biggest beneficiaries from Intel’s decision to spend $15.3 billion on the Israeli driverless-technology firm Mobileye will be the company’s shareholders, founders and senior executives, who stand to enjoy profits in excess of $3 billion. But the Israeli government won’t be far behind, collecting a tax windfall that could add up to more than $1 billion. Shmuel Harlap, a founder of Colmobil (which imports Mitsubishi and Hyundai cars into Israel), is Mobileye’s principal outside shareholder: His 7 percent  stake will be worth about $1 billion under the terms of the sale. Mobileye’s cofounders – Amnon Shashua, who is also chairman and chief technology officer, and CEO Ziv Aviram – own 7.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, and will also be getting $1 billion-plus. Unlike Harlap, who was one of the company’s first investors and says he never sold any of his shares, Aviram and Shashua have already earned big profits on their Mobileye shares: they have been selling them on the stock exchange over the last two and a half years. Based on filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Shashua had sold some $200 million worth of shares to date, including $45 million last year, while Aviram had sold $240 million worth of shares, including $80 million last year. Harlap’s business relies less on borrowing than many other Israeli tycoons, so he could afford to retain the shares even when their price peaked in 2015 and he could have sold them for $1.2 billion, industry sources said. Harlap had expected the company to reach a higher valuation than the one reflected by the Intel deal. According to Mobileye’s financial reports, the company’s managers and workers have 29 million in stock options they haven’t exercised. Of these, 19 million have already vested, but options vesting is typically accelerated during an acquisition. The options can be exercised at an average price of $21, which means an average profit of $42.50 a share because Intel will be buying Mobileye stock at $63.54 a share. All told, that adds up to a combined $1.2 billion for Mobileye’s managers and employees. Among those with the biggest payouts are Gaby Hayon, senior vice president for research and development, who is due $11.3 million; Chief Financial Officer Ofer Maharshak ($7 million); and board member Eyal Desheh ($6.3 million). According to the website Stocker, the biggest winner among Mobileye’s institutional investors will be Menora Mivtachim, whose 941,000 shares are worth $60 million. Other institutions hold smaller quantities of shares worth only a few million apiece. Shashua, Aviram and Harlap face a capital gains tax of 25 percent to 30 percent, in addition to a tax surcharge of 3 percent. As a result, they’re expected to pay over $1 billion in taxes on the $3.3 billion they receive from Intel, including options that vest within the next month. In shekel terms, that comes to about 3.7 billion shekels in taxes to the Tax Authority. To illustrate how big a windfall that will be for the treasury, the government’s recently completed tax amnesty program is expected to bring in about 2 billion shekels over the two and a half years it ran. The next three largest shareholders – Hayon, Maharshak and Desheh, with about 100,000 to 200,000 shares each – are expected to pay a total of a few tens of millions of shekels in capital gains tax. Tax rules allow employees exercising stock options to classify the profits earnings not as wages but as capital gains. Even in cases where the two-year period required for reporting the sale as capital gains has not yet ended, they can leave the money with a trustee until the period ends and pay only the 25 percent capital gains tax rate – a major saving.

Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately US$15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to US$70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. ‘Data centres on wheels’ Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. “As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels,” the statement said. “Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity.” Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country’s high-tech sector — an industry that has given it the nickname the “start-up nation”. “What’s important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located,” Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio. Intel has long had operations in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to US$6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Horizon Zero Dawn’ passes 2.6 million sales, sets specific record Want to protect your smartphone?

U.S. microprocessor giant Intel said Monday that it has agreed to buy Mobileye, an Israeli developer of driverless technologies, for 15.3 billion U.S. dollars, a record sum for an Israeli high-tech firm. (Xinhua/JINI) SAN FRANCISCO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. and Mobileye N.V. announced Monday an agreement under which the U.S. computer chipmaker would acquire the Israeli self-driving vehicle technology developer for about 15.3 billion U.S. dollars. Intel, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, said the deal will bring together Mobileye's leading computer vision expertise with Intel's high performance computing and connectivity expertise to create automated driving solutions from cloud to car. The goal of acquiring the Jerusalem-based company, as the world's largest chipmaker claimed in a press release, is to position Intel to accelerate innovation for automakers and to capture fast-growing market opportunity, estimated to be up to 70 billion dollars by 2030. Intel hailed Mobileye as a global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The deal is expected to be the largest exit in Israel's high-tech industry to date. "This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers," said Brian Krzanich, Intel's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers." In extending Intel's strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities, Krzanich envisions combining his company's technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car's path and making real-time driving decisions with Mobileye's abilities to bring automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. "We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers," said Ziv Aviram, Mobileye Co-Founder, President and CEO. "By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms." While Intel intends to fund the acquisition with cash from the balance sheet, a subsidiary of the company will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye, listed on the New York Stock Market since 2014, for 63.54 dollars per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately 15.3 billion dollars and an enterprise value of 14.7 billion dollars. Already approved by the Intel and Mobileye Boards of Directors, the transaction is expected to close within the next nine months.

Matthew Heller March 13, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Intel said Monday it would buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion, betting it can become a leader in developing driverless systems for automakers as it continues to diversify away from its legacy chip business. The bet is quite an expensive one for Intel, pricing Mobileye at about 21 times expected 2017 revenue — more than six times the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Intel will pay $63.54-per-share, a premium of about 33% to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. Recommended Stories: Dutch Paint Maker Rebuffs PPG’s $22B Offer Shell to Sell Alberta Oil Sand Assets for $8.5B SunEdison Sells Yieldco to Brookfield for $787M Mobileye’s cameras, sensor chips and other technologies help autonomous vehicles safely navigate streets. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. “The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business,” Reuters said. Intel had not been a significant player in the sector but the deal could put it in direct competition with such companies as Nvidia and Qualcomm. “In October, Qualcomm acquired automotive chip supplier NXP for $47 billion, further fueling Intel’s need to quickly get on board the automotive wave,” Recode noted. “That’s especially true given Intel missed the mobile wave and is attempting to make up for it through investments in virtual reality and self-driving technology.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich estimates self-driving will be a $70 billion industry by 2030. The company had previously partnered with Mobileye and BMW to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021 and had acquired a 15% stake in Here, a digital mapping business. Some investment analysts raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition’s price, but Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital Market said the deal was “a tremendous opportunity for [Intel] to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities.” “This deal makes Intel a Tier 1 partner for the automotive industry,” Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, told The New York Times.

Intel announced itself as a contender with its acquisition of Mobileye, which creates software that reads inputs from cameras, radar and laser sensors. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint DETROIT – Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at about $15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye's market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel's hardware, data centers and software, giving automakers a one-stop shop for fully autonomous systems. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year's end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye's leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye's software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semiautonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Sebastian Scheiner &#x2022; Associated Press Jerusalem-based Mobileye will absorb Intel’s autonomous driving division, with the combined operations to be based in Israel. Intel's involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. "Major players are finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution," he said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. "If you put all of that together, you really get an end-to-end solution for autonomous driving," said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google's Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1 billion purchase of budding robotics start-up Argo AI. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country's history. He said he's been assured that the company's operations will stay in Israel. "The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is turning into a global technology center," he said. The combined global autonomous driving company will be based in Israel, supporting both companies' existing production programs and building on relationships with automakers, Tier-1 parts suppliers and semiconductor partners, the companies said.

Nissan is testing self-driving systems with remote human managers that were initially developed for the Mars rover. DETROIT — Computer chip maker Intel paid handsomely for a piece of the next big thing Monday as it offered more than $15 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The purchase, scheduled to close by year’s end, creates another major player in self-driving technology as traditional automakers and tech companies vie to put the cars into public use. Most companies have predicted autonomous vehicles will be carrying people in the next three to five years. The big investment by Intel validates predictions that autonomous cars will someday come in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a University of Notre Dame professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, which makes software that processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Mobileye has partnerships with many of them, including testing cars with Intel and BMW. The Mobileye deal will help put Intel in the driver’s seat in terms of supplying vital parts of autonomous vehicles, said IHS Markit analyst Akhilesh Kona. Besides Mobileye’s technology, Intel is gaining access to major automakers and parts suppliers, Kona said. “They have captured a piece of what should be a fast-growing market.” Intel and Mobileye are targeting an array of sensors and camera systems that are expected to generate annual sales of $10 billion by 2022, quintupling from about $2 billion this year, IHS estimated. Mobileye controls about 70 percent of the world market for driver assistance systems such as automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. IHS expects as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles to be sold by the year 2035. But there are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies still haven’t aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers. The rise of mobile devices caused a decline in the personal computer market and undercut Intel’s growth and influence in the technology business. Now Intel is expanding into other potentially fertile fields. Besides setting its sights on the still-nascent driverless car market, Intel also has been investing in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, as well as drones. The companies said Monday’s deal combines Mobileye’s software with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees. The deal moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. It’s likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. The acquisition should have little short-term impact on competitors such as Autoliv and Continental, and Intel and Mobileye already are working with supplier Delphi and BMW to test cars, Jefferies analyst Ashik Kurian wrote in a note to investors. But in the long-term as the market moves toward more autonomous vehicles, the hookup “confirms our concern about the emergence of new large and well-capitalized competitors” threatening auto suppliers, Kurian wrote. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. That’s below Mobileye’s record high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015 after Morgan Stanley raised its target price on the shares to $80. Mobileye NV’s stock closed Monday up 28 percent to $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16.

Intel revealed March 13 that it figuratively will write a check with a lot of zeroes, $15,300,000,000 ($15.3 billion, for short), to acquire autonomous vehicle-software maker Mobileye. That's putting a company's money where its risks are. The transaction immediately gives Intel a strong new position in the market for autonomous vehicle IT while at the same time connecting it in a new way with more than a dozen of the most prominent automakers in the world. Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its closing price on March 10. Mobileye NV's stock closed March 13 up 28 percent at $60.62. Intel shares fell 2 percent to $35.16. Board members of both companies still must approve the transaction. The acquisition will result in an autonomous-driving Intel division that combines Mobileye with Intel's Automated Driving Group. The team will be based in Jerusalem, Israel; it will be led by Amnon Shashua, who currently serves as Mobileye CTO and board chairman. Further reading Apple, Android Smartphones Invite Cyber-Attacks LG Stylo 3 Comes to Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile Mobileye Already Owns 70 Percent of Market for Driver-Assist Systems According to software industry analyst IHS, Mobileye currently owns about 70 percent of the world market for driver-assistance systems, including automatic braking, lane centering and pedestrian detection. The analyst firm said it expects to see as many as 21 million autonomous vehicles on the nation's roads by 2035. That's the market in which Intel is on the road to become a vital supplier. Intel, Mobileye and BMW partnered last year with the five-year goal of developing fully autonomous driving as a platform for other automakers to license and use by 2021. Automotive industry analysts have projected automated vehicles to begin carrying passengers as a commonplace occurance within the next three to five years. Google, which now calls its program Waymo, has been testing its own driverless autos for nearly eight years, and Uber has been doing the same for about three years. Mobileye Entrenched as a Key Auto Industry Supplier Intel is buying a well-established company. Mobileye's intellectual property, which includes vision chips and software that interprets data from a camera to anticipate possible collisions with cars, people, animals, and other objects, is already used by 27 automakers, including Audi, BMW, General Motors and Ford. Mobileye specializes in software that processes information detected from cameras and other sensors in order to decide where a car should steer or to use emergency braking. The combination of its IP with Intel's adds hardware, software expertise and several data centers to the companies' goal of making driverless car transportation a normal experience. "Intel's acquisition of Mobileye underscores the potential for autonomous driving and magnitude of investment required to realize it," Paul Asel of Nokia Growth Partners told eWEEK in a media advisory.  "The acquisition furthers two trends:  semiconductor industry consolidation and the entry of tech majors into the auto sector through acquisition (Samsung/Harmon). The acquisition bolsters Intel's effort to enter the automotive sector and broadens its automotive offering. Highlighting that the acquisition is immediately accretive, Intel is signaling its view that pricing is reasonable, which is reinforced by recent comparable acquisitions.    "From Mobile Eye's perspective, the sale may be timely, as there are numerous new entrants in the space that will put pricing pressure on its products," Asel said. Companies Will Co-Develop New Systems Intel and Mobileye want to co-develop a set of sensors and camera systems that are expected to bring in annual revenue in the $10 billion range by 2022, according to IHS. "Mobileye brings the industry's best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers."

The move immediately gives Intel a strong foothold in the automotive industry, with Mobileye’s systems already accounting for 70% of the global market for advanced driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. Intel says it expects the all cash transaction to close within the next nine months. The two companies are collaborating with BMW on a project to deploy about 40 modified BMW 7 Series sedans for testing on public roads in the U.S. and Europe by the second half of 2017. The goal is to apply the gathered data not only toward producing BMW’s self-driving vehicle — codenamed iNext — four years from now, but to develop “scalable architecture” that can be adopted by other vehicle brands as a turnkey option instead of creating all of their own autonomous driving technology from scratch. Intel is separately working on another partnership with Mobileye and Delphi centered on self-driving technology, with the goal of delivering a fully functioning system by 2019. This is the latest in a series of moves to position itself in the automotive space. Back in November the company created a new business unit known as the Automated Driving Group and has vowed to spend $250 million over the next two years toward the development of autonomous vehicles. Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030 Related Reads BMW, Intel, and Mobileye will work together on self-driving car tech BMW, Intel and Mobileye to begin self-driving car tests on public roads later this year Mobileye reveals it split from Tesla over Autopilot safety concerns 6 comments 70 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Tech giants including Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are supporting Google's battle with FBI Warner Bros. reportedly in talks to reboot The Matrix Computing on the edge Popular 36 comments Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands Review 27 comments AMD Ryzen 5 processors detailed, launching April 11 Load Comments 6 ...

Business Home LBoard Putrajaya owns 1MDB’s ‘operational debt’, Pua tells Johari FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Intel buying Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for US$15 billion AFP | March 14, 2017 It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. JERUSALEM: Intel will buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than US$15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said Monday, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant’s commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately US$15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in “autonomous driving” that could provide the technology at a lower cost. “The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” it said. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to US$70 billion by 2030.” Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for “highly and fully automated driving” to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well. The Israeli firm was founded in 1999 and employs some 660 people. It has developed real-time camera systems used to avoid accidents with the help of algorithms that interpret the data. ‘Data centres on wheels’ Its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localisation. Drivers may be familiar with its system that warns when they are approaching too closely to another vehicle or pedestrian. Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said of the acquisition that “together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry”. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” he said in the statement. “It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers.” The companies said the transaction, approved by the boards of both Intel and Mobileye, is expected to close within the next nine months. “As cars progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels,” the statement said. “Intel expects that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate 4,000 GB of data per day, which plays to Intel’s strengths in high-performance computing and network connectivity.” Israeli officials were also touting the deal as a sign of confidence in the country’s high-tech sector — an industry that has given it the nickname the “start-up nation”. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone with Aviram to congratulate him, a statement from the premier’s office said. “The deal dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is being realised,” Netanyahu said. “Israel is becoming a global technology centre not only in the field of cyber but also the automotive field.” Economy Minister Eli Cohen told army radio that “what’s important now is that the production remains in Israel, where some 300 international companies are located”. The centre for work on the combined autonomous vehicle will be Mobileye’s headquarters in Jerusalem, the firms said. Aviram told Netanyahu that a global development centre will be established in Israel and “will be responsible all the international activity of Intel’s autonomous cars”, the statement from the premier’s office said. Intel has long operated in Israel, opening its first development centre in 1974. In 2014, the firm announced it was to invest close to $6 billion in upgrading its Israeli production facilities.

Yahoo disclosed new details about its negotiations with Verizon in a regulatory filing Monday. The filing doesn’t say why Verizon relented on its original demand, issued Feb. 1. Verizon ultimately accepted Yahoo’s offer to trim the sale price by $350 million instead. The companies struck a $4.83 billion deal last July, but reopened talks after Yahoo revealed that personal information had been stolen from more than a billion of its users in two separate hacking attacks in 2013 and 2014. The discount reflected concerns that people might decrease their use of Yahoo email and other digital services that Verizon is buying, reducing opportunities to show ads. Verizon Communications is now aiming to complete the revised $4.48 billion purchase by the end of June. After that, Yahoo’s email and other digital services will become part of Verizon, which is planning to meld the operations with its AOL division in an effort to become a bigger player in the growing market for digital ads. Yahoo’s most valuable parts — investments in China’s e-commerce leader, Alibaba Group, and in Yahoo Japan — will be left in a new company called Altaba. That company will be run by a Yahoo board member, Thomas McInerney, instead of Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer. Although she hasn’t divulged her plans, Mayer isn’t expected to work for Verizon. If she leaves, Mayer will receive a $23 million severance package, according to Monday’s filing. The amount is lower than a $44 million valuation disclosed in September because $21 million in stock options and other awards have vested in Mayer’s account since then. Besides her severance package, Mayer will gain control of stock options valued at $56.8 million, according to the filing. The stock will help ease the sting of a penalty that Mayer is paying for the big data breaches that occurred on her watch. Yahoo’s board is withholding Mayer’s annual bonus of up to $2 million and a potentially lucrative stock award to punish her. Besides naming McInerney as Altaba’s CEO, Yahoo also filled several other key positions at the new holding company. Arthur Chong will serve as general counsel and secretary and Alexi Wellman as chief financial and accounting officer. DeAnn Fairfield Work was named chief compliance officer. — Associated Press technology Intel to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion Intel agreed to buy Mobileye, an Israeli self-driving technology firm, for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia and Qualcomm to develop driverless systems and components for global automakers. The acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world’s largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been downplaying its core semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected that the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. Intel so far has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least a half-dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. The acquisition of Mobileye could dramatically expand Intel’s potential role in self-driving technology, with a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. “It’s an area where [Intel] has had very little presence — the automotive market, and so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities,” said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. “Mobileye’s technology is very critical. . . . The price seems fair,” she added. The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 percent to Mobileye’s closing price of $47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015. The deal also could have an effect on the role of other self-driving component suppliers, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies from Alphabet’s Google to Chinese Internet giant Baidu. Mobileye’s shares jumped 29 percent to $60.96 in afternoon trade, while Intel’s shares were down 2.1 percent. Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive, which has partnerships with both companies, were up 3.4 percent. — Reuters Also in Business ● The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on Monday named as its new president Raphael Bostic, an economist, professor and former housing official under President Barack Obama. Bostic, 50, is the first African American president at one of the dozen Fed regional banks. Since leaving the government in 2012, he has been a professor in public policy at the University of Southern California. ● HSBC Holdings named insurance executive Mark Tucker to succeed Douglas Flint as chairman, enlisting an outsider to oversee Europe’s biggest bank as it overhauls management. Tucker, 59, chief executive of AIA Group and former head of Prudential, will take the post Oct. 1, the bank said in a statement Monday. Tucker’s major task will be to find a successor to CEO Stuart Gulliver, who plans to retire. ● Puerto Rico’s federal oversight board voted unanimously on Monday to certify the government’s fiscal turnaround plan, on the condition it be amended to eliminate Christmas bonuses, impose employee furloughs and further reduce pension spending. The plan, a cornerstone of the federal Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, will serve as the baseline for looming restructuring talks with holders of some $70 billion in debt that has pushed the U.S. territory to the brink of economic collapse. — From news services Coming Today ● 8:30 a.m.: Labor Department releases the Producer Price Index for February. ●Federal Reserve policymakers begin a two-day meeting to set interest rates. ● Earnings: Volkswagen business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Israeli media reported that the deal worth approximately USD 15.3 billion was the largest ever cross-border acquisition for an Israeli tech firm. It comes with Intel and Mobileye previously collaborating with German automaker BMW to develop self-driving cars. Intel and Mobileye said they expected to combine to become a global leader in "autonomous driving" that could provide the technology at a lower cost. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," it said. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to USD 70 billion by 2030." Last year, BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and Intel on a self-drive project for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021, called the BMW iNext. BMW announced in January it would deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe this year. In August, Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. Mobileye, whose speciality includes systems for accident avoidance, has concluded an agreement with Volkswagen on road data technology as well.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Automotive Intel splashes $15b on autonomous vehicle company Mobileye Nick LavarsMarch 14th, 2017 3 pictures Intel sees Mobileye's expertise dovetailing well with its own computing cloutView gallery - 3 images Intel is much more than a computer hardware company these days. In addition to drones, virtual reality and fitness tracking, one future-flavored pie that the firm is sticking its fingers into is driverless vehicle technology. Today it may have just gone ahead and plunged a whole fist in, with a US$15 billion acquisition of Israeli company Mobileye. Mobileye is a driverless technology company that develops computer vision, machine learning and mapping for autonomous systems. It has made a bit of a name for itself in these circles, teaming up with the likes of VW, BMW and Intel itself in the past on driverless car projects. In fact Mobileye's systems are integrated into 237 unique car models and its chips into more than 3.3 million cars. Intel is well aware of the driverless car trend, and sees Mobileye's expertise dovetailing well with its own computing clout. It imagines a future where automobiles are less cars and more fully autonomous data centers hurtling down the freeway. So much so, that it anticipates autonomous vehicles will generate 4 GB of data every day by 2020. By this stage, it hopes its connectivity and processing prowess can combine with all the heavy data gathered by Mobileye's tech to provide something resembling an all-in-one autonomous technology package with information stored in the cloud. The acquisition will see Intel's recently-formed Automated Driving Group join Mobileye in Israel, where both companies will continue their existing production programs.

(REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A DETROIT: Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for US$15.3 billion on Monday (Mar 13) in a deal that could thrust the US chipmaker into direct competition with rivals Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop driverless systems for global automakers. The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market beyond its core computer semiconductor business. It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of self-driving start-ups. The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about US$3 billion in 2015 to US$96 billion in 2025 and US$290 billion in 2035. Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price. Intel has not been a significant player in the sector, although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up companies developing different components for self-driving systems, from robotics to sensors. Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras, sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine learning, cloud software and data fusion and management. "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's technology is very critical ... The price seems fair," she added. Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise." The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's position in the automated driver assistance market, but left Nvidia the leader on the highest end. Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands' NXP. The US$63.54 per share cash deal represents a premium of about 33 per cent to Mobileye's closing price of US$47 on Friday, but below its all-time high closing price of US$64.14 in August 2015. Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 per cent to close at US$60.62, while Intel's shares were down 2.1 per cent. The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded, including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo to Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc . Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC , which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0 per cent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies. MERGING 'EYES' AND 'BRAIN' Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at US$4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for US$7.7 billion. Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers. In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to share resources and data." Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 per cent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of US$173.3 million last year. Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do well by the deal: together they own nearly seven per cent of the company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a seven per cent stake. BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the resources to develop their own systems. Last October, Qualcomm announced a US$47 billion deal to acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia. The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017. - Reuters Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks ended little changed in light volume on Monday, with traders eyeing a Federal Reserve meeting expected to result in an interest rate increase later this week. The S&P 500 traded in its tightest range of the year, in and out of slight losses, while the CBOE Volatility index was on track to close at its lowest in more than a week. Shares of Mobileye jumped nearly 30 percent to a high of US$61.51 after chipmaker Intel agreed to buy the driverless technology maker for US$15.3 billion. Mobileye closed up 28.2 percent at US$60.62 and Intel fell 2.1 percent to US$35.16. Investors looked ahead to the Fed's two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Traders saw a 94 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. "Other than the Fed on Wednesday, I don’t see anything going on to make any (investment) decisions on," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "Intel buying Mobileye is the story of the day, moving into that market sector," he said, adding that they advised some clients to "fade in" into Intel stocks. "We think this is a very good support point," said Mendelsohn. Nvidia rose 2.8 percent to US$101.85 while Delphi Automotive added 4.0 percent to US$80.20. Both are involved in developing technology for cars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48, the S&P 500 gained 0.87 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,373.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,875.78. After the bell, U.S.-traded shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals dropped 9.3 percent to US$10.98 after investor William Ackman, who had been its biggest cheerleader for two years as the share price climbed and then plummeted, on Monday said his hedge fund had sold its entire position. During regular trading hours, Citrix Systems jumped 6.8 percent to US$84.93 after Bloomberg reported that the cloud-services company is working with advisers to seek potential suitors. Wynn Resorts gained 4.8 percent to US$104.30 after Morgan Stanley reiterated its "buy" rating and said the company could gain a meaningful market share in Macau. About 6.18 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.93 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 48 new lows. The S&P 500's average true range hit 5.9, its lowest of the year. The year-to-date average of that daily measure of volatility is 14.

Carlos Osorio, The Associated Press US$15 billion deal 'merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car' by  Tom Krisher And Ed White, The Associated Press  | March 13, 2017 Small Medium Large DETROIT — Intel will buy Israel’s Mobileye in a deal valued at about US$15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centres and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. “This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. The combination, expected to close by year’s end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. RELATED Autonomous cars don't make sense for the rest of us Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different automakers. It also controls about 70 per cent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Intel’s involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centres, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. “If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay US$63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 per cent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at US$15.3 billion. RELATED Driving Debate: Will autonomous cars help or hinder traffic? The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1 billion purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country’s history. He said he’s been assured that the company’s operations will stay in Israel. “The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is turning into a global technology centre,” he said. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel’s autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel, supporting both companies’ existing production programs and building on relationships with automakers, Tier-1 parts suppliers and semiconductor partners, the companies said.

GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Tested on AMD Ryzen versus Intel Kaby Lake CPU Bottleneck? GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Tested on AMD Ryzen versus Intel Kaby Lake Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Mon, Mar 13, 2017 - 5:10 PM 101 Comments Jump To: Page 1: CPU Bottleneck Exposed By GeForce GTX 1080 Ti? Page 2: AMD & Intel Test Systems Page 3: 3DMark Fire Strike and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Page 4: Thief and GTAV Page 5: Fallout 4 & Ghost Recon Wildlands Page 6: Final Thoughts & Conclusions CPU Bottleneck Exposed By GeForce GTX 1080 Ti? Last week, NVIDIA released the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition graphics card. This is the fastest desktop consumer graphics card in the world and we were torn on how we wanted to test it. We are in the middle of updating out GPU test bench and are fighting a few hardware gremlins and we thought we’d try something new and a little different for a change. AMD just recently launched it’s Ryzen processor series and that is a huge architectural change for AMD. It’s been many years since we’ve run graphics cards benchmarks on an AMD platform since Intel has been the platform of choice for gaming performance. Has that changed? So, rather than comparing the Intel GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition graphics card to dozens of other video cards we are going to be comparing it to just the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, but on two different platforms. One will be powered by a stock Intel Core i7-7700K processor ($329.99) and the other will be powered by the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 ($329.99). Both systems have Corsair Hydro series CPU water coolers and are running the same exact Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB of DDR4 memory kit at 2933 MHz with CL14 timings. We tried to make the platforms as identical as possible as we wanted to see how the GPU would scale at 1080P, 1440P and 4K resolutions when powered by latest Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake and AMD Ryzen 7 processors. We also gave the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 a head start by overclocking it from 3.0GHz (3.7GHz Turbo) stock clock speeds all the way up to 4GHz on all 8-cores. The Intel Core i7-7700K ‘Kaby Lake’ processor was left at stock settings, which are 4.2GHz base and 4.5GHz boost. AMD Ryzen 7 1700 With ATI Ruby We’ve all heard that AMD Ryzen 7 series processors don’t perform that hot at 1080P resolutions, so we’ll be paying close attention to how the GPU performance scales when you move from the GeForce GTX 1080 to the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. We’ve been slowly coming to the point that the GPU is going to be bottle-necked a little by the processor on both platforms. This greatly depends on the game title you are looking at, so we wanted to take a quick look at a few game titles. Depending on how much traffic this article gets we might expanding testing and look at more processors in the future as we do see CPU bottlenecks becoming an increasing concern for many. Keep in mind that CPU bottlenecks are more prevalent at lower resolutions and graphics settings. Once you increase the resolution or image quality settings you’ll likely become more GPU bound and the CPU bottleneck will be lessened. That said, let’s look at the test systems and then jump into the benchmarks. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums! Jump To: Page 1: CPU Bottleneck Exposed By GeForce GTX 1080 Ti?

AMD clearly showed that the Ryzen chips are aimed at 4K gaming aswell as there new Vega chips coming out. Doing reviews on 1080p for Ryzen chips is like doing a review on 720p and saying its better fps than 1080p. AMD is looking into the future of computing and gaming hence why the Ryzens chips are faster at 4K, render faster, Multitask more and are prepared for Full DX12 games with the Vega chips. I always run my games on Max settings and when Vega is released ill be running all my games in Max settings with 4K ohYoumad OK this in regards to the update on the last page, couldn’t you use a more cpu intensive game like say watch dogs 2 to show utilization in a more truer form? Imhop, not saying I’m correct but Tom Clancy titles never really pushed this aspect. Nicholas Perry Someone should underclock the 7700 to 4.0ghz to see what like for like performance is at the same frequency. McKoy No one in their right mind underclocks a cpu in the realworld. The answer here should be Ryzen going up to 4.5Ghz. ohYoumad I’m pretty sure ppl do it, because I’m one of them. Second i think it was suggested only to get true ipc comparison, that is all Nicholas Perry This is correct. Since Running cannot get to 4.5 , best to simply downclock the other ohYoumad I’m surprised that no reviewer has done this. Ryzen at 4.0 intel at 4.0. I mean the frequency don’t matter but ad long as they’re the same, that would be true apples to apples in ipc comparisons. Only then we can figure out how /= they are. McKoy You cannot do apples to apples with clockrates. Different architecture has different approach to processing. It is like asking an RX480 be clocked 1300mhz core then ask a GTX1060 be clocked 1300mhz core as well, then pit them together. ohYoumad You are missing the point, it don’t matter about architecture because @the same clocks it would show what each can do granted there are other variables(optimization)to take into account, the fact still remains the same…at the same clocks is more of a true ipc comparison than anything else. Intel have its own fab plants, AMD don’t second Intel’s process is more mature/dense it should be able to clock higher. Why do you think the Polaris refresh will use less power and have higher clocks? It’s AMD 2nd go around on the process…it should be better in all aspects. MadBlax Great article, just finishing my 1700 build, and look forward to future optimization, for gaming. Didn’t really buy it for strictly gaming though, as I doubt many are doing. ico80 So that means that in 1 or 2 years with a “2080ti” the Ryzen will heavily bottleneck the system? namco yes, lets test all games at medium with a gpu meant to play games on max settings (ultra+) what a fucking hack job. Nicholas Perry It’s not meant to be what is what you would play at (Which is debatable). It’s about removing the load off the GPU and making it so the CPU is the limiting factor. Which shows the true performance of the CPU. And the easiest way to do that in any given game that isn’t more CPU bottlenecked by default, is to turn the resolution down and the settings down lower. Even at max settings, there have been several tests that even at 1440p the Ryzen falls behind by 20+FPS at in ROTT and several others. Nathan Kirsch yeah, the point here wasn’t to be 100% GPU bound and I picked the settings used to try to get 4K playable on the new titles. ohYoumad Could you do one thing if it’s possible, can you take the wise benchmark for the 1700, and rib it again with both cpu at the same frequency? Just 1-3 times if that’s possible. namco Sorry. But this whole “drop a gpu setting to load the cpu” is bullshit. First off, games are highly optimized for intel. Even AMD has stated the need to work with game devs to optimize for the new chips which theyre doing. Secondly, your cpu doesnt magically start doing more work just because you drop graphical settings. I can literally dropy graphical settings in any game and the cpu utilization stays the same. A game is only gonna use XX% of a cpu. When you drop gpu settings and gain fps, its all gpu bound still. You can NEVER test a cpu in a game as means to see pwrformance. You wanna do a cpu test, then simply run a cpu test. Hell run a Single Thread cpu test and then compare it to intel chips tested single core on true cpu bound tests. There are so many factors in gaming that it makes these tests absolutely retarded including any back end issues like no optimization. Remember the benchmark tool fiasco where they used and intel compiler to make the program, and when it sees an intel cpu it ran faster “optimized” code, but on amd it forces slower code. Yet someone hacked it and forced the optimized code to run on amd and bam, amd didnt seem so slow anymore, still slower than intel, but not by as much as previously shown. realjjj In the update section , the Ryzen SS shows 16 cores 16 threads, that in itself is a problem.No idea what app that is, if it’s an in game tool, then you have discovered an issue in this game and properly identifying it as 8C/16T could make a difference. The games tested are odd as none seems to scales to more cores. That’s why adding the 6900k to the comparison helps as you can at least spot what games scale. Deux Ex should scale but doesn’t on Ryzen, something is odd with it. Nathan Kirsch That is the benchmark log from Ghost Recon Wildlands and it is indeed the in-game benchmark tool. realjjj That’s big considering that it made a relevant impact in F1 2016. Have you tested with HT off in this game? Nathan Kirsch Sorry, but we are out of town traveling for another NDA event. realjjj You guys are missing an opportunity here, the discovery is news and you are the ones to discover it so could generate quite a bit of traffic. Ofc if you can find the file where the config is stored ,edit it to 8C/16T and test perf differences, even better. Sinner85 I must say this is the most civil, Ryzen vs 7700k debate I’ve seen on the net. Nathan Kirsch I would hope so, it’s just showing people the data of where it is at. Once AMD optimizations come out we’ll run the updates on these titles and see what improved and what didn’t! Nate Why did you Overclock the Ryzen and no the 7700k? Nathan Kirsch The goal of overclocking the Ryzen 7 was to the the clock speeds closer to being the same. Yes, my 7700K can overclock past 5GHz, so there is even more headroom left in it while the Ryzen 7 1700 has maybe 100Mhz left in it. Sinner85 This is the other strange thing reviewers are doing overclocking the 7700k to about 5Ghz, again the cpu takes heavy strain and the life expectancy of the cpu cut to…I don’t know, can someone test that. How long can a 7700k run overclocked to 5Ghz. I’m guessing a few months? Nathan Kirsch exactly, my Ryzen 7 1800X can run at 4.2GHz at 1.5 to 1.55V… Doesn’t mean much to me though as for 24/7 use I don’t want it running that high as is will degrade over time. Mike Roberts Mine does 5.0 with 1.35v. Probably a long time. Sinner85 I suppose, with water cooling that’s fine? I’m still not convinced its the better CPU, though. Nate Hard to be convinced when you accept a review that OC’s one CPU and not the other as some reasonable comparison. Mike Roberts It is less than the ryzen here at 4.0. It should last as long or longer. Sinner85 Hard to believe, what temps does it go to, 100 degrees? ohYoumad If you only game then it is, if not amd for the most part. My 5830k clocks to 4.7 with about 1.31 vcore, it reaches 4.5 @1.24 vcore, guess where i leave it at? I don’t any of these cpus would just abruptly die, but it is possible. Increasing voltage does shorten is lifespan but i highly doubt it’s anything significant. I can’t remember off the top of my head where my p2 955be cpu is overclocked to but it still runs at that same settings i had it since day 1 of oc’n with no degradation afaik. McKoy yeah, well how long can a Ryzen run its 4Ghz (since that is the redline most people get)? Check around the net and see what temps people get with 4.8 – 5.0 Ghz OC with their 7700k with just normal tower heatsink air. In other words, this review is not even 7700k’s final form. Sinner85 I have and at times I see high temps and high utilisation, the cpu is good for gaming, but when it comes to cpu intensive games thats all you can do on it, whereas the Ryzen, has low utilisation and acceptable temperatures even when overclocked on air. At the end of the day yes the 7700 is very good for gaming, but the Ryzen(any of them) is not bad at gaming either and on top of it, it destroys any Intel at multitasking, at the end of the day enthusiast gamers are not the majority of cpu buyers, it’s actually the people that do more than just game that forms the bulk of cpu target market, so AMD actually produced a CPU that the market has been asking for, the rate of sales on the Ryzen line proves it. Nate So, would you say OC’ing to an unsafe voltage in one is fair? The processor was overclocked to 4.00 GHz on all cores with 1.3875V set for the CPU Core voltage That seems pretty high when you can hit 5.0.0 GHz on an i7 with 1.35 volts, don’t you think? Surely if you feel that OC’ing to this level is either safe or not is irrelevant, it should be about equity in testing. We don’t care about IPC at a lower / same clock speed, the review doesn’t pretend to be doing that, it sneakily leaves the clock of the i7 7700k at *stock* and overclocks *and* overvolts the Ryzen. It’s a skewed result that makes the Ryzen look “Close” rather than “way way far behind”. Nathan Kirsch Damned if you do and damned if you don’t. I’ve already done stock testing, overclocked testing and now a GPU/CPU scaling article. You can see stock results on the original testing on the 1700 in the launch article. This article was supposed to focus more on GPU scaling thanks to the 1080 Ti being relased. Silicon Lottery is selling Ryzen processors at 4GHz on all three options at up to 1.44V. Looks like <30% of 1700 & 1700X's can do 4.0GHz while over 70% of the 1800X's can run at 4GHz. Here is the link – https://siliconlottery.com/collections/frontpage/products/1700a40g namco you can’t hit 5ghz on a 7700k without delid, 80% of mainstream gamer’s who buy a 7700k isn’t gonna delid the fucker to gain that overclock. so you are trying to create an unfair battle by overclocking a chip only after its been modified….. Mike Roberts Mine is not delided. PC Master Race My 7700k is not delidded and does 5 ghz all day long at 1.25v stable with 3000 mhz ram. Max temp never goes above 79C in the most intensive stress test. I’m using a Corsair H100i v2 to cool it btw so its not a custom loop or anything. Sinner85 If CPU utilization, was added to these benchmarks, we would probably also see how that 4 core processor strained to get those results, run these benchmarks with a i7-6800k, for a real world comparison. That 7700k is probably running at 99.8% utilization, open any other app and performance will crumble, a gamer often will have programs like teamspeak, chrome(for bf4), etc open, how will a CPU that’s running at 99.8% fare when its doing more than just playing a game? Nathan Kirsch Not really, in Ghost Recon Wildlands the stock 7700K was below 40% CPU usage. Sinner85 Oh yes, I saw that benchmark, as well, I was surprised by it, however there are probably going to be a few, very few games that doesn’t make the i7 7700k run close to 99%. Nathan Kirsch https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/969c17f0c379cd0559769f1710a73270301ce47917fc9a3c62260fa48c5d47a2.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bab58299982c9a76009b690e84e91aa88b3bd76afa46bfdf84842cd43fbe05fa.jpg Sinner85 Thanks for these screenshots, this is the type of thing I find really interesting. Sinner85 Is this, what utilization for the CPU’s look like for most games? Nathan Kirsch For most from what I have seen at 1080P.. The CPU load goes down as you increase the screen resolution as the GPU load increases. Peter I’d like to know what games you think use 99% of a 7700k. I play bf1, final fantasy realm reborn,Forza horizon 3, resident evil 7. Gtav, Witcher 3, planet coaster, none of these games push my CPU to max or even close. It’s going to be a rare case that a game uses 99% of a 7700k And the 7700k is just as good as my 6700k in games, if not better due to it reaching 5ghz+. Nathan Kirsch yeah, especially with DX12 game titles… The CPU overhead has been reduced and it will be tough to put a 7700K at 99% load. Sinner85 With DX12, it doesn’t really, not really, matter if you have a 7700k a 6800k or a R7 1700, because DX12 reduces the overhead, performance gets better and then it comes down to what else do you wanna do with the CPU, besides gaming? Peter I have never seen my 6700k @ 4.6ghz hit 70% usage at 1440.usually 40% usage or less, except bf1 is 50-60 in multiplayer, So they have plenty of room left Sinner85 The 6700k in my opinion is a better cpu than the 7700k, but only when playing newer games. Which is what most of us play. Nate What? How is that true in any way? The i7 7700k is better, across the board, in performance. I’ve yet to see a review state otherwise. The 7700k is a small upgrade to the 6700k, it is not worth upgrading from 6700k->7700k… But if you have neither, you should look to buy the 7700k. Sinner85 Apologies, I meant 6800k, but this is probably because I think more cores will benifit you more in the long run, I might be wrong about that though. PC Master Race I also have a 5820k at 4.4 ghz and can say without a doubt the 7700k is better for games right now.. In maybe 2-3 years games will use more cores but by then I’ll just replace my 7700k with something else. PC Master Race To answer your inquiry: I run games at 5 ghz with discord, chrome (youtube music), corsair utility engine, a50 wireless program, msi afterburner, wallpaper engine, object dock, rainmeter, AV program, shadowplay/GFE, origin, steam and a few others running in the background and the performance is ALWAYS consistent and steady. I even sometimes stream to youtube at 1440p/10 Mbps and it keeps going without a hitch. Dan Brooks Also why slander amd when you know there has been zero support from developers for the past decade…?.. because either A. you’re retarded or b. You’re being paid by intel. Are you retarded? Dan Brooks You’re a biased fuck for using the wrong amd processor. Y not use the 1700x? Nathan Kirsch Because the Ryzen 7 1700 and Core i7-7700K are both priced at $329 here in the United States. Apples to Apples with regards to price, that is why! Miguel Ettema There is also no fundamental difference between the 1700, 1700x and the 1800x other than the core speeds. Even if he used the 1800x, you’d see the same results. Ryzen is great for a lot of things, gaming included… but it’s definitely not the best for gaming in its current state, for current games. Optimization from game creators and on Windows in general will see some improvements (hopefully). Dan Brooks The x uses more energy. 95watt vs 65 watt Edward Kinsella There isn’t new material hear. Using a faster clocked, game optimised, 4 core agains’t a slower, non optimized Ryzen 8 core, with old games is kinda smaking intel bias. You would know the result even before starting MisterWU Really some one still look at fire strike benchmarks results ?? One of the untrusting benchmark ever. Maybe testing with more modern and demand demanding game can be good idea to have a more complete overview of the real situation. Nathan Kirsch I have added in Fallout 4 and Ghost Recon Wildland results overnight, so hope those are better game titles for you to take a look at. Robert Johnson With only 20 percent AMD CPU marketshare for the past few years game developers have optimized games at 1080p for Intel processors which is why you see AMD lagging behind Intel at the 1080p resolution but at 2K and 4K you see a difference. So please stop blaming AMD for sluggish 1080p game performance. AMD has sent new SDK kits to game developers and also has established new partnerships with some gaming companies in an effort to change the status quo. MisterWU I am not a AMD fan boy, but I agree with your opinion and even more: when the binary of this games have been compiled, compiler know nothing about Zen architecture and how to optimize. Zero!!! 99% of online test, like this one, are, anyway, grabage. They use ridiculous benchmark and game. If you test a CPU you have to test a brute force calculations not a huge faulty ecosystem with so many variables that even the reviewers them self, clearly, don’t understand nothing about it. Don’t trust review, don’t trust game benchmark. Nathan Kirsch You guys are missing the point… These pointless tests are the baseline of Ryzen performance. These will need to be used to compare the optimizations. We are doing these tests to hopefully show the performance gains that are coming soon. This is the state of Ryzen now. If you go out any buy one, this is what you’ll get! KieraDanvers I think you are missing the point. Vortez.com did a review of the 1700 as well. They benched mostly applications and only 2 games. In those 2 game those (1080p) they showed the 1700 beating the 7700k. My point is this, take these review as a grain of salt. I RARELY believe any review from a review site thats known to be bias toward one party over the other. https://www.vortez.net/articles_pages/amd_ryzen_1700_review,17.html Nathan Kirsch Well, I guess you finally found a site that doesn’t care which way the numbers land. 5 game tested at three resolutions on two different video cards is usually more useful info than 2 games tested at one resolution and on one card. I didn’t spend 10+ hours setting this up and doing all the testing/writing to make a fake useless review. You can see the Ryzen 7 1700 overclocking article here where 18 different things were tested (mostly applications). Robert Pearce Save your breath Nathan. Ansau Lol that logic. Vortez is running a couple of games that resulted being gpu limited for using a RX 480. And that’s a valid test. But the rest of the world has to be taken with a grain of salt when they are showing dozens of games in scenarios where the cpu is the bottleneck. Nathan Kirsch You are correct… GPU limited testing is certainly valid as well. KieraDanvers Really? Here you go! https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2017/03/14/tips-for-building-a-better-amd-ryzen-system ohYoumad Just not to test cpu bottleneck lol KieraDanvers It looks like you have the logic issues. How is a gpu limited at 1080p. You test a 1080p because its more cpu bound than gpu bound. So how do you explain a 480 doing better on a 1700 than on a higher IPC 7700K….YOU CAN’T! If anything, the rx 480 should have performed better on the higher ipc 7700k but it didn’t, it was worse. Why? because of the superior multi-threading in said games. And lastly…CONFIGURATION MATTERS! https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2017/03/14/tips-for-building-a-better-amd-ryzen-system Ansau It seems you haven’t got any clue about what I was saying. I was critizizing how people cherrypick tests based on how they suit owns fanboyerism and blame those that aren’t suit to their desires (like this one). You come past, read “RX 480” and drop whatever your mind had first in his propaganda portfolio, in this case if Polaris gets higher fps in Ryzen or Intel, and put the flag of CONFIGURATION MATTERS. You got as close as the Sun and the Voyager 1 in this discussion… Sean Kumar Sinha Vortez tested 2 games and used an RX480, which will bring GPU limitations into play. Who missed the point, again? namco baseline? are you fucking serious? YOU gonna buy a 1080 or 1080ti and run it on fucking medium? GTFO Nicholas Perry You would if you are someone who wants as high of a frame rate as possible. Esp on the latest AAA games or in online MP games. Where you can reduce input lag even further and if you don’t have a Gsync monitor, can use Fast Sync. (Which requires high framerates with a multiple of 60) ohYoumad I’m glad you did it too, not a lot of reviews these days are as intuitive as this one. marco WOW! Medium Mmmmm. >:) I haven’t played anything on medium setting since way back in year 2000 (Need for Speed 2) on a Coppermine and a ATI Rage Pro 16MB @ 1280×1024… …and that was only because the Rage pros drivers sucked epic chunks. So basically this game is like Crysis-1, and makes even the mighty 1080 run like garbage in high? (me thinks i should wait till next gen GPus come out) McKoy So you are telling us, after year of waiting for Ryzen, we have to wait yet again for optimization? (if it ever did come..) because you know.. we waited for it back in hexacore phenom – “just wait till games become 6 core optimized”. back in bulldozer – “Just wait till games become octacore optimized”. Now ryzen – “Just wait till it becomes mature with bios drivers blah blah”. They should rename AMD to Wait-M-D. ohYoumad Sad, but guess what these were meant to go up against the hedt of Intel. Amd just shocked the world with its pricing, so go figure of course they would be compared to the standard desktop. Compare these against the x99/79 and Intel losses on just about all fronts ohYoumad Well technically i do believe amd botched this launch up quite a bit i.e. just releasing info on ryzen 1700x/1800x temp readings. That should’ve been in the reviewers hands from the get go. I think they didn’t care about the 1080p perf. Overall though i think they did a decent job and i will be making a ryzen/vega build in the near future, i just can’t find a case to do it in. Persn Dewillavic “Finally, we have investigated reports of instances where SMT is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT. We see this neutral/positive behavior in a wide range of titles, including: Arma® 3, Battlefield™ 1, Mafia™ III, Watch Dogs™ 2, Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI, For Honor™, Hitman™, Mirror’s Edge™ Catalyst and The Division™. Independent 3rd-party analyses have corroborated these findings. For the remaining outliers, AMD again sees multiple opportunities within the codebases of specific applications to improve how this software addresses the “Zen” architecture. We have already identified some simple changes that can improve a game’s understanding of the “Zen” core/cache topology, and we intend to provide a status update to the community when they are ready.” I would like to see testing on the games they mentioned in AMD Community update. Just curious. IMMIK These tests are pointlessly pushing Intel CPUs until the scheduler issue and cache issue in Windows 10 is fixed… In the meantime we already knew the answer. Zach B. Look up the “AMD Ryzen Community Update” posted today. AMD themselves say there is absolutely NO ISSUE with Windows 10 or the scheduler. Everything is working as intended. “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” Xain https://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/AMD-Ryzen-and-Windows-10-Scheduler-No-Silver-Bullet Fucking wrecked. Nathan Kirsch Yeah, AMD put that to rest already. Xain No they didn’t. Watch the review, it’s a response to “AMD putting it to rest”. PC Master Race Basically for games AMD is still way behind. Stephen Jones Interesting choice of games. Thief? Really?. Zach B. Would’ve been nice to see a more modern and relevant DX12 game there instead. Ashes of the Singularity comes to mind, especially since RTS games tend to utilize more CPU than shooters/open world RPGs. Nathan Kirsch No one plays Ashes of the Singularity. Great game title to benchmark and I love the developers and the support they give us, but it’s just not a played title. I have added Fallout 4 and Ghost Recon Wildlands results, so hope that helps! McKoy No one plays Thief as well (nor use its outdated engine anymore). What would be better is at least add games that utilize popular quick dev engines like Unity, UE4 (Thief is old UE3 still I think), or at least Frostbite. Victor Burgos Games This was a good review. Thanks for it. I am a GameDev, and have been thinking about if I wanted to use Ryzen as a build station or just keep my 5820K X99 station as is. I think that would be a really awesome Legit Review. I have not once seen a written review with my 5820K comparing it with the new Ryzens sadly 🙁 Ole-Martin Broz Imagine 5820 as an equal to Ryzen in most aspects, if you get above 4.1 ghz think of it as above in gaming, less in productivity. You did right with the purchase of 5820K back then, nothing new have happened, amd just brought more cores way more affordable. MisterWU If you are game devlopper and you find this a good review you have a huge huge problem. Nathan Kirsch Just because the game titles you prefer aren’t included doesn’t make this a bad review. The numbers are spot on and it does give a look at the performance impact of two different platforms using two graphics cards. ohYoumad I can’t believe how nonsensical ppl can be Nathan Kirsch Thank you and glad you found it helpful. The reason you don’t see many Core i7-5820K processor reviews is due to the fact that Intel never sampled them to the media. You’ll find many reviews using the 6950X, 6900K, 5960X, 6700K, 7700K, and the 7350K as Intel has sampled each of those to all the main sites over the past 2-3 years.

(Reuters/Tyrone Siu) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains March 13, 2017 Intel plans to purchase Mobileye, an Israeli-based company that builds vision systems for cars, for roughly $15 billion. The computer-chip giant says it will buy the outstanding shares of Mobileye for $63.54, a 34% bump on Friday’s closing price, according to The Wall Street Journal (paywall). Mobileye, founded in 1999 to create systems that would help cars detect other vehicles on the road using regular cameras and custom-built processors. It’s developed a range of warning technologies found in many car companies’ vehicles, including systems to warn when vehicles are drifting out of their lanes, ones to help prevent head-on collisions, and adaptive cruise control. In recent years, the company has been working on developing technology for autonomous cars. While many of its competitors use expensive laser-scanning systems, called LiDAR, Mobileye intends to build a system that relies on standard cameras and radars. LiDAR systems have proven so popular that manufacturers are actually unable to keep up with demand (paywall). But given that they can cost tens of thousands of dollars, a dependable system that just relies on far less expensive cameras and radars would be of great interest to automakers aiming to sell self-driving cars to the average consumer. Mobileye had been working with Tesla to develop the semi-autonomous “Autopilot” function designed to allow Teslas to essentially drive themselves while drivers stay attentive and with their hands on the wheel. After a deadly crash in Florida, Mobileye “expressed safety concerns regarding the use of Autopilot hands-free” and cut its ties with Tesla. Although shares of Mobileye initially shot up roughly 30% Monday (March 13) morning, the market didn’t seem particularly enthused by Intel’s plans, with its shares later dropping about 2% ($0.65). The acquisition will allow Intel to merge its own work on autonomous technologies with Mobileye’s, headquartering its research in Jerusalem, the two companies said in a joint release. Intel announced in January that it had partnered with Mobileye and BMW to launch a fleet of self-driving cars in Europe and the US later this year. Intel has been a household name since the 1990s, when its Pentium line of processors were in just about every computer one could find, and its “Intel Inside” jingle was as recognizable as anything else on US television. But the company struggled to see the industry’s shift to mobile, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to continue its pace of innovation in the core chip-making business, as silicon chips can only get so small. Intel laid off 12,000 employees in 2016 as part of a restructuring that aims to ensure that the company doesn’t miss the next great shift. Intel believes that—among other autonomous technologies like drones—self-driving cars are a platform that will fundamentally change the way the world operates, and it wants to be at the center of that change. “Many of you have asked why we think autonomous cars and vehicles are so important to Intel’s future. The answer is data,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a letter to employees. “Our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every technology and every industry. We are a data company. The businesses we focus on, and deliver solutions to, create, use and analyze massive amounts of data.” Self-driving vehicles are likely to be one of the most ubiquitous technologies over the next few years, with many manufacturers committing to launching autonomous ride-hailing services, and even consumer cars, by the end of the decade. And Intel wants to be at the heart of these machines, whether with the vision systems used to see the road, or with the processors making sense of all the information cars will be receiving. “As you’ve heard me say, others predict the future,” Krzanich said in his letter. “At Intel, we build it.” Most Popular A court’s decision in a Maine labor dispute hinged on the absence of an Oxford comma Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

While anyone who has ever used a laptop or a desktop has heard of Intel, Mobileye is a name that’s mostly known to technology and automotive industry insiders. That’s despite the fact that its EyeQ chips and technology are used in lane departure warning, lane keeping assistance, forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, automated emergency braking, traffic sign recognition, and automatic high beam control systems are used by many automakers, including BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, and Volvo. Founded in 1999, Mobileye specialises in automotive vision processing and data fusion from other sensors, like radar. The company claims that it was the first to come out with a camera/radar fusion product, and has since followed that up with firsts for automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection, traffic light detection and animal detection. Intel will buy all of Mobileye’s shares for US$63.54 ($84.27), a premium of over 34 per cent. Prior to today’s purchase announcement, Mobileye’s shares were trading for US$47.27 ($62.69). The transaction is not expected to be completed until the end of 2017. The companies estimate that the market opportunity for assisted driving and autonomous vehicle technology could worth up to US$70 billion ($93 billion) by 2030. According to Mobileye, once the transaction is complete, the company will retain the Mobileye name, and will, in fact, take over Intel’s Automated Driving Group. The combined division will be headquartered out of Mobileye’s existing facilities in Israel. For Intel, this is not only a way to become a bigger player in the autonomous driving technology sector, but also diversify itself away from being just processor and chip manufacturer. Intel says that by 2020, autonomous vehicles will generate up to 4,000GB of data per year, and that its processors and cloud technology will help to process all of that information.

Blog :  Exit Interview Key to Help Prevent Data Loss, CEO Says Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch Intel and Mobileye: Jumpstarting Autonomous Cars Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 13 Mar, 2017          |         |     Share Intel just bought Mobileye, an Israeli company that leads its market with a camera-based computer vision solution. Intel was a bit late to the game with regard to autonomous cars. It had been working with car makers on in-car entertainment and an advanced headlight system that can see through snow and rain which, sadly has never made it to market, but had largely lagged NVIDIA, which has a full-fledged solution in segment called the Drive PX, now in its second generation. Let’s talk about using an acquisition to close a competitive gap. Organic Vs. Acquisition Technology companies move incredibly fast, so for one to catch another from behind organically is nearly impossible. Ether the lead company needs to stumble or the following company needs to find a shortcut to the end goal. An example of a stumble was Sony building the PlayStation 3 at a cost of over two times what the retail price of a game console currently sold for in market. An example of finding a shortcut to the goal was the iPhone, which moved to consumer entertainment before the entrenched phone vendors even recognized that such a market actually existed. But the more common way to jump ahead is to make a strategic acquisition, like Apple did with the technology that created the iPod, leapfrogging the Sony Walkman. HP did it with Compaq, moving to the head of the market. Lenovo did it with the IBM PC Company to become a leader in PCs. Microsoft did it with several acquisitions to take on and take out firms like Lotus and Netscape. Most recently, Dell acquired EMC to become what is arguably the largest and most powerful tech companies in the world, something that otherwise might have taken decades instead took mere months. This is the path that Intel took with Mobileye. Mobileye Mobileye is known largely for its camera technology, which was used in the first hands-off, self-driving implementation in production in the Tesla S. Unfortunately, the Tesla implementation was ahead of the technology and a driver died relying too much on it, which resulted in a bit of finger pointing between Tesla and Mobileye. My own review of the problem suggested this was Tesla’s mistake, given that the technology wasn’t truly at a hands-free level yet. It has since disabled the feature, yet still calls it “autopilot,” suggesting it can perform better than it yet does. In addition, camera placement on the car may have been too low and the driver had been behaving irresponsibly for some time, all of this resulting in his death and a bit of an undeserved black eye for Mobileye and a nasty public disagreement with Tesla. Still, currently, the company appears to lead the autonomous and assisted driving car camera segment and it’s working with a wide variety of car makers and has been in the segment since its founding in 1999. Driving the Merger This is likely at the core of why Intel bought the company: the depth of contacts, the existing business relationships, and a tighter coupling between Intel’s computing technology and the leading car camera technology vendor. This allows the company to eventually showcase a level of engagement with the car companies closer to what NVIDIA enjoys and make it more competitive. In addition, since much of the work is currently focused on computer vision, under the belief that if people can drive cars with vision alone so can computers, this potentially reduces the cost of the related autonomous solution significantly. One Risk However, with this acquisition path, Intel has to preserve the assets of the acquired company and not damage it badly with the acquisition process. There is a right way to do these things and most firms choose not to follow it. Intel’s history is less than stellar, but it appears to be folding its efforts into Mobileye, not the other way around, which should help protect Mobileye. I’ve had conversations with the acquisition team’s leadership and they appear understand the reasons behind past failures and argue that they have implemented fixes. We’ll see with this acquisition, but this is where the greatest risk currently resides. Wrapping Up: Completing a Successful Acquisition The most assured way to catch up and pass a competitor initially is through acquisition. But the risk is that the firm damages the acquired company in some serious way as part of the process, eliminating much of the value it bought. Intel has demonstrated that problem but has represented that it fixed its process prior to the Mobileye acquisition and is placing its related assets under Mobileye management, which alone should mitigate much of the risk. One final thought: Some of Intel’s better managers have come from Israel and Mobileye is an Israeli company.

News Business Technology Science Financial Glossary Information Hub Company Information Hub About Contact News Business Technology Science Financial Glossary Information Hub Company Information Hub About Contact Intel acquiring autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion Intel acquiring autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion March 13, 2017, 9:09 PM GMT | Written by Joseph Nordqvist | Intel is acquiring Mobileye, a global leader in advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous driving technology, for $15.3bn (£12.5bn). Intel agreed to pay $63.54 a share in cash for the Israel-based company in a deal that will see the US chipmaker compete directly with Qualcomm and Nvidia to develop autonomous systems for carmakers. The acquisition will help Intel expand beyond its core computer semiconductor business into a lucrative new market – driverless vehicle technology.  The US company expects the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, was quoted by the BBC as saying that “this [deal] is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities”. Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University academic, said: “Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution.” Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, said in a statement: “This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers. “Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. “Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Mr. Ziv Aviram, Mobileye Co-Founder, President and CEO, said: “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers. “By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.” Share this article: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Print No part of this website or any of its contents may be reproduced, copied, or modified, without prior consent, unless otherwise indicated for stand-alone materials.

The S&P 500 traded in its tightest range of the year, in and out of slight losses, while the CBOE Volatility index was on track to close at its lowest in more than a week. Shares of Mobileye jumped nearly 30 percent to a high of $61.51 after chipmaker Intel agreed to buy the driverless technology maker for $15.3 billion. Mobileye closed up 28.2 percent at $60.62 and Intel fell 2.1 percent to $35.16. Investors looked ahead to the Fed's two-day meeting that starts on Tuesday. Traders saw a 94 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will lift interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. "Other than the Fed on Wednesday, I don't see anything going on to make any (investment) decisions on," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "Intel buying Mobileye is the story of the day, moving into that market sector," he said, adding that they advised some clients to "fade in" into Intel stocks. "We think this is a very good support point," said Mendelsohn. Nvidia rose 2.8 percent to $101.85 while Delphi Automotive added 4.0 percent to $80.20. Both are involved in developing technology for cars. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.5 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48, the S&P 500 gained 0.87 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,373.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.06 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,875.78. After the bell, U.S.-traded shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals dropped 9.3 percent to $10.98 after investor William Ackman, who had been its biggest cheerleader for two years as the share price climbed and then plummeted, on Monday said his hedge fund had sold its entire position. During regular trading hours, Citrix Systems jumped 6.8 percent to $84.93 after Bloomberg reported that the cloud-services company is working with advisers to seek potential suitors. Wynn Resorts gained 4.8 percent to $104.30 after Morgan Stanley reiterated its "buy" rating and said the company could gain a meaningful market share in Macau. About 6.18 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.93 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 48 new lows. The S&P 500's average true range hit 5.9, its lowest of the year.

Home Industry Intel drops $15 billion on Mobileye in race for a driverless future Intel drops $15 billion on Mobileye in race for a driverless future Intel will buy Israel's Mobileye in a deal valued at about $15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. By: Associated Press | Detroit | Published: March 14, 2017 2:46 AM The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. (Reuters) Intel will buy Israel’s Mobileye in a deal valued at about $15 billion, instantly propelling the computer chip and technology giant to the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. The deal announced Monday combines Mobileye’s market-leading software that processes information from cameras and other sensors with Intel’s hardware, data centers and its own software, giving automakers a one-stop place to shop for fully autonomous systems. ”This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote in a note to employees about the acquisition. You may also like to watch:   The combination, expected to close by year’s end, will allow the companies to bring components to market faster at a lower cost, solidifying Mobileye’s leadership position, officials from the companies said. Automakers and some technology companies are testing autonomous vehicles in California, Michigan and a few other states. Nearly all use Mobileye’s software, which reads inputs from cameras, radar, and laser sensors and makes decisions on what an autonomous car should do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye says it has contracts with 27 different automakers. It also controls about 70 percent of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems that are in cars and trucks on the road today. Intel’s involvement and the big price tag show that autonomous cars are coming in large numbers, signifying a sea change in the way we all get around, said Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University professor who has written about the future of automation. ”Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution,” he said. Autonomous cars will need higher levels of connectivity to the Internet and access to bigger data centers, which Intel can provide, Krzanich said. The two companies also will combine highly detailed mapping efforts. Automakers, Krzanich said, want lower costs, faster times to market and the ability to get an autonomous driving system in one place. ”If you put all of that together, you really get an end-do-end solution for autonomous driving,” said Mobileye Chairman and co-founder Amnon Shashua, who will continue to lead the combined autonomous car unit. In the deal, Intel Corp. will pay $63.54 for each share of Mobileye N.V., a 34 percent premium to its Friday closing price. The boards of both companies still have to approve the transaction. The companies put the equity value of the deal at $15.3 billion. The deal is the latest combination as automakers and technology firms race to build autonomous cars and for leadership in auto electronics. It moves Intel-Mobileye to at least parity with Google’s Waymo, Uber Technologies and car companies for autonomous car leadership, Carone said. The deal also is likely to pressure competitors into signing more deals, he added. Mobileye, with 660 employees, has been forming partnerships worldwide as its growth continued as a separate company. BMW, Intel and Mobileye partnered last year, and Mobileye teamed up with Delphi Automotive to develop building blocks for a fully autonomous car. Competitors also formed partnerships in 2016. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. to develop a fleet of autonomous electric taxis. Google has a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to work on autonomous minivans, and Volkswagen is working with Uber competitor Gett. Ford has invested $150 million in laser sensor maker Velodyne, and it recently announced a $1 billion purchase of budding robotics startup Argo AI. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the Intel acquisition of Mobileye, which he said was the largest deal in the country’s history. He said he’s been assured that the company’s operations will stay in Israel. ”The purchase dramatically proves that the vision we are leading is coming true. Israel is turning into a global technology center,” he said. The combined global autonomous driving company, which includes Mobileye and Intel’s autonomous driving group, will be based in Israel, supporting both companies’ existing production programs and building on relationships with automakers, Tier-1 parts suppliers and semiconductor partners, the companies said. Mobileye’s stock jumped nearly 30 percent Monday to $61.25 in midday trading. Intel shares fell 2.4 percent to $35.06.   Please Wait while comments are loading...

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Mar 13, 2017 at 4:45PM Stocks didn't drift far from breakeven on Monday, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes logging changes of less than a quarter percent. Today's stock market Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (0.10%) (21.50) S&P 500 0.04% 0.87 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Financial stocks attracted heavy trading and essentially mirrored the broader market. The popular Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLF) edged up by 0.24%. Gold-based exchange-traded funds, meanwhile, recovered some of their recent losses; the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) added 4%. Image source: Getty Images. As for individual stocks, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Del Taco (NASDAQ:TACO) were two of the biggest individual movers. Intel bets big on autonomous cars Intel was the Dow's biggest loser following news that the tech giant will be shelling out $15.3 billion to purchase Mobileye, the autonomous driving technology specialist. The two struck an all-cash deal for $63.54 per share, which equates to a 34% premium over the stock's last closing price. For that sum, Intel gets its hands on a fast-growing company -- sales jumped 48% year over year in 2016 -- at the center of the nascent autonomous vehicle sector. But it had to pay nearly 43 times sales for the asset, though. Still, Intel executives were enthusiastic about the purchase. "This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a press release. "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers," he continued. Mobileye also played up the likely synergies between the two companies. "By pooling together our infrastructure and resources," CEO Ziv Aviram said, "we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how." By Intel's estimate, the market opportunity around vehicle systems and data support could soar to as high as $70 billion by 2030. The company could afford to be off the mark on that long-term target, but it will still need to see many years of market-thumping growth ahead for this purchase to pay off. Del Taco forecasts a slowdown in 2017 Del Taco shares fell almost 4.5% following the release of the restaurant chain's fourth-quarter earnings report. Sales grew at a 5.5% pace to mark a significant slowdown from the prior quarter's 6.7% increase. Image source: Getty Images. Still, the full-year results were better than management had forecast. CEO Paul Murphy and his team said in October that same-store sales gains would top out 4.5% for the full year, but last quarter's result pushed the actual figure up to 4.8%. "Our solid fourth quarter results capped another successful year at Del Taco as we exceeded our annual guidance for comparable restaurant sales, total revenue, restaurant contribution margin and adjusted EBITDA, and delivered on our expectations for diluted earnings per share," Murphy said in a press release. Executives' plan for the year ahead includes stepping up brand awareness and increasing margins through new, premium menu options. However, market-beating sales growth will be harder to come by in what's expected to be its fifth straight year of comps gains. The expansion pace should be between 2% and 4%, they predicted, which would mark an almost 2-percentage-point deceleration at the midpoint of guidance. The company still expects to hit management's long-term goal of $1.5 million average store sales volume by the end of next year. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

    * Mobileye shares up 28.2 percent to $60.62

 (Adds analysts' comments, skepticism about self-driving cars)
    By Tova Cohen, Ari Rabinovitch and Paul LienertJERUSALEM/DETROIT, March 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp <INTC.O>
agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm
Mobileye <MBLY.N> for $15.3 billion on Monday in a deal that
could thrust the U.S. chipmaker into direct competition with
rivals Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> and Qualcomm Inc <QCOM.O> to develop
driverless systems for global automakers.
    The pricey acquisition of Mobileye could propel the world's
largest computer chipmaker into the front ranks of automotive
suppliers at a time when Intel has been reaching for market
beyond its core computer semiconductor business.
    It also promises to escalate the arms race among the world's
carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle
technology, and could fuel already-overheated valuations of
self-driving start-ups.
    The stakes are enormous. Last year, Goldman Sachs projected
the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous
vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion
in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035.
    Skeptics have questioned whether auto companies and
suppliers will be able to deploy fully self-driving cars safely
in the next four years, as several have promised. Investment
analysts on Monday raised concerns about the potential synergies
between Intel and Mobileye, as well as the acquisition's price.
    Intel has not been a significant player in the sector,
although it has invested in at least half a dozen start-up
companies developing different components for self-driving
systems, from robotics to sensors.
    Mobileye brings a broad portfolio that includes cameras,
sensor chips, in-car networking, roadway mapping, machine
learning, cloud software and data fusion and management.
    "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a
market that has significant growth opportunities," said Betsy
Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets. "Mobileye's
technology is very critical... The price seems fair," she added.
    Still, the industry newsletter Semiconductor Advisors on
Monday wrote that Intel's acquisition of Mobileye indicates a
strategic move "very far outside its core business franchise."
    The price is about 21 times expected 2017 revenue, making it
more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor
industry's three-year deal average, said B. Riley analyst Craig
Ellis. He said the "very expensive transaction" improved Intel's
position in the automated driver assistance market, but left
Nvidia the leader on the highest end.
    Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye's earnings,
about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire
the Netherlands' NXP.
    The $63.54-per-share cash deal represents a premium of about
33 percent to Mobileye's closing price of $47 on Friday, but
below its all-time high closing price of $64.14 in August 2015.
    Mobileye's shares rose 28.2 percent to close at $60.62,
while Intel's shares were down 2.1 percent.
    The market for self-driving technology is becoming crowded,
including mapping company Here, as well as technology companies
ranging from Alphabet Inc's Waymo <GOOGL.O> to Chinese Internet
giant Baidu Inc <BIDU.O>.
    Shares of systems integrator Delphi Automotive PLC <DLPH.N>,
which has partnerships with Intel and Mobileye, rose 4.0
percent. Delphi said in a statement that it expected the deal
would let it accelerate adoption of new technologies.

    MERGING 'EYES' AND 'BRAIN'
    Intel has a mixed record of capitalizing on technology
outside computer chips. Last year it spun out its cyber security
division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2
billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee
for $7.7 billion.
    Intel will give Mobileye unusual autonomy, integrating its
own automated driving group with Mobileye's operations under
Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from
Israel.
    Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said the acquisition
was akin to merging the "eyes of the autonomous car with the
intelligent brain that actually drives the car."
    Mobileye supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for
driver-assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving
cars - to more than two dozen vehicle manufacturers.
    In an interview in January, Shashua told Reuters: "If you
want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more
than one player... The idea is to have a number of partners to
share resources and data."
    Mobileye was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla,
but the two companies had an acrimonious and public break-up
last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while
operating the vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system.
    Mobileye, founded in 1999, accounts for 70 percent of the
global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems.
It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3
million last year.
    Shashua and two other senior Mobileye executives stand to do
well by the deal: together they own nearly 7 percent of the
company. Shmuel Harlap, Israel's biggest car importer and one of
Mobileye's earliest investors, also holds a 7 percent stake.

    BATTLE FOR SELF-CONTROL
    Mobileye and Intel are already collaborating with German
automaker BMW <BMWG.DE> on a project to put a fleet of around 40
self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of
this year. [nF9N1DH02C]
    At the same time, Mobileye has teamed up with Intel for its
fifth-generation of chips that will be used in fully autonomous
vehicles that are scheduled for delivery around 2021. Mobileye
also has partnered with Delphi on a self-driving platform that
is being shopped to smaller car companies that may not have the
resources to develop their own systems.
    Last October, Qualcomm announced a $47 billion deal to
acquire NXP, the largest automotive chip supplier, putting
pressure on other chipmakers seeking to make inroads in the
market, including Intel, Mobileye and Nvidia.
    The Qualcomm-NXP deal, which will create the industry's
largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements
vital to autonomous driving, is expected to close later in 2017.
