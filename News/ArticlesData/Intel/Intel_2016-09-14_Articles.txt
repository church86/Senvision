The new notebooks keep the chassis and display panel options, but sport faster CPUs, speedier memory, a Killer 1535 802.11ac WiFi card, as well as a higher-capacity battery. Dell plans to offer new XPS 13 notebooks in rose gold, gold and silver colors starting from October 4, 2016. Since Intel’s 7th generation Core i-series Kaby Lake-U processors are drop-in compatible with platforms supporting the Skylake-U chips, the new Dell XPS 13 uses exactly the same chassis as the Dell XPS 13 introduced a year ago and based on the previous-gen CPUs. That means, we are talking about systems made of machined aluminum and carbon fiber, which are 9 – 15 mm thick and weigh 1.2 – 1.29 kilograms. Display panels of the XPS 13 also remained the same: users can choose between a QHD+ (3200×1800) panel and an FHD (1920×1080) panel with or without touch support. Meanwhile, the new 7th generation Intel Core CPUs run at higher frequencies s compared to their predecessors, feature considerably improved video encoding/decoding engine, refined graphics as well as Speed Shift v2 technology. As a result, the upgraded XPS 13 will deliver higher performance and better responsiveness at the same power than the predecessors. Otherwise, as with the past generation of systems, Dell is offering from 4GB to 16GB of LPDDR3-1866 memory. Yet another improvement of the upgraded Dell XPS 13 is Rivet Networks' Killer 1535 802.11 2×2 Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 controller that promises to add some useful features with the help of refined software. Finally, the 2016 XPS 13 also comes with a 60 Wh battery, up from 56 Wh battery on the previous-generation model. Dell claims that thanks to the new battery and power optimizations of the platform, the FHD version of the XPS 13 will work for up to 22 hours and the QHD+ machine will run for up to 13 hours on one charge.

Dell will begin to sell its XPS 13 in silver, gold and rose gold colors on October 4 starting at $799. Traditionally, the company will also offer XPS 13 Developer Edition based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS starting at $949.  Gallery: Dell Updates XPS 13: Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs, DDR4-2133, Killer 802.11ac, New Battery Source: Dell Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Reply Byte - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link hurray for pegged CPU usage and memory leaks! Make use of that kaby lake power! Reply Brett Howse - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link They used a Broadcom one before. Reply Gray05 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Intel NICs were only in the Developer Editions. Reply ik9000 - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link Not true, I got an XPS13 9350 with Intel 8260 wireless AC in a win10pro model. It also has an i7-6560U which has been omitted from the list above in the 2015 specs. It has IRIS 540 graphics and 48EU. Odd they don't mention it. Reply Flunk - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Funny story, a lot of people with the previous version replaced the stock Dell (broadcom really) Wi-Fi cards with Killer Wi-Fi cards. So I guess Dell has just decided to give people what they want. Reply KPOM - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link And here I thought "killer" was an adjective, as in "kick-ass." Reply TheinsanegamerN - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link So it's got a slightly larger battery and replaced there good wifi with sub par killer wifi. And again no iris graphics. Reply Cliff34 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link You will noticed that no ultra portable laptops ever comes w Iris Pro graphics. I do wish they do. Reply spikebike - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link The current skylake xps 13 has a Iris 540 option.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | September 15, 2016 -- 21:00 GMT (14:00 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Israeli pharmaceutical firm Teva is partnering with US chipmaker Intel to develop wearables and a machine-learning platform that can be used in the treatment of Huntington's Disease. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows Huntington's is a genetic and typically fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes nerve cells in the brain to deteriorate. This leads to a host of behavioral and psychological problems, including involuntary writhing movements called chorea. Patients generally succumb to the disease within 15 to 25 years of the diagnosis. There is no cure for Huntington's, but Teva and Intel hope to spur the development of next-generation treatment options by better understanding the progression of the disease and how current treatments impact a patients' quality of life. The companies plan to accomplish this by combining Intel's capabilities in analytics and algorithms with Teva's work around Huntington's treatment and research. Specifically, patients will wear a smartwatch outfitted with sensors that will continuously measure their general functioning and movement. The data will feed into a cloud-based, machine-learning platform developed by Intel for analysis. The platform was first developed two years ago as part of a multi-phase partnership between Intel and The Michael J. Fox Foundation for use in Parkinson's disease research. In both cases, the aim is to detect patterns in participant data collected from wearables intended to monitor symptoms. "Patients generate data based on their day-to-day experiences that can help in improving disease management -- even something as simple as wearing a smart watch can add useful insight," said Jason Waxman, VP and GM of Intel's the Datacenter Solutions Group. "The complexity of analyzing these data streams requires a platform for machine learning, to help drive the pharmaceutical industry towards faster, better clinical trials, potentially leading to new treatments for patients." The study will start toward the end of the year and will take place in centers in the US and Canada.

Dell's new XPS 13 now comes in a rose gold color. If you're concerned that your laptop isn't as small, thin, and stylish as your Apple iPhone, Dell is working to change that. The company announced today the latest iteration of its XPS 13 laptop, which retains the lean and mean profile of previous versions, but now uses Intel's new 7th Generation Core ("Kaby Lake") processors and comes in a new color: rose gold. If you're not a fan of the floral-metallic aesthetic, you can still opt for traditional silver, too. In either case, Dell claims that the all-aluminum XPS 13 is the "smallest 13-inch laptop on the planet," and boasts about it being 17 percent smaller than the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air. Dell gives the XPS 13's dimensions as 11.98 wide (making it a "13-inch laptop in an 11-inch form," per the company), 7.88 inches deep, and between 0.6 (closed) and 0.33 inches high (closed). It weighs between 2.7 and 2.9 pounds, depending on whether it's equipped with touch. A number of display options are available for the 13.3-inch In-Plane Switching (IPS) screen, all the way up to 3,200-by-1,800 resolution on the highest-end model. Touch displays are clad in Corning Gorilla Glass, and all have what Dell calls an "InfinityEdge" display that has only a 5.2mm bezel on the top, left, and right sides. //Related Articles The Best Laptops of 2016 Ports on the XPS 13 include USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0 (with and without PowerShare), and headset, plus there's an SD card slot. The laptop can be configured with up to 16GB of memory and up to 1TB in solid-state storage, and it offers wireless connectivity through Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi via a Killer 1535 card that supports Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) technology. Although there is no discrete video card option, the integrated HD Graphics 620 represents the state of the Intel art. Want even more flair? The chiclet-style keyboard is backlit. As for battery life, Dell says that the XPS 13's will be the longest of any laptop, at more than 22 hours, or 13 hours if all you're doing is streaming video from Netflix or browsing the Web with Microsoft Edge. That might seem hard to believe; in our tests, no system has come close to besting the 13-inch MacBook Air, which could hang on for 17 hours, 36 minutes, in our rundown test. But when you combine its svelte construction with the many power-saving features in Intel's Kaby Lake chips, it's a distinct possibility. Stay tuned for a full review. The silver version of the laptop will start at $799, and the rose gold version at $1,149. Feeling especially adventurous? A special Developer Edition loaded with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS starts at $949.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Sep 15, 2016 at 1:21PM Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has rallied more than 20% this year on the belief that tighter DRAM and NAND (flash memory) supplies could boost memory prices across the market. But despite those positive catalysts, Micron sales and earnings growth remain weak. Revenue fell 25% year over year last quarter, compared to a 30% decline in the previous quarter and a 3% decline in the prior-year quarter. Image source: Micron. In the NAND market, Micron faces tough competition from larger rivals like Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk. In the mobile DRAM market, it lags behind Samsung and SK Hynix. Analysts expect Micron's sales to fall 24% sales this year, compared to a 1% decline last year. Micron posted a non-GAAP net loss of $0.08 per share last quarter, compared to a loss of $0.05 in the previous quarter and a profit of $0.54 a year earlier. In addition to tough competition, Micron's bottom line has been dragged down by market oversupply, pricing pressures, and challenges from integrating the manufacturing processes of its combined Elpida and Micron fabs. Analysts expect Micron's annual earnings to merely break even at $0.00 this year, compared to a profit of $2.47 per share in 2015. Micron also isn't cheap at 49 times earnings, which is more than four times the average P/E of 11 for the memory chips industry. In my opinion, there are safer ways to play the rebound in memory prices than Micron. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Western Digital, for example, both offer better diversification with exposure to the same markets. Intel's a more diversified computing play Intel left the DRAM market in 1985 amid intense competition, but started jointly developing NAND chips with Micron in 2006. That partnership formed the foundation of Intel's non-volatile memory business, which generated 4% of its sales last quarter. Together, the two companies developed new memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXPoint, the latter of which could offer "1,000 times" the performance of current-gen NAND chips. A 3DXPoint wafer. Image source: Micron. Intel frequently highlights non-volatile memory alongside the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses as ways to diversify its top line beyond PCs. However, the ongoing decline in memory prices caused Intel's non-volatile memory chip revenue to fall 20% annually last quarter. The unit also posted an operating loss of $224 million, down from an operating profit of $92 million in the prior year quarter. Those gloomy figures mirror Micron's results, but Intel generates most of its revenue and operating income from its dominant Client Computing (PC and mobile solutions) and Data Center groups. The ongoing slowdown in PC sales caused Intel's Client Computing revenue to fall 3% annually last quarter, but that decline was partly offset by 5% growth in Data Center revenues. Rising memory prices won't boost Intel's sales as much as Micron's, but Intel offers investors more balanced growth than Micron. Analysts currently expect Intel's revenue to rise 4% this year while earnings are expected to improve 7%. Intel also trades at just 18 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.9% -- while Micron has never paid a dividend. Western Digital's a more diversified NAND play Western Digital stock slid 14% this year due to sluggish sales of older HDDs (hard disk drives), which were being cannibalized by NAND-based SSDs (solid state drives). However, WD made a bold move and purchased SanDisk for $19 billion earlier this year. The purchase instantly made it the third largest NAND maker in the world with a 15% market share, according to DRAMeXchange's first quarter figures. Samsung leads the market with a 35% share, while Toshiba and Micron respectively control 22% and 13% of the market. While the massive acquisition will take time  to fully integrate, analysts expect the move to reduce WD's dependence on HDDs and get its sales growth back on track with 2% top line growth next year. SanDisk's Fusion ioMemory flash devices (L) and enterprise SSDs (R). Image source: SanDisk. WD's main HDD rival, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), hasn't made a meaningful purchase in the NAND space yet. Instead, it formed a multi-year strategic alliance with Micron to expand its presence in enterprise SSDs. That plan hasn't impressed analysts, who still expect Seagate's sales to slide 3% next year. To fund the SanDisk acquisition, WD suspended its buybacks, thus reducing its EPS growth. However, the company is still expected to post 44% earnings growth next year (as SanDisk becomes earnings accretive), which makes its forward P/E of 8 look very cheap. Moreover, WD pays a forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is still easily supported by its FCF payout ratio of 33% over the past 12 months. Like Intel, WD is a cheap dividend play instead of an aggressive bet on memory prices rising, but its SanDisk unit will still benefit from that turnaround when it happens. The bottom line Micron would benefit much more than Intel or WD from rising memory prices, but it could also lose a lot more if that recovery is delayed. So with the market near all-time highs, I personally prefer buying cheap income-generating investments like Intel and WD over speculative turnaround plays like Micron.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) today announced a collaboration with Intel Corp. to develop a unique wearable device and machine learning platform for use in Huntington disease (HD). The platform will continuously monitor and analyze key symptoms that impact daily living, in an effort to better understand disease progression and improve treatment evaluation. Teva, working in collaboration with Intel, will deploy this novel technology platform for the first time in a sub-study within the ongoing Phase II Open-Pride HD Study. As part of this, patients will be asked to use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure their general functioning and movement. These data will be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform specifically developed by Intel to analyze data from wearable devices. Proprietary algorithms will then translate these data, in near real-time, into objective scores of motor symptom severity. The study will start towards the end of the year and will take place in centers in the US and Canada. This collaboration will leverage Intel's capabilities in analytics and algorithm development for movement detection, together with Teva's deep knowledge and experience in HD treatment and research. HD is a devastating illness that is desperate for treatment options, requiring innovative ways to continuously and remotely assess and quantify symptoms in a way that can provide meaningful and actionable feedback to doctors, patients and caregivers. Teva president Global R&D and CSO Dr. Michael Hayden said, "The aim of this important project is to provide continuous objective data on the impact of Huntington disease on the patient, and, by extension, a clear understanding of the impact of treatment on patients' quality of life. Current measurement of symptoms is largely based on observation when the patient sees the doctor. This technology now provides us with an opportunity to have continuous monitoring. This unique technology could complement future trials in HD." “Patients generate data based on their day-to-day experiences that can help in improving disease management even something as simple as wearing a smart watch can add useful insight,” said Jason Waxman, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the Datacenter Solutions Group at Intel. “The complexity of analyzing these data streams requires a platform for machine learning, to help drive the pharmaceutical industry towards faster, better clinical trials, potentially leading to new treatments for patients.” This cloud-based solution for analyzing wearable device data is being developed using the open-source Intel Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP), a software platform optimized for performance and security to accelerate the creation of advanced analytics and machine learning solutions. Initial development was done in collaboration with The Michael J. Fox Foundation for use in Parkinson's disease research.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Leaked roadmap claims Intel will bring six-core chips to mainstream PCs with upcoming Coffee Lake Leaked roadmap claims Intel will bring six-core chips to mainstream PCs with upcoming Coffee Lake By Joel Hruska on September 15, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Ever since Intel launched the Core i7 back in 2008, it has pursued a fairly consistent core allocation and marketing system. Intel’s top-end mainstream parts are quad-cores with Hyper-Threading enabled, both on the desktop and the laptop. It’s been that way for nearly a decade, but if a leaked roadmap is accurate, that’s about to change. According to the roadmap, spotted by Overclock3D, Intel will introduce a new six-core processor as a top-end option in mobile when it refreshes its Cannon Lake 10nm chips with the second-generation Coffee Lake processors in 2018. The implication of this slide is that we won’t see Cannon Lake until about this time next year. Intel’s first generation 10nm process would continue to hold down the Y- and U-class product divisions, while Coffee Lake debuts in the 15-28W segment. It’s just the top-end chips that’ll get a six-core option, with TDPs from 35W-45W. There’s another slide from Overclock3D that claims to show things in a bit more detail. While we don’t have any details on the desktop side of things, Intel tends to keep its core counts fairly aligned between desktops and laptops. As we’ve discussed in our guide to Intel CPUs, desktop microprocessors have consistently followed the same pattern: Core i7 means quad-core + Hyper-Threading, Core i5’s are quad-core chips without HT, and Core i3 processors are dual-core with Hyper-Threading enabled. In mobile, the highest-end quad-cores also offer Hyper-Threading, but the lower-power Core i7 processors are all dual-core with HT enabled. Intel now offers a few Core i5’s without HT in mobile as well, but that’s a relatively recent development, and these are still 45W chips. What these slides imply is that Intel believes it can finally squeeze another two cores into its top-end 45W TDP bracket. These chips would target desktop replacements and mobile workstations, not conventional systems. And in all honesty, that’s probably where they should stay. The harsh truth is CPU performance simply isn’t improving very much or very quickly. DirectX 12 has proven to be a significant boost for AMD’s GPUs and CPUs in certain cases, but it hasn’t yet done much for Intel CPUs. The promise of DX12 is that it allows a CPU to take advantage of multi-threaded rendering much more efficiently — but if you stop and think about it, Intel CPUs have been the gold standard for conventional DirectX 11 workloads for a long time now. That means developers design scenes and games to be executed efficiently within the constraints DX11 put on Intel processors — and that, in turn, can limit the boost Intel chips see when using DirectX 12. Long term we expect to see better support for multi-threaded rendering and higher CPU core counts as developers begin using DirectX 12 more, but that may be a relatively slow transition. Major engines like Unreal will continue to support multiple APIs for some time into the future — DirectX 9’s feature set is still relevant to gaming today, and that API is nearly old enough to drive. Meanwhile, many consumer applications still top out, practically speaking, at just four threads. Some will see this roadmap as confirmation that Intel is reacting to AMD’s Zen, but we frankly doubt it. Zen is not expected to match Intel clock-for-clock and while we expect its power efficiency to be vastly better than anything AMD fielded with Bristol Ridge or Carrizo, it’s still going to take multiple product cycles to bring overall APU performance up to compete with Intel. While AMD intends to launch Zen APUs, it’s focusing on servers and the desktop market first — areas where it has much larger TDP ranges and can leverage core counts more effectively. Of course all of this is rumor at this point — take it all with a grain or ten of salt.

By Liam Tung | September 15, 2016 -- 11:32 GMT (04:32 PDT) | Topic: Hardware As well as a gold finish option, the XPS 13 comes with either a QHD touch display with a Core i7 or the FHD display with Core i5. Image: Dell Dell has refreshed its popular XPS 13 laptop with Intel's seventh-generation Core processors. The update brings a longer battery life, among other improvements, and a new rose-gold option for those who want a change from the usual silver. The move brings Dell's XPS 13 in line with other hardware carrying Intel's new chips, such as the recently-released Lenovo Yoga 910. Tech Pro Research System Monitoring Policy Going old school with tape backup Leaders share software-defined networking's benefits, obstacles, favored vendors TechRepublic's Depreciation Calculator Shipping with Windows 10, the XPS 13 will be available with either a QHD+ touch display with the latest Core i7 processor or the FHD display with a new Core i5 processor. Dell says the QHD+ model's battery will last up to 13 hours, while the FHD model will last up to 22 hours, thanks to a larger 60Wh battery. They also feature Dell's super-thin bezels, which it calls the InfinityEdge Display. Dell is touting two configurations, the FHD model with 8GB RAM, 256GB solid-state storage, and Intel's seventh generation i5 Core processors, as well as the QHD+ model with the same RAM and storage configurations but with Intel's latest Core i7 processor. Dell is also releasing an updated Developer Edition of the XPS 13 that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Its predecessor, the 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, is Linux creator Linus Torvalds' preferred laptop for programming and rated by ZDNet's open-source expert Steven J Vaughan-Nichols as the best laptop for serious programmers. ZDNet has contacted Dell's Europe office for more details and pricing. However, according to The Verge, the updated XPS 13 will also be available with Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 options, as well as 4G, 8GB, and 16GB memory options. Buyers will also be able choose 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB SSD. According to Dell, the XPS 13 and XPS 13 Developer Edition will be available from October 4, starting at $799 and $949 respectively. However, buyers who want gold will pay gold prices. Those starting prices only apply to the standard silver option, while the new rose-gold models start at $1,149.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 14, 2016 at 6:25PM Image source: CEVA.  Once Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted key technical specs for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on its website, it became clear that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was supplying a meaningful portion of the modems (with its XMM 7360 modem) that will go into these phones. Obviously, this is a win for Intel. Even if the revenue impact is limited, it serves as a validation of the company's significant multi-year investment in cellular modems. However, there is a company besides Intel that could enjoy a more substantial financial boost from this development: CEVA (NASDAQ:CEVA). What is CEVA, and how does it fit in here? CEVA designs digital signal processors that are used in a number of applications, including cellular modems. To be clear, CEVA is an intellectual property vendor, which means that it produces a design that another company takes and integrates into a chip. Companies like CEVA usually receive up-front licensing fees for their technology and subsequent royalty payments from sales of chips incorporating their technologies. With that in mind, it's important to note that cellular modems incorporate what are known as digital signal processors, or DSPs, to handle key processing tasks. Modems from Infineon Wireless (now Intel's wireless group) have historically used DSP cores from CEVA. In contrast, Qualcomm modems use in-house "Hexagon" DSP cores. When Infineon Wireless/Intel Mobile was kicked out of the iPhone several generations ago, CEVA lost a significant amount of smartphone DSP business. However, with Intel seemingly back in the iPhone in a significant way, royalties from CEVA's cellular baseband-related products should be poised to increase in the coming quarters. What kind of impact could CEVA enjoy? Last quarter, CEVA reported collecting royalties on 225 million units shipped by its partners, 191 million of which were related to cellular modems. The company's total royalty revenue during the quarter was $9.6 million. The average per-unit royalty, then, works out to $0.0427. If the upcoming iPhone product cycle see shipments of 120 million to 130 million units -- total unit volume is likely to be higher, but keep in mind that Apple is also selling the older iPhone 6s/6s Plus/SE which do not contain Intel modems and CEVA DSPs -- then CEVA could be looking at an additional $5.3 million in royalty revenue over that period. Considering that CEVA generated revenue of $59.5 million in its last fiscal year, the contribution to both the top and bottom lines should be significant. Furthermore, if Apple opts to use an Intel modem again in the successor to the iPhone 7 (something that seems likely but is hardly assured), and assuming that Intel continues to use CEVA DSPs (the successor to Intel's XMM 7360, the XMM 7480, indeed uses a CEVA DSP, according to CEVA itself), then CEVA could benefit not only from shipments of the next generation device but continued iPhone 7 volume once it becomes Apple's mid-range offering. A nice win for CEVA At the end of the day, Intel's success at Apple bodes well for CEVA's results in the near to medium term. If Intel proves that it can continue to win a place inside the iPhone year in and year out, and the company continues to employ CEVA technology, the longer term boost for CEVA could be significant as well.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 14, 2016 at 2:32PM Image source: Apple. It's been about five years since Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had any meaningful slot in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Previously, Apple had sourced cellular baseband modems from its Infineon wireless segment, which Intel acquired way back in 2010. But then Apple dropped Infineon and began exclusively sourcing baseband from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) starting with the iPhone 4s in 2011, and has stuck with the mobile chip giant ever since. Intel has fought for years to get back in, and rumors to that effect have swirled ahead of every iPhone launch. Well, it looks like Chipzilla has finally succeeded. Tech teardown Investors won't know for sure until the new iPhones are shipped and subsequently torn down to see what components are inside. This usually occurs immediately within a day or two. But all signs point to Intel having won the GSM-equipped variants. Unlike in recent years where a single Qualcomm modem could handle just about any network you threw at it, you'll notice that this year half of the models do not support CDMA networks. Intel's 7630 modem fits the bill. From a global perspective, GSM is generally far more widely used for 3G connectivity. But CDMA is important in the two largest smartphone markets: U.S. and China. Half of the domestic carriers use CDMA, while TD-SCDMA is prevalent in China, so Intel's win will be limited. That also has some potential implications for global travelers that need broader support. Not only do the specs suggest that Apple is now dual-sourcing from Intel, but The Wall Street Journal's people ever familiar with the matter have also confirmed it. Intel has undoubtedly failed in the mobile market, but this win is a small consolation. I'd also be worried about the negative implications for Qualcomm. Apple is one of Qualcomm's two most important customers, and Apple has undoubtedly been using this dual-sourcing strategy as negotiating leverage. To the extent that Intel can continue catching up with its baseband products, Apple will continue putting the squeeze on Qualcomm for volume concessions. In less than a week, we'll know for sure whether or not there's Intel inside, but all signs point to yes. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Chances are your computer isn’t running as fast as it could – and not because of all those browser extensions and background processes. Nope, your PC might not be performing at its peak because it may have been hamstrung by manufacturer set speed limits. How do you cast off those oppressive shackles keeping your CPU from its true potential? You overclock it. Overclocking your CPU is about more than just juicing up your processor. It’s about exploring the limits of your PC, pushing it to perform at its peak. Why is that? Well, when chips come off the line, they’re not uniformly capable. Due to variables in the manufacturing process, even CPUs produced in the same batch are going to perform differently. So manufacturers like Intel and AMD test the chips and slap a speed limit on them based on a lot of different factors. Performance, supply quotas, and marketing all play a role in determining how many chips of a certain speed each manufacturer ships to retailers. That’s where the fun comes in. By doing some tinkering, you might find that your humble CPU is hiding some serious horsepower. You could very well crank a 4GHz processor up to 4.5GHz or 4.6GHz for instance. With some serious cooling power, you might even push it to 5GHz. But your mileage will vary, because like we said, no two chips are alike. Exciting, right? Depending on your luck, you might have a processor that is capable of running much, much faster than it currently is, like a caged cheetah. Or a surprisingly quick tortoise. There’s only one way to find out. A word of caution When you overclock a processor a couple things happen. The chip runs hotter, and it uses more power. Both of those factors can be a problem if your PC has a barebones cooler. If you want to get serious power out of your processor, you might want to invest in some high quality cooling. You don’t have to spring for full-loop liquid cooling if you’re just looking to squeeze out a couple more clock cycles, but you might want to have a look at high performance fans or other cooling solutions. Secondly, if you’re looking for help overclocking your laptop, you’re probably out of luck. There are a couple laptops on the market which ship with unlocked Intel or AMD processors, but generally speaking most laptops – even gaming laptops – are shipped with locked processors. Finally, overclocking your CPU usually voids any warranty your computer is currently under. So if you’re worried about your warranty, or your extended care plan, stop reading and back away. Still want to give it a shot? Let’s get to the fun stuff. Identify your CPU First, it’s important to determine whether you can actually overclock your CPU in the first place. This is an area where AMD and Intel differ significantly. Most AMD chips can be overclocked, while only two series of Intel chips can be overclocked. Below are some current generation Intel processors which are unlocked and ready for overclocking. It’s not a definitive list, so if you’ve got an older PC your CPU, yours might not be down there. SKU Default Speed Cores Price Core i5-6600K 3.5GHz 4 $235 Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz 4 $340 Core i7-6800K 3.4GHz 6 $440 Core i7-6950X 3.0GHz 10 $1650 Core i7-6900K 3.2GHz 8 $1100 Core i7-6850K 3.6GHz 6 $610 Core i7-5960X 3.0GHz 8 $1016 Core i7-5930K 3.5GHz 6 $580 Core i7-5820K 3.3GHz 6 $340 Generally speaking, Intel chips can only be overclocked if they’re in the K or X-series. On rare occasions Intel produces an exception, like the affordable Pentium G3258. But that’s rare. In contrast to Intel, AMD produces a lot of unlocked processors, and currently they have three different lines of CPUs that offer unlocked variants. Rather than list individual processors here, below you’ll find the three current series of unlocked processors from AMD. Series Default Speed Cores Price Range AMD FX Series 3.2GHz – 4.7GHz 4-8 $78 – $202 Athlon X4 K-Series 3.8GHz – 4.2GHz 4 $60 – $84 AMD A10 & A8 K-Series 3.8GHz – 4.3GHz 2-4 $79 – $392 Now, don’t worry if your CPU isn’t on either list. It can be tough to identify whether or not your CPU is unlocked, particularly if it’s an older model. Fortunately, the utilities used in this guide will let you know whether or not your processor supports overclocking. Pop the hood Overclocking doesn’t require you to open up your PC, but you should. Get in there and clear out any dust with a can of compressed air, as you want to make sure your PC is running as cool as it possibly can before you squeeze any extra clock cycles out of your CPU. Open up your case, and be sure to blow out the main fan over your CPU, your GPU, and all the nooks and crannies. Your PC should be as clean as the day you bought it before you start juicing it for all its worth. Get your tools together It’s worth mentioning that there are two schools of thought when it comes to overclocking. Some prefer to overclock directly in your computer’s BIOS, while others prefer to use software you can run from your operating system. There are advantages and disadvantages for both. Overclocking in the BIOS allows more fine-grain detail as you configure various settings. But this guide is for beginners, so we’re going to focus on using software. You’ll want to to grab a utility that will allow you to make changes to your clock speed, and then test those changes. The app will help us determine what your PC’s stats currently are – how hot it’s running, how fast it’s running, and how much power it’s currently pulling down. The utility you need varies depending on if you have an AMD or Intel chip.

Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global gesture recognition market: Processor manufacturers incorporating gesture recognition Growing consumer electronics market Emergence of gestures as a new way of communicating with machines Development of motion-control gaming Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=52163 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Processor manufacturers incorporating gesture recognition Manufacturers such as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Microchip, and Texas Instruments have launched processors that support gesture recognition technology. In 2011, Texas Instruments launched OMAP 5 processors, which had the capability to recognize gestures utilizing the device's camera. Qualcomm acquired assets and technology from GestureTek in 2011 to add gesture recognition technology to its processors. In 2014, Intel introduced its RealSense technology for 3D gesture recognition with its 3D depth camera for notebooks, desktops, and other range of hybrid laptops. Intel has gone a step further with its RealSense technology, which was incorporated within a 3D depth camera that is small enough to be fitted in smartphones and easily incorporated into tablets. According to Navin Rajendra, an industry expert for human machine interface at Technavio, "Gesture recognition can be more accurate and provides better results than 2D cameras. Thus, processor manufacturers are investing in this technology, as a result of which gesture recognition is expected to become common in tablets, smartphones, and other devices during the forecast period." Growing consumer electronics market The demand for devices such as smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and TVs is growing due to numerous factors such as advances in technology, increased functionalities, and decreased prices. Smartphones are increasingly being used by every individual, and Technavio expects the market to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% during the forecast period. The markets in developed countries such as the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK are saturated but are still growing. At the same time, there is a huge potential for smartphone sales in countries such as India, China, Indonesia, Brazil, and other emerging economies. Most of the processors integrated into smartphones are capable of running gesture recognition software, which augurs well for the growth of the market. Emergence of gestures as a new way of communicating with machines PC users always look for new innovative technologies in their devices and gesture recognition is one of them. There are also consumers, though low in number, who demand gesture recognition in their smartphones, gaming consoles, and other gadgets. Graphic designers, engineers, artists, and others involved in design already find this technology useful when combined with AR. Gesture recognition helps them visualize the designs in 3D, and they can interact with the computer using hand movement. In addition, gaming using gesture recognition on a PC can create an experience similar to that provided by Xbox and PlayStation at a much more affordable cost. The educationindustry can use this technology to make learning more interactive and interesting. There are a number of other end-user applications that enable easy interaction with PCs. These applications can open up a number of other possibilities and reduce the need for existing hardware such as remote controls and keyboards. Development of motion-control gaming Motion-control gaming has gained traction in the global gaming console market. Major gaming console manufacturers such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have motion controllers in their products. Microsoft developed Kinect, which works as a motion controller as well as a gesture recognition device. Sony's PlayStation Move can be used with its PlayStation Eye camera, and up to four such motion controllers can be connected at once to enable multiplayer gaming. Nintendo's Wii Remote is a motion controller that can be used with Wii U game consoles. The use of motion controllers in gaming will educate gamers about the use of natural hand gestures to control games. This will help increase awareness about gesture recognition-based gaming consoles. Motion controllers can be considered as the first-step toward gesture recognition for gaming. "Thus, it is safe to expect these motion controllers to be replaced with gesture recognition devices in the future not just to control gaming consoles but other devices as well," says Navin.

(Intel), Added September 12, 2016 Translating...TranslateChinese SimplifiedChinese TraditionalEnglishFrenchGermanItalianPortugueseRussianSpanishTurkish This is a computer translation of the original content. It is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon as complete or accurate. Share Tweet Share Executive Summary The PCOMMIT instruction has been deprecated.  Although it was documented earlier, Intel has dropped it from consideration for future products.  This blog post explains the details behind that decision.   Enabling Persistent Memory Programming                                In preparation for the emerging persistent memory technologies, like Intel DIMMs based on 3D XPoint™ technology, Intel has defined several new instructions to enable the persistent memory programming model.  First, there are two new optimized cache flushing instructions, CLWB and CLFLUSHOPT.  These instructions are described in the Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference and are slated to appear on various platforms, including those supporting the Intel DIMM.  They provide a high performance method to flush stores from the CPU cache to the persistence domain, a term used to describe that portion of a platform’s data path where stores are power-fail safe. Originally, the set of new instructions included one called PCOMMIT, intended for use on platforms where flushing from the CPU cache was not sufficient to reach the persistence domain.  On those platforms, an additional step using PCOMMIT was required to ensure that stores had passed from memory controller write pending queues to the DIMM, which is the persistence domain on those platforms. The picture below illustrates the data path taken by a store (MOV) to persistent memory. As shown above, when an application executes a MOV instruction, the store typically ends up in the CPU caches.  Instructions like CLWB can be used to flush the store from the CPU cache.  At that point, the store may spend some amount of time in the write pending queue (WPQ) in the memory controller.  As shown above, the larger dashed box represents the power-fail safe persistence domain on a platform that is designed to flush the WPQ automatically on power-fail or shutdown.  One such platform-level feature to perform this flushing is called Asynchronous DRAM Refresh, or ADR. When the persistent memory programming model was first designed, there was a concern that ADR was a rarely-available platform feature so the PCOMMIT instruction was added to ensure there was a way to achieve persistence on machines without ADR (platforms where the persistence domain is the smaller dashed box in the picture above).  However, it turns out that platforms planning to support the Intel DIMM are also planning to support ADR, so the need for PCOMMIT is now gone.  The result is a simpler, single programming model where the application need not contain logic for detecting whether PCOMMIT is required.  For this reason, PCOMMIT is being deprecated before ever shipping on an Intel CPU, removing any need to support the instruction in older software since no software could have contained it (the opcode has always produced an invalid opcode exception and will continue to do so). As shown in the picture above, a platform may still have a way to flush the WPQ (shown as WPQ Flush above).  Unlike the PCOMMIT instruction, this is a kernel-only facility used to flush commands written to DIMM command registers, or used by the kernel in the rare case where it wants to ensure something is immediately flushed to the DIMM.  The application is typically unaware the WPQ Flush mechanism exists.   The Simpler Programming Model The picture below shows a sample instruction sequence for storing values (10 and 20) to persistent memory locations. The sequence on the left was required on platforms that did not have the ADR feature to flush the WPQ on power-fail/shutdown.  Since ADR is now a requirement for persistent memory support, the simpler sequence on the right can be used for all platforms.   Operating System and Toolchain Changes    To prepare for persistent memory programming, some operating systems, compilers, assemblers, and libraries were modified to use the PCOMMIT instruction.  Since the instruction was not guaranteed to exist on a given platform, any software using PCOMMIT would only do so if the appropriate CPUID flag indicated PCOMMIT was supported (the exact flag is CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0H):EBX, bit 22).  Since PCOMMIT is deprecated, that CPUID flag is now reserved to always be zero, rendering any code using PCOMMIT to be dead code that will never be executed. The harmless dead code can be removed over time, but as of this writing, all known operating systems supporting persistent memory and the Non-Volatile Memory Libraries (NVML) at http://pmem.io have already been updated to remove all uses of PCOMMIT.   Summary The programming model for persistent memory on Intel CPUs has been simplified by deprecating the PCOMMIT instruction before its first implementation.  Most software, including the Non-Volatile Memory Libraries at http://pmem.io are already updated to reflect this change.   Glossary of Terms Power-fail Protected Domain or Persistent Domain When storing to pmem, this is the point along the path taken by the store where the store is considered persistent ADR (Asynchronous DRAM Refresh) A platform-level feature where the power supply signals other system components that power-fail is imminent, causing the Write Pending Queues in the memory subsystem to be flushed PCOMMIT An instruction allowing an application to flush-on-demand the memory subsystem Write Pending Queues.  With ADR required, this instruction is no longer necessary and is being deprecated. WPQ (sometimes called TPQ) Write Pending Queues in the memory subsystem CLFLUSH CLWB CLFLUSHOPT Instructions that flush lines from the CPU caches.  CLWB and CLFLUSHOPT are recent additions for better pmem performance CPUID The mechanism allowing software to detect what features are supported by a CPU   For more complete information about compiler optimizations, see our Optimization Notice.

Password Operating Systems Is Windows 8.1 giving you a hard time ? Wanna try out Windows 10 ?   Thread Tools Display Modes Intel Performance Counter Monitor - A better way to measure CPU utilization   (#1) mbk1969 Ancient Guru   Videocard: GeForce GTX 970 Processor: I7-4930 Mainboard: Asus p9x79 Memory: G Skill RipjawZ, 16GB Soundcard: Onboard + FiiO E17 PSU: 1000 W Intel Performance Counter Monitor - A better way to measure CPU utilization - 09-14-2016, 01:47 | posts: 2,770 | Location: Moscow, Russia Quote: When the CPU utilization does not tell you the utilization of the CPU CPU utilization number obtained from operating system (OS) is a metric that has been used for many purposes like product sizing, compute capacity planning, job scheduling, and so on. The current implementation of this metric (the number that the UNIX* "top" utility and the Windows* task manager report) shows the portion of time slots that the CPU scheduler in the OS could assign to execution of running programs or the OS itself; the rest of the time is idle. For compute-bound workloads, the CPU utilization metric calculated this way predicted the remaining CPU capacity very well for architectures of 80ies that had much more uniform and predictable performance compared to modern systems. The advances in computer architecture made this algorithm an unreliable metric because of introduction of multi core and multi CPU systems, multi-level caches, non-uniform memory, simultaneous multithreading (SMT), pipelining, out-of-order execution, etc. A prominent example is the non-linear CPU utilization on processors with Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology). Intel® HT technology is a great performance feature that can boost performance by up to 30%. However, HT-unaware end users get easily confused by the reported CPU utilization: Consider an application that runs a single thread on each physical core. Then, the reported CPU utilization is 50% even though the application can use up to 70%-100% of the execution units. A different example is the CPU utilization for "memory throughput"-intensive workloads on multi-core systems. The bandwidth test "stream" already saturates the capacity of memory controller with fewer threads than there are cores available. Abstraction Level for Performance Monitoring Units The good news is that Intel processors already provide the capability to monitor performance events inside processors. In order to obtain a more precise picture of CPU resource utilization we rely on the dynamic data obtained from the so-called performance monitoring units (PMU) implemented in Intel's processors. We concentrate on the advanced feature set available in the current Intel® Xeon® 5500, 5600, 7500, E5, E7 and Core i7 processor series. We have implemented a basic set of routines with a high level interface that are callable from user C++ application and provide various CPU performance metrics in real-time. In contrast to other existing frameworks like PAPI* and Linux* "perf" we support not only core but also uncore PMUs of Intel processors (including the recent Intel® Xeon® E7 processor series). The uncore is the part of the processor that contains the integrated memory controller and the Intel® QuickPath Interconnect to the other processors and the I/O hub. In total, the following metrics are supported: Core: instructions retired, elapsed core clock ticks, core frequency including Intel® Turbo boost technology, L2 cache hits and misses, L3 cache misses and hits (including or excluding snoops). Uncore: read bytes from memory controller(s), bytes written to memory controller(s), data traffic transferred by the Intel® QuickPath Interconnect links. I want to see these counters! As an additional goody, the package includes easy-to-use command line and graphical utilities that are based on these routines. They can be used out-of-the box by users which cannot or do not want to integrate the routines in their code but are willing to monitor and understand the CPU capacity limits in real-time. https://software.intel.com/en-us/art...ounter-monitor For true geeks.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Analysis  ⋮  Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware Exclusive: Is Intel Really Starting To Lose Its Process Lead? 7nm Node Slated For Release in 2022 By Usman Pirzada Posted 2 months ago 96Shares Share Tweet Submit A comparison between 300mm² and 450mm² wafers - the shift to the latter will result in increased economies of scale. Changes in Intel’s hiring documentation have revealed what appears to be the first sign of the fact that the chip maker has delayed its 7 nm process to 2022. The 7nm node has been referred to, many times, as the end of conventional process technology and, quite repeatedly, the start of the road where physics will start to break down (we will go into detail on this below). Quite understandably, Intel has started to slow down its shrink schedule to milk the existing nodes for a bit longer and most of all – buy it precious time. It is with this somewhat stark backdrop in mind that we will look at this new development. Advert pops up stating that Intel’s 7nm node has been delayed to 2022 – Will TSMC & other Pure Play foundries beat it to the process? Motley Fool’s Ashraf Eassa was the first to spot that an Intel job advert looking for a processor designer had changed its time frame to 2022 from 2020 so the advert read: “ The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel’s sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade.” Remember that pesky thing called Moore’s law? Well, all vestiges of that have been going out of the window with recent announcements. The Moore’s law cycle was initially stated to be a 1 year cycle, in the recent past it was a 2 year cycle. With the announcement of Kaby Lake however, the time span increased even more: tick tock became tick tock tock. With the 10nm process, Intel expects to bring out three iterations of 10nm, namely 10nm, 10nm+ and 10nm ++. If we are to believe this advert then Intel should enter volume production of 10nm in 2017 with the final micro architecture landing in 2020 (10nm for 2017-2018, 10nm+ for 2018-2019 and 10nm++ for 2019-2020). Why physics starts to break down at near atomic sizes; the short version Its very clear that the company is going to face a lot of problems as we move towards 7nm. People keep on saying that “physics is going to break down” at this scale – but what that does that mean really? Well, the building block of computer processors is the transistor. Which is nothing more than a gate which either allows electrons to pass – or doesn’t depending on the state. When we talk about the process node getting smaller – its actually these gates which are getting smaller. A gate below 7nm will be just a few silicon atoms thick (1nm has a about two silicon atoms but the process name does not correspond directly to the size of the gate). At this point, you are probably wondering so what is the big deal? Those who remember elementary physics will recall that an atom is quite a big larger than an electron and as long as its bigger than an electron its good right? not exactly. This is where quantum mechanics step in. You might have heard that it is physically impossible to know the precise location of any given electron at any given time. What you can have are locations where the electron is probably located (this probability is 95% within the orbital cloud but approaches zero as you move further away, but never actually touches zero!). To state the obvious, the Balrog represents the electron and Gandalf’s swords represent the gate. Copyright: Last Clover, DeviantArt When dealing with gates this small an interesting phenomenon begins to occur – the electron can simply chose to be on the other side of the gate; in other words they can effectively tunnel through the closed transistor and appear on the other side. And when you are talking about logic sensitive circuits you can’t have closed gates leaking electricity. There are of course ways to get around this ranging from the choice of the substrate to the design of the transistor. Interestingly however, TSMC has recently revealed that it is right on track to deliver the 7nm process in 2018 which raises some very interesting questions: is Intel, the chipzilla who has dominated process advances for more than a decade finally falling behind to competition? Well, its a little more complicated than that. Simon Wang, director of business development at TSMC stated that the company is aiming to go into volume production at 7 nanometers in the first quarter of 2018. It is only a year after the next generation, 10 nanometer, is expected to start generating revenue. Other pure play foundries like Samsung and Globalfoundries will also be following soon behind. It would look like someone forgot to tell them about physics because they don’t seem to be having a problem with it – so what’s wrong with Intel? Understanding how foundries name their process nodes: Intel’s 10nm versus TSMC 10nm and beyond The answer lies in the fact that Intel’s naming standards and TSMC’s naming standards are drastically different. Intel’s processes use the same backbone as the advertised node (a 14nm process will use a 14nm backbone) while as all pure play foundries use a mixture of process technologies. TSMC’s 16nm FinFET tech for example uses a 20nm backbone (BEOL). So it is almost a certainty that they will be using a 14nm BEOL for their ’10nm finfet’ node. Let me explain a bit further, the process names that foundries use have now become more or less marketing material and not accurate physical descriptions of the node (except maybe in the case of Intel). Simply marketing a node as 7nm FinFET or 10nm FinFET does not make it a true 7nm or 10nm node respectively. I think the most relevant benchmark in this case (in my attempt to explain the point) is that of the Transistor Gate Pitch. This is the measure which is usually a very good indicator of the “true” node that a foundry might be using. Advertisement Process Feature Size Comparison WCCFTech Intel 22nm Intel 14nm TSMC 16nm Samsung 14nm Transistor Fin Pitch 60nm 42nm 48nm 48nm Transistor Gate Pitch 90nm 70nm 90nm 84nm Interconnect Pitch 80nm 52nm 64nm 64nm SRAM Cell Area .1080um² .0588² .0700² .0645² To give a starting reference point, the Transistor Gate Pitch of a ‘true’ 22nm node is 90nm (or 45nm if you are measuring in half pitch). The Intel 22nm node, had a transistor gate half pitch of exactly 45 nm. In comparison, the transistor gate pitch of all 14nm/16nm FinFET nodes out there have a transistor gate pitch of ~90nm. This means that physically speaking, these processes are actually equal to Intel’s 22nm node. The correct physical description of the 14nm/16nm FinFET node from TSMC/GloFo and Samsung would be 20nm with FinFETs. But hey, since you are getting a performance advantage from going FinFET (over planar) at the same physical step, why not brand it as a lower node right? It’s not like most of the market can tell which is which. Now let’s talk about Intel’s 14nm with FinFETs node. A simple calculation shows us that if a 22nm node has a Transistor Gate Pitch of 90nm, a true 14nm node with proper physical scaling should have a transistor gate pitch scaling (shrinkage) of more than more than 63%. That said, Intel has introduced 14nm with FinFETs and unlike the pure play foundries out there, it is not the same physical node as 22nm. Intel was able to achieve a shrink of roughly 30-40% over the 63% ideal shrink (Intel Transistor Gate Half Pitch for 14nm FinFET is 35nm) which while not perfect, is much closer to a true 14nm node than any of its competitors out there which are clearly 20nm and higher nodes. So here is the thing, to truly make sense of Intel’s standing in the foundry market, and to ascertain whether or not it has lost any real industry advantage – we must put aside the cloak of invisibility marketing material and judge it on a basis of apples to apples. When TSMC says that it will be shifting to 10nm by next year – what it really means is that it will be shifting to the Transistor Gate Half Pitch measure of somewhere in the vicinity of 35nm – this is something Intel achieved last year. In other words, it will be using a 14nm back end of line (BEOL) but because the addition of FinFETs gives it a performance gain that a shift to 10nm planar would give – they call it 10nm FinFET process. Investigating the shift of foundries to EUV for 7nm and beyond Here is the catch though, TSMC claims that it will be shifting to Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography after the 10nm process and claims to be one of the first foundries to deploy EUV. Conventionally speaking the capabilities of the laser used can be calculated by the simple formulae of dividing the wavelength by 2. Since EUV has a wavelength of 13.5nm it can easily imprint wafers on the 7nm process (the theoretical limit is 6.75nm, easily extendable up to 5nm with tricks such as multi patterning). So how much of that is real? A slide showing the various possibilities for 5nm and beyond. Approximately two years ago, ASML and TSMC recently achieved a landmark goal by using an EUV scanner to produce more than 1000 wafers. The wafers were manufactured by using the NXE:3300B system by ASML holding and was done during the duration of exactly one day. TSMC already has two such systems in their foundry and plans to add as many as 2 more for the targeted output of 1000 wafers per day (sustained) at much higher than 90 Watts. Now here is the thing, the scanners originally used for testing were operating at 90W power, and should have been replaced with 3350B models running at 125W and ideally the factories should be capable of 250W production by, well, this year. Now let’s talk about Intel. The company has already stated that it does not need to use EUV for 10nm and plans to use them for nodes smaller than 10nm (although to be honest, they have been saying that ever since the 45nm node) – and you can be sure that if Intel switches to EUV, the process lead it has been enjoying for so long will hold (regardless of what the marketed names of the node might indicate). Although the customers of ASML are a secret, Intel is pretty much a no brainier considering their huge stake in the company.  But if this recent advert is to be believed, it does not look like that will be happening (or happening at a date later than the others). The demise of Intel’s process lead has always been greatly exaggerated Conclusion: Many analysts have been pointing to the fact that Intel had problems shifting to the 14nm node and 10nm and 7nm are going to be only harder, but as I have already explained in the article, that trouble was due to the process being much smaller than everyone else and not at all comparable to TSMC’s 16nm FinFET node – which is really 20nm with FinFETs physically speaking. This is why, at the very end of the article, I will give my opinion: It is entirely possible that 7nm wont land till 2021/2022 (considering the PAO cadence, 10nm will stay till 2020 at the very least) and it is also very much possible that you will see process nodes being marketed as 7nm by various foundries before Intel. But what is not possible (or rather highly improbable) is that Intel loses its process lead in terms of the actual physical node. Because for that to happen we have to assume that they wont be making the shift to EUV along with others and considering Intel has the largest stake (14.37%) in the company that produces the EUV scanners: ASML Holdings, it seems very very unlikely. The simple fact of the matter is that Intel has never cared about beating the foundries on the basis of marketing material – but it has consistently beaten every other foundry to process shrinks in terms of their physical size. Apart from this advert, I see no change in any of the fundamental variables that might indicate that this will not be true for the years to come. Intel’s greatest rival has always been, and remains, the laws of physics.

As Intel proceeds with plans to divest its majority stake in Intel Security, the chipmaker's security business unit, a lawsuit filed against Intel threatens to create challenges for the entity. Intel purchased the anti-virus company in 2011 for $US7.68 billion, then known as McAfee. Private equity firm TPG is backing the security business as a new entity under the McAfee name. The middle-market investment firm will pay Intel $US3.1 billion for a 51 percent stake in the new entity. The transaction is valued at $US4.2 billion, including debt. Intel first began exploring the sale of the security unit in June, according to a report in the Financial Times. The anti-virus company was founded by John McAfee in 1987. Intel renamed the company Intel Security in 2014, although some of the unit's products continue to use the McAfee name. John McAfee and his cyber-security investment firm, MGT Capital Investments, filed a request for a judgment that his investment company's “use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business” would not infringe on Intel's trademark.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 18, 2016 The Surprising Story Of The First Microprocessors 16 Comments by: Jenny List September 15, 2016 If you maintain an interest in vintage computers, you may well know something of the early history of the microprocessor, how Intel’s 4-bit 4004, intended for a desktop calculator, was the first to be developed, and the follow-up 8008 was the first 8-bit device. We tend to like simple stories when it comes to history, and inventions like this are always conveniently packaged for posterity as one-off events. In fact the story of the development of the first microprocessors is a much more convoluted one than it might appear, with several different companies concurrently at the forefront of developments. A fascinating recent IEEE Spectrum piece from [Ken Shirriff] investigates this period in microprocessor design, and presents the surprising conclusion that Texas Instruments may deserve the crown of having created the first 8-bit device, dislodging the 8008 from its pedestal. The piece looks at the development of MOS integrated circuits for general purpose computing in the late 1960s, and the progression through a series of military and avionic, then mini- computers with ever smaller chip counts. Long-forgotten companies like Viatron, whose claim to fame is coining the word “microprocessor”, and Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), whose Datapoint 2200 intelligent terminal was the seed for Intel’s 8008 architecture make an appearance. It was the Datapoint 2200 that lay at the root of TI’s claim for the first 8-bit microprocessor, both TI and Intel worked separately on processors to replace the 2200’s discrete chip processor. TI’s offering, the TMX1795, was completed months before the 8008, but in the event CTC rejected both chips and continued with its discrete architecture. Intel successfully commercialised the 8008 while the TI chip failed to find any customers, and the rest, as they say, is history. The IEEE Spectrum piece investigates this period in extremely interesting detail, and is well worth a read. We’ve covered the early Intel processors a few times in the past. We had an investigation of the 4004 internals, a Retro Challenge entry of a 4004 ROM emulator, and someone made a clock based on an 8008. 4004 die image: Intel Free Press [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons.

In school for EE we didn’t have any micro classes so all I learned about micros was programming the chip and learning how to do it the hard way. BTW it was a dog of a chip with all the address and data lines going through the same 8 lines so you had to capture the high level address then the low level address then the data. That made it very slow. Even though the chip was small the supporting chips were large. Report comment Reply Michael Black says: September 15, 2016 at 4:31 pm Did you splurge on the hardware to add a stack? At least, I thought it was the 8008 that had no internal stack, an article in an early issue if Byte showed how to add a small stack. Michael Report comment Reply DougL says: September 16, 2016 at 3:42 pm Gosh it was so long ago, but it did have a internal stack, Online it said “Seven-level push-down address call stack. Eight registers are actually used, with the top-most register being the PC.” Report comment Reply RoGeorge says: September 15, 2016 at 4:09 pm This is my INS4004J waiting for a great project.

There is a nonzero possibility that I have one sitting in a box of junk somewhere, thinking it was some old 4000 series CMOS that I’ve never been big into using. Report comment Reply x says: September 15, 2016 at 4:23 pm Ahh the 8008. I helped debug code on one of those back in the late 70’s (?). Our memory board (4k bytes) was the size of a modern day laptop and was kept powered on 24/7 while debugging because the only way to reload it was via paper tape / teletype. The final debugged program image was then sent out of house and burned into a prom. Good memories.

Report comment Reply Sweeney says: September 16, 2016 at 4:28 pm In the early days of silicon chips a fab could start producing 100% rejects for no apparent reason, so anyone who wanted chips in volume insisted that there be at least one second source. AMD got their licence for x86 from starting out as an official second source for example. Report comment Reply Jac Goudsmit (@JacGoudsmit) says: September 16, 2016 at 8:37 pm MOS licensed their 6502 chips to a number of other manufacturers, which gave control away but made the chip more interesting for buyers. Apple would still be waiting for their 6502’s if they would have ordered them from MOS in 1977: Commodore (who owned MOS) was a direct competitor. Report comment Reply Pete Willard says: September 15, 2016 at 9:06 pm National Semiconductor was the only second source company for the Intel 4004. The company announced second-sourcing of 4004 family at the beginning of 1975, started shipping samples in December 1974 – January 1975, and full production started in May – June 1975. Report comment Reply Law says: September 16, 2016 at 12:14 pm I built the Mark 8 computer which used an Intel 8008. Had a 5-bit baudot teletype, a TV typewriter, and Dr Suding’s cassette interface. These were a good introduction to digital electronics, machine programming, and the peripherals, including the ever popular programming of serial data (AKA bit-banging). Report comment Reply Ben Thar says: September 19, 2016 at 10:38 am I’m glad to see Ken Shirriff’s detailed article. The evolution of the microprocessor from it’s calculator and terminal roots is a complicated story. Only in Intel’s corporate, loud, and constant re-telling of the story is Intel protrayed as the sole inventor. Hoff and Mazor deserve plenty of credit, but in Intel’s version, Faggin is all but written out the of the story…along with anybody else…at any other company. “History is written by the victors.” as the saying goes. Report comment Reply Daniel Delaureal says: September 19, 2016 at 5:46 pm Lordy, lordy, lordy, I worked for Data Point back in the day. They had a networking protocol called ARCnet way before ethernet ever got off the ground. The tech people begged upper management to license it out and beat ethernet to the punch, but of course…..The company was finally destroyed by Asher Edelman who raided the employees retirement fund and broke up the company.

SCOUT Jacob Phillips (© Chad Simmons) Jacob Phillips still major OU priority Bob Przybylo 09/15/2016 Intel returns with an update on Jacob Phillips, following OU visit. It wasn’t a huge visit weekend for Oklahoma with just two official visitors. But no doubt Nashville (Tenn.) East Literature Magnet inside linebacker Jacob Phillips will be one to monitor going forward. Phillips, a Scout 300 prospect, was back in Norman for the first time since a trip in the spring, and it’s clear everything went as well as expected. http://www.scout.com/player/194194-jacob-phillips?s=73 His trips are not done as Phillips continues one of the most ambitious official visit schedules anyone has ever seen with five consecutive weekends of visits, but OU has made its impression. Phillips is definitely a top target for OU and looks to be the same for Alabama and Notre Dame. The Sooners seem to have Phillips and Anthony Hines’ names circled as to who will be that final inside linebacker for the class. Here are Phillips’ impressions following another trip to Norman and the first look at the renovated stadium. How different was this visit compared to the one you took to OU in the spring? A lot different on this visit. I had a lot of fun just being around everyone down there. On my first visit it was a lot of touring and stuff like that but the players were around this time so that made it better. Who was your host and what was your favorite part of the weekend? Tay Evans and again, just hanging out with the players coaches and commits. Seeing how into the game the fans were was pretty good also. You’ve been pretty clear about saying you wanted to take all five visits and decide. But was there ever a point where you thought about ending it and committing right then and there? No sir. My family and I decided a while ago we were going to wait to take all of my officials so that I would have no regrets. A lot of OU commits and targets picked the Ohio State weekend for their visit so how did ULM become yours? Was it special to be among the first visitors to see the renovated stadium? I wanted to take my first five official visits the first five weeks of the season so it just landed on that date because they had to all fit in a back-to-back schedule. And it was pretty cool seeing the renovated stadium. They looked nice. How was the Sunday morning brunch with Bob Stoops? What kind of experience was that? His house was huge (laughs). Going and looking inside just kind of gives you a hunch that this is where he wants to live for the rest of his life, which is what you want to give you a mental security of a stable coaching staff. We had good conversation and my family enjoyed it. Almost halfway there. Has this process been too overwhelming for you to make visits on five consecutive weekends? No, it's going great. The visits are so fun all throughout the week. I think about the game on Friday and then my visit that weekend.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Scout 2017 Rankings Directory Sooner Intel: Kamren Curl Sooner Intel: Calling on Calvin Sooner Intel: Justin Broiles Pac-12 football grad rates, first to worst Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Sooner Intel: Calling on Calvin Intel returns with a look at OU's defensive line targets. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:55 AM Sooner Intel: Kamren Curl Intel returns with an update OU's most recent offer, Kamren Curl. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:51 AM Setting the stage: OU at West VirginiaFinal breakdown of OU-West Virginia. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:38 AM Five questions: West Virginia Breaking down West Virginia with Kevin Kinder. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 10:50 AM OU's Baker Mayfield delivering on promiseOU quarterback Baker Mayfield has delivered on his promise after Ohio State game. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedWednesday at 9:07 AM OU's road to CFP playoff a daunting one OU's road to the college football playoff is not a smooth road but not impossible. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 7:15 PM Sooners No. 9 in CFP rankingsOU is in the top 10 of the college football playoff rankings for the first time, coming in at No. 9. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 6:38 PM Breaking News Charles Walker NOT returning to OUDefensive lineman Charles Walker is not going to return to OU and will focus on the NFL Draft. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 4:57 PM Przybylo: OU bred for 'Championship November'OU keeps slowly rising up the rankings because Sooners know what 'Championship November' is all about. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedMonday at 7:19 AM Sooner Intel: Justin Broiles Intel returns with an update on OU commit Justin Broiles. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:47 AM Scout 2017 Rankings DirectoryThe Scout positional, state, regional, national and team rankings for the Class of 2017... by Brandon Huffman Scout Football7:00 AM Sooners surge in second halfSenior Jordan Woodard spurred the Sooners' second half surge in an 89-70 win vs. Tulane. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 7:13 PMLoad More NCAA Teams Forums Basketball BB Recruiting Football FB Recruiting JC Football NFL Teams Forums Fantasy News Free Agents Draft MLB Teams Forums News Top Prospects Scouting Home Handy Cooking Gardening Tailgater More Hunting Fishing Warrior Golf NBA High School Other App Membership Tickets FOX Sports Sign In Sign Up Back To Top Twitter Facebook Instagram RSS Feed About Advertisers Press Help Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Service Jobs © 2016 Scout.com All rights reserved Javascript must be enabled to view this page.

The OpenStack flinger has bought TCP Cloud, a 30-person specialist in running managed services on OpenStack, OpenContrail and Kubernetes. The purchase buys TCP Cloud’s open-source MK.20 technology. Financial terms for the Czech Republic-based firm were not disclosed. MK.20 uses a design pattern employed by AWS, Google Compute Cloud and Microsoft Azure to maintain their clouds. It tackles the problem of deploying and managing upgrades when using OpenStack as a micro service via Google’s Kubernetes. Mirantis in August announced a partnership with Google and Intel to run OpenStack as containers, orchestrated using the Kubernetes orchestration tool. It was an inversion of a dominant idea of having containers work well on OpenStack. TCP Cloud’s software lets you manage integration points, the lifecycle of services, and managing infrastructure as code. It deals with version control, with all code managed centrally, via GitHub, acting as a single source of truth. Alex Freedland, Mirantis chief executive, reckoned the big advantage of MK.20 is it saves OpenStack users the job of building such tooling themselves. “The guys in TCP Cloud were thinking of industrial scale from day one,” he told The Reg. “Today nothing like this has been productized.” Through its acquisition, MK.20 will be integrated with Mirantis’ Fuel software to deploy and manage OpenStack clouds and resources. Founded in 2011, Mirantis is emerging as a strong independent name in OpenStack. The firm has not just survived a period of consolidation, but has attracted venture support – $200m in four rounds. Freedland claimed Mirantis now employs 900 people and has a business run rate of nearly $100m. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections Post a comment Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

This marked the coming together of three top guns to ready the iNEXT as the global foundation for BMW’s autonomous driving strategy. “The agreement is one milestone in a long journey,” says Kavitha Mohammad, Director, Industry Solutions Group, Public Sector, Intel, Asia-Pacific & Japan. Intel, BMW and Mobile Eye are creating a platform where data can help make decisions on behalf of the owner. This requires a lot of computing power and intelligence which needs to be standardised. As Mohammad says, carmakers are looking at data generated to get customer insights as the next big currency. “Everyone wants a piece of this action right from OEMs to dealerships. To make sense of that data, you need a platform that can control everything from the door locks to the data centre,” she adds. How can a vehicle immerse itself in that environment and provide data that is useful to the owner? In the Indian context, car insurance is perhaps an example where once creation of personalised (insurance) packages “would be very powerful and encourage people to be more responsible on the road”. Likewise, continues Mohammad, a connected car moving from Kerala to Tamil Nadu can have a sensor fitted which has the capability to talk through GPS back to the data centre. This will come in handy for issues on interstate tax. In short, there is a lot of value to be derived from this platform which has the data and gives the right insight to OEMs, insurance companies, dealers and customers. All this will drive a lot of value added services and efficiencies in the system. According to Mohammad, the Intel, BMW and Mobileye tie-up is important because it might act as pioneer and set the right standards which industry is looking for. It will help technology become efficient and drive innovation. Moving on, Mohammad says there are different phases in connected cars beginning with electromechanical safety like airbags and brake systems. The next step is in-vehicle infotainment “which is something like a software-defined cockpit in a car” and mostly to do with entertainment and information. In the West, the gradient has shifted to information like lane departures, parking assist and so on. “We are probably just about to catch that curve in India with carmakers announcing huge investments,” says Mohammad. At Intel, the India focus will in all likelihood be on IVR (interactive voice response) while slowly moving to the next phase of adaptive cruise control, emergency braking and lane keeping like in the US. To that extent, this is akin to scratching the surface before moving to the next big thing in autonomous driving. Of course, this will depend on a host of variables which are specific to India like its infrastructure and traffic conditions. Mohammad concedes that autonomous driving is still some years away in India. “You need to control cattle on the road and violators sometimes come head on in a one way road. How will things work unless you have the infrastructure to think driverless and keep these variables in check?” she says. Yet, the silver lining in the cloud is that things are changing with more people taking pride in technology. “Most of the next population wave is working in our benefit and are between 20 and 40 years old. For them, it is about the environment, social service and giving something back to the community which means this attitude would extend to autonomous driving as well,” believes Mohammad. Leapfrogging of technology also happens to be the fastest in India because its demographic profile supports early adoption. “We take pride in being tech savvy and people care about the environment. I am hopeful attitudes will keep pace with changes in technology,” she says.

The jointly developed platform will continuously monitor and analyze key symptoms that impact the daily lives of patients with Huntington’s in an effort to better understand the progression of the disease and the impact of treatment on patients, Teva said in a statement. Huntington’s, a fatal and neurodegenerative disease, is a devastating illness that urgently requires new treatment options, the statement said, including ways to continuously and remotely assess and quantify symptoms that can give useful and actionable feedback to doctors, patients and caregivers. The disease is characterized by uncoordinated and uncontrollable movements, cognitive deterioration and behavioral and/or psychological problems. Progression of the disease is characterized by a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability and generally results in death within 15‐25 years of clinical diagnosis. Because it is genetic, Huntington’s can be passed from parent to child through a gene mutation, and children of a parent with Huntington’s have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene. According to the World Health Organization, Huntington’s affects about five to seven people per 100,000 in Western countries. The new technology platform developed by Teva and Intel will be used for the first time in a sub-study within an ongoing Phase 2 study of the disease. Patients will be asked to use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure their general functioning and movement. The data will be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform specifically developed by Intel to analyze the data from wearable devices. Proprietary algorithms will then translate the data, in near real-time, into objective scores to measure the severity of the motoric symptoms. This collaboration will make use of Intel’s capabilities in analytics and algorithm development for movement detection, together with Teva’s knowledge and experience in Huntington’s treatment and research, the statement said. The study will start toward the end of the year and will take place in centers in the US and Canada. “The aim of this important project is to provide continuous objective data on the impact of Huntington disease on the patient, and, by extension, a clear understanding of the impact of treatment on patients’ quality of life,” said Michael Hayden, president of Teva Global R&D and its chief scientific officer. “Current measurement of symptoms is largely based on observation when the patient sees the doctor. This technology now provides us with an opportunity to have continuous monitoring. This unique technology could complement future trials in HD.” This cloud-based solution for analyzing wearable device data is being developed using the open-source Intel Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP), a software platform to accelerate the creation of advanced analytics and machine learning solutions. Initial development was done in collaboration with The Michael J. Fox Foundation for use in Parkinson’s disease research. “Patients generate data based on their day-to-day experiences that can help in improving disease management — even something as simple as wearing a smart watch can add useful insight,” said Jason Waxman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Datacenter Solutions Group at Intel. “The complexity of analyzing these data streams requires a platform for machine learning, to help drive the pharmaceutical industry towards faster, better clinical trials, potentially leading to new treatments for patients.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Teva Pharmaceuticals,  Intel Corp.,  Huntington disease (HD),  wearable devices,  medical devices More in Israel Inside Blinking and inking Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Drone-based system capable of remotely finding bombs unveiled in Tel Aviv By Times of Israel staff   Flex sees Israel startups key to new tech strategy By Shoshanna Solomon   Israel cybersecurity tech helps NatWest catch online crooks By Shoshanna Solomon   Israel, Germany join forces in nanotechnology boost By Shoshanna Solomon   Israeli startup 2breathe wins CES Innovation Award By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs November 17, 2016, 6:12 pm Trump: Someday you people will explain to me what you’re doing During the presidential primary campaign earlier this year, the JTA quoted President-elect Donald Trump as making the......

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) said on Thursday it was collaborating with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to develop a wearable technology platform to track the progression of disease in patients with Huntington's, a fatal degenerative disorder. The inherited condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability. There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington's, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis. Teva (TEVA.N), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington's study, the Israeli company said on Thursday. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement. The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare. The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products. Earlier this month, Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care. In August, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. Sanofi (SASY.PA) also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen (BIIB.O) is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis. Teva, last year, announced it would partner with IBM's (IBM.N) Watson Health.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today A few weeks before the much-awaited release of "Mafia III," its publisher studio, 2k Games, has revealed the PC system requirements of the latest "Mafia" installment. As reported by the Game Spot, 2K released the system requirements in an artistic and goofy fashion. The image resembles an old school magazine poster, where the system requirements are listed on it. As "Mafia III" is expected to be an action-packed video game, it is pretty obvious that the game would have huge requirements. Particularly, the recommended graphics card for those using Nvidia product is the GTX 1060. For AMD graphics cards, 2K recommends a Radeon R9 290X. The minimum software and hardware requirements of the game are Windows 7 64-bit OS, Intel I5-2500K for Intel CPUs, AMD FX-8120 for AMD CPUs, 6 GB RAM, Radeon HD7870 for AMD GPUs, GeForce GTX 660 for Nvidia GPUs, 2 GB video card memory, and 50 GB free space on internal hard drive. Meanwhile, 2K Games recommends a higher quality of graphics and processing chipsets to maximize the "Mafia III" experience. For Intel CPUs, the recommended processor is I7-3770, AMD FX 8359 4.0 Ghz with 8 GB RAM for AMD chipsets, Radeon R9 290X for AMD GPUs, GeForce GTX 780 or GeForce GTX 1060 for Nvidia graphics cards, and video memory of 4 GB. The latest "Mafia" installment will be introducing new contents that are new to the franchise, especially that in this sequel, the players are given more freedom to choose their character's line of work. There are different ways for the players to explore the underground world of criminals, and they can freely decide on which path to take. "'Mafia III' introduces a truly open world, rich with its own criminal ecosystems to the franchise, while still upholding the strong narrative storytelling and immersive setting that the previous 'Mafia' games are known for," said by Hanger 13 head and creative director, Haden Blackman via Games Beat.

The original company, Bigfoot Networks, launched on FPGAs over a decade ago, with super large heatsinks (that are now collectors’ items), and were eventually purchased by Qualcomm. The technology was updated into custom ASICs, but a lack of investment meant the technology meant that the brand stagnated a little. After discussing with QC, a number of the original Bigfoot team have spun the brand back out into a new company, Rivet Networks, while retaining a strong partnership with Qualcomm. We've kept tabs on the company, and their mantra is one of promotion and evolution: today is the launch of their new E2500 network controller, with a new UI.  Describing why users should buy Killer over other solutions (and solutions that users have experience or feel comfortable with) has been difficult because the technology behind Killer requires a lot of prior networking knowledge. Public demos showing the feature sets have been obscure at best, and overly technical at worst. Nonetheless, the E2400 previous generation product was widely used in MSI, GIGABYTE and ASRock motherboards, as well as a range of gaming focused laptops as both an extension of marketing towards gaming products as well as the promise of increased performance. The Killer E2500 The new Killer E2500 network controller is likely to make its way onto new motherboards and systems as they are released over the next few months. The E2500 is a newer ground-up design, which Rivet says offers better packet processing metrics than the E2400 and other competition based on a redesigned foundation for network application detection. Aside from automatic implementations purely in hardware, the software for Killer solutions is also important, and this is where a significant change occurs with the E2500. The E2500 uses ‘Advanced Stream Detect 2.0’, the marketing name, for network connection detection and the packet analysis implementation. Rivet has designed it to not only detect programs and apply a priority spectrum, but it also detects up to 500 whitelisted websites in a browser agnostic fashion. This allows users to prioritize, for example, a Youtube video in one browser window at a higher priority than another browser window all while downloading, as well as keeping any game at priority one (and windows updates at priority six). There are parallels with Intel’s processor line in this way of thinking. The latest Broadwell-E chipsets were marketed with a large spoonful of ‘mega-tasking’, for the user who wants to do it all and do it at once. This is the value add that the new Killer line is also going for – gamers who want to stream, or multifaceted users that do several tasks at once. So in order to play a game or a video, while also performing on-the-fly encode and upload, the downloads do not have to be switched off, for example. The idea of improved Quality of Service by prioritizing content isn’t new - we’ve had cFos as a software tool for years (even bundled with a number of motherboards), however Rivet has stated that their hardware solution aims to provide better performance (packet processing latency, dispatch latency and prioritization) for less CPU time than the competition as well as a simpler interface this time around. On the interface, the old version (as I reviewed many times) was a malady in terms of user experience. Rivet has been taking feedback (and reaching out personally to us at AnandTech among others) to figure out the best way to move forward. This is it. The hardware solution deals with six levels of priority, with priority one being ‘real time’ and guaranteeing a front-seat in processing and being placed in the next packet. Detected games (from an internal list) automatically get priority 1 or 2, with messaging programs at 3. Website traffic goes in at either 3/4/5, depending on how the website interacts – video and audio is given a 3, most traffic is a 4, excess traffic is a 5. That leaves priority 6 for updates and large time-insensitive downloads. Programs or websites that need to be adjusted frequently can be pinned to this list, especially specific websites that can be chosen (for example, Facebook/Youtube/Twitch). The major speedometer on this front screen shows real-time bandwidth use (highest value of download or upload), with the maximum value determined via a speed test in the Settings menu. The meat of the software is application management, which is the next tab down. Here we have all the applications listed, with buttons for direct blocking of access (if you see something consuming bandwidth and not sure what it is), as well as per-application bandwidth limiting via sliders for upload and download separately. Both this screen and the last screen work with DoubleShot Pro, Rivet’s name for when two Killer interfaces are being used simultaneously. They use the wired+wifi as an example (so E2500 + 802.11ac Killer 1535), whereby the user can have priority 1-3 going over the wired connection for the best latency, and 4-6 over the wifi as something less critical. The color on the left indicates which connection (currently green for primary, blue for secondary), and the download and upload bars adjust in color as well for parity. With two connections, the main overview interface will show two speedometers as a result. The software is continually a work in progress (Rivet Networks seems very happy to take on board any user comments) and is currently geared for release with E2500 equipped systems. When we spoke with Rivet, they stated that the new interface will work with the 1535 Wi-Fi module for the most part, but the E2400 and below will some features disabled due to the updated configuration on the new silicon. Ultimately the Killer solution is marketed to offer better packet processing and network stream detection for hardware-based prioritization over any competitor solution, and any OEM that goes for Killer will be able to use the software on their platforms. No doubt we will see Killer's SDK allowing for customized interfaces as well in due course. Identifying how the Killer solution affects the end-user is going to be tricky, as the multi-tasking benefits of stream prioritization are hard to accurately measure, or that packet processing is a badly understood and usually synthetic metric. Something such as video conferencing while downloading is perhaps an interesting future metric to monitor: similar to how testing SSDs has evolved, testing network solutions to accurately represent real-world situations has to evolve as well, and we’re aiming to adapt along those lines. It will be interesting to see how the new (and old) solutions from Rivet, Intel, Qualcomm and Realtek perform.

POST A COMMENT 49 Comments View All Comments The_Assimilator - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link If you want your machine's stability killed, buy this product. If you want a NIC that actually works, buy Intel. Reply nathanddrews - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link I'm a huge fan of Intel NICs, but you're going to have to explain your reasoning to us sheeple. Reply Shadow7037932 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Drivers can be unstable and sometimes causes "No Internet Access" issues despite being connected. Gotta disable then re enable to get it to work again. Reply Klimax - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Last I saw such thing was with older Atheros drivers as used on ASUS mainboards for Core 2. (P5KPL-E) Made transfers of large files impossible. Reply Stan11003 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Ditto, I had nothing but problems on my MSI build until I disabled the bundled killer nic and went Intel. Reply wujj123456 - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Exactly. I had E2201 on my Z87 G1 Sniper 5. With their driver is installed, it's giving me BSOD twice a day. After I uninstalled the driver and making it an "unrecognized device" in device manager, my system has never BSOD'ed once. I gave it another try when I upgraded to Windows 8 and it's same crap even after Windows 8 was released for at least a year. If my MB only had that single LAN port I would be doomed, but thankfully there is also an Intel I-217V. I am never going to buy a MB with only Killer Ethernet. I actually doubt if I would ever want to try again. What they are doing seems to be something should be done at router level. It won't solve any problem in a shared network, which is most network environment anyway. Reply Ian Cutress - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link E2201 is two/three generations old at this point, back when it was still a Qualcomm brand. Since then it's been redesigned and a new software team with user input. For sure I'm going to try it out my side as well when it gets here, but 'under new management' is a big banner they're putting on this generation. Reply wujj123456 - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link I certainly hope so, but definitely won't run the risk of buying a MB with only killer ports. I am not sure how much "brand" plays a role here. I remember QC acquired the brand along with its team back then. If it's really a mostly new team with new management, I can't help but wonder what happened before/after acquisition and what they were doing for all the years... Also Intel cards work out of box for Linux, and there were noLinux driver (open-source or proprietary) at all to make it work under Linux. (It's probably still the case?) Not really holding breath for Linux side of things though. Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link It's pretty clear from comments here that opinions about Killer NICs are resoundingly negative. I've seen that evidence elsewhere as Killer NICs are regarded poorly in product reviews. Of the few benchmarks I've looked at, benefits (if they really existed at all in prior products) are close to or within a reasonable margin of error when compared to other competing network adapters. That stands to reason, of course, because the network adapter has no control over data packets once they're placed on the wire. After that point, latency, transmission priority, and so forth are controlled by other equipment that is outside of the end user's reach. In my opinion, the negative branding perception is caused by two factors. The first is the problem of the NIC's lack of reach into the network as explained above. The second is a perception of poor quality as articulated by people retelling problems they've had with drivers and software. Having changed hands multiple times (Bigfoot, Qualcomm, and now Rivet) doesn't exactly help that brand image because it makes the product look like an unwanted orphan with little market appeal -- something that's clearly and obviously true based on the response this article's gotten. Since Rivet Networks consists of leftovers from Bigfoot Networks, a company that already failed to build a successful product once before, those same people will need to have learned a lot from their prior mistakes if they intend to survive. People, right or wrong, have long memories over being burned by a particular brand in the past. Even with expert execution, I don't see how a premium network adapter brand will ultimately find success under the conditions Rivet is working with. Ultimately, Rivet is still _just_ a spinoff company of Qualcomm which makes one think the fruit of the new company hasn't fallen very far from the mother tree. Buying anything with a Killer NIC in it is a risky venture for the buyer since the new company is unproven which might leave someone stuck with an unsupported, non-functional adapter that's been abandoned by a now dead business entity. Having said all that, it's clear that you have reasons for coming to Rivet Networks' defence even if we're not privy to your motives (nor should it matter). I think the majority of us, in spite of our present opinions, are willing to entertain a product review. If the E2500 can demonstrate some measurable benefit, perhaps it has a chance. As most of us are skeptical of vendor claims, bitter and angry over the direction the industry has gone in the past few years, and just want a product that works, we'll have to see the usefulness of a Killer NIC played out in numbers before any of us are going to even consider one. Well, in my case, I'd have to see numbers AND Linux support or its a non-starter regardless. Reply Ian Cutress - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link I agree with you. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt, given the ups and downs over the past few years, and I'm waiting to put it through a set of relevant tests with the appropriate competition. I've met the engineers, and the VPs, since the spinout - and they understand a lot of user concerns. They're also clearly smart and passionate guys, so I'm not willing to write them off just yet until I get the product in my hands and it goes through the ringer.

CDW Rolls Out New Ads Featuring a Barista, a Class Clown and a Fanny-Pack Wearer Spots Are Latest Additions to 'IT Orchestration by CDW' Campaign By Kate Maddox. Published on September 15, 2016. Reprints Reprints Tech company CDW is rolling out new TV spots today in its "IT Orchestration by CDW" brand campaign, featuring a barista, a class clown and a fanny-pack wearer. CDW will introduce five new ads, created by Ogilvy & Mather Chicago, showcasing its partnerships with technology companies including Cisco, Dell, HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Intel. "Dell is a new partner since the March campaign," said Dean Lamb, director of brand and sponsorships at CDW. "This is the first time Dell has been in the campaign, and we are excited to have them with us." In March, CDW launched a new brand campaign to highlight how it partners with big IT companies to provide solutions for customes in retail, healthcare, education and other industries. "We did a lot of research going in and coming out of the March campaign," Mr. Lamb said. "What we're looking to do with this campaign is modify the purchase funnel to incorporate targeted reach as well as broad-reach activities." For example, CDW will use addressable TV buys and account-based marketing, in addition to the TV ads. It is also running radio and out-of-home in select markets, including Chicago, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit and Las Vegas. TV ads are running on cable networks including AMC, CNBC, ESPN and HGTV. One ad, called "CDW Orchestrates Working from Anywhere," shows a coffee shop where CDW is using Dell PowerEdge servers with Intel Xeon processors to let people work from anywhere. Instead of ordering coffee, customers have set up shop with their laptops and mobile devices. One woman approaches the barista and says, "Hey, could I get a couple of copies?" In another ad, called "CDW Orchestrates the Modern Classroom," the class clown is not happy about CDW's use of technology to improve education. "The cloud app ecosystem got everyone excited about learning again, instead of my hilarious pranks and shenanigans," says the class clown. "And the new wireless infrastructure lets Miss Smartypants access her data from anywhere." "We wanted to talk about our services capabilities and how we are helping the education market and helping teachers modernize the learning experience," said Mr. Lamb. Other ads showcase CDW's partnerships with tech providers including Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to modernize printing, retail and supply chain operations. The campaign budget was not disclosed.

Mesa 12.0.3 Is An Emergency Release For Intel Users Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 15 September 2016 at 06:52 AM EDT. 9 Comments Emil Velikov announced the "emergency release" this morning of Mesa 12.0.3 as the latest stable installment for the Mesa 12.0 series. Mesa 12.0.3 reverts an earlier commit (i965/miptree: Stop multiplying cube depth by 6 in HiZ) that was causing a number of regressions for all Intel devices powered by the i965 Mesa driver. Aside from that, was just updating a download URL and the preparations for tagging this immediate release. Intel users wanting to upgrade to Mesa 12.0.3 can find the details via this mailing list post. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Since then there's been a decent refresh to keep the laptop up to date, and now Dell is preparing to release the latest version of the XPS 13 – and it looks like it's going to be a good'un. First up, the laptop will be getting Intel's latest 7th generation Kaby Lake processors, which should ensure the device can compete with other laptops that have appeared in recent months. You'll have a choice between Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 configurations, with the option to add 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage. Related: Best laptop There's also Intel's HD Graphics 650 handling the visuals and the Killer 1535 AC hardware should bring improved Wi-Fi to the range. What's more, the company has introduced a new Rose Gold colour option, which is fast becoming a standard offering on devices such as this. The laptop will also come with the same display options as previous iterations, with a choice between a Quad HD+ touchscreen or Full HD display. Dell claims the Full HD offering will allow the laptop to hit 22 hours of battery life, while the QHD+ version is apparently capable of lasting for 13 hours. That's thanks to a new larger 60WHr battery which should ensure improved performance, even if it's not quite up to Dell's claims. The refreshed XPS 13 is available in the UK today at £1,329.

The Envy x360 is HP’s newest revision to its Envy line of notebooks. It fuses solid metal construction with a touchscreen display that can be rotated through 360 degrees. It’s surprisingly cheap for an Envy-branded device, but that's because HP has made a few compromises when it comes to hardware. As a result, it isn't the most powerful convertible on the market and its size can be unwieldy. But even with these flaws, it's a decent machine overall. Related: Best laptops HP Envy x360 – Buying Information My review sample featured an AMD A9 9410 processor, a 256GB M.2 SSD and a 1080p IPS display: model number, 15-ar002na. There are other configurations available, inlcuding models with Intel Core i5 and i7 U-suffix processors, a higher capacity hard disk and Ultra HD screens. HP Envy x360 – Design and Build The Envy x360's design looks slightly above its price point, with a decent-looking brushed aluminium coating and angular features. The metal shell is free from flex, and the rubber pads on the base prevent the Envy from moving around when placed on a solid surface. It’s 1.9cm thick, which makes it easy to throw into a laptop bag; but it isn't the lightest laptop, weighing just over 2kg. In terms of connections, the Envy x360 houses one USB Type-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI connector, an SD card reader and a 3.5mm headset jack. The power button and volume rocker are located on the left of the device, making them easy to use in tablet mode. The touchscreen display is held in place with a pair of hinges that rotate nearly 360 degrees, which enable the x360 to be used as a tablet or hybrid laptop. The issue here is that the hinge can’t support the weight of that large 15.6-inch screen particularly well; the display can flop down into a lowered position when moved around. Related: Best Laptops For Students In addition, the screen tends to wobble when pressing on the touchscreen, which is a problem for a device that places the screen front and centre. The usefulness of the display’s bend-ability is most stark when you just want to kick back with some Netflix in bed and try to rest the laptop, in tablet mode, on your knees. Tent mode is great for compact spaces such as trains and planes. HP Envy x360 – Keyboard and touchpad The keyboard, on paper, should be decent, presenting large, chiclet-style keys that are easy to find. They’re backlit, too, which makes finding the key you're after much easier in low light. The travel distance on each key is satisfactory, but unfortunately, there isn't much tactile "feel" to them. I found myself missing a few more key presses than I'd like, which is slightly disappointing for a laptop that could otherwise be an effective work machine. The touchpad is also a mixed affair. The trackpad is large, with plenty of space to use the multitouch gestures. Tracking is pretty good for a laptop at this price, and while it isn't the worst I've tested, it doesn’t come close to laptops that get Microsoft-certified Precision touchpads. The issue comes when you want to start clicking: while left-clicks work without issue, I found that right-clicks were frequently missed, even when using the two-finger method – which is frustrating. HP Envy x360 – Audio The Envy x360 uses Bang & Olufsen-branded speakers, and on the whole they’re pretty decent performers. Mid-tones are delivered with suitable clarity, and the high-end doesn't sound sharp – even at high volume. The speakers do lack a bit of punch in the low-end, however, so for music you’ll be better off with headphones. For watching YouTube or Netflix, however, the Envy does a respectable job of delivering a solid audio experience. HP Envy x360 – Screen While its large form factor can hamper the user experience, the screen doesn't – for the most part. The Envy comes packing a Full HD IPS display on the baseline model, which is great for a laptop at this price. The 1080p resolution will be sharp enough for all but the most demanding users, although a 4K variant is also available. The display delivers decent contrast, but overall colour coverage is akin to a lower-end laptop. Still, contrast is king and I have no complaints there. It’s bright, too, although it won’t do enough to overcome the reflective touch coating outdoors on a sunny day. HP Envy x360 – Performance While the Envy x360 is available in a range of specifications, the baseline model comes equipped with an AMD A9 APU. This dual-core processor simply isn't the fastest out there by a large margin, and the resulting performance leaves the laptop lacking. It managed a score of 2,278 in the Geekbench 4 single-threaded tests and 3,485 in the multi-threaded tests, while in a PCMark run it achieved a score of 2,483. This makes it quite a lot slower than the significantly cheaper HP Pavilion x360 when multi-tasking; the Intel Core i3-6100U on board this significantly cheaper device has Intel Hyper-Threading, which speeds up multi-tasking performance. This makes choosing the AMD A9-powered edition of the Envy x360 a little puzzling. In everyday use you probably won’t notice the difference, but when rendering photos you might feel the pinch. What really helps every day snappiness is the high-speed M.2 SSD running in the device, which achieved a read speed of 810MB/sec in the AS SSD benchmark and 136MB/sec write speeds. The write speeds are much lower than I'd expect, but system feel is defined by read speeds, and these are sky-high. While real-world performance is more than sufficient for day-to-day use, gamers will want to look elsewhere – the Radeon graphics aren't up to the task of playing modern-day titles. In Minecraft, the frame rate displayed plenty of variance, jumping between 20 and 40 frames per second. Turn up the settings, and you really won't have a playable experience. Using the touchscreen is a pleasure, and the responsiveness is slick in both tablet and laptop modes, but there is an issue triggering tablet mode when converting from the standard laptop stance. While it does use Windows 10's Continuum feature to switch modes, it doesn't always recognise the switch, which can be frustrating. The x360's design also incorporates an active fan-based cooling system, which becomes audible at medium to high loads. HP Envy x360 – Battery Life The battery life is very respectable for a laptop of this size and price, and it shouldn't be an issue for all but the heaviest of users. In TrustedReviews’ PowerMark test – which involves 10 minutes of web browsing and 5 minutes of video – the laptop lasted 8hrs 13mins, with brightness set to 50% and key backlighting switched off. In a real-world scenario, the x360 managed around five hours of screen-on time, which is fine, if not spectacular. Should I buy the Envy x360? While it isn't the most powerful, nor the lightest convertible notebook on the market, the Envy x360 does just enough to differentiate itself from the Pavilion x360. This is largely down to the M.2 SSD, which helps pick up the performance shortfall caused by the processor. The cheaper Pavilion is still probably a better buy in terms of raw value for money, but the Envy’s lighter weight and better build are big plus points. Verdict It isn't without flaws, but the cheapest HP Envy x360 is an attractive convertible laptop.

Mirantis today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TCP Cloud. Headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, TCP Cloud employs 30 people and specializes in managed services for OpenStack, OpenContrail and Kubernetes. The acquisition will support Mirantis’ initiative with Google and Intel to enable OpenStack on Kubernetes by equipping Mirantis to continuously deliver OpenStack to customer datacenters. The combined entity will solve the problem of upgrades, one of the primary burdens of on-premises infrastructure. "The model for delivering infrastructure employed by traditional vendors is fundamentally misaligned with modern software development patterns. Disruptors of the digital era push new code to production multiple times a day, while traditional enterprise vendors ship infrastructure as packaged software once every few years and require forklift upgrades,” said Alex Freedland, Mirantis CEO. “Mirantis empowers enterprises to embrace the new, continuously delivered infrastructure model on their terms. TCP Cloud’s technology and expertise helps us accelerate that vision." "The integration of OpenStack and Kubernetes simplifies deployment and expands enterprise cloud capability," said Jonathan Donaldson, vice president of Software Defined Infrastructure at Intel. "Mirantis’ acquisition of TCP Cloud provides a major step forward towards our joint goal of delivering this breakthrough open SDI stack to the market." Mirantis will integrate TCP Cloud’s technology, called MK.20, with Mirantis OpenStack to provide true public cloud experience on customer premises. The design pattern for managing computing infrastructure in MK.20, commonly referred to as managing infrastructure-as-code, is also used today by top public cloud vendors like AWS, Google Compute Cloud and Microsoft Azure to maintain their clouds. Beginning in the next version of Mirantis OpenStack, MK.20 will become part of Mirantis' Fuel software for deploying and managing OpenStack and related open source infrastructure software. “Mirantis and TCP Cloud share a vision of building open source software, and continuously delivering it to digital enterprises,” said Adam Scotnicky, TCP Cloud CEO. “By acquiring TCP Cloud, Mirantis will have increased influence in key open source communities and broader expertise in continuously delivered infrastructure. This powerful combination will help customers like AT&T and Volkswagen build software faster, and emerge as winners in the digital economy.” Mirantis is the top contributor to OpenStack open source project, with the most committers, core contributors, and lines of code contributed to the most recent release, Mitaka. Mirantis is also a top contributor to Ceph, and is quickly emerging as one of the most active contributors to Kubernetes. About Mirantis Mirantis helps top enterprises build and manage private cloud infrastructure using OpenStack and related open source technologies. The company is the top contributor of open source code to OpenStack project and follows a build-operate-transfer model to deliver its OpenStack distribution and cloud management services, empowering customers to take advantage of open source innovation with no vendor lock-in. To date Mirantis has helped over 200 enterprises build and operate some of the largest OpenStack clouds in the world. Its customers include iconic brands like AT&T, Comcast, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, eBay, Wells Fargo Bank and Volkswagen. Learn more at www.mirantis.com.

XDC2016 Will Be One Of The Largest X.Org Conferences In A Long Time Written by Michael Larabel in X.Org on 14 September 2016 at 08:02 PM EDT. 28 Comments Next week's XDC2016 conference in Finland will be one of the largest X.Org Developers' Conferences, if not the largest ever. Some years there has been just 30~50 attendees while usually it's less than 80, which is considered rather large for XDC that's focused upon X.Org / Mesa / DRM / Wayland / related open-source graphics projects. As of writing this evening, 102 individuals are registered to attend, albeit not everyone may actually show up. Of the 102 individuals registered, at least 30 are employees of Intel. (Intel has a large office in Helsinki where a number of open-source developers are working.) Interestingly, nine developers are registered from NVIDIA. This is rather a large amount when usually there are just 1~3 NVIDIA developers in attendance. This year at XDC2016, NVIDIA will be discussing their Wayland EGLStreams proposal and more. Sadly, just one AMD developer is registered: Harry Wentland, who will be discussing the DAL display abstract proposal for the AMDGPU kernel driver. No sign of John Bridgman or Alex Deucher or any of the other AMD Linux folks this year... Other attendees are there representing Canonical, Red Hat, SUSE, Igalia, Google, ARM, and even Broadcom and Imagination Tech. Consulting firm Collabora who invests a lot in the Mesa/Wayland stack will also have four contributors at the event. It should be a very interesting next week in Helsinki with many interesting talks. The current XDC2016 attendee list can be seen here. 28 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Alizera Shafaei, a UBC PhD student who wrote a paper showing how video games can be used to train a computer vision system, was quoted in the Mail article and in a similar story in Vice. Synthetic data like that used in video games can be just as useful for training, if not more so, said Shafaei. “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings.” Next Big Thing 2014 View all Next Big Thing 2014 submissions.

The iPhones will launch in India on the seventh, as will the AirPods, Google is possibly gearing up for a Pixel event and Microsoft also intends to show something off around that time. That ‘something’ was initially expected to be a Surface Pro 5, Book 2 and the much-awaited Surface Phone, but now it seems like those will remain rumours for the time being. Reports on Neowin and iTechPost suggest that we’ll only be seeing a Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book refresh and maybe a glimpse of the Pro 5 and Book 2. The reports also suggest that Intel’s Kaby Lake is to blame for the delay. Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake mobile processors are already out and available to OEMs, but only the low-power Y and U series are out. The more powerful, quad-core HQ series will not make an appearance until next year. We’re also expecting to see Microsoft’s latest attempt at an all-in-one type device in the form of the Surface PC. iTechPost goes so far as to suggest that the tagline for the Surface PC will be “turns your PC into a desk.” I’m not entirely sure what a refresh would involve. The low-powered Kaby-Lakes are out, so there might be some entry-level SKUs with those chips. One can also expect the Surface Book to incorporate the latest Nvidia GPUs as well. The Surface Phone is what has me most excited, but in a more academic sense. What rumours I’ve heard suggest a phone with a 21MP Carl Zeiss lens, triple LED flash and USB Type-C port. Continuum and Windows 10 are a given, which is why my interest is only academic. Windows Phone/Mobile/10 is as good as dead at this time and while I don’t doubt Microsoft’s ability to make great hardware, I’m curious to see what they’ll do with the software.

Friday, November 18, 2016 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2016/03/09/recent-cases-highlight-silicon-valleys-wage-theft-epidemic/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News Recent Cases Highlight Silicon Valley’s Wage Theft ‘Epidemic’ By Jennifer Wadsworth @jennwadsworth / March 9, 2016 3 Constante Yanos, 72, lost thousands of dollars to wage theft at i2A Technologies, a local semiconductor manufacturer. (Photo by Jennifer Wadsworth) Anis Uzzaman penned the book on Silicon Valley success. In Startup Bible, the founding partner of San Jose-based Fenox Venture Capital preaches the gospel of prosperity-by-disruption to aspiring entrepreneurs in Japan. The volume touches on fundraising, patents and how to build a team, which he called a company’s “biggest asset.” In what seemed a gesture of goodwill, he donated proceeds of the how-to guide to help rebuild Japan a few years after the 2011 earthquake that triggered the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. But to several of his former staffers, the donation looked more like a roundabout ploy for applause after stiffing them out of salaries. Last month, Fenox became the first venture capital firm in the Bay Area busted for wage theft. The U.S Department of Labor (DOL) ordered the firm to cough up $331,269 in back wages and damages to 56 unpaid workers. From 2011 to 2014, investigators say, the company used free labor to prepare investment reports and recruit startups—the core functions of a VC firm. Under federal law, interns at a for-profit company must earn at least minimum wage if their work benefits the company. The interns-in-name-only also spent hours translating Uzzaman’s book, which is either ironic or apt, given the region’s labor economics. “In Silicon Valley, exploitation is part of the business model,” says attorney Ruth Silver-Taube, who leads Santa Clara County’s Wage Theft Coalition. Last year, Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe Systems reached a $415 million settlement in a federal class action lawsuit after a judge found that the companies illegally conspired to suppress wages and stifle upward mobility with a moratorium on soliciting each other’s workers. The anti-poaching case shows that it takes sophisticated collusion to cheat well-paid software engineers. Pay theft, however, more often impacts immigrants, the working poor and the ever-expanding digital labor force. The nonprofit Economic Policy Institute found that two-thirds of the nation’s low-wage earners have fallen victim to the crime. Nowhere in California is the problem worse than in Silicon Valley, where white-collar wealth has spiked the demand for service jobs and other blue-collar labor. The South Bay counts more wage theft complaints than any other region in the state and the highest average amount stolen from each worker. Still, it wasn’t until 2013 that the county formed its wage theft coalition to crack down on what it called an epidemic. Three years earlier, a Florida county became the first in the nation to enact a wage theft ordinance. The California Labor Commissioner’s San Jose office, which fields about 300 wage theft claims a month, awarded $8.4 million in back pay to 2,000 workers from 2012 to 2013. Since the agency doesn’t readily track which companies pay up, however, two-thirds of those judgments remain uncollected. San Jose also falls under purview of the DOL Wage and Hour Division, whose 11-county Bay Area district has claimed $32.8 million for 16,980 workers since 2011. Nationally, the agency helps about 300,000 people a year recover $280 million in back pay. That doesn’t include what's recovered by state attorneys general, state labor departments or the $460 million a year reclaimed by private attorneys. Silver-Taube says the tech industry’s penchant for unconventional work arrangements opens the door for abuse. Some employers, she says, purposefully break the rules if a cost-benefit analysis weighs in favor of a violation. “We’ve always had misclassification,” she says. “But employers have found new ways to be greedy. It’s like old wine in new bottles.” Victor Batinovich, longtime owner of Fremont semiconductor manufacturer i2A Technologies, failed to pay 23 employees for six months over a 14-month stretch through last year. All the while, he sold goods made for free. Staffers say Batinovich led them on with predictions that the business would recover. Instead, he filed for bankruptcy and, in what seemed a last-ditch effort to skirt liability, demoted himself. U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup gave him two choices: pay up or go to jail. The last time the court threatened to incarcerate someone over a wage violation was in 1999. On March 1, the day Batinovich was ordered to surrender to the U.S. Marshals office, he brought in a cashier's check for $56,470.42. It was enough to avert arrest, but hardly covers the $200,000 the feds say he still owes. Batinovich declined to comment on the case. “This company stood out because the failure to pay was so egregious and so longstanding,” says DOL attorney Rose Darling, who handled the case. “This sends a very clear message. Payroll isn’t just another line item, it’s someone’s livelihood.” Constante Yanos, a 72-year-old machine operator who worked for Batinovich since the mid-1990s, got bumped down to a $16-an-hour independent contractor a few years ago. He said the lapse in pay, which amounts to about $3,200, prevented him from treating serious health issues. Meanwhile, his age and the region’s dramatic shift from a manufacturing to service economy has made it difficult for Yanos to find work. He briefly drove for Uber, he says, but his gas-guzzling SUV ate up too much of the profit. Angel Rodriguez, 57, hoped the company would pull through for the sake of his cancer-sick wife and teenaged children. The unpaid wages set off a domino effect that cost him everything except his home in Los Banos. “I tried to keep it for my boys and my wife,” says Rodriguez, who took up farm work and recycling cans and bottles to get by. In 2013, another Fremont company ran afoul of labor law by paying workers from India the equivalent of $1.21 an hour in rupees to install computer systems. The case resulted in $40,000 in back wages for eight employees and a surprisingly modest fine of $3,500. “It was appalling,” says DOL Assistant District Director Michael Eastwood, who works out of agency’s San Jose office. Labor brokers can break the chain of responsibility, says Silver-Taube. As can the so-called “1099 economy,” which enables employers to misclassify de facto staffers as independent contractors. Uber became a high-profile example of the practice last year when the state Labor Commissioner ruled that the company’s control over drivers renders them employees. And, as evidenced by Fenox, work is sometimes presented under the guise of an internship to people eager to get their foot in the door. While technology has to a degree complicated oversight, it also gives workers a way to organize and police prospective employers. Researchers out of the University of Minnesota and University of California at San Diego recently launched a digital tool to combat wage theft in the fragmented digital workforce. Turkopticon allows users to rate employers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a website likened to a digital sweatshop where people sign up for “micro-tasks” such as transcribing audio or tagging pictures for pennies apiece. If someone refuses to pay, workers have virtually no recourse and often don’t even know who assigned the task in the first place. Aaron Sojourner, a union organizer before he became a labor economist at the University of Minnesota, led the research team that evaluated Turkopticon’s effectiveness. He found that Turkers who worked for higher-rated employers made 40 percent more than they did without the app. In that sense, the app plays a similar role to the Freelancers Union and Glassdoor, websites where workers share information about employers. Another new app enables day laborers to fight wage theft with their smartphones. Jornalero, which launched a beta version last month, lets workers anonymously rate employers, log hours, upload photos and send alerts to other users. Silver-Taube says she's eager to see how new technologies play a role in curbing pay theft. Meanwhile, she wants to see more policy changes that protect workers. On the state level, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation last fall that makes it easier for workers to recover lost wages. The law holds individual executives, not just companies, accountable for unpaid wages. That rule already held true under federal law. In 2014, the Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance disqualifying wage theft violators from county contracts. This month, the Santa Clara Unified School District voted to require companies it works with to disclose wage judgments and prove that they made good on those payments. San Jose and Sunnyvale are considering similar measures. “Local governments must close the enforcement gap,” Silver-Taube says. “We are seeing some progress.” Jennifer Wadsworth is a staff writer for San Jose Inside and Metro Newspaper.

Reply frustrated finfan Mar 10, 2016 @ 8:00 pm — “Pay theft, however, more often impacts immigrants, the working poor and the ever-expanding digital labor force.” — Given that entrapreneurealship tends to reveal itself in early age, I wonder how many of these dastardly employers were first introduced to the art of worker exploitation as delivery boys, courtesy of their “independent contractor” relationship with their hometown newspaper? By way of what it ironically characterized as a “character-building” experience, the newspaper industry was infamous for its abuse of paperboys, treating them as independent contractors in all matters financial (with the boys absorbing all subscriber defaults) but as bottom-of-the-barrel employees for everything else. After a century of operating a system so blatantly tilted in its own favor that the job, once synonymous with industrious youngsters on the rise, declined to become the domain of desperate adults headed nowhere. In recent years there have been huge settlements in actions against the industry involving tens of millions of dollars. The courts, presented with overwhelming evidence of pay theft, finally declared it what it had always been. I don’t recall those court cases being reported by the news media with any heart-tugging descriptions of the abused workers (though the abused workers are poor and often immigrants), but that’s par for the course for the nation’s most arrogant and disgraceful industry.

Introduction and design 2. Specifications, performance and features 3. Verdict Great Value Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Fashionably designed using mid-range materials and high-end parts, the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin is an obvious choice to quell MacBook Pro envy. This laptop has the "wow" factor that bargain hunters with taste desire. For Excellent value Snappy keyboard Very versatile HDR display Against Hefty weight Graphics narrowly miss the mark If you were to look at Samsung's laptops even a year ago, you'd see gorgeous devices crafted with premium materials on the outside and a steep price tag to match – with components that, well, often didn't. Since then, for reasons that should be obvious, Samsung's vision for its laptops has shifted slowly to focus more on value than an ultra-luxury experience. (Specifically, crafting a luxury experience at a value price.) The Samsung Notebook 9 is a fine example of this. However, we're not talking about Ultrabooks here, but the often nebulous realm of mid-range multimedia laptops. Meet the 15.6-inch Samsung Notebook 7 Spin, a laptop like the Notebook 9 in its goal to bring a primo-feeling experience and more power to an approachable price point. Starting at just $899 (about £681, AU$1,206), the Notebook 7 Spin comes packing one of the best and latest Intel processors, gobs of memory and storage, and dedicated Nvidia graphics behind a crisp, 1080p HDR (!!!) screen. Oh, and it's a convertible hybrid – just in case you like those, too. Yeah, we'd say Samsung accomplished its mission. Design That's in no small part thanks to how Samsung employed a serious design sense in molding the Notebook 7 Spin shell while making use of less-than-high-end materials. Not much has changed about this iteration from the previous in terms of design ID, though. The same subdued, chrome Samsung logo sits flush left on the laptop's brushed aluminum lid, and the aluminum keyboard deck feels just as refreshingly cool to the touch as it has for at least one or two generations now. However, the bottom half of the silver-colored chassis is comprised of a soft touch plastic that's both cheaper and better prevents slipping. However, back to what's sitting on upper half. Making liberal use of the room that its 15-inch size affords it, unlike some key competitors, Samsung laid out a full set of curved, backlit black keys – including a number pad. The keys offer a hearty punch when pressed and released, and were effortless to adjust to over the course of our review. The spacious, glass trackpad is centered with the space bar, which we wish was centered with the device instead, but otherwise performs just fine with single and- multi-touch gestures. And if you just want to touch the screen you can do that or even convert it into an oversized tablet. This editor is generally a curmudgeon when it comes to convertible hybrids, but we don't mind it here as an add-in feature, since the hinge is so strong and sturdy it's barely noticeable. That said, using this thing as a tablet is just plain silly, even with its neat, curved lip above and below its hinge available to help with grip. Simply put, it's just too heavy and bulky for that kind of use. The tent-like mode is excellent for bedridden movie binges, though. What you have here is a laptop designed to be attractive and effective without being ostentatiously expensive, and the Notebook 7 Spin's design simply exudes that quality. That said, it is rather hefty. Want to save money?

Investors looked over a series of mixed economic reports as they sought clues about the Federal Reserve's intentions and the health of the economy. Technology companies made the largest gains as Apple rose for the fourth consecutive day. It's up 12 percent this week on growing optimism about early sales of its newest iPhones. Energy companies bounced back after two rough days, though the price of oil rose only a small amount. Health care and phone company stocks also climbed. Bond yields wobbled and finished little changed, a sign investors aren't sure what will happen with interest rates. FILE - This July 15, 2013, file photo, shows the New York Stock Exchange. Global markets traded in narrow ranges Thursday, Sept. 15, 2016, ahead of a raft of U.S. economic data that could impact on market expectations over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) It was the fourth big move for the market in the last five days as investors try to anticipate whether the Fed will raise interest rates next week. Based on weaker producer prices and manufacturing and less spending by shoppers, they appeared to conclude rates will stay where they are for now. Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist for Voya Investment Strategies, said investors are sending stocks higher because they think the reports will make the Fed less likely to raise rates now. Some investors fear that that would hurt the economy. "They're not going to raise interest rates in September," she said. "It was kind of a mixed bag, but the bottom line is that the data's not great." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 177.71 points, or 1 percent, to 18,212.48. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 21.49 points, or 1 percent, to 2,147.26. The Nasdaq composite gained 75.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 5,249.69. Apple rose to its highest price in 10 months on reports of strong preorders for the new iPhones it introduced last week. The stock added $3.80, or 3.4 percent, to $115.57. Other technology companies also rose. Microsoft gained 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $57.19 and Intel picked up 94 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $36.56. Strong gains for technology and health care companies have the Nasdaq on pace for its best week since late June. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 33 cents to $43.91 per barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent in the last two days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 74 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $46.59 a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Marathon Petroleum rose $1.87, or 4.5 percent, to $43.74 and Chevron gained $1.08, or 1.1 percent, to $99.50. Investors pored over a series of economic reports. The Labor Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. Lower producer prices reduce inflation, and the Fed has said it wants to see evidence inflation is edging upward before it raises rates. Inflation has remained consistently low in recent years. Reports by the Commerce Department and the Federal Reserve, respectively, showed that retail sales fell last month and factory production decreased as well. Bond prices wobbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.70 percent. Among companies in the news, Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed after the company boosted its dividend and said it plans to return $4 billion to shareholders over the next few years. The stock rose $1.58, or 5.1 percent, to $32.39. Aerie Pharmaceuticals surged $9.48, or 44.9 percent, to $30.61 after the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of Roclatan, an experimental glaucoma drug. AMC Networks fell $1.44, or 2.8 percent, to $50.53 after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil downgraded the company because competition is growing and ratings for its hit "The Walking Dead" may weaken as the show enters its seventh season. Wells Fargo lost 37 cents to $46.15. Regulators said last week that the bank opened more than 2 million accounts that customers may not have authorized and transferred money into those accounts without their approval. The company agreed to pay a $185 million fine and says it will cut back on aggressive sales targets, but the controversy is damaging its reputation. The stock is mired in a five-day losing streak that has pulled its value down 7.5 percent. The price of gold fell $8.10 to $1,318 an ounce and silver lost 3 cents to $19.04 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.16 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline jumped 7 cents, or 5 percent, to $1.43 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $1.42 a gallon. Natural gas added 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar slid to 102.16 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro dipped to $1.1246 from $1.1249. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares traded 0.9 percent higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.5 percent while the CAC 40 of France edged up 0.1 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.3 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.6 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay FILE - In this Oct. 23, 2015 file photo, Specialist Mark Fitzgerald, right, works at the post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange that trades Pandora.

Despite the 13-7 vote, which included support from four Republican members and all nine Democrats, Koh’s confirmation to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is uncertain. Senate Republican leaders have refused to take up President Obama’s nomination of Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court and have held up Senate floor votes on some of his lower-court nominees for a year or more. Koh, a former federal prosecutor and the daughter of Korean immigrants, was appointed to the Santa Clara County Superior Court in 2008 and was nominated to U.S. District Court in San Jose two years later. She was confirmed 90-0 by the Senate and became the nation’s second-ever Korean American federal judge. Obama nominated her to the appeals court in February. As a federal judge, she presided over a lawsuit by thousands of employees that accused Apple, Google, Intel and other technology powerhouses of conspiring to hold down salaries by agreeing not to hire one another’s workers. Koh refused to dismiss the suit in January 2014 and later rejected an initial $324.5 million settlement proposal as too low. The companies have since agreed to settlements totaling $435 million. She also heard a lawsuit by Apple that accused Samsung Electronics Co. of copying Apple’s iPhone and iPad. A jury found patent violations in 2013 and awarded Apple $930 million in damages, an amount that Koh upheld but that an appeals court later reduced to $548 million. The lone argument against her Thursday came from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who criticized Koh’s July 2015 ruling requiring federal agents to get a search warrant from a judge before obtaining data from cell phone companies that would track a phone user’s movements. State and federal courts have been divided on that issue, but Cornyn contended Koh’s decision defied U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The ruling is “an example of the kind of judicial activism that betrays a lack of regard to the plain text of the Constitution” and binding legal precedents “in favor of what the judge views as better policy,” Cornyn said. But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the Supreme Court has yet to resolve the issue, as indicated by the split in lower courts. She noted that the court, in rulings by Chief Justice John Roberts and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, has required police to obtain warrants before searching cell phones they seize from suspects and before attaching GPS tracking devices to suspects’ cars. Feinstein said Koh has “impeccable credentials” and support from Republicans like former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stanford Law Professor Michael McConnell, a former federal appeals court judge.

The awards annually recognize energy storage projects that demonstrate an exceptional level of design & engineering in practical applications. VIEW THE PROJECTS AND VOTE FOR IDEAL POWER The project award finalists that utilized Ideal Power’s patented power conversion technology: • Stone Edge Farm Stone Edge Farm is a 15-acre organic farm and vineyard located in Sonoma, California. The solar PV + storage installation is part of the farm’s innovative microgrid and is designed to provide energy for a number of buildings on the site, including the primary residence, offices and workshops. The system uses Ideal Power’s Grid Resilient 30 kW Multi-port Power Conversion System (30B3) powering Aquion batteries. • Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) Innovation Center  RMI implemented Gexpro’s Power IQ 30 energy storage system (30 kW/45 kWh) and combined it with an 83 kW solar array at their Innovation Center in Basalt, Colorado. The system incorporates Ideal Power’s Grid Resilient 30 kW Multi-port Power Conversion System (30B3) to ensure the building's peak usage does not exceed 50 kW.  • University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Smart Charging Center UCSD installed a PV + energy storage system that is also an EV charging station. Ideal Power’s Battery Converter (IBC-30kW-480) provides both battery charging (AC to DC) and battery discharging (DC to AC) to facilitate EV charging directly from energy storage thereby minimizing demand charges. • Intel Charging Center  EV4 and Powin Energy collaborated on a solar + storage EV charging station at Intel’s corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The station’s roof consists of 15 solar panels with a capacity of 4.1 kW which provide an estimated 7,300 kWh of power per year. Ideal Power’s highly efficient (IBC-30kW-480) bi-directional power conversion system is integrated to convert AC to DC and vice-versa. Voting is open now until September 20 at ESNA’s website. Winners will be announced October 5 during ESNA’s 2016 conference in San Diego, California. Ideal Power’s power conversion systems are based on its patented, industry-leading Power Packet Switching Architecture™ (PPSA) which offers customers a proven, compact, high-efficiency solution for energy storage systems. Ideal Power's systems are software configurable, allowing them to operate in 50Hz or 60Hz environments, maximizing the ease of deployment in different geographical markets and providing the flexibility to optimize performance for many energy applications. The significant reduction in the size and weight of Ideal Power systems results in dramatically lower installation costs.

Investors looked over a series of mixed economic reports as they sought clues about the Federal Reserve's intentions and the health of the economy. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Technology companies made the largest gains as Apple rose for the fourth consecutive day. It is up 12% this week on growing optimism about early sales of its newest iPhones. Energy companies bounced back after two rough days, though the price of oil rose only a small amount. Health care and phone company stocks also climbed. Bond yields wobbled and finished little changed, a sign investors are not sure what will happen with interest rates. It was the fourth big move for the market in the last five days as investors try to anticipate whether the Fed will raise interest rates next week. Based on weaker producer prices and manufacturing and less spending by shoppers, they appeared to conclude rates will stay where they are for now. Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist for Voya Investment Strategies, said investors are sending stocks higher because they think the reports will make the Fed less likely to raise rates now. Some investors fear that that would hurt the economy. "They're not going to raise interest rates in September," she said. "It was kind of a mixed bag, but the bottom line is that the data's not great." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 177.71 points, or 1%, to 18,212.48. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 21.49 points, or 1%, to 2,147.26. The Nasdaq composite gained 75.92 points, or 1.5%, to 5,249.69. Apple rose to its highest price in 10 months on reports of strong pre-orders for the new iPhones it introduced last week. The stock added 3.80 US dollars, or 3.4%, to 115.57 dollars. Other technology companies also rose. Microsoft gained 93 cents, or 1.7%, to 57.19 dollars and Intel picked up 94 cents, or 2.6%, to 36.56 dollars. Strong gains for technology and health care companies have the Nasdaq on pace for its best week since late June. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 33 cents to 43.91 dollars per barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent in the last two days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 74 cents, or 1.6%, to 46.59 dollars a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Marathon Petroleum rose 1.87 dollars, or 4.5%, to 43.74 dollars and Chevron gained 1.08 dollars, or 1.1%, to 99.50 dollars. Investors pored over a series of economic reports. The Labour Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. Lower producer prices reduce inflation, and the Fed has said it wants to see evidence inflation is edging upward before it raises rates. Inflation has remained consistently low in recent years. Reports by the Commerce Department and the Federal Reserve, respectively, showed that retail sales fell last month and factory production decreased as well. Bond prices wobbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.70%. Among companies in the news, Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed after the company boosted its dividend and said it plans to return four billion US dollars to shareholders over the next few years. The stock rose 1.58 dollars, or 5.1%, to 32.39 dollars. Aerie Pharmaceuticals surged 9.48 dollars, or 44.9%, to 30.61 dollars after the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of Roclatan, an experimental glaucoma drug. AMC Networks fell 1.44 dollars, or 2.8%, to 50.53 dollars after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil downgraded the company because competition is growing and ratings for its hit The Walking Dead may weaken as the show enters its seventh season. Wells Fargo lost 37 cents to 46.15 dollars. Regulators said last week that the bank opened more than two million accounts that customers may not have authorized and transferred money into those accounts without their approval. The company agreed to pay a 185 million dollar fine and says it will cut back on aggressive sales targets, but the controversy is damaging its reputation. The stock is mired in a five-day losing streak that has pulled its value down 7.5%. The price of gold fell 8.10 dollars to 1,318 dollars an ounce and silver lost three cents to 19.04 dollars an ounce. Copper remained at 2.16 dollars a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol jumped seven cents, or 5%, to 1.43 dollars a gallon. Heating oil rose three cents, or 2.5%, to 1.42 dollars a gallon. Natural gas added four cents to 2.93 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar slid to 102.16 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro dipped to 1.1246 from 1.1249 dollars. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares traded 0.9% higher. Germany's Dax rose 0.5% while the CAC 40 of France edged up 0.1%. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.3% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.6%.

From discussions on the Realities of Drone Delivery to a forum on Finding Funding: The VC Community Speaks, Drone World Expo taking place Nov. 15-16 at the San Jose Convention Center will offer something for everyone interested in the use of drones for commercial purposes.  The full conference program with details about sessions and the 100+ speakers is now available at www.droneworldexpo.com.   Of the speakers, there are dozens of prominent women who will take the stage to talk about their involvement in this fast- paced and growing industry. "Drone World Expo is proud to feature and celebrate so many talented women leaders at our event and provide a forum for women from all aspects of the business to connect," said Joelle Coretti, Event Director, Drone World Expo.  "The overall success of the drone industry depends upon fostering diversity, developing talent and promoting numerous opportunities for career advancement and many of these women are doing just that within their organizations." Dr. Kerry Palakanis, DNP, NP-C, Crisfield Clinic is a panelist on "The Realities of Drone Delivery" session at Drone World Expo.  While the concept of drone delivery originally seemed like a marketing gimmick, it has become a serious business for many companies.

Energy companies are bouncing back from steep losses as the price of crude oil edges higher. With the Federal Reserve’s next meeting less than a week away, investors are reviewing economic reports for clues about the Fed’s intentions and the health of the economy. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,232 as of 2:50 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index jumped 23 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,148. The index had fallen five days out of the last six. The Nasdaq composite added 75 points, or 1.5 percent, to 5,249. APPLE PICKED: Apple made its fourth strong gain in a row as investors became more optimistic about early sales of its newest iPhone models. The stock added $3.36, or 3 percent, to $115.13, its highest price of 2016. The stock is up almost 12 percent so far this week. Other technology companies also rose. Microsoft gained $1.01, or 1.8 percent, to $57.27 and Intel picked up 98 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $36.60. Strong gains for technology companies like Apple, as well as health care companies, have the Nasdaq on pace for its best week since the beginning of July. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 33 cents to $43.91 per barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent in the last two days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 74 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $46.59 a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Marathon Petroleum rose $1.98, or 4.7 percent, to $43.85 and Chevron gained $1.56, or 1.6 percent, to $99.98. DATA DELUGE: Investors pored over a series of reports about the state of the economy. The Labor Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. That could affect the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates next week. The lower producer prices keep inflation low, and the Fed has said it wants to see evidence inflation is edging upward before it raises rates. Separate reports showed that retail sales fell last month and factory production decreased as well. THE QUOTE: Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist for Voya Investment Strategies, said investors are sending stocks higher because they think the reports will make the Fed less likely to raise interest rates now. Some investors fear that that would hurt the economy. “They’re not going to raise interest rates in September,” she said. “It was kind of a mixed bag, but the bottom line is that the data’s not great.” RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD: Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed after the company boosted its dividend and said it plans to return $4 billion to shareholders over the next few years. The stock rose $1.57, or 5 percent, to $32.38. UP IN THE AIR: Aerie Pharmaceuticals surged $9.13, or 43.2 percent, to $30.26 after the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of Roclatan, an experimental glaucoma drug. HEAVY TRADING: Online brokerage E-Trade rose $1.05, or 3.8 percent, to $28.29 as investors liked what they saw in a presentation about the state of E-Trade’s business. ZOMBIFIED: AMC Networks fell $1.56, or 3 percent, to $50.41 after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil downgraded the company because competition is growing and ratings for its hit “The Walking Dead” may weaken as the show enters its seventh season. UNWELLS: Wells Fargo lost 19 cents to $46.33. Regulators said last week that the bank opened more than 2 million accounts that customers may not have authorized and transferred money into those accounts without their approval. The company agreed to pay a $185 million fine and says it will cut back on aggressive sales targets, but the controversy is damaging its reputation. The stock is mired in a five-day losing streak that has pulled its value down 7 percent. BONDS: Bond prices wobbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained 1.70 percent. METALS: Gold fell $8.10 to $1,318 an ounce and silver lost 3 cents to $19.04 an ounce. Copper remained at $2.16 a pound. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline jumped 7 cents, or 5 percent, to $1.43 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $1.42 a gallon. Natural gas added 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet. CURRENCIES: The dollar slid to 102.12 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro dipped to $1.1242 from $1.1249. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares traded 0.9 percent higher. Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 percent while the CAC 40 of France edged up 0.1 percent. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.3 percent while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.6 percent. To sign up for free CityBusiness Daily Updates, click here.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 39 Illustration: Scott Gelber for The Intercept Tech Money Lurks Behind Government Privacy Conference Sam Biddle Sam Biddle 2016-09-15T18:52:35+00:00 Illustration: Scott Gelber for The Intercept In January, academic-turned-regulator Lorrie Cranor gave a presentation and provided the closing remarks at PrivacyCon, a Federal Trade Commission event intended to “inform policymaking with research,” as she put it. Cranor, the FTC’s chief technologist, neglected to mention that over half of the researchers who presented that day had received financial support from Google — hardly a neutral figure in the debate over privacy. Cranor herself got an “unrestricted gift” of roughly $350,000 from the company, according to her CV. Virtually none of these ties were disclosed, so Google’s entanglements at PrivacyCon were not just extensive, they were also invisible. The internet powerhouse is keenly interested in influencing a lot of government activity, including antitrust regulation, telecommunications policy, copyright enforcement, online security, and trade pacts, and to advance that goal, has thrown around a lot of money in the nation’s capital. Ties to academia let Google attempt to sway power less directly, by giving money to university and graduate researchers whose work remains largely within academic circles — until it gains the audience of federal policymakers, as at PrivacyCon. Some research at the event supported Google’s positions. An MIT economist who took Google money, for example, questioned whether the government needed to intervene to further regulate privacy when corporations are sometimes incentivized to do so themselves. Geoffrey Manne, the executive director of a Portland-based legal think tank that relies on funding from Google (and a former Microsoft employee), presented a paper saying that “we need to give some thought to self-help and reputation and competition as solutions” to privacy concerns “before [regulators start] to intervene.” (Manne did not return a request for comment.) Other research presented at PrivacyCon led to conclusions the company would likely dispute. The problem with Google’s hidden links to the event is not that they should place researchers under automatic suspicion, but rather that the motives of corporate academic benefactors should always be suspect. Without prominent disclosure of corporate money in academia, it becomes hard for the consumers of research to raise important questions about its origins and framing. Google declined to comment on the record for this article. How Tech Money Flows to Privacy Scholars Google’s ties to PrivacyCon are pervasive enough to warrant interrogation. As a case study in how pervasive and well-concealed this type of influence has become, PrivacyCon is hard to beat. Authors of a whopping 13 out of 19 papers presented at the conference and 23 out of 41 speakers have financial ties to Google. Only two papers included disclosure of an ongoing or past financial connection to Google. Other tech companies are also financially linked to speakers at the event. At least two presenters took money from Microsoft,` while three others are affiliated with a university center funded by Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. “Are we getting voices that have never received money from a company like Google?” — Paul Ohm, Georgetown But Google’s corporate adversaries are helping to shine a spotlight on what their fellow travelers describe as Google’s particularly deep ties to academia. Those ties are a major focus of a new report from an entity called the Google Transparency Project, part of a charitable nonprofit known as the Campaign for Accountability. The Campaign for Accountability, in turn, receives major, undisclosed funding from Google nemesis and business software company Oracle, as well as from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was set up by the co-founder and longtime CEO of Google rival Microsoft (the nonprofit says its funding sources have no bearing on its work to expose funding sources). The Intercept, meanwhile, operates with funding from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. In other words, tech money even pervades the research into everything tech money pervades. But even accepting that, the report does highlight the extent to which Silicon Valley is widening its influence at the intersection of academia and government. Take MIT professor Catherine Tucker, who in one PrivacyCon paper argued against proposed government regulations requiring genetic testing services to obtain a type of written permission known as “informed consent” from patients. Tucker added that such a requirement would deter patients from using the testing services and specifically cited one such service, 23andMe, a firm that Google has invested in repeatedly, most recently in October, and whose CEO is the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Tucker did not disclose in the paper that she has received over $150,000 in grants from Google since 2009, plus another $49,000 from the Net Institute, a think tank funded in part by Google. Contacted by email, Tucker answered that she discloses “nearly two pages of grants from, and consulting work for, a variety of companies and other organizations, on my CV.” Google has been appreciative of Tucker’s conference work. In a series of emails between Google and George Mason University law professor James Cooper for a 2012 policy conference, first reported by Salon, a Google representative went so far as to personally recommend the marketing professor as someone to invite: Cooper did not return multiple requests for comment on this story. Reached for comment via email, Cranor replied that she lists “the funder(s) in the acknowledgments of the specific papers that their grant funded,” and that there “have also been press releases about most of the Google funding I received, so everything has been fully disclosed in multiple places.” Cranor added that “all of these grants are made to Carnegie Mellon University for use in my research,” and “I did not receive any of this money personally.” But it is surely worth noting that one of the press releases Cranor references says that “each funded project receives an individual Google sponsor to help develop the research direction and facilitate collaboration between Google and the research team.” Cranor did not reply when asked what role “an individual Google sponsor” has played in her research. Nick Feamster, a Princeton professor, presented at PrivacyCon on internet-connected household objects and did not disclose that he’s received over $1.5 million in research support from Google. Over email, Feamster told The Intercept that any notion of a conflict “doesn’t even make any sense given the nature of the content we presented,” which included descriptions of security shortcomings in the Nest smart thermostat, owned by Google. “If they were really trying to exert the ‘influence’ that the [report] is trying to suggest, do you think they would have influenced us to do work that actually calls them out on bad privacy practices?” Many other PrivacyCon speakers, like Omer Tene, an affiliate scholar at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society, don’t seem ever to have received money from Google; rather, a department or organization they work for is funded in part by Google. On the CIS website, this is made plain: We are fortunate to enjoy the support of individual and organizational donors, including generous support from Google, Inc. Like all donors to CIS, Google has agreed to provide funds as unrestricted gifts, for which there is no contractual agreement and no promised products, results, or deliverables. To avoid any conflict of interest, CIS avoids litigation if it involves Google. CIS does not accept corporate funding for its network neutrality-related work. The CIS website also cites Microsoft as a funding source, along with the National Internet Alliance, a telecom lobbying group. “Neither Google nor any of the other supporters has influenced my work,” Tene told me, referring to his long bibliography on personal data and online privacy. But support at the institutional level may still influence individual behavior. Cooper, the George Mason staffer who reached out to Google for advice on a privacy conference in the screenshot above, works as the director of the program on economics and privacy at the university’s Law and Economics Center, which has received at least $750,000 from Google, as well as additional funds from Amazon, AT&T, and Chinese internet giant Tencent. A 2015 report in Salon detailed close ties between Google and Cooper, including emails indicating that Google was shopping an op-ed written by Cooper to newspapers, and other messages where Cooper asks Google for help crafting the content of a “symposium on dynamic competition and mergers”: Cooper also wrote pro-Google academic papers, including this one for the George Mason Law Review entitled “Privacy and Antitrust: Underpants Gnomes, the First Amendment, and Subjectivity,” where he argues that privacy should not be included in any antitrust analysis. Cooper does not disclose Google’s funding of the [Law and Economics Center] in the article. Other pro-Google articles by Cooper, like this one from Main Justice, do include disclosure. Cooper presented at this year’s PrivacyCon and did not disclose his relationship with Google. Cooper did not return a request for comment. Among the PrivacyCon presenters who have benefited from non-Google generosity: Carnegie Mellon University’s Alessandro Acquisti and Columbia University’s Roxana Geambasu received $60,000 and $215,000 in Microsoft money, respectively, on top of financial ties to Google. Both co-authored and presented papers on the topic of targeted advertising. Acquisti’s papers, which did not disclose his funding sources, concluded that such marketing was not necessarily to the detriment of users. Geambasu (to her credit) produced data that contradicted Google’s claims about how targeting works and disclosed her financial relationship with the company. She also noted to The Intercept that “all my funding sources are listed in my resume,” located on her website. The University of California, Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, which had an affiliated researcher presenting at PrivacyCon, counts on not just Google for its survival, but Microsoft, Comcast, Cisco, Intel, and Samsung. Two PrivacyCon submissions came out of Columbia’s Data Science Institute, which relies on Yahoo and Cisco. The Center for Democracy and Technology — which employs one PrivacyCon presenter and co-organized a privacy conference with Princeton in May — is made possible not just by Google but also an alphabet of startup and legacy tech money, according to IRS disclosures: Adobe, Airbnb, Amazon, AOL, Apple, all the way down to Twitter and Yahoo. Corporate gifts are often able to keep entire academic units functioning. The CMU CyLab, affiliated with four PrivacyCon presenters, is supported by Facebook, Symantec, and LG, among others. Narrower Disclosure Standards in Academia Contacted by The Intercept, academics who took money from tech companies and then spoke at PrivacyCon without disclosure provided responses ranging from flat denials to lengthy rationales. Some of the academics argued that just because their institution or organization keeps the lights on because of Silicon Valley money doesn’t mean they’re beholden to or even aware of these benefactors. But it’s harder to imagine, say, an environmental studies department getting away with floating in Exxon money, or a cancer researcher bankrolled by Phillip Morris. Like radon or noise pollution, invisible biases are something people both overstate and don’t take seriously enough — anyone with whom we disagree must be biased, and we’re loath to admit the possibility of our own. Serge Egelman, the director of usable security and privacy at Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, argued that this is hardly an issue unique to Google: I am a Google grant recipient, as are literally thousands of other researchers in computer science. Every year, like many other companies who have an interest in advancing basic research (e.g., Cisco, IBM, Comcast, Microsoft, Intel, etc.), Google posts grant solicitations. Grants are made as unrestricted gifts, meaning that Google has no control over how the money is used, and certainly cannot impose any restrictions over what is published or presented. These are grants made to institutions, and not individuals; this has no bearing on my personal income, but means that I can (partially) support a graduate student for a year. Corporate philanthropy is currently filling a gap created by dwindling government support for basic research (though only partially). He also added that no matter who’s paying the bills, his research is independent and strongly in the public interest: My own talk was on how Android apps gather sensitive data against users’ wishes, and the ways that the platform could be improved to better support users’ privacy preferences. All of my work in the privacy space is on protecting consumers’ privacy interests and this is the first time anyone has accused me of doing otherwise. The list of people who spoke at PrivacyCon are some of the most active researchers in the privacy space. They come from the top universities in computer science, which is why it’s no surprise that their institutions have received research funding from many different sources, Google included. The question that you should be asking is, was the research that was presented in the public interest? I think the answer is a resounding yes. Acquisti, the PrivacyCon presenter from CMU, is a professor affiliated with the university’s CyLab privacy think tank and shared a 2010 $400,000 Google gift with FTC technologist Cranor and fellow CMU professor Norman Sadeh before submitting and presenting two PrivacyCon papers sans disclosure, plus one presentation that included a disclosure. When the gift was given, the New York Times observed that “it is presumably in Google’s interest to promote the development of privacy-handling tools that forestall federal regulation.” Over email, Acquisti argued that disclosure is only necessary when it applies to the specific funding for a body of work being published or presented. That is, once you’ve given the talk or published a paper, your obligation to mention its financing source ends: “It would be highly misleading and incorrect for an author to list in the acknowledgements of an article a funding source that did NOT in fact fund the research activities conducted for and presented in that article.” In fact, Acquisti said, “It would be nearly fraudulent”: It would be like claiming that funds from a certain source were used to cover a study (e.g. pay for a lab experiment) while they were not; or it would be like claiming that a research proposal was submitted to (and approved by) some grant committee at some agency/institution, whereas in fact that institution never even knew or heard about that research. … This is such a basic tenet in academia. This line of reasoning came up again and again as I spoke to privacy-oriented researchers and academics — that papers actually should not mention funding directed to the researcher for other projects, even when such disclosure could bear on a conflict of interest, and that, for better or for worse, this deeply narrow standard of disclosure is just the way it is. And besides, it’s not as if researchers who enjoy cash from Google are necessarily handing favors back, right? According to Paul Ohm, a professor of law and director at Georgetown University’s Center on Privacy and Technology, that’s missing the point: The danger of corporate money isn’t just clear-cut corruption, but subconscious calculus among academics about their research topics and conclusions and invisible influence that funding might cause. Ohm said he continually worries about “the corrupting influence of corporate money in scholarship” among his peers. “I think privacy law is so poorly defined,” Ohm told The Intercept, “and we have so few clear rules for the road, that people who practice in privacy law rely on academics more than they do in most areas of the law, because of that it really has become a corporate strategy to interact with academics a lot.” It’s exactly this threat that a disclosure is meant to counter — not an admission of any wrongdoing but a warning that it’s possible the work in question was compromised in some way, however slight. A disclosure isn’t a stop sign so much as one suggesting caution. That’s why Ohm thinks it’s wise for PrivacyCon (and the infinite stream of other academic conferences) to err on the side of too much disclosure — he goes as far as to say organizers should consider donor source diversity in a “code of conduct.” “Let’s try to make sure we have at least one voice on every panel that didn’t take money,” Ohm said. “Are we getting voices that have never received money from a company like Google?” And ultimately, why not disclose? Egelman, from UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute, told me he thought extra disclosures wouldn’t be a good way for “researchers [to] use valuable conference time.” Ohm disagrees: “I don’t think it’s difficult at the beginning of your talk to say, ‘I took funding in the broader research project of which this a part.’” In other words: Have you taken money from Google? Are you presenting to a room filled with regulators on a topic about which you cannot speak without the existence of Google at least looming overhead? It would serve your audience — and you — to spend 10 seconds on a disclosure. “Disclosure would have been great,” Ohm said of PrivacyCon. “Recent disclosure would have been great. Disclosure of related funding would have been great.” Apparently, only two other researchers agreed.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date Rumors and Updates: Major Upgrade Behind Launch Delay? Features and Specs Detailed By Christian Ver Marcelo Sep 14, 2016 | 10:51 PM After its non-appearance in Apple's September event, fans have been clamoring for the highly-anticipated MacBook Pro 2016 lineup. The device has been delayed for so long, but it may be worth it as it was most likely caused by a major upgrade. Delay Due to Upgrade It is no secret that the new MacBook Pro 2016 would most likely run Intel's Kaby Lake processing chipsets. The new top of the line processor will be seeing action in most, if not all, laptops and desktop devices this year. However, Intel will not be releasing the Kaby Lake lineup until the fourth quarter of the year. As it will most likely be launched at the near end of October or mid-November, the MacBook Pro 2016 will have to wait until then. Apple CEO Tim Cook had previously reassured and even teased the public of the upcoming laptop lineup this year. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Other Upgrades Tim Cook also said that the Apple development team is doing its absolute best to bring only the highest end features to the MacBook Pro 2016. With this, other significant upgrades are to be expected of the new laptop line. Along with the Kaby Lake processors, AMD's Polaris chipset will provide powerful graphics processing to the MacBook Pro 2016. The two for one punch provided by these two processors, coupled with the optimized macOS Sierra environment, would ensure smooth performance to the new lineup. The form factor will remain largely the same as the previous iteration though. The biggest improvement here would be the smaller overall footprint of the device, with shallower curves and thinner bezels. It will then be lighter and more portable due to the reduced form factor. It will come in two screen variants and color options of space gray, silver, and rose gold. There are also abundant rumors about the new OLED display touch bar replacing the F function keys above the alphanumeric keyboard. It will be customizable to serve the user's purpose. The MacBook Pro 2016 would most likely have a touchscreen display to further contend with top competitors. Touch ID will also make an appearance to further fortify Apple's already tight security measures. It will be integrated to the power button for automatic login. The MacBook Pro 2016 will also pack new SSD technologies with faster reading and writing speeds. The USB-C port from last year's MacBook would also appear here, allowing faster data transfers. The MacBook Pro 2016 may also do away with the headphone jack, similar to the iPhone 7. Wireless headphones would likely be the new standard for Apple devices.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Sep 15, 2016 at 9:26AM Image source: Getty Images The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most fascinating and promising technological movements of our time. Pretty soon, all of our connected devices will be talking to one another, fundamentally changing what our everyday life looks like. Given this trend, you'd think that investing in pure-play companies at the forefront of this revolution would be a lucrative endeavor. But I simply don't think that will be the case. My cases in point for today are InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR), and CalAmp (NASDAQ:CAMP). Since the start of 2015, these three have proven to be losing investments. SWIR data by YCharts But I have two reasons -- which are somewhat related -- to believe the worst may be yet to come. The enemy of every investor: commoditization There's nothing that can drive a business' bottom line -- and its stock -- down quite like having its primary product commoditized. If you're new to investing, think of it like this: You live in a world where apples don't exist. Then, somehow, you're able to start growing them. People love them; they can't get enough of them, and they're willing to pay upwards of $100 per pound for them! Then, someone else suddenly figures out how to grow a slightly different apple. All of a sudden, your customers are only willing to pay $50 per pound. Before long, others have developed their own apples, and they offer them for less. The most you can get for your apples now is $5 per pound. In the blink of an eye, your volume of apple sales has remained the same, but revenue dropped has 95%. That's commoditization. For IoT companies, I fear the same risks. Granted, I'm not a technology expert. But what InvenSense, Sierra Wireless, and CalAmp do is develop technologies that allow machines to talk to one another. Obviously, this is a huge and growing field, and they are three of the first entrants into it. That gave them an advantage...for a while. The problem is that these companies can become victims of their own success. As soon as bigger businesses start to notice that these three are making money on IoT applications, they will want a piece of the pie as well. That's what's happening right now, as General Electric, Intel, Qualcomm, and STMicroelectronics all have or will soon have products on the market that can compete with InvenSense, Sierra Wireless, and/or CalAmp. Bulls will argue that the services offered don't overlap perfectly with what the larger players are coming to market with; or they may argue that the three smaller companies are trying to create ecosystems that would prevent commoditization. These investors have a point, but I think it misses the bigger picture: over the long run, the most lucrative IoT offerings can and will be commoditized, and while attempts at creating an ecosystem are laudable, there's little evidence that they are coming to fruition. Lots of concentration risk Let's go back to my apples comparison. After adjusting to the new reality of only being able to sell apples for $5 per pound, you make your life easier when you find one customer -- a major grocery store -- to buy up over 30% of your product. True, for the time being, it does make your life easier. But it also makes you more vulnerable. All it would take is one person at one company making one decision to find a different producer of apples for you to suffer a 30% dip in revenue over night. In the investing world, this is called "concentration risk," and all three of these companies are exposed to it right now. Previously, CalAmp had two business segments: satellite and DataCom. The satellite business only had one major customer: EchoStar. When EchoStar announced it was essentially cutting ties with CalAmp, it forced the company to shut down its satellite division entirely. And while the DataCom business is growing nicely, the fact remains that it has only one customer that accounts for 15% of accounts receivable, and two suppliers that account for 72% of accounts payable. In other words, 15% of the company's revenue could disappear overnight, and if manufacturing trouble occurs at one of two companies that provide parts for CalAmp, the company could be in a world of hurt. For InvenSense, it's easy to see where the concentration risk comes from. In 2015, Apple accounted for 40% of net revenue, while Samsung provided another 16%.  In the case of Sierra Wireless, there's no identifiable customer that accounts for an outsized portion of sales. But the fact remains that in 2015, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) accounted for 86% of all sales. That's important, because OEMs will almost always pick the cheapest, good-enough technology to put in their products. That makes Sierra very vulnerable to commoditization. Better places for your money I'll be the first to admit that I don't have a crystal ball. It's entirely possible that any one of these companies could produce outstanding returns for investors. All three are doing everything they can to avoid commoditization and diversify their revenue streams. But at their current levels, I have very little confidence that that will happen. Why take the risk when there are so many other companies to invest in that don't face these challenges? Brian Stoffel and The Motley Fool own shares of and recommends Apple.

Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian Dalya Alberge Monday 12 September 2016 02.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 15 September 2016 18.16 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old The head of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) may be more versed in the language of the Bard than computer chips, but a corporate technology video inspired him to see the potential of digital science, fibre optics and sensors for live theatre. Gregory Doran, the RSC’s artistic director, was overwhelmed by an extraordinary flying whale in a three-minute corporate video by Intel Corporation. The footage is spectacular. The whale swims across three juxtaposed cinema screens before emerging through one of them and swimming over hundreds of people in an auditorium. Referring to the technology, rather than the whale, Doran told colleagues: “That’s what I want for The Tempest.” Sounds and sweet airs: The Tempest's seductive musical sorcery Read more They contacted Intel, who were excited by the challenge of extending technology developed for film and video to live theatre. In November, the shipwreck, storms and fantastical creatures of Shakespeare’s late play will be brought to life with what promises to be spectacular special effects. Rehearsals begin on Monday. The production stars Simon Russell Beale as Prospero, the magician, and Mark Quartley as Ariel, the sprite, who will be transformed through real-time performance capture technology into a “live” animated character in the RSC Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. Quartley will be on stage, wearing sensors that capture his movements, projecting them into the air and rendering him as a character that morphs in and out of a human form. Doran told the Guardian: “You will see an avatar of Ariel in real time, flying, walking and moving in the middle space, in the air. It will be projected on to a whole number of things. “I’m amazed just how fast technology advances. There’s even been, since we started this venture [a year ago], a new kind of glass that’s been invented that you can’t see. So there are all sorts of things that you can project on to.” The production combines the RSC’s traditional theatre-making skills and Intel’s digital innovation with the technical imagination of the Imaginarium Studios, in London, in pushing boundaries. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gregory Doran on the technology in his new production of The Tempest Technological experiments will take place this week. The hope is that when Prospero conjures up a magical storm to wreck the ship carrying men who wronged him projected images on multiple surfaces will also make the audience feel as though they are in the ship as it starts filling with water. Actors will appear to be thrown into the air by crashing, swirling waves. Doran said: “There’s all the computer-generated extraordinary stuff you can do on film. But it has never yet been done live on stage. This is storytelling for the 21st century, taking the audience’s imagination into new realms. “We would be Luddites not to open ourselves to those possibilities.” Sarah Ellis, the RSC’s head of digital development, said: “To be able to create digital characters in real time on that scale in a theatrical environment is a huge achievement.” But Doran is keen to emphasise “the primacy of the words”. “The effects mustn’t overwhelm them … It’s got to enhance rather than dictate what we’re doing.” Tawny Schlieski, Intel’s director of research, said that the potential for live theatre is huge: “It’s not about being new for new’s sake. It’s about creating that moment in which you’re immersed in a world and you don’t think about why or how. You just become lost in it. That’s something magical.” They were speaking ahead of an announcement on Monday of the RSC’s spring/summer 2017 season. From Stratford to Shanghai: the Royal Shakespeare Company tours China Read more The programme will pay tribute to the Roman poet Ovid, a major influence on Shakespeare. A new Rome season of Shakespeare’s four great political thrillers will begin with Julius Caesar, with its somewhat topical “politics of spin and betrayal”, followed by Antony and Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus and Coriolanus. World premieres will include a co-production – with Hull Truck theatre and Hull City of Culture 2017 – of The Hypocrite by the award-winning playwright Richard Bean. It is described as a “riotous farce about the infamous moment in Hull’s history which started the English civil war”. Another first is a staging of a story of social injustice from 13th-century Yuan dynasty China. Guan Hanqing’s Snow in Midsummer – in a contemporary translation by the playwright Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig – tells the story of a young girl framed for a crime she did not commit. It is part of a cultural exchange with China. The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre will in turn produce Henry V with a Chinese cast under RSC associate director Owen Horsley. Whether new technology will feature in the 2017 season remains to be seen.

 The net asset value (NAV) of a closed-end fund is the market value of the underlying investments (i.e., stocks and bonds) in the Fund's portfolio, minus liabilities, divided by the total number of Fund shares outstanding. However, the Fund also has a market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount. Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at www.all-starfunds.com. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.

The 'Great Place To Work Institute' today released the second annual list of India's Best Companies to work for in IT & ITeS segment. The list was based on an assessment of employee perceptions gauged using the engagement survey and an audit of company practices. Some of the other companies on the list include, Aegis, Global Analytics India, Happiest Minds Technologies, Hitachi Data Systems India, Kronos Incorporated, NetApp India, Pitney Bowes Software India and Shriram Value Services. Multi National Companies (MNCs) dominated the list. Around 47 per cent of MNCs featured among the Best in IT & ITeS companies compared to just 20 per cent of non-MNCs making to the list. Other key companies to be featured in the list include SAP India, Intel India and PayPal. Employees from MNCs express far more positive perceptions about the workplace, compared to those from non-MNCs. Unique benefits, work-life balance, and fair share of profits were the top three areas where MNCs fared better over Indian companies, the report said. Meanwhile, the startups (less than 5 years of operation) offered a far superior experience in all areas covered in the survey compared to more established organisations, with the top three areas being celebrations at work, tolerance to mistakes, and accessibility of managers. Even though more than 80 per cent of the companies had more than 5 years of operations under their belt, these findings are compelling considering the significant number of jobs created by startups being around 80,000 in 2014-15, according to a NASSCOM study. "In our survey this year, the IT & ITeS sector accounted for nearly one-third of the companies we studied across the Indian industries. The industry’s clear focus on creating a great employee experience is therefore striking," Prasenjit Bhattacharya, CEO, Great Place To Work Institute India said. Dubbed as India's Silicon Valley, Bengaluru was unsurprisingly the most popular location for IT companies assessed. The city also accounts for the headquarters of nearly one-quarter (24 per cent) of the best workplaces this year, including Happiest Minds, Intuit, Cisco, Salesforce and EMC India in the study. Bengaluru, Noida, Chennai, Mumbai, and Gurgaon together account for 64 per cent of the total study population, and more than three-fourths (76 per cent) of the best companies in IT & ITeS. Top 50 companies were identified based on comprehensive country-wide engagement survey of over 36,500 employees from 145 IT & ITeS companies and employee engagement in the study is measured through the Trust Index and Culture Audit.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in Hudson 150th anniversary parade takes place Sunday Thursday Sep 15, 2016 at 8:10 AM Sep 15, 2016 at 8:10 AM Brad Avery @BradAvery_MW HUDSON - After nine months of events, the Hudson sesquicentennial celebration will have its grand parade Sunday to praise 150 years of local history. The Sept. 18 parade will begin at noon on Central Street led by the first section including the Hudson police and fire departments, local politicians, the Cellucci family and the parade's multiple grand marshals. The grand marshals include Rosemary Rimkus, Victor Rimkus, Hugo Guidotti, Sally Crossman Guidotti, Mary Hellen, Alan Johnson and H. Catherine Johnson. The route goes east on Central Street, turns onto Packard Street, and then heads south onto Lincoln Street. At the downtown rotary the parade curves onto Main Street, finally ending at the intersection of Main Street and Tower Street. According to Sesquicentennial Planning Committee member Vincent Picarello, the parade will feature eight sections featuring groups including numerous local businesses, Intel, Hudson Catholic High School alumni, local sports teams, River's Edge Arts Alliance and dozens more. Musical performances include the Middlesex County Fife and Drum and the Quinn Middle School band. In total, more than 900 people will march or ride in the parade. "The last part of it will be the DPW sweeper," he said. Although several more events for the town's 150th anniversary are planned for the remaining months of 2016, the parade represents the main feature of a yearlong celebration of town history. In March, the town held a concert to celebrate the actual date that Hudson became a town in 1866, but the parade was held until September. "It's probably the most comprehensive event in terms of people who are going to participate," Picarello said of the parade. "It's the biggest part of the celebration." On Monday, the Board of Selectmen approved road closures for the event. From 9 a.m.-4 p.m. on Sept. 18, a parking ban will be in effect from 188 Central St. along the entire parade route to the intersection of Main and Tower Street. Vehicles parked on the streets in that time may be ticketed and towed. Official Hudson 150 memorabilia including buttons, medallions and t-shirts will be available at the parade.

It is a question we got a lot after publishing our reviews of the POWER8 and POWER8 servers. Despite the fact that IBM has launched several scale out servers, many people still do not see IBM as a challenger for Intel's midrange Xeon E5 business. Those doubts are understandable if you consider that Linux based systems are only 10% of IBM's Power systems sales. And some of those Linux based systems are high-end scale up servers. Although the available financial info gives us a very murky view, nobody doubts that the Linux based scale out servers are only a tiny part of IBM's revenue. Hence the doubts whether IBM is really serious about the much less profitable midrange server market. At the same time, IBM's strongholds – mainframes, high-end servers and the associated lucrative software and consulting services – are in a slow but steady decline. Many years ago IBM put into motion plans to turn the ship around, by focusing on Cloud services (Softlayer& Bluemix), Watson (Cognitive applications, AI & Analytics) and ... OpenPOWER. If you pay close attention to what the company has been saying there is little doubt: these three initiatives will make or break IBM's future. And cloud services will be based upon scale out servers. The story of Watson, the poster child of the new innovative IBM, is even more telling. Watson, probably the most advanced natural language processing software on the planet, started its career on typical IBM Big Iron: a cluster of 90 POWER 750 servers, containing 2880 Power7 CPUs and 16 TB of RAM. We were even surprised that this AI marvel was on the market for no more than 3 million dollars. The next generation for Watson cloud services will be (is?) based upon OpenPOWER hardware: a scale out dual POWER8 server with NVIDIA's K80 GPU accelerator as the basic building block. An OpenPOWER based Watson service is simply much cheaper and faster, even in IBM's own datacenters. But there is more to it than just IBM's internal affairs. Google: "a simple config change" Google seems to be quite enthusiastic about OpenPOWER. Google always experimented with different architectures, and told the world more than once that it was playing around with ARM and POWER based servers. However, the plans with OpenPOWER hardware are very tangible and require large investments: Google is actively developing a POWER9 server with Rackspace. "Zaius, the OpenPOWER POWER9 server of Google and Rackspace" Google has also publicly stated that "For most Googlers, enabling POWER is a config change". This far transcends the typical "we experimenting with that stuff in the labs". So no wonder that IBM is giving this currently low revenue but very promising project such a high priority. And the pace increases: IBM just announced even more "OpenPOWER based" servers. The scale out server family is expanding quickly...

POST A COMMENT 49 Comments View All Comments Eden-K121D - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Can't wait for Power9 Reply Kevin G - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Same here. I'm really curious about the differences between the four different dies IBM will be offering. Certainly the mix of two core types and IO types should fill the assorted niches found in the server market. Reply rahvin - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link I can wait, it will be a market share failure like every other power because IBM will price it out of reach of any sensible price range. Going by previous attempts it will cost anywhere from 5-10X as much as an equivalent amount of x86 processing power. Something like $10K for the processor and a another $2-5 for the case, memory and motherboard and it will be equivalent to a quad x86 Xeon server that costs $5k for the same hardware. No one that doesn't need some special sauce it provides will buy them, particularly because you'd have to recompile all your software to use it. IBM has screwed up power so many times at this point that you'd have to be a fool to bet on it. Reply Eden-K121D - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Tell that to Google Reply Brutalizer - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Power9 will be 50% - 125% faster than power8, according to IBM. http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/201... On average it will be 75% faster. The specjbb2013 benchmark is broken, SPEC discovered the benchmark can be vendor optimized to provide false results so they fixed it in specjbb2015. IBM have released specjbb2015 numbers for their S812LC server achieving 44.900 for max-jops and 13.000 for crticial-jops. That is almost as good as the Intel Xeon E5-2699v4 result. However, what is interesting is the critical-jops, which measures critical throughput under SLAs. IBM have said they will compete with Intel, with their power9. (Of course, one SPARC M7 cpu achieves 120.600 max-jops and 60.300 critical-jops, that is 2.7x faster max-jops and 4.6x faster critical-jops. This is not using the built in hardware accelerators in SPARC. Next year the SPARC M8 arrives, which is 2x faster than M7. Today, Oracle have released six cpus in six years, each doubling performance (except the low cost S7, which is a crippled M7)) Reply wingar - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link I do like how you come with a comment that's incendiary towards POWER8 and POWER9, doing what you can to make it look worse... and then start touting how magical and wonderful SPARC M7 is. Using the same old Oracle-supplied performance claims without substantiating it. Funny, that. I think it stands out a little bit... But that's not what matters. If you run a simple google search, "site:anandtech.com brutalizer", you'll find comments with not a lot of variety. Usually commenting on anything x86 and POWER8, and in every single one (Except this one, actually! You actually reference an IBM supplied Spec result. However, you should link to it next time.) you tout the wonder of the latest SPARC of the time. Linking to Oracle-supplied benchmarks, on Oracles own site consistently concluding that Oracle outperforms their competitors. And every time you do this the comment seems to be as close to the top of the comment list as possible, for visibility. Have some links. http://www.anandtech.com/comments/10158/the-intel-... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/9193/the-xeon-e7... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/10230/ibm-nvidia... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/9567/the-power-8... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/7757/quad-ivy-br... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/7852/intel-xeon-... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/7285/intel-xeon-... But I found a couple of comments you left that anti-everyone-not-Oracle. Have some links. http://www.anandtech.com/comments/7334/a-look-at-a... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/7371/understandi... http://www.anandtech.com/comments/5831/amd-trinity... I'm sure there's more comments like this where you're actually adding to the conversation but those are the few I found, and they're always unrelated to CPUs and the server market. They seem to perhaps reflect your own interests? But there is one thing to point out here and that the first religiously-pro-Oracle comment you made seemed to be in 2014. What happened then? Did you buy the account? Did someone start paying you? I don't know. And hey, for fun I've actually posted this comment before to you, here's a link: http://www.anandtech.com/comments/10435/assessing-... Reply Brutalizer - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link I am not doing something to make power look worse, I put it in perspective and post other benchmark numbers from Intel and Oracle so people can compare. Yes, I am posting hard facts that can be indendently verified, or are you rejecting the benchmarks I post? Why? Why do you think it is a bad thing I post benchmarks from other vendors than IBM? You dont want people to be able to build their own opinion about power by comparing with other vendors? Why not? Why is it dangerous when someone quote benchmarks from other vendors? Whats the problem with that? If you insist, here is the SPARC M7 specjbb2015 results. https://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/201511_spe... Reply PowerOfFacts - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link troll Reply Brutalizer - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link "...Using the same old Oracle-supplied performance claims without substantiating it..." Now this is the same old FUD from the IBM supporters. As i have explained, mathematicians can always prove their claims with links to benchmarks, white papers, resaerch papers, or point to common comp sci knowledge, etc. So you are in deep sh-t now. I can always post links to the numbers I claim. You claim I can not, and I spread unsubstantiated information - now you are lying about me. Quote me on any number in any post - and I will post links to prove my numbers. If you ever find any post (you will not find any) where I make up numbers out of the blue to discredit IBM or Intel, you are correct that I post unsubstantiated claims. If you can not find any such posts by me, you are spreading FUD about me, and you lie about me. Now go ahead and quote me on any number where I make out things. I am waiting. You are not really smart to claim a mathematician to not be able to prove his figures. I am now able to prove you are a liar and FUDer. I think it is funny how the IBM supporters always FUD and try to discredit people, instead of countering the benchmark numbers. I post benchmark numbers, and instead of try to discuss the numbers you always attack me. That is not the scientific way, to avoid the hard facts and instead try to discredit the opponent. You should instead try to dissect my numbers and links instead of attacking me. But always, always, the IBM crowd does that " oh, he is an Oracle supporter" - so what? You are an IBM supporter! The difference is that I post numbers, and IBM crowd attacks me instead of countering with other numbers. If you want to disprove my claims about Sparc, post numbers that disproves my benchmarks. Do not attack me, that does not win you any discussions. Reply SarahKerrigan - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Sure, it's true that on SPECjbb2015 a T7-1 beats a low-end IBM Turismo machine, an S812LC (with an entry price under $5000 list, compared to over $30000 entry price for the T7-1), by a factor of 2.7x on max-jops. It's also true that M7 came out almost a year and a half after P8 did, and that you can get a dual-CPU P8 server with that same processor, and 256GB RAM, for well under half of the list price of a single-CPU T7-1 with 128GB. Starting to see why IBM has over 70% of the non-x86 server market?

Grand Theft Auto has turned out to have an unexpectedly positive use when it comes to researchers studying how we drive. Open world games like Grand Theft Auto V are being used to train the artificial intelligence in self-driving cars. Which apparently is not as dangerous or crazy an idea as it sounds. You’ve probably heard of prototype cars driving around on motorways and other main roads, in order to get enough data to be able to react in any given situation. But apparently analysing smaller streets and urban areas is more difficult, because of unmarked lanes and more unexpected obstacles, such as cyclists or kids running across the road. Training is also done simply by using videos, but according to website CarAdvice researches at Intel Labs and Darmstadt University have found that training cars on GTA V is a lot easier and quicker. One of the big helps is that you don’t have to analyse what anything is in the game because the software already knows whether it’s a car or traffic light or whatever, essentially removing one of the trickiest stages of the work. Apparently GTA V is particularly useful because its large open world features a wide range of different environments, from busy downtown areas to desert highways and winding mountain passes. There’s also pedestrians and motorcyclists to get in your way (as well as the odd psychopath). Grand Theft Auto V – a car with the brain of Trevor is not a comforting thought According to a researcher at the University of British Columbia, ‘synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training’. It’s not the first time something like this has happened with video games, as the outbreak of an in-game plague in World Of Warcraft was studied by scientists trying to model how real-life epidemics spread. It was also used to look at how terrorist cells form and operate, since people were spreading the plague on purpose in the game.

Dell Launches New XPS 13 Laptop with Kaby Lake CPU and Rose Gold Version GO Upgraded series featuring new hardware and color options Sep 15, 2016 09:33 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Dell has just launched a refresh of its XPS 13 series of Windows 10 laptops, with significant hardware upgrades and a new color option that brings it in line with many other models introduced this year by various manufacturers. First and foremost, the hardware. The new XPS 13 series will be available with two different display configurations, just like the existing generation. You can choose between a 13.3-inch FHD non-touch display and a 4K configuration that’s also featuring touch support, both sporting Dell’s InfinityEdge. According to the press release issued today, Dell was particularly focused on making the laptop more portable, so its weight is now starting at 2.7 lbs (1.2 kg), while the slimmest version measures just 9 mm. In case you’re wondering how come they are so light, Dell says it turned to machined aluminum and carbon fiber to make the laptops durable, and it used Gorilla Glass to protect the screen. Kaby Lake CPUs The new models come with Intel’s new-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, i5 and i7, which are paired with 8GB of RAM memory in the default configuration, but it can be boosted up to 16 GB. In terms of storage, you can go up to 1 TB of SSD. The graphics card is Intel’s HD Graphics 650, which provides mixed performance, so maybe some upgrades here would come in handy. As far as the battery is concerned, here’s something that’ll certainly take you by surprise. Dell says that the FHD version can provide up to 22 hours of battery life, but this is clearly impossible, especially if you use it for watching videos or playing games. The 4K display version offers an autonomy of 13 hours. The typical laptop features are also available, and these include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB 3.0 ports. A Rose Gold version is also available, and this is expected to be the best-selling version of the new lineup, but as you can see for yourselves in the gallery here, it’s more gold than rose. Pricing will begin at $799 in the United States for the entry-level version and $1,499 for the Rose Gold configuration. Sales will begin on October 4. The Rose Gold version is more gold than rose   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Dell#XPS 13#Windows 10#laptop#Kaby Lake subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Dell XPS 13 in Rose Gold (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Responds to Microsoft with Its Own Chrome Battery Tests on Surface Books - Video Alienware’s New Laptop Brings Windows 10 to Life with the Blink of an Eye Acer Launches New Windows 10 PCs at IFA 2016 Microsoft Band 2 vs. Samsung Gear Fit 2: Battle of the Bands Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Nokia's Return to Smartphone Business Confirmed for 2017 HTC 10 Evo to Be Announced on November 22 Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Goes on Sale at Sprint and Verizon Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update 3 photos    The laptop will go on sale next month in the US New Apps Alive Video Converter: Convert videos from and to a multitude of formats with the help of this approachable piece of software that can also extract audio tracks Photo Effects Studio: Enhance your photos by applying a wide range of interesting visual effects, correct issues and export images to multiple formats, with this intuitive editing tool WinSent Innocenti: Simple tool that helps you receive messages, notifications and alerts via Windows Messenger Service, and copy the messages to the clipboard or delete them Reflector: This easy to use application allows you to easily connect your iOS or Android device to the PC and use the AirPlay feature to stream content to your desktop Dbvisit Replicate: Create a duplicate for your Oracle database for backup or migration purpose with the help of this advanced and effective program Gwyddion: An efficient and reliable modular application designed specifically for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data visualization and analysis Gus Tools: Turn ESD images of Windows 10 to ISO format, so that you may upgrade your computer to this operating system using a USB or a DVD Reader comments Load old comments   Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

One of our favourite features of the previous version, the virtually borderless display, makes a return and will be available in full HD or quad HD variations. The new ultraslim laptop runs on Windows 10 and be specced with either an Intel 7th Gen i5 or 7th Gen i7 processor, both come with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of solid state storage. The i5 model comes with the full HD screen while the i7 gets the quad HD. Dell claims battery life is better than ever, claiming 22 hours for i5 model and 13 hours for the i7. When we reviewed the 2015 model we found battery life to be some way off Dell’s claims, so we’re looking forward to finding out if things have improved. Everything is housed in a machined aluminium casing with splashes of carbon fibre and a Gorilla Glass screen, should it should be able to stand up to a few knocks. Dell’s new XPS 13 will be available from October 4th for $799, UK pricing has yet to be announced. That's not all... It’s not just super slim and sexy laptops that Dell has for 2016, as there’s two new Inspiron models as well. There’s the Inspiron 15 5000 touch-screen laptop and Inspiron 17 5000 desktop. The 15 5000 has an infra-red camera letting you sign in using Windows Hello, which scans your eyes to unlock the computer. Colours include such things as “Cosmic Purple” and “Tango Red”, alongside regular black and white. The new Inspiron models will also be available from October 4th from $550.

New Supercharged TrueTCP monitoring helps validate the ability of middleboxes to handle high connection rates and thereby simulate large numbers of users. Both traditional and virtualized networks may have a number of middleboxes, providing services such as firewall, cache or NAT. Testing at what point the middleboxes impact performance requires real TCP traffic in meaningful quantities. Creanord TrueTCP enables 1,000,000s of connections and enables testing all the way up to 100G on Intel DPDK-powered platforms. The purpose of the test is to help determine the number of sustainable sessions in the network. "Powerful TCP testing has become a must," states Creanord CEO Jari Augustin. "You simply need to know how many users your network can sustain. Solutions either utilizing headers-only 'Fake TCP' or supporting only some tens of connections are inadequate when it comes to simulating tens or hundreds of thousands of users on TCP. RFC 6349 is a good starting point, but does not go nearly far enough. So we took it and supercharged it with the help of Intel DPDK and run it on our vProbe - enabling automated pre-testing of SDN-driven connections with NFV middleboxes." The Creanord solution enables running vProbes in central locations, intermediate points or at the vCPE enabling capacity, health and active monitoring, segmented or end-to-end. The new TrueTCP complements existing measurements with RFC 6349, and enables unsurpassed power for TCP testing with millions of simultaneous TCP connections. Supercharged TrueTCP runs on CreaNODE hardware probes and vProbe all the way up to 100G. Please contact your Creanord representative for more information on Supercharged TrueTCP RFC 6349 testing in your network. Creanord empowers carriers and service providers with True SLA Network Experience, through a complete service assurance solution for SDN/NFV, Carrier Ethernet and IP networks.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On CSIRO lays groundwork for Magnus supercomputer replacement By Andrew Sadauskas on Sep 15, 2016 11:41AM Prepares for new $1.5m Pawsey HPC. The CSIRO has taken the first step in replacing a decommissioned high performance computing system within its Pawsey centre as part of a project that will eventually replace its Magnus supercomputer. The new machine will replace the Fornax HPC that was switched off last year after three years of service. Pawsey last year revealed the HPC would not have enough GPU resources to handle computational research requirements by mid-year, and was forced to make an extra 60,000 GPU hours available to researchers on the Zeus system instead. The centre is now looking for a replacement for the decommissioned Fornax.  Along with helping to support radioastronomy from the 36-antenna Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) telescopes, the new HPC will be used for computationally-intensive research in fields like geoscience, nanotechnology and biotechnology. The tender specifies that both the CPU and GPU nodes of the new cluster are to run either RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.2 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12.1. All of the CPU nodes are to have an identical specification based on at least one Intel Xeon Phi processor with a Knights Landing architecture, along with a minimum of 64 GB of ECC DDR memory. Each of the GPU nodes are to feature at least two Nvidia Pascal GPUs, along with at least two host Power or Intel-x86 processors. The system is to be ready for service by April 30 next year at the latest. The CSIRO said it had a fixed budget of $1.5 million for the new system, with the three-year contract to include hardware, software licensing, maintenance, support, installation and commissioning. The new HPC forms part of a program called the Advanced Technology Cluster, which is evaluating technologies to replace Pawsey’s Magnus supercomputer, a Cray XC40 machine that went live as a petascale system in September 2014 and runs 1488 compute nodes. Pawsey is moving to replace Magnus ahead of the end of its support agreement with Cray in September 2018, and because research demand for supercomputer capacity is now significantly outstripping what the at-capacity supercomputer can provide. In a bid to ease the processing and storage crunch, Pawsey implemented a new 1.7 petabyte Dell Lustre storage system earlier this year. Over the longer term the federal government has flagged a new funding model for future upgrades at Pawsey and the National Computational Infrastructure. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

The XPS 13's exterior is also seeing some change; it's now available in "highly anticipated" rose gold — just like every other 2016 gadget. It looks like pretty standard gold in these product shots, but maybe the "rose" part is more visible in person. Like previous revisions of the XPS 13, you can choose between a Quad HD+ touchscreen or Full HD 1080p display (which also offers an optional touchscreen SKU), with the latter capable of hitting 22 hours of battery life according to Dell's claims. Focusing on video and web browsing alone, Dell estimates the new XPS 13 can last for 13 hours straight. That'd be wonderful if true, but Dell tends to fall a bit short of its figures, so we'll need to test the machine directly to see if it actually reaches that target. The move to Kaby Lake brings Dell up to par with some other laptops we've seen debut over the last couple months, notably Lenovo's Yoga 910 (which features a tiny bezel similar to the XPS) and Razer's Blade Stealth. You can choose from Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 configurations, with 4GB / 8GB / 16GB options for RAM and 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB for flash storage. Intel's HD Graphics 650 handles the video end, and the company is also talking up fast Wi-Fi performance thanks to the Killer 1535 AC hardware inside. The refreshed XPS 13 will begin shipping October 4th for prices starting at $1,499.99 for rose gold, or $799 if you're someone who can settle for plain old silver aluminum.

By Asha McLean | September 15, 2016 -- 01:37 GMT (18:37 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is on the hunt for a new Advanced Technology Cluster (ATC) to replace the decommissioned Fornax system at the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre in Perth, a national supercomputing joint venture between the CSIRO, Curtin University, Edith Cowan University, Murdoch University, and the University of Western Australia. With a budget of AU$1.5 million, the CSIRO has specified the new ATC must meet the needs of the radio astronomy research community and high-end researchers in other areas of computational science, such as geosciences, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. Latest Australian news NBN loaned AU$20b by government to complete rollout Video streaming drives new Telstra investment in ADSL backhaul Telcos should form organically, except for NBN: Fifield Beyond cyber espionage lies cyber sabotage and cyber disinformation ​Centrelink payments overhaul heads interstate seeking talent In its request for tender (RFT), the CSIRO dictates that there are two technology components for the ATC, with tenderers required to separately bid for each. The AU$1.5 million maximum spend is inclusive of the hardware, software licensing, maintenance and support requirements, installation, and commissioning costs for both components. Each compute node in Component A is required to include at least one Xeon Phi processor with a Knights Landing architecture and all Xeon Phi processors in Component A will be bootable in main socket configuration, and not accelerators, the RFT specifies. All compute nodes in Component A are to be connected by an Omni-Path interconnect, with a bandwidth of at least 100Gbps per node, and all compute nodes will need to be able to mount the existing Pawsey Lustre scratch and group filesystem. The RFT also requests that all compute nodes be connected by a 100Gbps EDR InfiniBand interconnect and a minimum of 64 GB of ECC DDR memory. Each compute node in Component A is also required to also have a DDR memory configuration that is optimised for performance, but also allows the use of all cluster modes on the Xeon Phi processor(s). Each compute node should also contain sufficient storage for the operating system, or alternatively boot via the ethernet management network using Pawsey's existing xCAT infrastructure. The tenderer is to also fully support a recent version of RedHat Enterprise Linux -- 7.2 or higher -- or a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server -- 12.1 or higher -- on all nodes Each compute node in Component B is to include at least two GPUs with a Pascal architecture, with each expected to include at least two host processors with either a Power or Intel x86 64 bit architecture. The RFT specifies all compute nodes in Component B are to be connected by an EDR InfiniBand interconnect, with a bandwidth of at least 100Gbps per node, with all compute nodes capable of mounting to the existing Pawsey scratch and group filesystem, via the Pawsey FDR Infiniband infrastructure with uplinks to the existing Mellanox SX6356 series switch and at least 80Gbps of bandwidth. All compute nodes in Component B may be connected by a 100 Gbps Omni-Path interconnect. The RFT also states the GPUs in Component B should support NVLINK, and have a minimum of 64GB of ECC DDR memory, with each optimised for performance. Similar to Component A, each compute node in Component B may contain storage for the operating system, or alternatively boot via the ethernet management network using Pawsey's existing xCAT infrastructure. The Pawsey Supercomputing Centre currently looks after four systems: Epic, Fronax, Magnus, and Galaxy. Epic is a decommissioned 100 teraflop cluster-based system with a high-performance interconnect installed at Murdoch University. Fornax, the system to be replaced by the RFT, is a heterogeneous computing environment installed within an existing building on the University of Western Australia campus in Perth. It contained a number of HPC technologies including GPUs, dual interconnect, large memory, and local storage to support data intensive science and inform the procurement of a replacement for the Magnus system. Magnus is a Cray XC40 petascale system, which is currently the most powerful public research supercomputer in the southern hemisphere. Magnus is supported by a smaller commodity cluster, Zeus, for pre/post-processing and visualisation. Galaxy is a Cray system with a similar architecture to Magnus, dedicated to supporting the radio astronomy data processing of the ASKAP and MWA telescopes. Both Magnus and Galaxy are installed in the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre. The installation, configuration, and acceptance of the new system is expected to be completed before April 30, 2017. In March, the CSIRO welcomed the Dell-powered Pearcey supercomputer to its Canberra site to support research in areas such bioinformatics, fluid dynamics, and materials science. A month prior, the Faculty of Science at the University of Western Australia also welcomed its own high-performance computing HPC cluster to its Perth campus to assist with computational chemistry, biology, and physics. The CSIRO has also mentioned in its latest RFT that it is looking for a vendor with supply chain integrity, meaning only those that are actively aware of no evidence of exploitation in its supply chain after conducting a reasonable examination of its supply chain. Earlier this year, 56 electronics companies were probed as part of Baptist World Aid's 2016 Electronics Industry Trends report that evaluated a company on how ethically and sustainably their products are made, with a focus on human rights and protecting workers from exploitation. Hisense, Palsonic, and Polaroid failed the test. Whilst no company received an A, Acer, Apple, BSH Group, Intel, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Motorola Mobility, and Samsung received a B+ grade.

And thanks to everyone here at Capital Factory.  This morning, Josh – where’s Josh? There you are – Josh, thanks for being part of the inspiration of this day, appreciate it.  Representatives from this community’s bright constellation of innovative businesses, universities, and government institutions: thank all of you for joining us here today. It’s great to be back here in Austin to formally announce that our technology start-up, DIUx, Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, is expanding yet again and extending the Department of Defense’s outreach to America’s technology community.  Given this city and this region’s deep commitment to innovation, and also, I should say, this state’s deep connections to those who serve, we couldn’t have picked a better place than Austin, Texas. I created DIUx last year because one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to build, and in some cases to rebuild, bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and America’s wonderfully innovative and open technology community.  That’s important, because we’ve had a long history of partnership – working together to develop and advance technologies like the Internet, GPS, and in the years before that, satellite communications and the jet engine.  What we’ve done together has not only benefited both our security and our society, but it’s fair to say the entire world, and that cooperation between industry, the academy, and government helped make our military what it is today: the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, there’s no one more capable, there’s no one more innovative than we.  That’s a fact, and it’s one that every American ought to be proud of. But it’s also a fact that our military’s excellence isn’t a birthright.  It’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted in the 21st century; we have to earn it again and again.  And today, it’s imperative we do so, because we live in a changing and fiercely competitive world. Technology itself is an example of that change.  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense.  And today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  Nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap.  And meanwhile, technologies once possessed only by the most advanced militaries have gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors.  And at the same time, our own reliance on things like satellites and the Internet can lead to vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit. So to stay ahead of all these challenges, to stay the best, I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided box – to invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds:  in our technology, in our operations, in our organizations, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force. One way we’re doing that is by pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, undersea drones – much, much more.  We’re making some serious investments here.  Just to remind you, the latest budget I’ve proposed will invest $72 billion in research and development next year alone.  And that’s more than double what Intel, Apple, and Google spent on R&D last year, combined.  So it’s a big investment. Another way we’re investing in innovation is through people, to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young Americans for our force of the future.  As part of that, we’re building what I call on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions.  This will let more of America’s brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or for a project.  It will also allow more of DoD’s and the defense industry’s innovative military and civilian technologists – and I should remind you that there are many of them – to engage in new ways with our country’s larger innovation ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about working with defense. Now, innovative technologies and people are necessary, and that’s why we’re building bridges to them.  But technology and people also need innovative practices and organizational structures, so we’re investing in them, too.  The world we live in demands it.  While the Cold War was characterized by the slow and steady accumulation of strength, with the leaders simply having more, bigger, and better weapons, today’s era of technological competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can innovate faster than anyone else.  And it’s no longer just a matter of the level of the technology we buy.  More than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, who we buy them from, how rapidly and creatively we can adapt and use them in different and innovative ways – all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies. And to ensure that we keep adopting more innovative practices in the future, I recently created the Defense Innovation Board to advise me and future defense secretaries on how we can keep growing more competitive.  It’s chaired by Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt, and the board members we’re recruiting represent a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people – people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, and also, as I mentioned earlier, Austin’s very own Bill McRaven.  I’ve charged Bill and the rest of the Defense Innovation Board to keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people and organizations and operations and technology – to support innovators themselves, the people in DoD and the strong companies that already work with us who are willing to try new things, who are willing to fail, fail fast, and to iterate – and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead in this changing and competitive world. At the outset, I’ve given them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in the Department of Defense, not unlike our recent Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which you may have heard of, which invited white-hat hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of America’s major companies already conduct.  So while this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first in the entire federal government.  And it was so successful we’re expanding it to other parts of DoD.  It’s the perfect example of the kind of recommendations I’m looking for from the Defense Innovation Board – things that are out there that we might be able to use. Now, of course, not everything in the private sector is going to make sense for us, because we’re always mindful that the military isn’t a company – it’s the profession of arms.  And so for important reasons, we’re not always going to be able to do everything the same way that others do.  But that doesn’t mean we can’t look ourselves in the mirror.  It doesn’t mean we can’t look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn for ways we can operate more effectively.  So the board will recommend a first slate of innovative practices in the fall, in time for me to review and determine which ones make sense for us to adopt.  And I have no doubt that we will. Finally, one more way we’re investing in innovation is by developing new partnerships with the private sector across America’s many great innovation hubs, unrivaled in the world – places like Boston, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and of course, here in Austin.  And that’s why we, and DIUx, have come here today. Over the last 12 months, since we first opened the doors of the west coast office in Silicon Valley, DIUx has been a signature part of our outreach to the tech community.  And it’s been enormously productive.  We’ve already iterated – launching DIUx 2.0, as we call it, in May, under the leadership of Raj Shah and his fellow partners.  We’ve expanded to Boston, where I opened the DIUx east coast office in July.  And Raj and his team are already bringing in game-changing technologies that are going to benefit America’s warfighters.  They’ve closed five deals just in the last three months.  It took an average of just over 50 days after they first interacted with a company to award these funds.  That’s fast, especially for the Department of Defense, and appropriately so.  And they have another 22 more projects already in the pipeline for an additional $65 million, in areas like network defense, autonomous seafaring drones, and virtual war-gaming. Today, we’re building on that progress with a new DIUx presence here in Austin, to join and complement our east and west coast operations.  Coming here made perfect sense.  The “Silicon Hills” of central Texas have long been a hotbed of scientific and technological innovation – from the garage inventors and dorm room entrepreneurs who follow in Michael Dell’s footsteps, to the startups nurtured in incubators like Capital Factory right here, to the researchers and grad students breaking new ground on campus at U.T. But this is also a state with deep connections to the Department of Defense and to our mission of defending our country and our people.  Texas is home to over a dozen military bases, including some of our largest and most populous, like Fort Bliss and Fort Hood.  Texas is also where some of our longstanding and highly innovative defense companies are located – manufacturing key platforms like the Marine Corps’ most modern attack and utility helicopters, the AH-1 Zulu, and the UH-1 Yankee – Venom, so-called – as well as our most advanced stealth fighter, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the Army’s High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which I’ll remind you we’re using more and more in our coalition campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat in Syria and Iraq, which we surely will do.  Texas is also the home of many service members, military families, and veterans.  In fact, Texas has one of the highest numbers of veteran-owned businesses in the country, including dozens of start-ups right here in Austin.  So bringing DIUx to central Texas and to Austin was a logical step for us.  And we’re fortunate there are two important organizations here – institutions, really – that can help us get established in the area.  One is right here, Capital Factory, where DIUx personnel will start off by working part-time from the co-working spaces here – hopefully benefiting from the close proximity to Austin’s “center of gravity” for innovators.  And the other institution is the University of Texas, which of course has given rise to generations of inventors and innovations in advanced computing, data visualization, robotics, energy, engineering and design, and more. One thing that’s unique about our presence in Austin is that it will help expand DIUx’s national reserve element, which is led by Navy Reserve Commander Doug Beck, a decorated combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Doug’s a very busy guy, especially right now – in his civilian life, he’s a vice president for Apple, reports directly to Tim Cook – but I’m grateful he could join us here today, and for his continued leadership in the DIUx west coast office.  From there, Doug’s been leading a great team of citizen-soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, all of whom provide unique value to DIUx since many of these patriots are tech industry leaders and entrepreneurs when they’re not on duty for us – for DoD. We’re looking to benefit from such talent even more in Austin, because here, DIUx will build its ranks by recruiting proven local innovators who already serve our country in the National Guard and the Reserves.  Once they come on board, they’ll serve part-time – that is, in their regular Reserve capacity – to help connect the broader DIUx enterprise with local and nearby companies that are developing promising technologies with potential customers across our Department of Defense.  They’ll work in close coordination with the DIUx partners based in Silicon Valley and in Boston.  And if this model continues to succeed, we are going to look to replicate it in other innovation hubs around the country.  The “x” in DIUx is well past proving itself as an experiment, but it won’t stop experimenting. Now, to help us get this new DIUx outpost up and running, I’ve hand-picked a leader who was recently one of DoD’s most creative and talented senior civilians – Christine Abizaid.  Christy Abizaid, right over there.  I asked Christy to be our point-person here not only because of her proud legacy of service to our country, but because she has proven to be an innovative thinker and innovative leader everywhere she goes.  In the Pentagon, at the White House, and on battlefields halfway around the world, Christy has always been looking for better, smarter, faster ways to get things done.  Until just recently, Christy was our Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia – lovely places – serving as one of my most trusted policy advisers for what you’ll all recognize as a critically important region.  And I know she’ll do a great job spearheading DIUx’s presence in Austin. And joining Christy will be local Reserve members, starting with First Lieutenant Samantha Snabes, right there.  Before joining DIUx, Samantha’s been serving in uniform as an intelligence officer in the Mississippi Air National Guard.  In civilian life, she’s co-founder and CEO of re:3D, a business she started here in Austin to support affordable, industrial 3-D printing innovations.  Lieutenant Snabes has also worked at NASA and with DARPA – a great example of the innovative people we already have in our military’s ranks.  And I’m sure more Austin-based reservists like her will be joining DIUx soon. And before you know, Christy and her team will be reaching out to all of you here.  They’ll want you to help them understand the technologies you’re working on.  They’ll want to help you understand how those technologies can support our men and women in uniform and contribute to defending our country.  You tell us what you’re doing, we’ll tell you how it can help.  They’ll be our ambassadors to you and a way for you to connect back to us.  So I hope you take the time to get to know them, and even better, to work with them. This is a very exciting and portentous time.  For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on with us, and that’s also true for those interested in technology.  But the intersection of those two – what matters and what’s new – is an opportunity-rich environment. Let me explain what I mean by that, because there are opportunities for partnership in every challenge we face.  Right now – right now, as we sit here in this room – our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our world-wide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate a lasting defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do and we want to do soon.  They’re training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression.  They’re also sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula, countering Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East, and all the while, they’re helping protect our people here at home and helping to make a better world for our children. In each of these missions, you and technologists like you can make a difference, too.  Because whether it’s machine-learning technology that might be able to recognize and block ISIL’s barbaric ideology on social media, or algorithms to help a self-driving boat track submarines, or biotech research that could one day help our troops recover from injury faster, technology’s a critical part of everything we do – and it’s critical to addressing every challenge we face today. I want to close by saying that I know many of you in this city take pride in keeping Austin weird.  So let me assure you, I not only want to keep Austin weird; I’m counting on it.  Because the creative thinking that happens in places like Austin is part of what makes our country so innovative and our economy so vibrant and strong.  And I know that with DIUx in town, it’ll also help our military remain the best in the world.  Because when it comes to America’s national security, we can’t afford to be complacent.  Our competitors are trying to out-innovate us, which means we have to be willing to think a little differently.  That’s how we’ve succeeded in the past – thinking differently put us in space, it put us on the moon, it put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips – and it’s how we’ll succeed and prevail in the future, too: ensuring the safety of our country and our fellow citizens for generations to come.  That’s why DIUx matters.  It has to do with our protection and our security, and creating a world where people can live their lives, dream their dreams, and give their children a better future.

Scientists from Darmstadt University in Germany and Intel Labs have developed a new clever method to source visual data from Grand Theft Auto that could then be fed to computers to teach vehicles how to drive autonomously. Although machine learning is enabling computers to quickly pick up new skills, the approach requires large quantities of information to work effectively –  and data could be hard to find sometimes. It takes thousands of hours of real-world visual data in various scenarios to teach cars how to navigate on their own, but the researchers say information from games is easy to collect and can be “almost as good, or sometimes even better” than real data. This is where Grand Theft Auto’s incredibly realistic environment comes in play. The scientists created a software that is capable of classifying different objects on roads within the game. The data generated can then be used to teach self-driving cars the difference between pedestrians and other objects when navigating through the real world. You can watch the video in the section above to see how the researchers are gathering data from Grand Theft Auto. And while scientists are still figuring out the best ways to teach computers how to drive, companies from the likes of Google, Uber, BMW and Nvidia are in a heated race to conquer the nascent market of self-driving cars.

Nvidia officials are looking to grab a larger share of the ever-expanding artificial intelligence space. At the company's GPU Technology Conference in Beijing this week, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled two new GPUs that are specifically designed for the part of the deep learning process called "inference," an area where the work is usually processed on CPUs from Intel. The new GPUs—the Tesla P4 and P40 (pictured)—are part of a widening push by Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena and the latest point of competition between the GPU maker and Intel in the emerging market. AI refers to the creation of systems that can collect input (such as voice commands or images from the environments around them), process the data instantly and then react accordingly. It can be seen in such technologies as Siri on Apple iPhones and movie recommendation programs on Netflix, and will play an increasingly important role in other spaces, such as self-driving cars. "AI is everywhere," Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at Nvidia, told eWEEK. "We believe it's the most important computing technology in the industry right now." Nvidia officials over the past couple of years have made AI and deep learning crucial parts of the vendor's strategy going forward, and Intel also is aggressively pursuing the emerging market. Central to the competition is the debate over whether GPUs or the x86 CPU architecture are best suited for the workloads that need to run in order for AI to fulfill its promise. The issue of deep learning is twofold. There essentially are two parts of machine learning: training (where neural networks are taught such things as object identification) and inference (where they use this training to recognize and process unknown inputs, such as Siri understanding a user's question and then responding correctly). Neural networks used for training are large, and most training is done on Nvidia GPUs. The inference networks are smaller, and most of that work is done on CPUs from Intel. However, Nvidia officials are arguing now that the Tesla P4 and P40 deliver greater performance and efficiency than Intel chips for inference applications. Both are based on the vendor's 16-nanometer Pascal architecture and offer specialized inference instructions based on 8-bit (INT8) operations. According to Nvidia officials, the new GPUs offer four times faster response than the previous GPU offerings launched less than a year ago and 45 times better response than CPUs. The P4, due out in November, is smaller than the P40 and is designed for data centers where energy efficiency is key. The GPU, which starts at 50 watts of power, can fit into any server and low-power system and, according to Nvidia, is 40 times more efficient than CPUs when running production inferencing workloads. A single server powered by a P4 GPU can replace 13 CPU-only systems for video inferencing workloads and deliver more than eight times the savings in total cost of ownership, which includes server and power costs. The larger and more powerful P40, which is scheduled for release in October, provides 47 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance, and a server with eight P40 GPU accelerators can replace more than 140 CPU-based servers, saving organizations more than $650,000 in server acquisition costs. The two graphics cards follow the massive P100 that Nvidia officials introduced in April, which packs 150 billion transistors and was built for data center and cloud environments. Intel is pushing ahead with its own AI initiatives. The chip maker in recent months bought Nervana Systems and its machine learning technologies, and officials have boasted of the company's commitment to such open machine learning frameworks as Caffe and Theano. In addition, at the Intel Developer Forum last month, Intel officials talked about the planned release of a multi-core Xeon Phi chip dubbed "Knights Mill" with enhanced variable precision and flexible high-capacity memory that is aimed at AI workloads. Knights Mill is due out next year. Nvidia also introduced new software tools for inferencing workloads. TensorRT is a software library designed to make it faster and more efficient to taking neural networks that have been trained and optimizing them for reduced precision INT8 operation. In addition, the DeepStream software developer kit (SDK) is aimed at video streams. The software enables servers powered by Pascal GPUs to simultaneously decode and analyze up to 93 high-definition video streams in real time, much faster than the seven streams that can be run with dual CPUs, officials said. This capability will be important for such applications as self-driving cars, interactive robots and ad placement, they said.             LATEST NETWORKING ARTICLES   Cisco Posts Modestly Good Quarter, but Outlook is Soft Nutanix Brings Networking Into Its Enterprise Cloud Platform Cypress Adds Connectivity Option to WICED IoT Platform BT, CA Make Deeper Pushes Into Growing SD-WAN Space Cisco Brings Flexible Payments, App Site to Spark Collaboration Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The SM951 AHCI PCIe Gen3 x4 M.2 SSD delivered the goods at the time like nothing previously seen. Even Intel's behemoth 750 Series NVMe SSDs had trouble outperforming this tiny M.2 SSD. The only issue with the SM951 AHCI was thermal throttling that in some cases greatly reduced performance.     Sonnet Technologies, a leading aftermarket company that mainly caters to the Mac crowd, has created a custom Add-In-Card (AIC) utilizing Samsung's SM951 AHCI M.2 SSD, a custom heat sink and an M.2 to PCIe Gen3 x 4 lane PCIe slot adapter, dubbed Tempo. The large custom heat sink wicks heat away from the drive's controller and flash packages, thus putting an end to the thermal throttling issues that have plagued the SM951 AHCI from day one.   Sonnet adds a hefty premium for this custom design, and that's to be expected from a company that caters mainly to Mac users. The price for the Tempo 512GB SSD is roughly $200 more than if you were to buy a 512GB SM951 AHCI in a standalone M.2 form factor. However, you get the benefit of a design that virtually eliminates thermal throttling as well as a more universal form factor that can be utilized on computers that do not have a built-in M.2 Gen3 x4 slot. Because the Tempo is an AHCI based drive, the Tempo has true plug and play capabilities for most Mac's as well as Windows PCs.   At the heart of the Tempo is a Samsung SM951 AHCI SSD, so we know it is going to be good; let's see how good.   Specifications     Sonnet's Tempo AIC SSD is available in two capacities: 256GB and 512GB. The 512GB model we have on the bench has the following factory specifications for Windows PC's with PCIe 3.0 slots:   Sequential Read: up to 1936 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 1529 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: not listed Max 4K Random Write Speed: not listed   The Tempo retail package includes the drive, half-height mounting bracket, full height mounting bracket, and printed quick start guide.   Sonnet warranties the Tempo for one year, which is way too short of a period in our opinion. Because the SM951 AHCI is an OEM product, the warranty and endurance are specified by the reseller instead of Samsung.

News & Analysis Touch Standard Rides I3C Link MIPI aims to replace proprietary interfaces Rick Merritt 9/14/2016 11:30 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS 2 saves Login to Rate Tweet MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – The MIPI Alliance has started work on a standard interface for touch screens using its emerging I3C interconnect announced earlier this year. MIPI Touch, described at a developer’s conference here, aims to simplify work for engineers who currently support a handful of proprietary approaches. The interface includes a standard command set for relaying messages between the application processor and other touch components. It aims to replace a variety of approaches using I2C and SPI links the group claims are not well optimized for mobile systems The spec, now in a draft to contributors, is expected to be ratified sometime next year. It is being developed by companies including Intel, NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung and Synaptics. It’s not clear if potential users such as Apple and their vendors will support the effort. In the iPhone 6, Apple used a touchscreen controller from Broadcom and a line driver from Texas Instruments, according to a teardown by TechInsights. Apple is a contributing member of MIPI, but Broadcom is not a member. Today’s many touch-based smartphones, tablets and in-car gadgets send data “over a slow interface with customized register sets and functions so every OEM writes special drivers…MIPI Touch makes the process more transparent,” said Dale Stolitzka, a principal engineer in Samsung Display and chair of the MIPI Alliance’s display working group. MIPI Touch will support both standard and custom commands over an I3C interconnect. (Image: MIPI) MIPI Touch is not specific to today’s mainstream capacitive touch sensors. It will support single-, multi-touch and stylus inputs; and it allows vendors to create custom commands and functions outside a basic shared command set. The current version of the spec does not take into account force data, also known as haptics, but the spec could be updated in the future to include it. Earlier this month, Apple described a large custom haptics sensor it built into its iPhone 7. Engineers may be able to implement MIPI Touch in firmware if their devices have an embedded controller, Stolitzka said. The MIPI I3C interface the touch standard is based on is in a final review stage now. I3C supports data rates of more than 30 Mbits/second and has compatibility modes for working with I2C. “We’re trying to make it as easy as possible for vendors to implement this quickly,” said Stolitzka. Looking ahead, the rise of virtual and augmented reality goggles are expected to drive needs for new MIPI display interfaces with greater throughput. “The issue will be how much display area in pixels people need to look at and the commensurate bandwidth to support the resolution demands,” Stolitzka said. “We probably need to think about doubling bandwidth from where we are with the D-PHY interface at about 4 Gbits/s today,” an effort that could take about a year, he added. In addition, MIPI aims to extend its work beyond the smartphone to cars and TVs. That could require extending some interfaces to support distances measured in meters rather than inches, said Rick Wietfeldt, chair of MIPI's technical steering group in a keynote talk here. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Apple Debuts Three Custom Chips 4 Traps in Installing Capacitive Touchscreens for Auto Googles Daydream is Silicon Reality Where Is Top 10 IoT Processor List?

Contact Us Journalists Blog Log In Sign Up Send a Release News Solutions Resources Search IBM, HPE outsourcing, SPSS, and VMware Are Most Likely To Be Recommended By IT Professionals, According to New Temkin Group Research Fifth Annual Study of IT Decision Benchmarks Net Promoter Scores and Loyalty Levels for 62 Large Tech Vendors News provided by Temkin Group Sep 14, 2016, 08:30 ET Share this article WABAN, Mass., Sept. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies often use a metric called Net Promoter® Score (NPS®) as a measure of loyalty, as it calculates the likelihood that customers will recommend a company to friends and colleagues. In a new report called Tech Vendor NPS Benchmark, 2016, Temkin Group analyzes NPS of 62 tech vendors based on feedback from 800 IT decision makers within large North American companies. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/406961LOGO NPS can range from a low of -100 to a high of +100. With an NPS of 61, IBM software came out with the top score followed by HPE outsourcing, IBM SPSS, and VMware. Four other tech vendors received NPS of more than 45: Oracle outsourcing, Intel, Microsoft servers, and HPE IT services. At the other end of the spectrum, eight tech vendors have NPS below 10: Cognizant, Capgemini, Infosys, SunGard, CSC, ADP, Trend Micro, and Accenture. This is the fifth year that Temkin Group has completed the NPS study. The average NPS dropped from 31.8 in 2015 to 29.9 this year. "We found a wide range of Net Promoter Scores across tech vendors, and a strong connection between that metric and the loyalty of IT professionals," states Bruce Temkin, Managing Partner of Temkin Group. In addition to benchmarking NPS, the research examines several areas of loyalty that large companies have for their tech vendors. We found that IT professionals are most likely to increase spending with Software AG and HPE outsourcing, most likely to try new offerings from IBM SPSS, IBM software, and IBM outsourcing, and are most likely to forgive HPE outsourcing and IBM SPSS.

View Latest Posts >>> Russian Black Sea Fleet ‘Has Everything’ to Destroy Enemy Moving to Crimea By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on September 14, 2016 Russian Black Sea Fleet ‘Has Everything’ to Destroy Enemy Moving to Crimea … from  Sputnik, Moscow [ Editor’s Note: NATO’s ploy to think that a NEO-Nazi coup in Kiev was going to have the key Russian naval base in Crimea fall into its hands like a ripe apple was ill-founded, notwithstanding that Moscow had prepaid the Sevastopol base rental fees for a decade in advance to help out Kiev’s cash flow. Despite the Western puppet government installed in Kiev, the large majority of ethnic Russians in Crimea were not about to have the boot of Ukrainian nationalists on their necks. They did what any reasonable people would, telling Kiev with their secession vote where it could stick its boot. And so would the US, if it had been in a similar situation with Americans being threatened. The major boomerang from all of this is the huge focus now on Russia’s building up its defense capacities, despite the hardships of the sanctions. And with Obama’s ill thought out Asian Pivot, the Chinese are in the same mode now, particularly on making and deploying technical advances to counter US numerical naval advantage. Was triggering a new arms race to fill the coffers of the military industrial complex a major motivating factor in the strategy, when there was no realistic military threat from either Russia or China? Many geopolitical analysts think so, including those in the Intel field… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ – First published  …  September 14,  2016 – The Russian Black Sea Fleet is fully capable of defending the country’s borders thanks to reconnaissance and modern weapons, the General Staff’s head said. The Russian Black Sea Fleet is capable of engaging a potential enemy while advancing from its bases, the Russian Defense Ministry’s head of General Staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, said Wednesday. “The Black Sea Fleet now has everything needed to do so: intelligence tools that detect targets at ranges up to 500 kilometers [310 miles] and weapons. The Bastion coastal missile complex alone extends 350 kilometers [217 miles] up to and including the Bosphorous,” Gerasimov told reporters. He added that the fleet’s submarines armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, naval aviation, as well as strategic and tactical aircraft would prevent a potential enemy’s landing troops “from reaching the Black Sea coast of Crimea wherever it comes from.” “The Black Sea Fleet should be able to – and it has demonstrated its ability to – independently engage a landing force while advancing, starting from the loading ports,” Gerasimov stressed. __________ Russia Unleashes Lethal Next Gen Kalibr Cruise Missile During War Games (VIDEO) Russian Caspian Flotilla warships have successfully fired advanced Kalibr-NK cruise missiles as part of the country’s Caucasus-2016 military exercise. The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Kalibr-class cruise missiles launched from the Caspian Sea during Russia’s most recent display of strength all had accurately struck their designated land and sea practice targets. In the first stage of the drills, a missile fired from the Grad Sviyazhsk corvette with the use of Kalibr precision system flew about 100 nautical miles and successfully hit the onshore target — an artificial enemy command post. In the second stage of the exercises, a Kalibr missile launched from the Uglich small-size missile vessel struck a sea target located at a distance of over 70 nautical miles, the Defense ministry’s press service reported. Kalibr-class cruise missiles, the game-changing development by the Russian defense industry, can travel 50 to 150 meters above the ground and hit sea targets up to 350 kilometers away and ground targets more than 2,500 kilometers away. Their maximum deviation from the designated target is only three meters. Here is the chilling footage showing the missiles streak away into the air, leaving behind volumes of smoke. Russia’s Caucasus-2016 drills were aimed at testing the Caspian flotilla’s ability to resolve crisis situations threatening the country’s defense security. ____________ Related Posts: Why Russia Will NOT Be Dedicated to the “Virgin Mary” Russia tests stratospheric missile to destroy fleets Who Instigates Russian-Ukrainian War Over Crimea?

Someone that knows about PC hardware, is going to know that this is a very expensive piece of hardware. They are not going to pay that much for the machine, even though it is a small beefy PC! It is very expensive, and limited. They should have done what Alienware did with the Alpha, and target smaller hardware with lesser power, at a much lower cost. The Alpha is a quick selling product because of it's size, price, and power to be enough for mainstream gaming. The companies are also trying to call some of the small form factor PC's consoles, but you try to sell this to a console user that probably only paid maybe $400 on average for a console you aren't going to get anyone to buy it then. I am a huge fan of SFF PC's, but they have to have some value.     vbetts View Public Profile Find all posts by vbetts « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2016, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Grand Theft Auto is being used to teach the artificial intelligence that controls self-driving cars. Researchers are using open worlds built by Rockstar and other developers to replicate real-world data. Using games like Grand Theft Auto is cheaper and less time-consuming than creating bespoke software for machine learning, according to a Technology Review report. Researchers at Intel Labs and Darmstadt University have created software that can help AI differentiate between vehicles, pedestrians and other scenery in games like GTA. Doing the same with real-world data would take “thousands of hours” to collect and label the imagery. “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings,” said Alireza Shafaei, a student and the University of British Columbia. “We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.” Would you be happy in a car that learnt how to navigate the streets of Los Santos and the Cunning Stunts courses?

(Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images) In November 2014, Li Yuxiao, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace, stated, according to the state-run China Daily: “Now is the time for China to realize its responsibilities. If the United States is willing to give up its running of the internet sphere, the question comes as to who will take the baton and how it would be run. “We have to first set our goal in cyberspace, and then think about the strategy to take, before moving on to refining our laws,” he said. Li is now the head of a department designed to enforce the Chinese regime’s laws on technology companies. His comments are tied to a process announced by the United States in 2014 to relinquish control of the internet by ending the contract between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This process is now nearing its completion, with a deadline of Oct. 1. The handover is technically of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which is a department of ICANN. It regulates domain name registrations for websites, handles the Domain Name System (DNS) Root Zone to ensure internet users are directed to the websites they intend to visit, and also handles internet protocols. The integrity of DNS, in particular, is critical, since it can be used for cyberattacks that send people to fake, infected websites. It’s also one of the primary systems manipulated for state censorship that can block access to specific websites. Read More China Wants to Control What You Watch The United States plans for the internet to be run by a multistakeholder model without government oversight, and relinquishing control of ICANN will be the last step in this process. Yet the new model does not mean ICANN, or the broader internet, will remain free from government influence. Rather, the United States is simply stepping back from this role. According to Chris Mattmann, who helped develop how email systems work under IANA and who also helped develop several Apache systems that are at the heart of the internet, the handover of ICANN is a concerning move. With this shift, Mattmann said, the process of determining which website is shown to you when you enter a web address “will no longer be driven by the U.S. Department of Commerce,” and this could be manipulated by foreign powers for anything from censorship to cyberattacks. For instance, if the Chinese regime were to object to a website that publishes information about its human rights record, the ability to influence IANA would allow the regime to make that website virtually invisible on the web. Mattmann, who currently works at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said he believes processes under ICANN need to be heavily vetted, noting that “even when the internet is itself distributed and decentralized,” the open system begins to break down without an authority to ensure it stays open. Already, the Chinese regime is moving to fill the void left by the U.S. handover—and its new system for governing the internet goes far beyond the responsibilities held by ICANN. Over the last two years, Chinese leaders have drafted an authoritarian set of laws that governs every facet of the internet. The Chinese regime has formed domestic institutions or gained control over international bodies to press these new laws for the internet through the United Nations; through domestic enforcement including on foreign companies inside China; and through organizations formed to work directly with major technology companies abroad and more generally with internet stakeholders. A Tool for Foreign Engagement Lu Wei, minister of the Cyberspace Affairs Administration of China, at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, eastern China’s Zhejiang Province, on Nov. 19, 2014. (AFP PHOTO/JOHANNES EISELE In the two years since Li gave his speech at the 2014 World Internet Conference, the Chinese regime has gained ground on Li’s goal to govern the global internet. The three-day conference in Wuzhen, themed “An Interconnected World Shared and Governed by All,” brought together more than 1,000 internet companies from over 100 countries and regions. Li is now the secretary-general of the Cyber Security Association of China, which is chaired by Fang Binxing, the creator of China’s Great Firewall, which censors and monitors the country’s internet. The association, formed on March 25, gives the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) a vehicle for spreading its systems and laws for governing the internet abroad, while giving its efforts a benign facade under the label of “cybersecurity.” Related Coverage Inside the Global Banking E-Heist The association can start discussions abroad at “more senior levels” with “international industry, academic, and research associations” that constitute the global system that controls the internet under the multistakeholder model, according to a report from the Center for Strategic & International Studies. The association is registered as a national nonprofit organization, but according to the report, it answers directly to the Leading Small Group for Network Security and Information—which is chaired by CCP leader Xi Jinping—and is “responsible for shaping and implementing information security and internet policies and laws.” According to the report, the Cyber Security Association of China, among other tasks, focuses on “public opinion supervision to help in information control and propaganda” and “protecting core Chinese interests under globalization, and promoting globally competitive Chinese IT companies.” According to Xia Yiyang, senior director of research and policy at the Human Rights Law Foundation, there is more to the statement, “protecting core Chinese interests under globalization,” than meets the eye. “In the CCP’s language, it’s a way to keep the CCP in power by any means,” he said, adding, “They have a very clear definition of ‘core interests.'” In an interview published on the World Internet Conference website, Li stated that since China has the largest number of netizens in the world, it should have the right to “make the international rules of cyberspace governance.” “The establishment of rules is just a start,” he said. Influence Over Foreign Companies The Chinese regime has begun bringing major U.S. tech firms—including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)—into its newly formed committee, the Technical Committee 260. The committee is already working with foreign companies to enforce the CCP’s laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, it is inviting companies to help Chinese authorities draft rules for issues including encryption, big data, and cybersecurity, and with determining which technologies should be “secure and controllable” by the CCP. A screen shows a rolling feed of new Generic Top-Level Domain Names (gTLDs) that have been applied for during a press conference hosted by ICANN in central London, on June 13, 2012. The U.S. intention to relinquish control of ICANN opens the door for China to gain greater control over the internet. (Andrew Cowie/AFP/GettyImages) The phrase “secure and controllable” was included in the Chinese regime’s sweeping National Security Law, passed on July 1, 2015. The Washington-based think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation described the law’s requirements as being “part of a strategic effort” intended to “ultimately supplant foreign technology companies both in China and in markets around the world.” According to the BBC, the law authorizes the CCP to take “all necessary” steps to protect itself. The BBC report also noted that many foreign technology firms operating in China “fear that under the new law they will be forced to hand over sensitive information to the authorities.” For instance, China has repeatedly tried to force foreign tech companies to hand over the source code for their software—in 2015, Apple said no, but IBM said yes—and has also demanded foreign tech companies’ encryption keys. The technology news website TechDirt speculated the CCP could use this law to renew its attempts to require foreign companies to install back doors in their technology products. If companies give in to these demands, they compromise their own and their users’ security in and outside of China. Failure to give in to these demands may bar companies from the Chinese market. Influence Through the United Nations The United Nations branch responsible for telecommunications issues, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) technically only governs radio communications, but at a meeting in 2012 many nations agreed to ITU assuming a role in governing the Internet. Meanwhile, China has been working hard to assume control of the ITU. The ITU gained international attention in 2012, when it held the closed-door World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai to rewrite rules that govern the global internet. Related Coverage CHINA SECURITY: Twitter’s First China Director Signals Censorship and State Control EXCLUSIVE: Global Banking System Infiltrated by Chinese State Hackers Despite the closed-door policy, many documents from the meetings were leaked online, and the contents of these documents drew heavy criticism from tech-focused groups and news outlets. One law the ITU passed “could give governments and companies the ability to sift through all of an internet user’s traffic—including emails, banking transactions, and voice calls—without adequate privacy safeguards,” according to the Center for Democracy and Technology, which exposed the ITU program known as Y.2770. The United States walked out of the 2012 meeting, and other countries—including the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Australia, and others—refused to sign its controversial treaty. Yet the treaty was passed regardless, giving the ITU a level of governance over the internet it had not had before. Nations that refused to sign the treaty are not included in it. Instead, they retain agreements under the 1988 ITU treaty, which did not include any elements on ITU governing the internet. Nonetheless, the ITU declared the new treaty a success, as its remaining members did recognize its new role. It released a statement on Dec. 14, 2012, saying “delegates from around the world have agreed [to] a new global treaty that will help pave the way to a hyper-connected world.” In October 2014, the ITU elected China’s Houlin Zhao as its secretary-general. Zhao had stated previously that censorship is subjective. According to The New American in October 2014, when Zhao was asked about “the Communist Chinese dictatorship’s massive censorship regime targeting dissent, dissidents, and ideas it disagrees with,” he replied, “Some kind of censorship may not be strange to other countries.” A Contentious Move Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has spearheaded a push to prevent the handover of ICANN, and many U.S. government officials, organizations, and experts have sounded an alarm over concerns that a foreign authoritarian power may attempt to do precisely what the Chinese regime has already set into motion. During a Senate subcommittee hearing on Sept. 14 on the issue, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said, according to a prepared statement, that many important questions on the transition remain unanswered. These include whether it will “yield an unconstitutional transfer of United States government property, how the transfer will affect human rights and free speech issues, if U.S.-controlled top-level domains such as .gov and .mil could be compromised.” “If this internet giveaway goes forward, there’s no reason to believe that authoritarian states would stop trying to exert greater control and we don’t know how things will play out long term,” Grassley said. Related Coverage The Silent War Against America’s Image On June 8, Cruz and Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act, which seeks to prevent the U.S. handover of ICANN, and to ensure the United States retains sole ownership of .gov and .mil top-level domains. Similar concerns were shared by Philip Zimmermann, creator of the PGP encryption standard and chief scientist and co-founder of Silent Circle, a company specializing in secure communications. Zimmerman said he believes the United States needs to maintain some authority over the internet, lest “we give in to control by an international body that can be easily influenced by member states that are oppressive societies.” “The internet is supposed to make the weak have a voice, you know. If China controls their own domains within their country, it’s going to be easy to suppress opposition,” he said. According to Barney Warf, a geography professor at the University of Kansas who has published research on global internet freedom and governance, China has a “brutal, fascist, oppressive regime that has gone out of its way to suppress human rights.” Warf said even the possibility that the CCP could enforce its laws over the global internet is a frightening thought. He said the United States’ informal governing of the internet did not place any firm control over it, and this allowed innovation to flourish. He said the lack of strict governance gave people room to “experiment and make mistakes,” and added, “I think the internet has thrived because there is no central power over it.” Laws for the Internet Steve Crocker, chair of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), during an ICANN meeting in Singapore on Feb. 9, 2015. The U.S. plan to relinquish control of ICANN opens the door for China to have greater influence over the global Internet. (ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images) After the U.S. relinquishes control of ICANN, it will technically retain some level of oversight, but this oversight will be bundled together with that of the 171 other members and 35 observers in the Governmental Advisory Committee. Among those members is ITU, along with “all the UN agencies with a direct interest in global Internet governance,” according to the committee’s website. The Committee advises ICANN on government concerns “related to laws and international agreements based on consensus,” according to Jonathan Zuck, president of ACT | The App Association, in a statement presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 14. In the event the 171 member committee does make a consensus-based recommendation to ICANN, Zuck testified that ICANN can reject it with a 60 percent majority vote of its governing board.  While the U.N.’s legal structure will for all practical purposes eliminate the U.S. ability to affect ICANN’s policy, Chinese officials have been very candid about their intentions to push CCP law onto the internet. The coming out party for this effort was the 2014 World Internet Conference, which followed upon the U.S. announcement that it would step back from internet governance. “Experts said China is using the platform to sell its own strategy and rules to the world, a mission that the world’s largest cyberpower with the most internet users has deemed significant and urgent,” the state-run China Daily reported at the time. “China has the capability now to set up international rules for cyberspace and use our strategy and our rules to influence the world,” said Shen Yi, an associate professor specializing in cybersecurity at Fudan University, according to China Daily. “China is considering setting up its own rules in cyberspace,” CCP Premier Li Keqiang said, in comments summarized by China Daily. He added the CCP wants to create a “common code of rules” for the internet. In July 2015, the CCP passed the National Security Law mentioned earlier, with its requirement that certain technologies should be “secure and controllable.” That same month, the CCP introduced the draft of its Cybersecurity Law. Reuters reported that the law requires network operators to “accept the supervision of the government and public,” and that it reiterates requirements that all personal data on Chinese citizens and “important business data” needs to be stored domestically—an element that further exposes the data to government surveillance. Reuters noted the law was controversial in the United States and Europe, since it affects foreign firms. It also noted it increased the CCP’s power to “access and block dissemination of private information records that Chinese law deems illegal,” and that this has caused concern among governments, multinational companies, and rights activists, since the CCP may be able to “interpret the law as it sees fit.” In December 2015, the CCP passed the Counterterrorism Law, which allows Chinese authorities to decrypt information to prevent “terrorism,” and to monitor systems with the excuse of preventing the spread of information that can be used for the CCP’s definitions of terrorism or “extremism.” There is a long list of similar laws and regulations. In February 2016, the CCP issued rules for online publishing. In March 2016, it drafted rules for domain name registration. It has issued state procurement lists that restrict foreign suppliers and has pending laws on encryption regulations. With its new institutions, laws, and regulations, the Chinese regime is ready through its Cyber Security Association to influence the operation of ICANN and other systems in the multistakeholder model; or it is ready to see the U.N. gain influence over ICANN through the ITU—with China at its helm. Tech companies operating in China are now required to turn over proprietary technology, endangering their businesses and destroying their customers’ expectation of confidentiality. Meanwhile, through the Technical Committee 260, major tech companies are lobbying for the world to adopt the Chinese regime’s internet law and regulations. And the China-led ITU wants to grant nations the right to search all internet traffic. Thus, China is seeking to make good on Liu Yuxiao’s promise that China will “realize its responsibilities” in the absence of U.S. control.

By Danny Palmer | September 14, 2016 -- 07:55 GMT (00:55 PDT) | Topic: Security Hospitals: an easy target for some hackers, a no-go for others. Image: iStock Ransomware attacks against hospitals represent a growing threat which is becoming increasingly lucrative for some cybercriminals -- even while other hackers are openly condemning extortion attempts against healthcare providers. A combination of hospitals' reliance on equipment powered by older operating systems and their often very urgent need to access medical data means that some hackers have looked at the institutions as a potentially rich target. One of the nastiest types of ransomware has just come back to life How Bitcoin helped fuel an explosion in ransomware attacks How Bitcoin helped fuel an explosion in ransomware attacks Ransomware-as-a-service allows wannabe hackers to cash-in on cyber extortion Now ransomware is taking aim at business networks That was demonstrated when a Los Angeles hospital paid a $17,000 Bitcoin ransom after a Locky infection took down its network. But that wasn't a one-off attack: there's been a surge in ransomware-based cyberattacks against hospital networks across the globe, but particularly in the US. Cybersecurity researchers from Intel Security analysed ransomware code from attacks against hospitals made during the first quarter of the year and discovered numerous Bitcoin wallets used to transfer ransom payments -- Bitcoin having become the preferred currency of the cybercriminal -- which showed that the hackers behind these hospitals attacks had amassed $100,000 from ransoms alone. Researchers have described the ransomware attack methods used by such attackers as "effective but not very sophisticated". While they don't specify which variants of ransomware are being used, the description could point to the culprits using something like Cerber, which has been seen being made available as a ransomware-as-a-service scheme for use by even the most technically-illiterate wannabe cybercriminal. Researchers also suggest the hospital attacks weren't carried out by the sort of "malicious actors we normally face in ransomware attacks or breaches". Indeed, they found evidence that suggests that cyberattacks against hospitals are being carried out by those viewed as renegades even within the cybercriminal fraternity, judged negatively for their decision to carry out attacks against those which provision healthcare. In the Russian underground in particular, there's an 'ethical' code of conduct which places hospitals off-limits -- even in countries usually targeted by Russian-speaking hackers. In one forum, criminals discussed the ethics of attacking hospitals at length: "Yes, this is pretty sad and a new low. These ransom attacks are bad enough, but if someone were to die or be injured because of this it is just plain wrong," one user said, while another labelled hospital attackers as "dumbest hackers ever". While hospitals currently only account for a small percentage of ransomware victims, it's feared that as ransomware becomes an increasingly appealing method of attack for hackers, more and more of them will attack the healthcare sector. "With cybersecurity threats including ransomware rising at such a rapid rate, organisations are having to come to terms with the fact that it's fast becoming a question of 'when', not 'if', they suffer a breach," says Raj Samani, CTO at EMEA Intel Security. "It's crucial that the likes of healthcare pick up the pace with cybersecurity. Vulnerabilities in these sectors provide hackers with access to extremely personal, valuable and often irreplaceable data and IP." Despite a few high profile cases, Intel Security researchers found that, in most instances, hospitals that became victims of ransomware didn't pay hackers a ransom. In these cases, it's likely that organisations found another way to decrypt the files -- or they simply deemed the encrypted files to not be important enough to pay to get back. Cybersecurity researchers and the authorities have both warned about the increasing threat of ransomware to corporate and public sector networks.

If that’s the case, then this latest Android-x86 release might just be the right fit for you. Now at version 6.0-r1, this is the first stable release of Android-x86 based on Android Marshmallow. And while it may not have yet the multi-tasking features of 7.0 Nougat, it does pave the way for that brighter future for Android on PCs. Although it may not be the only one, the Android-x86 project is perhaps the most successful and longest-running community port of Android for x86 and x86_64 computers, particularly those running on Intel’s chips. It is so popular that Jide, makers of the Android Remix devices and OS, grabbed Android-x86 founder Chih-Wei Huang for its own team, basing the new Remix OS for PCs on this body of code. Curiously, this Android x86 6.0 release comes almost two months after Jide released a new Marshmallow version of Remix OS for PCs. Still, not everyone might have been so enamored by Remix OS and some might opt for a leaner platform to build their own customizations on. For these people, Android-x86 is the perfect thing. Aside from upgrading to Marshmallow, Android-x86 6.0-r1 also brings in some new features and fixes. For the security-conscious, it includes all recent AOSP security fixes and patches. For the stability-conscious, it uses Linux kernel version 4.4.20 from the kernel’s “Long-Term Support” (LTS) tree. Android-x86 also now provides a normal looking mouse cursor, instead of a simple circle, taken from Android Nougat. Installing Android-x86, however, might not be for the faint of heart. Although it practically uses the same tools as Remix OS for PC, it doesn’t package them into a single downloadable bundle. For those who do wish to dive in, Android-x86 now supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processors and both legacy BIOS and UEFI firmwares.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Titan JUXT Pro Review Titan just outed their first all touchscreen smartwatch that follows up on the JUXT. The new smartwatch is called the JUXT Pro and aims to provide a premium experience to customers. Let’s take a look at what it offers. Unboxing The Titan JUXT Pro comes in a really neat wooden box that feels premium and reminds you of a premium analogue watch. You can watch the unboxing video below: Here are the contents of the box: Titan JUXT Pro smartwatch in Black Case with leather strap Charging cradle Micro USB cable User manual and warranty information Design, Materials and Build Quality The Titan JUXT Pro succeeds the JUXT but unlike its predecessor, it features a completely digital interface. However, you would be glad to note that Titan hasn’t compromised on the aesthetics or build quality like most other smartwatches seem to do these days. The JUXT Pro is made out of a stainless steel casing that is robust and features an IP67 rating that protects it from water and dust. The only plastic part on the entire casing is the bezel ring that surrounds the display but even that could pass as being metal to the untrained eye. The build quality is top notch thanks to the 316L stainless steel that has been used in construction and the watch feels like it can easily handle a drop or two but we don’t recommend that you try it though. The case features two buttons on the right side, one for the power button and another for the Titan Safety feature just below it. The casing is available in two different colour variants, one with a full black casing and the other in a combination of black and silver. Both of them come with a leather strap but the straps are interchangeable and just about any 22mm watch strap will fit into the casing. The watch is water resistant upto 3 ATM (30 metres) and it is quite a bit bigger (48mm casing) as well as heavier than most other smartwatches on the market. Although the size of the watch implicates that it would be something worn by men, Titan say that it could just as well be worn by women too. The primary need to have a larger design was to integrate more components inside the body including a larger battery without having to compromise. Hence the design could be said as something that was inspired by functionality as much as it was supposed to invoke a premium analogue watch design. Display The display on the JUXT Pro is a fully circular 1.3″ IPS display that comes with a resolution of 360×360 pixels (278 ppi) which offers good brightness as well as viewing angles. The brightness is good enough for both indoor and outdoor visibility. The display glass is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which means its quite resistant to scratches and while it is no Sapphire Crystal, it still hasn’t gotten scratched on our unit even with regular use. Touch response is good as well. The display can be chosen to stay on all the time or a bring to see mode where you rotate your wrist in such a way that the screen is visible and the screen lights up. This also brings up an important feature of the JUXT pro called privilege reveal. Even if you get a notification, the screen of the smartphone won’t light up right away. You will get a vibration but you will be able to see the notification only when you use the bring to see function. You could also turn off the bring to see mode and only have the watch display light up when you press the home button but I personally quite like the bring to see function as it is quite practical and doesn’t really come at the expense of battery life. There are 20 pre-loaded watch faces to choose from and you can customize more online to your liking. Comfort I personally love big watches and the Titan JUXT Pro probably has the perfect size for my big hands too. At 48mm, the casing is larger than most smartwatches and even most analogue watches. But the whole point of the JUXT Pro was to be something that stands out and looks great. It certainly does achieve that. While the watch is quite a bit heavy when you hold it, it doesn’t actually feel all that big or heavy while wearing it. It doesn’t really give you any wrist fatigue too and despite having worn it through several hectic days during IFA 2016, it didn’t really irritate me. Coming to the strap, I am not really a big fan of leather straps and if I got the JUXT Pro personally, I would immediately change the strap for a silicon or rubber one. But with that said, the leather strap is of good quality and despite an initial rigidness, it becomes easy to wear after a few uses. A metal strap would also look good but I feel it would become too bulky and heavy if you do so. But that is your personal choice and the 22mm strap size means you can easily change the strap at a Titan store or anywhere else you want to. Storage and Performance The JUXT Pro comes with 4GB of internal storage but the OS itself takes around 2GB of space. Users can store their favourite music and play them from the smartwatch instead of having to rely on your smartphone itself. Additionally, you can use your JUXT Pro as a mass storage device to store and carry files that you want. In a way, its also a secure way to store important documents on travel for example your passport scans and more.  So in the unlikely event that you lose your phone or computer, you can still access the files from your smartwatch. However, the only downside is the fact that you need the dock to access the files. The 512MB of RAM along with the Dual Core Intel processor clocked in at 1 GHz made sure that performance was smooth at all times and we didn’t encounter any instances of the watch heating up even with step tracking and notifications turned on. Software The JUXT Pro does not run on Android Wear. Instead, it runs on Titan’s proprietary OS and is compatible with Android devices running version 4.4 and higher as well as iOS devices running version 8 or higher. It connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth 4.0 but it doesn’t have WiFi. There is a Titan JUXT Pro app that allows you to feed in your profile as well as customise and manage your watch settings. There is also a Titan Safety app that can be used to assign your emergency contacts. You can use Titan Safety to alert your loved ones of your location with the touch of the dedicated safety button. You could also set a panic alarm which will notify your selected contacts of your status and there is even a shadow me feature that will give regular updates about your location to your loved ones. Lastly, there is a priority call option where you can add chosen individuals to the list and you will be notified (even in silent or do not disturb mode) when any of them calls you but not disturbed when anyone else does. There is even a chat feature where you can talk to a particular group of contacts, be it your friend or family and send them photos and voice notes too. Apps and Notifications The JUXT Pro offers notifications for all apps and not just a few preset applications. This is quite good since the apps that each user uses varies a lot and it isn’t necessary that everyone uses the same messaging client for example. So if you have support for one but not the other, it is bound to agitate a few users at least. Luckily, all apps are supported and users can also choose which of them to exclude from the notification list and which should not be allowed to give a vibration feedback. I personally have disabled vibration and notification for apps like Whatsapp considering the vast majority of messages that come everyday. Have allowed important notifications such as calls, emails and messages though. You can also respond to notifications from a set of preset messages that can also be customised to your needs. Users can choose to mute calls and notifications on their phone when it is connected to the watch in order to have a more subtle way of getting notified. The watch also comes with a timer, a stopwatch, a weather app, a calendar app and a converter. Mind you, it is a unit converter and not a real time currency converter. There is a built-in phone finder tool that allows the user to make his/her phone vibrate or ring when the watch is connected to it. The good thing is that it allows you to even ring the phone when the phone is on silent. Note that on iOS devices, the ringing functionality won’t work if you have muted the phone with the physical switch. However, if you have muted it with the volume keys then it will work. Lastly, there is a camera app that allows you to remotely control the cameras on your smartphone be it at the front or back. You can choose the flash setting and take a shot by pressing the shutter button on the smartphone. The watch gives you a 3 second timer so that you have time to pose before the shot is captured. The only downside to this is that it launches its own camera app instead of the stock one and that limits the ability to adjust settings such as HDR, shutter speed etc before taking the shot. If Titan add that functionality too, it would become a really useful tool. Note that the phone needs to be unlocked when you want to use the camera app on the watch but you can launch the camera by hitting the camera app on the watch without needing to open the camera app separately on the phone. You can also use your JUXT Pro to control the music on your smartphone or play ones from the watch itself. To start playing music on your smartphone, you need to launch the app with the phone unlocked. After that, you can control the music even when the phone is locked. You have track play/pause, seek/transport as well as volume controls. Fitness Tracker The JUXT Pro has a built in Fitness Tracker that allows you to record the number of steps you take as well as the distance covered and calories burnt. It’s pretty neat and you get a statistical chart of how your day has stacked up compared to the previous day, week or month. You can set a profile where you specify your sex (this is another indication that Titan have also made room just in case women want to wear the watch), height, weight and also a step target. It can also notify you of your progress on a regular programmed basis. The sad part is that it isn’t really acccurate. We had the tracker count steps even as we were sitting in the car without too bumpy a road. So while it can be used as a rough scale of your physical activities, it isn’t probably your best bet for proper training. Battery Life The battery life is one of the aspects for concern in most smartwatches since manufacturers prefer to put in tiny batteries in order to go for a slimmer and sleeker design. Titan refused to do that and have bundled a massive 450mAh battery (Massive in smartwatch standards at least) into the watch body. Titan had promised a battery life of 36 hours when using the smartwatch with notification and the bring to see feature. In real life, we found this claim to be more or less true. While most smartwaches would’ve definitely died after a day of use if not before, the JUXT Pro kept pushing and I was able to muster around 38 hours of use with step tracking, notifications etc which is quite impressive. It also has an impressive standby time of around 7 days. The battery life does drop significantly when you leave the display on always but then again that is the case with every smartwatch and it would be sort of pointless and moreover distracting to leave it on always. Charging requires you to place the smartwatch into the dock since it is waterproof. There are 3 pins which need to be aligned with the ones on the dock. Once you do that, you can plug in just about any microUSB cable in order to charge the watch. Conclusion The Titan JUXT Pro is certainly one of the better smartwatches on the market. While it is smart and offers a lot of functionality, it emphasises more on being a watch rather than smart. It is one of the most premium smartwatches that we have tried in terms of design but functionality wise, I don’t think I can say the same. Sure, the Titan Safety feature is something unique but rest of the features don’t really stand out. If you are getting a smartwatch primarily for its fitness tracking abilities then you are better looking elsewhere since it isn’t very accurate. But if you want one to make a style statement while also being able to enjoy the occasional notification and perks of owning a smartwatch, then this is worth the buy at Rs 22,995.

Nearly every major tech company, car company and ride services company, it seems, is developing or partnering with developers of self-driving technology, from Google parent Alphabet to Tesla Motors, General Motors and Uber Technologies, creating an insatiable demand for the people teaching the machines to think. In about a year's time, a Lincoln sedan will be driving itself from Mountain View to San Francisco, using software developed by 250 or so students enrolled at education startup Udacity, if all goes according to plan. Udacity bought the Lincoln already equipped with the digital interface needed in autonomous vehicles; students will write the code. Udacity's course, which costs $2,400 for three, 12-week terms, starts next month and was designed by company co-founder Sebastian Thrun, who launched Google's driverless car program. World's first self-driving taxis debut in Singapore The world's first self-driving taxis will be picking up passengers in Singapore starting Thursday. Select members of the public will be able to hail a free ride through their smartphones in taxis operated by nuTonomy, an autonomous vehicle software startup. Self-driving truck startup Otto, recently acquired by Uber Technologies, automaker Mercedes-Benz and chip maker Nvidia contributed to Udacity's curriculum. "If you go through this curriculum you are on the bleeding edge of self-driving cars," said Thrun. Fast-track to jobs? The aim of the program is a faster path to employment, Thrun said, in a career that has an average salary of $138,000. Mercedes-Benz, Chinese ride-service Didi Chuxing and others agreed to consider Udacity graduates for job openings. The employer pool is growing quickly. Research firm and venture capital database CB Insights has identified 33 corporations working on autonomous cars, including auto makers GM and Volvo, internet giants Baidu and Google, and Silicon Valley companies tech firm Intel and startup ride-service Lyft. GM for one is hiring dozens of engineers in the area, and Uber is looking to fill more than 50 positions in Pittsburgh, where the company is building a fleet of self-driving cars, according to jobs website Glassdoor. "I love people with MIT and Stanford degrees," Thrun said. But "there are a lot of people who can't make it to those institutions. There are entire generations of people who are equally smart and equally capable." Yet the idea that a certificate from an online training program would secure a job in one of the most difficult emerging technologies strikes some recruiters as very unlikely. A master's degree in computer science from a leading university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University is the usual, and still preferred, course. "You'd be hard-pressed to say the Udacity candidate is going to be more qualified because they have some specific knowledge about self-driving cars, versus someone who has a rock-hard degree in computer science or data science," said Dave Carvajal, chief executive of recruiting firm Dave Partners, which fills executive jobs at venture-backed tech companies. Hungry for talent With a scarcity of talent in the workforce, companies have been recruiting directly from universities with strong programs in data science, robotics and machine learning. Carnegie Mellon University suffered an exodus of staff last year after Uber hired away 40 faculty and researchers for its Advanced Technologies Center. Ford, Baidu invest $150 million in self-driving technology company Ford Motor and Baidu, the Chinese search engine giant, have jointly invested $150 million in Velodyne, which makes a key component in self-driving cars as Ford ramps up development in the autonomous field. Startups, too, are sparring to build autonomous vehicle staff. Varden Labs, a company of fewer than 15 people working on self-driving car technology, is "hiring aggressively" although the field is "very competitive," said co-founder Alex Rodrigues. Technology companies frequently bemoan their struggle to hire qualified engineers, but the challenge is more pronounced in autonomous vehicles, which combines complex technologies such as machine learning and computer vision, and applies them to cars. Startups in particular are struggling to hire against powerhouses such as Apple and Google, say recruiters. "The startups will have to get by with one, two, three or four people who can do it," said Dan Portillo, talent partner at venture firm Greylock Partners. But a small team may be enough for startup success. GM in March purchased Cruise Automation, a three-year-old autonomous vehicle startup with about 40 employees, for about $1 billion. Uber last month agreed to buy Otto, which is less than a year old, in a deal valued at $680 million. "Early hires are making unbelievable amounts of money in a few short years," Rodrigues said.

For example, in our case scientists from Darmstadt University in Germany and Intel Labs have decided that aimlessly stealing cars and running over people for no apparent reason in Grand Theft Auto needs to serve a higher purpose. This is because they came up with a neat way of getting data from GTA and using it to teach autonomous cars to better operate on real roads. The researchers argue that data from modern computer games can be “almost as good, or sometimes even better” than real data, while using it is also infinitely cheaper than gathering real-world visual data. The developers cooked a new software which classifies different objects on the roads in the game. So far 25,000 frames from the computer game have been extracted, with various weather conditions and at different moments of the day. Annotating them only took 49 hours in total – the process would have lasted days with real-world data. The data is then used to have the vehicles learn the difference between humans and other objects throughout the environment, which in turn makes autonomous cars smarter and safer.   Related Tweet Share Share 2017 Volkswagen e-Golf packs more power and better range November 18, 2016 The 2017 Rezvani Beast Alpha has arrived November 17, 2016 LA Auto Show: Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio November 16, 2016 LA Auto Show: Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet November 16, 2016 LA Auto Show: 2017 Lamborghini Huracan LP 580-2 Spyder November 16, 2016 Recent Posts Mercedes delivers the British Queen’s Christmas tree Toyota envisions heavy duty fuel cell use for commercial trucks Subaru Viziv-7 Concept paves way for large SUV in Los Angeles Toyota kickstarts battery electric development with new venture company We want to live like this – oldest Mustang GT driver is 97 Most Popular Now List of World record highways 10 Busiest Junctions in the world McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Hamilton-to-Ferrari rumours fire in Bahrain Ferrari re-opens door to working with Red Bull Bottas signs deal to replace Raikkonen – report 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show LIVE: 2016 Skoda Superb Combi… Latest Galeries Receive Our Newsletter Subscribe to RSS Follow us on Social Media News All the news ordered by time Industry Technology Tuners Videos Safety Car Crashes Concepts Spy Photos IN DEPTH Motor Shows Motor Sport Test Drive Editors Choice Automakers Acura Alfa Romeo Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Bugatti Buick Cadillac Caterharm Chevrolet Chrysler Citroen Dacia Dodge Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford GMC Holden Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Jaguar Jeep Kia Koenigsegg Lamborghini Lancia Land Rover Lexus Lotus Lincoln McLaren Maserati Mazda Mayback Mercede-Benz Mini Mitshubishi Nissan Pagani Peugeot Porsche Opel RAM Renault Rolls Royce Saab Saturn Scion Seat Skoda Spyker Subaru Suzuki Tata Tesla Vauxhall Volkswagen Toyota Volvo Others Copyright © 2016 — INAUTONEWS.

No More Ransom is an alliance of cops and anti-malware experts including McAfee and soon-to-be-former parent company Intel, Kaspersky Labs, Europol's EC3 cybercrime division, and Dutch police. The group has uploaded thousands of decryption keys and tools to help users avoid paying ransom to net scum who use malware to encrypt precious files demanding cash to revert the damage. The alliance formalises what had been a scattered and silo-ed, but furious effort by legendary malware researchers to lay waste to scores of ransomware variants, leaving a scant few including the latest Cryptxxx and Cryptowall unbroken. Security researcher Utku Sen went as far as to upload a deliberately-weakened ransomware blueprint to Github under the guise of a proof-of-concept in a successful bid to demoralise ransomware scum who built on his work. Jornt v.d. Wiel, a researcher with Kaspersky's elite GReAT threat team, announced the figures and revealed that as of yesterday 822 Coinvault and 941 Shade ransomware victims have been liberated. A further 700 ransomware victims have been assisted, bringing the total to 2463. The initiative is certain to have saved victims thousands of dollars, the pain of restoring data and formatting drives (or figuring out to get one's hands on a Bitcoin). Researchers recently scalped the Wildfire ransomware uploading more than 1600 decryption keys to the initative. Victims who cannot decrypt their ransomware infections should also try Trend Micro's continually updated decryption tool which recently added the advanced Ceber ransomware to the list of malware it can neuter. Criminals can net a conservative US$84,000 a month slinging ransomware for an investment of $6000, a whopping 1425 per cent profit margin, Trustwave found last year. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Kill Flash now.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Microsoft Corp unveiled on Tuesday its first laptop, a line of Lumia smartphones, a new Surface Pro tablet and an updated version of its wearable fitness tracker, Microsoft Band, all running on Windows 10, its latest operating system. Microsoft is counting on Windows 10, launched in July, to help it win a bigger share of the market for tablets and smartphones, now dominated by Apple Inc and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Microsoft said its laptop, the Surface Book, will start at $1,499 and is twice as fast as Apple’s MacBook Pro. It will be available from Oct. 26, with preorders starting on Wednesday. The laptop has a 13.5-inch display with 267 pixels per inch and features a track pad made of glass. Microsoft, whose shares were up 0.6 percent at $46.89 at midday, said 110 million devices were now running Windows 10. The company unveiled three phones at an event in New York. The Lumia 950 and 950XL will have starting prices of $549 and $649 respectively when they go on sale in November, while the Lumia 550 will cost $139 when it becomes available in December. The Lumia 950 includes a 5.2-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor with hexacore CPUs. The Lumia 950 XL has a 5.7-inch display and a Snapdragon 810 processor with octa-core CPUs. The 550 has a 4.7-inch HD display and runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 210 processor. The new Surface Pro 4 tablet – a larger but thinner and lighter version of the Surface Pro 3 – is priced at $899 and will be available from Oct. 26 with pre-orders starting on Wednesday. Launched nearly a year and a half after its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4 features a 12.3-inch screen with 267 pixels per inch. It runs on 6th-generation Intel Core processor and has 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage. Surface Pro 4 is 50 percent faster than Apple’s MacBook Air, Panos Panay, the corporate vice president for Surface Computing at Microsoft, said at the event. LOVING IT “We’re moving people from needing to choosing to loving Windows, and these devices promise to fuel even more enthusiasm and opportunity for the entire Windows ecosystem,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the event. Microsoft suffered its biggest-ever quarterly net loss in the three months ended June 30 after taking a $7.6 billion writedown on its Nokia handset business. The company had said from the restructuring of the business would be pumped into its new flagship operating system, its fast-growing cloud business and its hardware division, which includes Xbox gaming consoles. Microsoft also said its new tablet and smartphones will come with Windows Hello, an automatic biometric sign-in option introduced earlier this year. The feature allows users to scan their face, iris or fingerprints to verify their identity and give them access to Windows phones, laptops and personal computers. Microsoft also introduced a Surface Pen, which has year-long battery life, 1,024 pressure points and comes in five colors with inter-changeable pen tips. The 950 and 950XL handsets feature a 20-megapixel rear camera, have up to 32GB of storage, 4K video and use liquid cooling technology. Microsoft said storage on the phones could be extended to up to 2 terabytes using a memory card. The Microsoft Band 2, which allows users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime, will be priced at $249 when it becomes available on Oct. 30. Unlike its predecessor, Microsoft’s entry product in the wearable technology market a year ago, the new Band has a curved display, which uses the Corning Gorilla glass 3, and has a barometer sensor to track elevation. “The event was solid and showed Microsoft has stepped up its game on the consumer device front. Now the question is will consumers buy the products,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, who attended the event. “…It is clear from presentations as well as speaking with the Microsoft team that Redmond feels that Windows 10 will help finally vault Microsoft into relevance on the smartphone landscape,” Ives said. “That said, this is going to be a long road for Nadella as Microsoft plays major catchup on this key market.” Microsoft said it was taking applications for a development kit for HoloLens, the holographic lens device that allows users to see 3D renderings of computer-generated images. The kit will be available in the first quarter of 2016 for $3,000. HoloLens, which looks like a wireless visor, gives Microsoft a stake in the emerging market for virtual and augmented reality, which is also being targeted by Facebook Inc’s Oculus. Microsoft’s shares have risen less than 1 percent since the start of the year. – Reuters Related Posts Facebook outlines measures to combat racist content FACEBOOK said on Monday that it would work with the German Justice Ministry to fight xenophobic and racist messages on the social network’s platform, bending to government pressure to clamp ...

LLVM Clang 3.9 Mostly Trails GCC In Compiler Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Software on 13 September 2016. Page 1 of 5. 26 Comments Following yesterday's GCC 5 vs. 6 vs. early 7 benchmarks, to no surprise LLVM's Clang compiler was brought up in the comments. I had already been running some fresh LLVM Clang benchmarks on this same Intel Xeon system and have those results to share now with Clang 3.8 and the newly-released Clang 3.9. This is the first time in a number of months I've carried out a large comparison of GCC vs. Clang using the latest compiler releases. For today's article are the GCC 5.4.0, GCC 6.2.0, and GCC 7.0.0 20160904 compiler benchmarks compared to LLVM Clang 3.8.0 and the new Clang 3.9.0 release. Interestingly, these benchmarks show a number of performance regressions in the generated binaries under Clang 3.9. With all of the compiler benchmarks, the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS were maintained the same at "-O3 -march=native" and all other system settings were maintained the same throughout the benchmarking process. All tests for this article were carried out in a completely automated and standardized manner via the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

The Republican-led committee released a three-page unclassified summary of its two-year bipartisan examination of how Snowden was able to remove more than 1.5 million classified documents from secure NSA networks, what the documents contained and the damage their removal caused to U.S. national security. Edward Snowden speaks via video link at a news conference for the launch of a campaign calling for President Obama to pardon him on Sept. 14, 2016 in New York City. The campaign, which includes representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and ACLU attorney Ben Wizner, looks to have the whistle blower pardoned from under the Espionage Act. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Snowden was an NSA contract employee when he took the documents and leaked them to journalists who revealed massive domestic surveillance programs begun in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. Snowden fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, to avoid prosecution and now wants a presidential pardon as a whistleblower. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) chairman of the committee, said Snowden betrayed his colleagues and his country. “He put our service members and the American people at risk after perceived slights by his superiors,” Nunes said in a statement. “In light of his long list of exaggerations and outright fabrications detailed in this report, no one should take him at his word. I look forward to his eventual return to the United States, where he will face justice for his damaging crimes.” Snowden’s revelations about the agency’s bulk collection of millions of Americans’ phone records set off a fierce debate that pit civil libertarians concerned about privacy against more hawkish lawmakers fearful about losing tools to combat terrorism. Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans pushed through a reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act last year that ended the program. There was little evidence that the phone records or other surveillance programs Snowden revealed ever thwarted an attack. Snowden is seeking a presidential pardon because he says he helped his country by revealing secret domestic surveillance programs. Separately, all members of the committee sent a bipartisan letter to President Barack Obama urging him not to pardon Snowden. JUST IN: House Intel Committee sends bipartisan letter to Pres. Obama urging no pardon for Snowden – @NBCNightlyNews pic.twitter.com/nohadX7UVo — Micah Grimes (@MicahGrimes) September 15, 2016 “The vast majority of what he took has nothing to do with American privacy,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said. “The majority of what he took has to do with military secrets and defense secrets,” Schiff said in an interview Thursday for C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers.” ”I think that’s very much at odds with the narrative that he wants to tell that he is a whistleblower.” The Obama administration has urged Snowden to return to the U.S. and face trial. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi has said “there is no question his actions have inflicted serious harms on our national security.” The committee report says that he was a “disgruntled employee who had frequent conflicts with his managers.” Publicly revealing classified information does not qualify someone as a whistleblower, the report said. The committee “found no evidence that Snowden took any official effort to express concerns about U.S. intelligence activities to any oversight officials within the U.S. government, despite numerous avenues for him to do so.” According to the committee, Snowden began mass downloads of classified material two weeks after he was reprimanded for engaging in a spat with NSA managers. The committee also described Snowden as a “serial exaggerator and fabricator.” “A close review of Snowden’s official employment records and submissions reveals a pattern of intentional lying,” the report said. “He claimed to have left Army basic training because of broken legs when in fact he washed out because of shin splints. He claimed to have obtained a high school degree equivalent when in fact he never did. “ The report said Snowden claimed to have worked for the CIA as a senior adviser, when he was a computer technician. “He also doctored his performance evaluations and obtained new positions at NSA by exaggerating his resume and stealing the answers to an employment test,” the report said. Speaking by video link from Moscow, Snowden said Wednesday that whistleblowing “is democracy’s safeguard of last resort, the one on which we rely when all other checks and balances have failed and the public has no idea what’s going on behind closed doors.” The 33-year-old addressed a New York City news conference where advocates from the American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International announced an online petition drive to urge Obama to pardon Snowden before he leaves office. The supporters called Snowden a hero for exposing the extent of government surveillance by giving thousands of classified documents to journalists. Snowden insists he has not shared the full cache of 1.5 million classified documents with anyone. However, the report notes that in June, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense and security committee publicly conceded that “Snowden did share intelligence” with his government. The report was released one day ahead of Friday’s opening of director Oliver Stone’s film “Snowden.” — Share Tweet Rate this story Recommended from the Web 95 Comments Show Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

(Investor's Business Daily) Global Equities Research is confident that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) has the capability to win machine learning or Deep Learning due to its acquisition of Nervana and XEON Phi Deep Learning processor. Following the news, the stock advanced more than 3 percent. Analyst Trip Chowdhry views machine and deep learning as a passion for NVIDIA. However, it is merely a hobby for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). In a research note, the brokerage said, "We continue to insist that the right investment framework is based on Machine Learning Practitioners framework, as we presented it in our September 11 report." The lead analyst termed the semiconductor approach as flawed. Related Link: Negative Galaxy Note Social Media Buzz Picks Up Steam Following Airline Restrictions Global Equities Research listed the following factors in favor of its opinion: NVIDIA enjoys Business and Generational Technological advantage. The company has the advantage of economics of scope and scale. Its Graphic Processing Units are deployed in SuperClouds of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS that record continued year-over-year growth of 100 percent. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s second half of the current year's Compute budget jumped 250 percent from the first half.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) New York • U.S. stocks changed course again Thursday and climbed as Apple led a big gain for technology companies and energy companies recovered some of their recent losses. Investors looked over a series of mixed economic reports as they sought clues about the Federal Reserve's intentions and the health of the economy. Technology companies made the largest gains as Apple rose for the fourth consecutive day. It's up 12 percent this week on growing optimism about early sales of its newest iPhones. Energy companies bounced back after two rough days, though the price of oil rose only a small amount. Health care and phone company stocks also climbed. Bond yields wobbled and finished little changed, a sign investors aren't sure what will happen with interest rates. VIDEOS TOP JOBS It was the fourth big move for the market in the last five days as investors try to anticipate whether the Fed will raise interest rates next week. Based on weaker producer prices and manufacturing and less spending by shoppers, they appeared to conclude rates will stay where they are for now. Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist for Voya Investment Strategies, said investors are sending stocks higher because they think the reports will make the Fed less likely to raise rates now. Some investors fear that that would hurt the economy. "They're not going to raise interest rates in September," she said. "It was kind of a mixed bag, but the bottom line is that the data's not great." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 177.71 points, or 1 percent, to 18,212.48. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 21.49 points, or 1 percent, to 2,147.26. The Nasdaq composite gained 75.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 5,249.69. Apple rose to its highest price in 10 months on reports of strong preorders for the new iPhones it introduced last week. The stock added $3.80, or 3.4 percent, to $115.57. Other technology companies also rose. Microsoft gained 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $57.19 and Intel picked up 94 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $36.56. Strong gains for technology and health care companies have the Nasdaq on pace for its best week since late June. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 33 cents to $43.91 per barrel in New York. It fell almost 6 percent in the last two days. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 74 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $46.59 a barrel in London. Among energy stocks, Marathon Petroleum rose $1.87, or 4.5 percent, to $43.74 and Chevron gained $1.08, or 1.1 percent, to $99.50. Investors pored over a series of economic reports. The Labor Department said producer prices fell in August as gas and food prices declined. Lower producer prices reduce inflation, and the Fed has said it wants to see evidence inflation is edging upward before it raises rates. Inflation has remained consistently low in recent years. Reports by the Commerce Department and the Federal Reserve, respectively, showed that retail sales fell last month and factory production decreased as well. Bond prices wobbled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 1.70 percent. Among companies in the news, Goodyear Tire & Rubber climbed after the company boosted its dividend and said it plans to return $4 billion to shareholders over the next few years. The stock rose $1.58, or 5.1 percent, to $32.39. Aerie Pharmaceuticals surged $9.48, or 44.9 percent, to $30.61 after the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of Roclatan, an experimental glaucoma drug. AMC Networks fell $1.44, or 2.8 percent, to $50.53 after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil downgraded the company because competition is growing and ratings for its hit "The Walking Dead" may weaken as the show enters its seventh season. Wells Fargo lost 37 cents to $46.15. Regulators said last week that the bank opened more than 2 million accounts that customers may not have authorized and transferred money into those accounts without their approval. The company agreed to pay a $185 million fine and says it will cut back on aggressive sales targets, but the controversy is damaging its reputation. » Next page...
