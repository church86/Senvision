Apple is expected to upgrade its 13" and 15" MacBook Pro laptops, released last fall, by the end of 2017. Rumors already point to the arrival of Intel's latest-generation microprocessors (Kaby Lake), freshly unveiled at the CES technology show in Las Vegas (USA), accompanied by a boost in RAM. According to a research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, reported by a host of tech news sites, Apple has finally decided to use Intel's latest processors in its MacBook Pro computers. When the laptops launched in November 2016, Apple surprised observers by using Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, already at large in top-of-the-range PCs from HP, Lenovo, Acer and Dell. The new processors are expected to be joined by more RAM, with up to 32GB for the 15" MacBook Pro, double the current maximum. However, this MacBook Pro update isn't expected before fall 2017. As a result, the firm's 12" MacBook is likely to be the first of the brand's notebooks to get a new Intel Kaby Lake chip, expected from Q2 2017. The laptop could also get up to 16GB of RAM, up from the current 8GB. The current-generation MacBook Pro is the slimmest and most lightweight model ever made by Apple. It stands out from competitors with the new "Touch Bar" of touch-sensitive controls replacing the traditional row of function keys. This Retina-quality multi-touch strip adapts its functions in relation to the program being used, offering quick and easy touchscreen access to the main functions of Finder, Mail, Safari, Photos, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X or third-party applications. The 13" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar technology starts at $1,799, rising to $2,399 for the 15" model. With top-spec components, the MacBook Pro can cost up to $4,799. A 13" model with no Touch Bar is available for $1,499. The previous-gen 13" model is still available to buy for $1,299, with the older 15" model at $1,999.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 17, 2017 at 8:41PM On January 26, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will report its financial results and provide financial guidance for the coming quarter and, likely, the entirety of 2017. Although the company is planning to host its financial analyst day shortly thereafter, on February 9, during which the company will go into deeper dives into each of its business units, there are still several questions I'd like to hear answered during the company's upcoming earnings call. Here are three. Will the memory business be profitable this year? Over the course of 2016, Intel's non-volatile memory business -- which builds and sells products based mainly on NAND flash and will soon begin shipping products based on its 3D XPoint technology -- has lost a bunch of money. A NAND flash-based solid-state drive. Image source: Intel.  The losses Intel has racked up here during the first three quarters of 2016 are $453 million, with more losses likely on the way during the fourth quarter. I'd like to see Intel management answer the following question: When will the memory business stop losing money and begin turning an operating profit? Indeed, if Intel just brought this business up to break even, it would add $453 million in operating profit. To put this into perspective, current estimates peg Intel's operating profit for 2016 at roughly $16.3 billion. An additional $453 million would represent approximately 2.8% operating profit growth alone, all else equal. A move into solid profitability would help even more. Update on manufacturing technology It has been a while since Intel has updated investors on its chip manufacturing technologies, and some information about the strategy and recent developments on the earnings call would be most welcome. A wafer of chips manufactured in Intel's 14nm-plus technology. Image source: Intel.  I'd like to see the company provide some insight into its manufacturing strategy for both personal computer products as well as its data center products. What manufacturing technologies does the company intend to use for what product lines/segments over the next couple of years? Some preliminary insight on the earnings call followed by a deeper dive at the company's investor meeting would be quite reasonable.  Data center growth rate? For a while now, Intel's publicly stated long-term growth rate expectations for its Data Center Group (DCG), the company's second largest business unit by revenue, is 15%. However, the company is expected to miss this target in 2016 because of a slowdown in sales of enterprise servers. Image source: Intel.  Since Intel is likely going to give its revenue growth forecast for 2017 on the call, it would be helpful if the company also provided its growth expectations for DCG in 2017 and, if it has changed, over the next five years or so. Then, during the company's investor meeting in February, Intel can go into more of the details, such as growth rate by sub-segment within the data center segment (enterprise servers, cloud, networking, and so on). It could also go into more detail on operating margin expectations, and its view of the competitive landscape longer term. There are definitely some things best saved for the investor meeting since earnings calls are generally about an hour long, but getting the expected long-term DCG growth rate out there as soon as possible -- if it has changed -- would be a good thing.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By TheresePoletti Columnist In a time when global trade, the U.S. relationship with China and technology are fiery hot-button issues, one important debate that touches on all three deserves more attention. Now, a late-term presidential examination of Chinese attempts to quickly hoard semiconductor technology suggests a line needs to be drawn, and leaves it to Donald Trump to draw it. President Barack Obama’s administration has been confronted by a wave of Chinese bids for semiconductor companies and their technology in his final term, and dealt with them on a case-by-case basis in a little-known but powerful regulatory body within the U.S. Treasury Department. With just two weeks remaining in his presidency, advisers to Obama finally released a comprehensive look that suggests at least some semiconductor technology should be treated as a state secret. “I hope it wakes up Washington to the precarious national-security problem created by ignoring the issue until now,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, president and co-founder of market-research firm VLSI Research Inc. “I look at it and say there is nothing new here, but it’s good that the government is finally becoming aware of it. It’s finally now got some attention.” Read also: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry China nominally wants companies that make semiconductors and related electronic components to feed its own burgeoning consumer-tech industry and bring down the prices on those already mostly cheap gadgets. However, the 32-page report notes that some technological breakthroughs would be very disadvantageous in Chinese hands, especially in the realms of military defense systems and security, and calls for standards that limit some acquisitions. ”The U.S. government will need to identify areas in which the diffusion of particular semiconductor technologies, or control of particular companies, poses intolerable national-security risks that cannot be mitigated through steps short of stopping their acquisition,” reads the report, written by a committee that included former top executives of Intel Corp. INTC, +2.31% Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +0.22%  , Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, +0.83%  and other chip-industry giants. The big question, though, is whether the incoming Trump administration will adhere to the recommendations in the report, which states that the U.S. should continue to allow Chinese acquisitions of smaller chip companies that have noncritical intellectual property. While much of the report could appeal to the president-elect’s stated positions, Trump could get even tougher on potential Chinese acquisitions. “I think they will be subject to more heightened scrutiny [under Trump]. There are a lot of Chinese deals pending with” the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, said Anne Salladin, a special counsel of the Washington law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and a former senior counsel to the Treasury Department.

Photo: EPA/Reuters The Trump transition team did not respond to questions about their approach to the China chip conundrum when asked by MarketWatch, but the president-elect’s stance toward China in general has been a tough one. He took aim at China throughout the election, blaming it for a downturn in U.S. manufacturing, and named noted China critic Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine economics professor and author of the book, “Death by China,” as director of the newly formed National Trade Council. Navarro also did not respond to requests for comment. China’s move to create its own chip-making industry includes a government plan to spend $150 billion in a decade to build and buy its way into semiconductors, which are the core of every electronics device and a $341 billion global industry. The state-sponsored investment effort has a stated goal of giving China “advanced world-level [semiconductor capability] in all major segments of the industry by 2030,” according to the report. Much of that push has involved attempting to buy U.S. chip companies or knowledge. Salladin noted that China had the most overall deals in front of the CFIUS, the regulatory body that can shoot down or approve foreign acquisitions, for the most recent year on record, 2014, and believes that number increased in subsequent years. China has already made some costly acquisitions in the U.S. semiconductor business, but in recent months the climate has been tougher and CFIUS has been reluctant to approve such moves. Last year, a consortium of Chinese investors called Uphill Investment Co. eventually won in a takeover battle for Integrated Silicon Solution Inc., a designer of specialized memory chips for automotive, communications and consumer electronics products. Uphill outbid rival Cypress Semiconductor Corp. CY, +5.99% and the approximately $765 million deal was ultimately approved after an extended review by CFIUS, which gave it a final go-ahead, finding “no unresolved national security concerns.”  Read also: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips A more recent deal in Germany was killed last month after President Obama came out swinging against an approximately $730 million deal by a Chinese investment firm to buy Aixtron SE AIXA, +0.95% a German semiconductor equipment maker, which was contingent upon approval by the CFIUS. One pending deal, a $1.3 billion bid for Lattice Semiconductor Corp. LSCC, +1.72%  by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, could be a huge early indicator on how Trump’s policies will evolve. Lattice designs field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which are finding a new home in data centers. Intel’s purchase of Altera Corp. last year was founded upon their joint venture developing configurable chips for data centers. “Lattice is the canary in the coal mine,” said Chris Rolland, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. “This relatively small deal is going to set the tone for what we might see over the next few years.” Rolland gives the deal a 50/50 chance of being approved, but he does note that Lattice’s technology is not as leading-edge as competitors such as Intel’s Altera or Xilinx Inc. XLNX, +1.65%   Just a few days after Obama blocked the Aixtron deal, 22 lawmakers wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to voice their concerns about the Lattice deal, according to The Wall Street Journal, noting that it appeared to be constructed in such a manner to “obfuscate the involvement of numerous [China] state-owned enterprises during the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. review process.” Despite national security concerns, many U.S. companies would like China to be an open and level playing field to avoid the plight of other tech companies that have had to walk away from the large potential market. But they have met the same sort of uneven enforcement that Chinese companies have so far faced: While Intel managed to strike a deal with Tsinghua University and Montage Technology Global Holdings to develop a special programmable chip that preserves the intellectual property of both parties, it also had to stop shipping chips to China for a supercomputer after the U.S. government intervened. The Obama administration’s report strikes a proper balance between keeping the Chinese market open and drawing a hard line on what type of chips and semiconductor knowledge it will allow to flow to the country. But its arrival just ahead of a change in leadership means we must wait to see if Trump will have the same approach, with the Lattice deal a critical harbinger.

US Army may need foreign weapons to keep up Annoyingly precocious teen who ruined Trek is now an asteroid More like this Apple Monopoly Qualcomm Ftc Personal Tech US watchdog sues Qualcomm for 'bribing' Apple to swallow chips Snapdragon biz broke monopoly laws, FTC claims in bombshell lawsuit 18 Jan 2017 at 00:29, Shaun Nichols America's trade watchdog the FTC has sued Qualcomm, alleging the California-based biz trampled over US laws on fair competition. The three-count complaint [PDF] accuses the chip designer of strong-arming smartphone makers (cough, cough, Apple) into dodgy deals by abusing its war chest of patents. Qualcomm designs not only the Snapdragon processors used in countless Android-powered handhelds, but also the baseband electronics needed by phones and other devices to connect to cellular networks. Crucially, Qualcomm holds a ton of patents on the common protocols and technologies used by phones to communicate. According to the FTC, phone makers were offered a discount if they just used Qualcomm's modems, effectively forcing them to pay extra if they want to use a rival's chipset. And Qualcomm crippled its rivals by refusing to fairly license and share its knowhow, resulting in features missing from competing chips, it is claimed. Thus, Qualcomm screwed over its competitors and made phone manufacturers an offer they couldn't refuse, it is alleged. According to the FTC: Qualcomm "maintains a 'no license, no chips' policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms." Basically, it is claimed Qualcomm says to its customers: if you ship products with a mix of our modems and a rival's chips, you have to pay extra royalties to us. And if you just use a rival's chipset, that chipset will be hamstrung by being locked out of modern standards that we've patented – so tough luck, get your wallet out if you want to ship a decent product. Qualcomm "refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors." In other words, Qualcomm is supposed to license its patents fairly and at a reasonable cost to anyone who adopts the standards they cover – but these licenses were withheld from rival chip designers whose baseband processors competed with Qualcomm's. That effectively locked Qualy's competitors out of chunks of the mobile broadband market – it's why Intel's XMM 7360 modem in the iPhone 7 doesn't support CDMA phone networks. (Last year, Apple decided to use a mix of Qualcomm and Intel baseband electronics in the iPhone 7: the Intel modem lacked features found in its Qualcomm counterpart due to patent licensing, resulting in Intel-based iPhones unable to use some network carriers.) Finally, Qualcomm "extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties." Qualy allegedly bribed Apple to take out a five-year exclusivity deal to use only its baseband chips in tens of millions of iOS handsets and tablets sold from 2011 to 2016. And before that, in 2007, Qualcomm also allegedly bribed Apple with rebates: if the iGiant stuck just to Qualcomm's chips, and didn't implement the Intel-championed WiMAX standard, it would get a fat refund. Funnily enough, that WiMAX standard is now dead. "By threatening to disrupt cell phone manufacturers' supply of baseband processors, Qualcomm obtains elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents that manufacturers would otherwise reject," the FTC alleged. "These royalties amount to a tax on the manufacturers' use of baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm's competitors – a tax that excludes these competitors and harms competition. "Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors." The complaint, filed in the northern district of California on Tuesday, seeks a court order that would require Qualcomm to cease all of the infringing activities or run the risk of further penalties. The FTC authorized the filing via a 2-1 vote, with commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen dissenting. Qualcomm says it will "vigorously defend" against the charges. "The portrayal of facts offered by the FTC as the basis for the agency's case is significantly flawed," the chip designer told The Register in an email. "In particular, Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC's allegation to the contrary – the central thesis of the complaint – is wrong." The words Qualcomm, patent, licensing and dispute are never far apart: the processor designer coughed up a billion dollars in China to make a row over licensing there go away, for example, and it is suing Apple, Samsung, Intel, Broadcom and others for allegedly ganging up on it in South Korea. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 23 Comments Whitepapers Hunting insider threats Insider threats are a real risk to business because they threaten both customer and employee trust.

Thought the Pentium G4560 processor would be useless? Not so fast, there... slick. In ComputerBase's testing, they used GeForce GTX 980 Ti cards in SLI at 4K, with the Pentium G4560 matching the performance of the Core i5-7600K which costs $243.

In a recently released report, GE and co-author Intel offer a comprehensive view of how the Industrial Internet – embedded sensors, data analytics and connected platforms- are helping companies increase their productivity and reducing environmental emissions to securing a cleaner and more competitive future. “We are working closely with our partners in the region, such as Masdar, Saudi Aramco, and RasGas, among others, some of the first adopters of digital solutions, to support regional economies in achieving their energy and economic diversification goals. This is part of a larger movement that includes both large companies, and start-ups, from across the industrial and tech sectors, working together on innovation and implementation to realize the dramatic economic and environmental potential of digital efficiency,” said Deb Frodl, Global Executive Director of GE Ecomagination. Overarching report findings on digital efficiency: Emerging digital solutions applied across industry can potentially save $81 billion in fuel costs annually and close the gap to reaching the COP21 goals by 30 per cent or 823 MT of carbon emissions per year, the equivalent of taking 174 million cars off the road. The key economic and environmental impact of digitization were identified as: Advertisement • Power – $14 billion in cost savings annually and a potential reduction in global carbon by 495 Mt/year • Lighting – $30 billion in saving, and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction • Aviation- $14 billion in annual saving and 45 MT/year in carbon reduction • Railway – $3 billion in saving and 19MT/year in carbon reduction • Ground transportation – $20 billion in saving and 132 MT/year in carbon reduction GE has been working with its partners on digital industrial technologies that help achieve enhanced productivity, efficiency and asset optimization. For example, RasGas Company Limited (RasGas), one of the world’s largest and pioneering producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is marking the first global deployment of Industrial Internet technologies in the LNG sector. In the UAE, Masdar is working with GE to pilot and commercialize sustainable energy-neutral advanced wastewater treatment solutions in the MENAT region, and co-develop Industrial Internet solutions to optimize efficiencies. GE is also working with Masdar to launch a co-leadership training program for women to drive innovation and talent development in the renewable energy sector. In aviation, GE Aviation and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to accelerate innovation and advanced technology around the world. In Saudi Arabia, GE has announced several new digital industrial partnerships, technologies and initiatives. The GE Saudi Technology & Innovation Center (GE STIC) in Dhahran Techno Valley is at the heart of the company’s ‘Industrial Internet’ roadmap to drive digital transformation of industry. GE Oil & Gas Digital is introducing its first Asset Performance Management (APM) solution to reside on Saudi Aramco’s business network for the Aramco Jazan Complex Integrated Manufacturing Operations Management System (IMOMS). Saudi Electricity Company has joined hands with GE, and established a Generation & Optimization Center (GOC), a state-of-the-art center equipped with hardware and software to monitor 16 SEC power plants. In lighting, Current, which brings together capabilities from GE’s LED, Solar, Energy Storage, and electric vehicle businesses, is enabling its partners in MENA to tap into a wide variety of GE offerings and optimize their energy needs across their entire operation. GE’s Industrial Internet operating system, Predix, is playing a pivotal role in providing a foundation for a range of digital solutions that improve energy and water efficiency across aviation, railways, ground transportation, manufacturing facilities, power plants and buildings. © The Saudi Gazette 2017 © Copyright Zawya.

Quadrupled in 2016 Investors are betting that AMD becomes competitive in both of its core markets after years of terrible results. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 17, 2017 at 7:00PM Image source: AMD. What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher. So what AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA. AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet. Data by YCharts. AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth. AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017. Now what There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability. But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal. 2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The company used its dominance in baseband processors, which manage cellular communication in mobile devices, to force vendors to pay elevated royalties for Qualcomm technologies, the FTC charged in a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court. At the same time, Qualcomm gave Apple favorable terms so it could supply the baseband chips for all iPhones from 2011 to 2016, according to the FTC. Among other things, in 2007 it got Apple to agree not to use WiMax, the original 4G system used on Sprint’s network, in any iPhones, the complaint said. WiMax was promoted by Intel, Qualcomm’s archrival. Qualcomm’s actions hurt competition and effectively imposed a tax on some products that was passed on to consumers, the FTC said. It’s seeking a court order to undo and prevent the company’s allegedly anticompetitive practices. In a statement, Qualcomm said the complaint was based on a flawed legal theory and inadequate evidence. “Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms,” the statement said. The company said the FTC rushed out the complaint before the new presidential administration takes office on Friday. Only three of the five seats on the commission are filled, and member Maureen Ohlhausen dissented from the complaint. Qualcomm has a vast portfolio of mobile technology patents, and licensing them is a big part of its business in addition to selling chips. Its licensing practices have come under fire before. Last month, South Korea’s antitrust agency fined the company $853 million for allegedly violating that country’s competition laws. By threatening to cut off phone makers’ supplies of baseband chips, Qualcomm got them to accept royalties and other license terms they wouldn’t otherwise have accepted, the FTC alleged. This weakened other baseband chip makers and raised costs for consumers, it said. In addition, the company has refused to license its patented technology to other chip makers even when those technologies were essential to industry standards, the FTC said. Standards groups commonly require patent holders to license anything that’s part of a standard on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. In her dissent, Commissioner Ohlhausen said the complaint never alleges that Qualcomm charged more than reasonable royalties because the commission lacked the evidence to say that.

Several Old DDX Drivers Got Updated For X.Org Server 1.19, Even Voodoo Graphics Written by Michael Larabel in X.Org on 17 January 2017 at 09:13 PM EST. 15 Comments X.Org Server 1.19 was released last November while today there was finally an X.Org developer giving some love to the older DDX drivers for those still with vintage GPUs and wanting to run the modern xorg-server. A number of the less common xf86-video DDX drivers hadn't seen new releases for "ABI 23" support as used by X.Org Server 1.19+ until Matt Turner took to getting the updates released today where as previously the ABI fixes were just residing in Git. The new DDX driver releases today include the xf86-video-tdfx 1.4.7, xf86-video-sis 0.10.9, xf86-video-mga 1.6.5, xf86-video-chips 1.2.7, xf86-video-siliconmotion 1.7.9, xf86-video-nv 2.1.21, xf86-video-glint 1.2.9, xf86-video-trident 1.3.8, xf86-video-sisusb 0.9.7, xf86-video-savage 2.3.9, xf86-video-i740 1.3.6, and xf86-video-r128 6.10.2 Aside from supporting the latest X.Org driver, some of these display drivers see some other small fixes too but none of the other changes appear really major. The change-logs for each driver can be found via xorg. There's even a few fixes to the dropped xf86-video-nv driver while generally the other updated drivers are much older, including for vintage SiS and Voodoo graphics hardware. If there's anything funny about these updates, these old drivers like 3dfx Voodoo and MGA were quicker to see a new driver release supporting this latest xorg-server video ABI quicker than there was for xf86-video-intel. The xf86-video-intel driver hasn't seen a new (development) release in two years since v2.99.917 and the last stable release was three years back, but if using xf86-video-intel Git there was the ABI 23 support last summer. We'll see how much longer some of these X.Org drivers continue to be haphazardly maintained... But hey, that's part of the beauty of open-source software. 15 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Twitter Facebook FTC charges Qualcomm with anticompetitive chip tactics The company dictated licensing terms by threatening phone makers' access to chips, the agency says Stephen Lawson (IDG News Service) 18 January, 2017 12:02 - - - - print email Comments Qualcomm strong-armed some phone makers into accepting unfavorable technology licensing terms while giving Apple a break in exchange for exclusivity, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has charged. The company used its dominance in baseband processors, which manage cellular communication in mobile devices, to force vendors to pay elevated royalties for Qualcomm technologies, the FTC charged in a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court. At the same time, Qualcomm gave Apple favorable terms so it could supply the baseband chips for all iPhones from 2011 to 2016, according to the FTC. Among other things, in 2007 it got Apple to agree not to use WiMax, the original 4G system used on Sprint’s network, in any iPhones, the complaint said. WiMax was promoted by Intel, Qualcomm’s archrival. Qualcomm’s actions hurt competition and effectively imposed a tax on some products that was passed on to consumers, the FTC said. It’s seeking a court order to undo and prevent the company’s allegedly anticompetitive practices. In a statement, Qualcomm said the complaint was based on a flawed legal theory and inadequate evidence. “Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms,” the statement said. The company said the FTC rushed out the complaint before the new presidential administration takes office on Friday. Only three of the five seats on the commission are filled, and member Maureen Ohlhausen dissented from the complaint. Qualcomm has a vast portfolio of mobile technology patents, and licensing them is a big part of its business in addition to selling chips. Its licensing practices have come under fire before. Last month, South Korea’s antitrust agency fined the company $853 million for allegedly violating that country’s competition laws. By threatening to cut off phone makers’ supplies of baseband chips, Qualcomm got them to accept royalties and other license terms they wouldn’t otherwise have accepted, the FTC alleged. This weakened other baseband chip makers and raised costs for consumers, it said. In addition, the company has refused to license its patented technology to other chip makers even when those technologies were essential to industry standards, the FTC said. Standards groups commonly require patent holders to license anything that’s part of a standard on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. In her dissent, Commissioner Ohlhausen said the complaint never alleges that Qualcomm charged more than reasonable royalties because the commission lacked the evidence to say that.

Quadrupled in 2016 Investors are betting that AMD becomes competitive in both of its core markets after years of terrible results. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Jan 17, 2017 at 7:00PM Image source: AMD. What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) gained 295% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. A return to revenue growth, a series of deals that bolstered the balance sheet, the launch of its mainstream Polaris graphics cards, and optimism regarding new CPUs and GPUs set to launch in the coming months drove the stock higher. So what AMD entered 2016 in rough shape. Revenue in 2015 slumped 28%, leading to a net loss of more than $400 million. Cash was dwindling, approaching the lower limit of the company's target range. On top of all that, AMD's core CPU and GPU products were largely not competitive with those of Intel or NVIDIA. AMD took a few steps in 2016 to raise cash, giving it some much-needed breathing room that boosted investor confidence in a turnaround. A deal to create a joint venture in China around the company's x86 server technology raised $293 million in licensing fees, with the potential for royalties on sales of chips. More cash was raised later in the year when AMD sold new common stock and convertible notes, further bolstering the balance sheet. Data by YCharts. AMD returned to year-over-year revenue growth during the second quarter and posted even stronger growth during the third quarter. The launch of the Polaris mainstream graphics cards lifted the computing and graphics segment, while strong demand for semi-custom game console chips drove growth in the semi-custom segment. Polaris hasn't been as big of a success as NVIDIA's Pascal graphics cards, at least according to Steam's hardware and software survey numbers, but it did help return the company to growth. AMD revealed some information about Ryzen, its upcoming CPU, and Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, last year, adding fuel to the fire. The market is betting that AMD will become competitive in both the high-end CPU and GPU markets when those products launch during the first half of 2017. Now what There's no question that AMD is in a stronger position than it was at the end of 2015. The top line and balance sheet are looking stronger, and Ryzen and Vega have the potential to return the company to profitability. But investors should not forget AMD's long history of over-promising and under-delivering. The Bulldozer family of CPUs launched in 2011 turned out to be a complete disaster for the company. The Fury line of high-end GPUs launched in 2015 didn't even move the needle despite AMD hyping up its use of high-bandwidth memory. And Polaris, while producing some growth for the company, has been completely overshadowed by NVIDIA's Pascal. 2017 may be different. Based on what AMD has said so far, both Ryzen and Vega have some serious potential. But if either product comes up short of expectations, the stock's impressive gains from last year could quickly vanish. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple is expected to ship some 15 million laptops this year, or 10% more than last year. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro is to “blame” for the increased interest in MacBooks. Additionally, Apple’s upcoming 2017 MacBook and MacBook Pro updates should also convince even more users to upgrade. Don't Miss: You can buy a handgun that looks like an iPhone, and cops are worried Citing Chinese-language site Economic Daily News, Digitimes says that demand is still rather high for the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The laptop is set to get even better later this year, thanks to processor upgrades to Intel Kaby Lake and support of up to 32GB of RAM. Kaby Lake’s low power consumption is expected “to trigger a replacement trend among existing MacBook users,” according to market watchers. The 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar will be even cheaper, as Apple looks to increase overall shipments. The device will replace the 13-inch MacBook Air, the same market watchers claimed. Finally, the 12-inch MacBook is also set to receive an update early in the second quarter of the year. Apple will sell a version of the laptop that packs 16GB of RAM. The Kaby Lake-based 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros are expected to hit production early in the third quarter, while the 32GB 15-inch MacBook Pro will hit production a quarter later. These details, yet to be confirmed by Apple, are in line with the predictions of KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo.

Notably, a big part of the complaint alleges that Qualcomm extracted baseband processor exclusivity from Apple in exchange for partial royalty relief. The FTC reveals that Apple entered into agreements with Qualcomm in 2007, 2011, and 2013. In the 2007 agreement Qualcomm stipulated that Apple would not sell or license a smartphone that implemented WiMax, a rival technology to LTE. Under a 2007 agreement, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm received from Apple’s contract manufacturers in excess of a specified per-handset cap. Qualcomm’s payment obligations were conditioned upon, among other things, Apple not selling or licensing a handset implementing the WiMax standard, a prospective fourth-generation cellular standard championed by Intel and opposed by Qualcomm. In subsequent agreements, Qualcomm conditioned royalty relief on Apple exclusively using their baseband processors. ----- Qualcomm and Apple entered into additional agreements in 2011 and 2013. Under these agreements, Qualcomm provided Apple large lump sum payments that constituted partial relief from Qualcomm royalties. Qualcomm conditioned this relief on Apple’s exclusive use of Qualcomm baseband processors in new iPhone and iPad models. Under Qualcomm’s 2011 agreement with Apple, Qualcomm agreed to make substantial incentive payments from 2011 through 2016, explicitly conditioned upon Apple using Qualcomm baseband processors exclusively in all new iPhone and iPad models. If, during this period, Apple launched a new handset with a non-Qualcomm baseband processor, it would forfeit all future payments and, depending on when a handset launched, could be required to refund past payments. Qualcomm’s 2013 agreements with Apple modified and extended the exclusivity arrangement set forth in the companies’ 2011 agreement. Under the 2013 agreements, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm collected from Apple’s contract manufacturers in excess of modified per-handset caps. Qualcomm’s obligation to make these rebate payments was subject to, among other terms, a new condition—that Apple neither initiate nor induce others to initiate litigation claiming that Qualcomm had failed to offer a license on FRAND terms. Qualcomm also agreed to make substantial incentive payments in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, explicitly conditioned on Apple sourcing baseband processors for new iPad and iPhone models exclusively from Qualcomm. If, during this period, Apple launched a new handset with a non-Qualcomm baseband processor, it would forfeit all future incentive payments and, depending on when a handset launched, could be required to refund past incentive payments. ----- As a result of the terms in its agreements with Qualcomm, Apple sourced baseband processors exclusively from Qualcomm for all new iPad and iPhone products that it launched over the five-year period from October 2011 until September 2016. The new iPhone 7 uses baseband processors from Qualcomm and Intel. The FTC has charged Qualcomm with violating the FTC Act. The complaint alleges that Qualcomm: ● Maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms. The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors. According to the Commission’s complaint, this is an anticompetitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors. “No license, no chips” is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose. The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks. ● Refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors. Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors. ● Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. The complaint was approved by a 2 to 1 vote. Notably, the dissenting vote was from Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen who strongly opposes the complaint. "I have been presented with no robust economic evidence of exclusion and anticompetitive effects, either as to the complaint’s core “taxation” theory or to associated allegations like exclusive dealing", says Ohlhausen. "What I have been presented with is simply a possibility theorem." You can read Ohlhausen's full statement of dissent here. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « GM set to invest another Billion Dollars at Several U.S. Plants | Main | Samsung Granted Two Distinctly Different Foldable, Dual Display Smartphone Concept Patents » January 17, 2017 The U.S. Fair Trade Commission Sues Qualcomm for Forcing Apple to use its Chips in iDevices   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Korea's Antitrust Agency Hits Qualcomm with Record $865 Million Fine for Excessive Licensing Fees to Phone Makers." South Korea's Fair trade Commission accused Qualcomm of coercing mobile phone makers, including South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Apple of U.S., to pay excessive licensing fees under unfair conditions set by the company.   The Korean FTC said that Samsung, LG, Apple, Intel, MediaTek, China's Huawei Technologies, and Ericsson of Sweden, participated in its investigation of Qualcomm.   Today Bloomberg reports on the U.S. Fair Trade Commission picking up the ball and filing a similar lawsuit against Qualcomm today accusing the biggest maker of mobile phone chips of illegally maintaining a monopoly over semiconductors used in cellphones and pocketing elevated royalties from customers.   Reportedly the filing notes that Qualcomm Inc. forced Apple Inc. to use its chips exclusively in return for lowering licensing fees, unfairly cutting out competitors, the U.S. said in a lawsuit against the semiconductor company.   The FTC further noted that Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple's business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm's competitors.   The lawsuit presents yet another regulatory challenge to Qualcomm's most lucrative business, technology licensing. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Qualcomm has argued that its licensing follows industry standards that have been in place for more than 20 years and are used by other companies.   In February 2015 China's National Development and Reform Commission levied a fine of 6 billion yuan ($975 million) on Qualcomm for charging excessive royalties for its third- and fourth-generation telecommunication technology patents.

By TheresePoletti Columnist An antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission against Qualcomm Inc. puts a dark cloud over a chip company that had managed to battle back from a steep stock drop. Qualcomm QCOM, +0.22% derives the bulk of its profits from licensing its technology, but that business has been under attack by regulators off and on for more than 10 years. In 2015, a whopping $975 million fine and royalty rate cut in China emboldened regulators world-wide. In December, South Korea fined Qualcomm $853 million for antitrust violations, saying that it used its position as a key chip supplier as a tool to convince mobile phone makers to agree to unfair terms. On Tuesday, just days before the Donald Trump administration takes over, the FTC alleged that Qualcomm is using anticompetitive tactics to “maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cellphones and other consumer products.” It also alleged that Qualcomm, in a manner similar to past behavior by chip giant Intel Corp. INTC, +2.31% INTC, +2.31% gave Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.09%  “rebate payments” of royalties, conditioned upon Apple’s exclusive use of Qualcomm processors in its devices. The FTC noted in its complaint that these agreements “effectively foreclosed Qualcomm’s competitors from gaining baseband processor business at Apple.” Qualcomm issued a statement saying the central thesis of the FTC’s complaint is wrong. “The portrayal of facts offered by the FTC as the basis for the agency’s case is significantly flawed,” the company said. “In particular, Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms.” Qualcomm’s shares fell about 4% Tuesday after news of the lawsuit hit. The company’s stock fell sharply in late 2015 as it faced resistance to its licensing practices, but has bounced back in the past year, gaining more than 40%. The San Diego company is a pioneer in CDMA technology and has patents on key innovations and underlying technologies for cellphones. It licenses its patents to cellphone makers around the world and its licensing business is far more profitable than revenue from its chipsets. In an interesting twist, the FTC decision to sue the chip maker, which came two years after its investigation began in 2014, was not unanimous. One of the three FTC commissioners, Maureen Ohlhausen, dissented, and issued what she said was a rare statement as she faced an “extraordinary situation.” She said the enforcement action was “based on a flawed legal theory” ahead of a new incoming administration, and that by its mere issuance, the action “will undermine U.S. intellectual property rights in Asia and world-wide.” Ohlhausen noted that the FTC complaint “failed to allege that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty” and “speaks to the dearth of evidence in this case.” Qualcomm also noted the transition to a new administration and an apparent hastiness of the suit. “In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm. “In fact, Qualcomm was still receiving requests for information from the agency that would be necessary to an informed view of the facts when it became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new Administration.” While Qualcomm sees major flaws in the accusations, they will likely get a full hearing. “It’s not going to go away, assuming it doesn’t get withdrawn,” Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “If it goes to trial, it will be tied up for years. They finally just fixed China…then South Korea and the FTC comes down on them. They can’t catch a break.” Rasgon noted that the company’s licensing business makes up approximately 80% of its profits and that Qualcomm really is a “licensing business,” so any changes and risks to that revenue source are closely watched. The FTC suit is yet another risk for investors to keep an eye on. Qualcomm shares have gained 40% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.66%  has gained 20.6%.

We’re still reeling over the new MacBook Pro’s incredible new price upgrade, but it looks like Apple is already preparing a new update to its flagship laptop. According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kup Apple is getting ready to release 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, with Intel’s brand new Kaby Lake processors. As written by MacRumours, the report goes on to say that production fo both laptops will start in the early third waurter around July. If you’re waiting for a price drop, it looks like you may be in luck. Kuo predicts the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the TouchBar – should be discounted this year, partly to bring it in line with the 13-inch MacBook Air it’ll eventually replace.

Despite being three years away from the end of its lifecycle, Windows 7 is no longer fit for business use, according to Microsoft Germany. The company's German division yesterday said Windows 7, which will receive regular security updates until 2020, lacks the security needed to deal with modern threats. Basic support for Windows 7 ended two years ago, and since then the operating system has suffered from higher operating costs and downtime due to malware attacks, and a general lack of support for newer hardware peripherals, according to the blog post. "Even today, (Windows 7) fails to meet the needs of modern technology and the high standards of security required by IT departments.," said Markus Nitschke, head of Windows at Microsoft Germany, quoted in the post. Support for the Windows 7 platform is due to end in January 2020, at which point customers still using the OS will no longer receive security updates or technical support from Microsoft. But Monday's blog post argues that companies not planning a transition away from Windows 7 within three years face "enormous dangers". "As we saw with Windows XP, companies should start making the switch early to avoid risks and costs later on," Nitschke added. While Microsoft counts 400 million devices running its newest operating system, Windows 10, as of December 2016, Windows 7's userbase was still double that of Windows 10, with 7 running on 48.34% of desktop and laptop devices and 10 running on 24.36%, according to NetMarketShare. Yesterday's blog post refers to services such as Cortana and Windows Ink, both new features with Windows 10. The post does not mention the extra layers of security businesses might employ to increase overall protection.   But the fact remains that Windows 7 is now an outdated operating system, and as with any older platforms, users are likely to encounter compatibility issues. The blog post points out that "Windows 10 is the only version of Windows that offers support for the latest chips from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm". Windows 7, released in 2009, was "developed for the wireless world of the late 2000s", but Microsoft said the platform is built on outdated security architectures and, since basic support ended, it hasn't been upgraded with any new features. In contrast, users on Windows 10 can take advantage of improved security through Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and Microsoft has boasted that the latest Anniversary Update was able to stamp out exploits before they were specifically patched.

PHOTO: AFP WASHINGTON: Mobile chip giant Qualcomm was hit Tuesday with a US antitrust suit alleging it abused its dominant position in the market for processors used in cell phones and other devices. The US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomm’s practices amount to “unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors,” which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency’s case as “significantly flawed,” arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. “In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a released statement. Chip maker Qualcomm fined $854 mln for violating competition laws Qualcomm, which is the dominant provider of chips for smartphones, has faced similar antitrust investigations in the European Union and China, and last month was hit with a record fine of $850 million by South Korean enforcement regulators. In the US lawsuit, the FTC said Qualcomm’s policy is to supply its processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s “preferred license terms” for patents which are essential for mobile communications. “By using its monopoly power to obtain elevated royalties that apply to baseband processors supplied by its competitors, Qualcomm in effect collects a ‘tax’ on cell phone manufacturers when they use non-Qualcomm processors,” the lawsuit said. “This tax weakens Qualcomm’s competitors, including by reducing demand for their processors, and serves to maintain Qualcomm’s monopoly in baseband processor markets.” Qualcomm’s actions have hurt competitors including Taiwan-based Via Technologies, which was acquired by Intel in 2015, and another Taiwan firm, MediaTek Inc. The suit also alleges that Qualcomm “extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties,” which prevented the iPhone maker from getting processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm to buy NXP Semiconductors for about $47 billion including debt Qualcomm general counsel Rosenberg maintained that the FTC sped up the investigation, filing the suit just days before a change in the US presidential administration and with only three of five agency commissioners in place. “This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint,” Rosenberg said. “It became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new administration.” The San Diego, California, group in 2015 agreed to pay $975 million to settle antitrust charges in China. The tech group is challenging an EU competition inquiry which could result in a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual sales, which amounted to $26.5 billion for Qualcomm in 2015.

Business Technology Qualcomm faces FTC lawsuit over patent licensing Qualcomm has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its patent licensing practices. Qualcomm Qualcomm has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its patent licensing practices. (Qualcomm) Mike FreemanContact Reporter A U.S. regulator has sued Qualcomm over the way it licenses cellular patents to smartphone makers — joining South Korea and potentially other governments in seeking to upend the San Diego’s company’s patent royalty practices. The Federal Trade Commission filed the civil lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Northern California. The company also faces investigations in Europe, Japan and Taiwan. The FTC lawsuit comes a month after the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm $865 million over patent royalties. The company vowed to fight in South Korea’s courts, calling the regulators’ action inconsistent with the facts and a misapplication of fundamental tenets of competition law. The FTC alleges Qualcomm used its dominant market share in wireless chips to get excessive royalties on key, standard essential patents, which are supposed to be made available at reasonable rates under law. The agency also says Qualcomm gave Apple rebates in exchange for being the exclusive supplier of cellular modems in iPhones from 2011 through 2015 — hurting competitors. The FTC isn’t seeking specific damages but asked the court to take steps to prevent Qualcomm’s alleged anti-competitive practices from happening again. The agency’s governing board voted 2-1 to bring the lawsuit. Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen objected on the grounds that court action is based on a flawed legal theory, will undermine U.S. intellectual property rights worldwide and comes on the eve of a new presidential administration. Qualcomm echoed those concerns, calling the FTC’s lawsuit “midnight litigation” brought as Chairwoman Edith Ramirez leaves the agency and President-Elect Donald Trump takes over the White House. “Qualcomm was still receiving requests for information from the agency that would be necessary to an informed view of the facts when it became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new Administration,” said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a written statement. “We have grave concerns about the two Commissioners’ decision to bring this case despite a lack of evidence supporting the allegations and theories in the complaint.” Qualcomm makes money not only designing mobile semiconductors, but also by licensing its vast portfolio of wireless patents on key cellular technology. While sales of wireless semiconductors generated nearly two-thirds of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue last year, patent licensing accounted for the bulk of its $5.7 billion in profit. The company’s patent licensing business has been controversial, with smartphone makers complaining that the company charges too much for its intellectual property. Qualcomm contends that its cellular technology is vital to making smartphones truly mobile. Without it, devices could not tap into the wireless Internet from virtually anywhere. Qualcomm charges patent royalties that average about 3 percent based on the wholesale price of the smartphone. The company typically licenses its entire wireless patent portfolio, which includes thousands of diverse inventions.   Regulators worldwide ratcheted up scrutiny of Qualcomm in the wake of China’s 13-month long anti-monopoly probe, which resulted in a $975 million fine in February 2015. The FTC began investigating Qualcomm’s patent business in late 2014. In its complaint Tuesday, the agency singled out Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy, which requires smartphone makers that buy the company’s wireless semiconductors to also license its patents. The FTC contends that the tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay higher royalties regardless of whether they buy chips from Qualcomm or rivals such Intel or MediaTek. “This is an anti-competitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors,” said the FTC in a statement.  Because of its dominant market position, the risk of losing access to Qualcomm’s cellular modems is too great for smartphone makers to not take a license, according to the complaint. Qualcomm licenses patents to device makers but refuses to license to rival chip firms, according to the FTC. In addition, the complaint says Qualcomm gave Apple rebates to make sure it was the exclusive supplier of cellular modems in iPhones from 2011 through 2015. “Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors,” said the FTC. During that period, Qualcomm had a significant technology advantage over rivals in performance of 4G LTE wireless data modems. Last year, Apple began using Intel for LTE chips in some iPhones as it caught up with Qualcomm. Qualcomm’s shares ended trading Tuesday down 4 percent at $64.19 on the Nasdaq.

Qualcomm echoed those concerns, calling the FTC’s lawsuit “midnight litigation” brought as Chairwoman Edith Ramirez leaves the agency and President-Elect Donald Trump takes over the White House. “Qualcomm was still receiving requests for information from the agency that would be necessary to an informed view of the facts when it became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new Administration,” said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a written statement. “We have grave concerns about the two Commissioners’ decision to bring this case despite a lack of evidence supporting the allegations and theories in the complaint.” Qualcomm makes money not only designing mobile semiconductors, but also by licensing its vast portfolio of wireless patents on key cellular technology. While sales of wireless semiconductors generated nearly two-thirds of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue last year, patent licensing accounted for the bulk of its $5.7 billion in profit. The company’s patent licensing business has been controversial, with smartphone makers complaining that the company charges too much for its intellectual property. Qualcomm contends that its cellular technology is vital to making smartphones truly mobile. Without it, devices could not tap into the wireless Internet from virtually anywhere. Qualcomm charges patent royalties that average about 3 percent based on the wholesale price of the smartphone. The company typically licenses its entire wireless patent portfolio, which includes thousands of diverse inventions.   Regulators worldwide ratcheted up scrutiny of Qualcomm in the wake of China’s 13-month long anti-monopoly probe, which resulted in a $975 million fine in February 2015. The FTC began investigating Qualcomm’s patent business in late 2014. In its complaint Tuesday, the agency singled out Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy, which requires smartphone makers that buy the company’s wireless semiconductors to also license its patents. The FTC contends that the tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay higher royalties regardless of whether they buy chips from Qualcomm or rivals such Intel or MediaTek. “This is an anti-competitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors,” said the FTC in a statement.  Because of its dominant market position, the risk of losing access to Qualcomm’s cellular modems is too great for smartphone makers to not take a license, according to the complaint. Qualcomm licenses patents to device makers but refuses to license to rival chip firms, according to the FTC. In addition, the complaint says Qualcomm gave Apple rebates to make sure it was the exclusive supplier of cellular modems in iPhones from 2011 through 2015. “Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors,” said the FTC. During that period, Qualcomm had a significant technology advantage over rivals in performance of 4G LTE wireless data modems. Last year, Apple began using Intel for LTE chips in some iPhones as it caught up with Qualcomm. Qualcomm’s shares ended trading Tuesday down 4 percent at $64.19 on the Nasdaq.

Business Technology Qualcomm faces FTC lawsuit over patent licensing Qualcomm has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its patent licensing practices. Qualcomm Qualcomm has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has been sued by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over its patent licensing practices. (Qualcomm) Mike FreemanContact Reporter A U.S. regulator has sued Qualcomm over the way it licenses cellular patents to smartphone makers — joining South Korea and potentially other governments in seeking to upend the San Diego’s company’s patent royalty practices. The Federal Trade Commission filed the civil lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Northern California. The company also faces investigations in Europe, Japan and Taiwan. The FTC lawsuit comes a month after the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm $865 million over patent royalties. The company vowed to fight in South Korea’s courts, calling the regulators’ action inconsistent with the facts and a misapplication of fundamental tenets of competition law. The FTC alleges Qualcomm used its dominant market share in wireless chips to get excessive royalties on key, standard essential patents, which are supposed to be made available at reasonable rates under law. The agency also says Qualcomm gave Apple rebates in exchange for being the exclusive supplier of cellular modems in iPhones from 2011 through 2015 — hurting competitors. The FTC isn’t seeking specific damages but asked the court to take steps to prevent Qualcomm’s alleged anti-competitive practices from happening again. The agency’s governing board voted 2-1 to bring the lawsuit. Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen objected on the grounds that court action is based on a flawed legal theory, will undermine U.S. intellectual property rights worldwide and comes on the eve of a new presidential administration. Qualcomm echoed those concerns, calling the FTC’s lawsuit “midnight litigation” brought as Chairwoman Edith Ramirez leaves the agency and President-Elect Donald Trump takes over the White House. “Qualcomm was still receiving requests for information from the agency that would be necessary to an informed view of the facts when it became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new Administration,” said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a written statement. “We have grave concerns about the two Commissioners’ decision to bring this case despite a lack of evidence supporting the allegations and theories in the complaint.” Qualcomm makes money not only designing mobile semiconductors, but also by licensing its vast portfolio of wireless patents on key cellular technology.

Shoes Training Nutrition New IronStrength Subscribe Running Shoes & Gear Wearable Tech 5 Ways Technology Will Make You Healthier In 2017 Discover the mind-blowing new tech that may change how you eat, exercise, and treat illness this year. By Markham Heid for Men’s Health Tuesday, January 17, 2017, 11:18 am Shutterstock Technology is moving forward at a breakneck speed, and health tech is no exception. Ever heard of Moore’s Law? It’s the idea that technological progress roughly doubles every two years. Moore was one of the founders of the microchip company Intel, and he came up with his “law” back in the 1970s when talking about computer processing speed. When you consider that the chip in your phone is more powerful than the computers NASA used to send astronauts to the moon, it’s hard to argue with Moore’s thinking. And when it comes to health tech, 2017 has some mind-blowing stuff in store for us. Here are some of the life-changing tech advances coming in the New Year. Subscribe Subscribe Your Fitness Tracker Will Help Keep Tabs on More Than You Ever Imagined 1/5 Shutterstock Your Fitness Tracker Will Help Keep Tabs on More Than You Ever Imagined First there were GPS Watches, and then devices that track your steps and heart rate. That was a good start. But soon we’re all going to have access to “medical-grade, wearable sensors” that can monitor more advanced health biomarkers, says Steven Steinhubl, M.D., director of digital medicine at California’s Scripps Translational Science Institute. One example that made a splash at CES® 2017: a new fatigue-sensing shoe from Under Armour. Under Armour’s new line of smart shoes will feature a technology the company is calling “Jump Test”: Take a brief timeout from your workout and jump a couple times. Your shoes will be able to gauge your level of muscle fatigue. Armed with this info, you can adjust your workout’s intensity to maximize performance gains and recovery. First Run: Under Armour’s Smart Shoes Also at CES®, a company called Lief demonstrated a new wearable skin patch capable of detecting your stress levels by tracking your heart rate variability. Lief’s app, which it developed with the help of doctors at Stanford, features a “self-regulation toolkit” to help users knock out stress. You’ll Be Able to Treat Diabetes With an Artificial Pancreas 2/5 Shutterstock You’ll Be Able to Treat Diabetes With an Artificial Pancreas At least two new devices could radically change the nature of diabetes treatment, says Bertalan Mesko, Ph.D., author of The Guide to the Future of Medicine. The FDA recently green-lighted the first artificial pancreas, which should make its way into patients with type-1 diabetes by mid-2017, he says. Your pancreas monitors your blood sugar levels and releases the hormone insulin as needed. When your pancreas goes haywire—either failing to produce insulin or mismanaging the hormone’s release—diabetes results. The new artificial pancreas implant—made by a company called Medtronic—“basically replicates what a healthy version of the organ does on its own,” Mesko says. The second device is a smart contact lens—developed by Google—that can track a diabetes sufferer’s blood sugar levels by monitoring the chemistry of his tears. Mesko says the lenses should be ready for trials this year. Your Surgeon Will Use Augmented Reality to Zero In on Tumors 3/5 Shutterstock Your Surgeon Will Use Augmented Reality to Zero In on Tumors Using “augmented reality” and 3-D visualization, surgeons will be more precise when performing complex and dangerous procedures, says Michael Roizen, M.D., chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. Just one example: When removing cancer-riddled tumor cells, a surgeon using augmented reality will be able to see exactly which cells contain normal DNA and which contain cancer mutations. “The surgeon will see the cancer cells as a different color than the normal cells,” Dr. Roizen explains. As a result, patients will be less likely to suffer lasting dysfunction or cancer recurrence. You’ll Protect Your Heart by Treating Your Gut Bacteria 4/5 Shutterstock You’ll Protect Your Heart by Treating Your Gut Bacteria Your body—and especially your gut—is home to a vast and complex ecosystem of microorganisms known as your microbiome. Your microbiome touches every aspect of your health. “Mental illness, stress, anxiety, obesity—all seem to be caused by gut bacteria and their waste products,” Dr. Roizen explains. Related: Lose Weight and Fight Disease by Hacking Your Gut Bacteria He says new medications coming in 2017 should help strengthen your microbiome in ways that prevent these and other major diseases. One example: “We know that a substance in extra virgin olive oil prevents gut bacteria from producing inflammation in the body,” he says. “But the problem is you’d have to swallow a lot of extra virgin olive oil to get that benefit.” One of these new microbiome-focused meds could provide enough of that olive oil substance to knock out that inflammation, which could protect you from heart disease and other diseases. If you don’t want to wait for the meds, there are plenty of easy ways to strengthen your microbiome right now. You’ll Use Genetic Testing to Determine the Best Diet for You 5/5 Shutterstock You’ll Use Genetic Testing to Determine the Best Diet for You At-home, saliva-based genetic testing is already here. And it’s about to get a lot more helpful, Mesko says. Using the term “nutrigenomics” to describe a cross between gene and nutrition science, Mesko says DNA testing will soon be able to tell you exactly what nutrients your body requires for optimal wellness. “A smart app could let you know which food you should eat and what you should avoid at all cost,” he says. When you think about all the ways that food allergies and sensitivities—as well as nutritional shortfalls—affect how you think, feel, and function, the benefits of nutrigenomics are almost limitless. A California company called Habit is poised to be one of the first to offer this kind of service, Mesko adds. Many more are sure to follow.

Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm hit with US antitrust suit Technology Wednesday 18 January 2017 - 3:39am One of many Qualcomm buildings is shown in San Diego, California, US on November 3, 2015. Photo: Reuters WASHINGTON - Mobile chip giant Qualcomm was hit Tuesday with a US antitrust suit alleging it abused its dominant position in the market for processors used in cell phones and other devices. The US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomm's practices amount to "unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors," which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as "significantly flawed," arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. "In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions," Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a released statement. Qualcomm, which is the dominant provider of chips for smartphones, has faced similar antitrust investigations in the European Union and China, and last month was hit with a record fine of $850 million by South Korean enforcement regulators. In the US lawsuit, the FTC said Qualcomm's policy is to supply its processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's "preferred licence terms" for patents which are essential for mobile communications. "By using its monopoly power to obtain elevated royalties that apply to baseband processors supplied by its competitors, Qualcomm in effect collects a 'tax' on cell phone manufacturers when they use non-Qualcomm processors," the lawsuit said. "This tax weakens Qualcomm's competitors, including by reducing demand for their processors, and serves to maintain Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband processor markets." Qualcomm's actions have hurt competitors including Taiwan-based Via Technologies, which was acquired by Intel in 2015, and another Taiwan firm, MediaTek Inc. The suit also alleges that Qualcomm "extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties," which prevented the iPhone maker from getting processors from Qualcomm's competitors from 2011 to 2016.  Qualcomm general counsel Rosenberg maintained that the FTC sped up the investigation, filing the suit just days before a change in the US presidential administration and with only three of five agency commissioners in place. "This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint," Rosenberg said. "It became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new administration." The San Diego, California, group in 2015 agreed to pay $975 million to settle antitrust charges in China. The tech group is challenging an EU competition inquiry which could result in a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual sales, which amounted to $26.5 billion for Qualcomm in 2015. AFP Comment Now!

Professor Nguyen Mai, a prominent economist and former Deputy Chairman of the State Commission for Cooperation and Investment (now the Ministry of Planning and Investment), looks over the major achievements of the period, and the way the past can guide the country’s trade future. Vietnam’s admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO), decade ago was a natural progression of the country’s international economic integration after it had shifted to a market-based economy model. This was an important cornerstone, marking Vietnam’s deepened engagement with international economic institutions, prior to accession, Vietnam had already partnered with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. Evolving to match contemporary requirements The WTO accession meant Vietnam was required to adhere to international rules on investment and trade liberalisation, while national economic institutions needed to be amended and improved to match international principles. Also, the country had to gradually open the door of the products and services market pursuant to its bilateral and multilateral agreements with other countries, and accept decisions of international arbitrators to dispute cases. Vietnam applied to join WTO back in 1996. During the period from 1997 to 2001, government authorised agencies had to answer more than 1,500 questions from WTO member countries about the country’s legal system, and actual state of development. From 2002 to 2007, Vietnam entered into multiple bilateral and multilateral negotiations with WTO member countries and the organization itself. In the meantime, the country made constant efforts to improve its regulatory system to become eligible for WTO accession. After joining WTO, the country’s legal system was further improved to make good on its WTO commitments. These commitments had to follow specific roadmaps for each particular economic sector. Vietnam’s efforts in revising and improving the legal system around WTO accession walked a line between the country’s innovation and conservatism, between trade liberalisation and trade protectionism,  between respecting companies’ rights to do business and maintaining the old ‘ask and give’ mechanism. At the heart of these efforts was an ideological dispute between a pro-business model of governance and efforts to maintain the centrally-planned, bureaucratic state. This battle would eventually result in concrete results, particularly the 2014-ameded Law on Enterprises and the 2014-amended Law on Investment. The government also started requiring businesses to apply the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standards in taxation and ASEAN-4 countries’ standards in customs fields. But not everyone was on board with this direction. Some tried to dull this pro-business progress through imposing conditions and procedures that hampered business operations to reap their own benefits.  This is why efforts were made to retain regulations on conditional business fields, requiring sub-licence provisions. In addition to those resisting the changes, law enforcement bottlenecked around the enforcement of business practices. The preparation and implementation of WTO commitments soon became a task of foremost importance to the country. This was demonstrated in the Central Party Committee Resolution and government’s Action Programme on the issue. Once WTO accession was gained, these processes were carried out simultaneously across ministries, sectors, and localities. Organizations specific to WTO were founded to provide consultation to businesses. Many documents, including the WTO Handbook, were published. Never before had the country’s business climate shown so much life as in the months after Vietnam’s accession to WTO. These diligent preparations aroused commercial confidence in Vietnam’s future development. And now, as Vietnam engages in a raft of a new-generation free trade agreements and the ASEAN Economic Community, the lessons of WTO accession are more important than ever. Achievements in international trade and investment The global economic recession took place in 2008, causing detrimental impacts to Vietnam’s economy through slowing down economic growth and igniting high inflation. The government concentrated resources on tackling the new situation, delaying the implementation of the Action Programme on the WTO for several years. To review progress on the five-year anniversary of WTO accession, on August 14, 2012 the government convened a national conference to review the implementation of the Resolution and the Action Programme on WTO, seeking comments and issuing a government resolution on “Accelerating and improving efficiency of international economic integration during 2012-2015, with an orientation to 2020.” Expanding international trade relations through increasing trade values and the restructuring of export type are positive effects of Vietnam’s accession to WTO. Accordingly, the proportion of natural resources and raw materials in the export structure has been reduced alongside an increased percentage of manufactured products. Among manufactured products, the rate of high-tech items rose the sharpest. The rates of raw and manufactured items in the export structure were 44.6 and 55.4% in 2007, respectively. In 2015, these figures stood at 23.8 and 76.2%. Before 2012, textiles, garments, and footwear were Vietnam’s major export items. In recent years, electronic items have superseded them in the export structure. Domestic and foreign-invested businesses have made growing contributions to Vietnam’s international trade, with foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) becoming more eminent players. Local businesses contributed 42.8% to the 2007 export value, whereas the remaining 57.2% was produced by FIEs. Corresponding figures for 2015 were 29.5 and 71.5%, respectively. Vietnam’s foreign direct investment (FDI) attraction is the brightest point in the past decade. Total disbursed FDI volume was US$8.03 billion in 2007, increasing to US$11 billion in 2010 before reaching US$14.5 billion in 2015 and US$15.8 billion in 2016-nearly doubling the level of 2007. This is an important indicator reflecting Vietnam’s attraction towards FDI capital flow compared with other regional peers. The quality of FDI has also improved markedly, as scores of global tech players such as Intel, Microsoft, Samsung, LG, Nokia and Canon have all deployed large-scale projects in Vietnam, making significant contributions to restructuring Vietnam’s economy following a new growth model. The gap between committed and disbursed FDI volumes narrowed remarkably. Registered FDI volumes reveal investors’ commitment to project implementation, and best demonstrate FDI development trends. However, after the government decentralised the power onto localities and management authorities of industrial parks and economic zones, there were cases of several management agencies paying special attention to capital-intensive projects while neglecting investor quality. Consequently, myriad licensed projects were found lying idle across the country. Things saw a turnaround in recent years. Localities throughout the country reportedly took back investment certificated for hundreds of idle projects last year. Foreign-invested projects valued in the million and billions of US dollars in capital began to commission in shorter windows of time after getting investment certificates-in many cases, in less than one year. This has helped shorten the gap between committed and disbursed FDI amounts. In short, during the 10 years since WTO accession, international trade and foreign investment have been two of the biggest driving forces propelling national economic growth. They have done this through increased labour efficiency, sharpened competitiveness of local products and businesses, and an improved image of the country in the world.

Budget 2017: Can Arun Jaitley make you & economy happy? Click for our special Budget 2017 coverage WASHINGTON: Mobile chip giant Qualcomm has been hit with a US antitrust suit alleging it abused its dominant position in the market for processors used in cell phones and other devices. The US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court in California claiming Qualcomm's practices amount to "unlawful maintenance of a monopoly in baseband processors," which are devices that enable cellular communications in phones and other products. Qualcomm rejected the agency's case as "significantly flawed," arguing that reasoning at the heart of the civil complaint is wrong. "In our recent discussions with the FTC, it became apparent that it still lacked basic information about the industry and was instead relying on inaccurate information and presumptions," Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a released statement. Qualcomm, which is the dominant provider of chips for smartphones, has faced similar antitrust investigations in the European Union and China, and last month was hit with a record fine of $850 million by South Korean enforcement regulators. In the US lawsuit, the FTC said Qualcomm's policy is to supply its processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's "preferred license terms" for patents which are essential for mobile communications. "By using its monopoly power to obtain elevated royalties that apply to baseband processors supplied by its competitors, Qualcomm in effect collects a 'tax' on cell phone manufacturers when they use non-Qualcomm processors," the lawsuit said. "This tax weakens Qualcomm's competitors, including by reducing demand for their processors, and serves to maintain Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband processor markets." Qualcomm's actions have hurt competitors including Taiwan-based Via Technologies, which was acquired by Intel in 2015, and another Taiwan firm, MediaTek Inc. The suit also alleges that Qualcomm "extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties," which prevented the iPhone maker from getting processors from Qualcomm's competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm general counsel Rosenberg maintained that the FTC sped up the investigation, filing the suit just days before a change in the US presidential administration and with only three of five agency commissioners in place. "This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint," Rosenberg said. "It became apparent that the FTC was driving to file a complaint before the transition to the new administration." The San Diego, California, group in 2015 agreed to pay $975 million to settle antitrust charges in China. The tech group is challenging an EU competition inquiry which could result in a fine of up to 10 per cent of its annual sales, which amounted to $26.5 billion for Qualcomm in 2015.

This is despite the fact that the new laptops are incredibly expensive and are lacking certain features that customers have been asking for, such as 32GB RAM options. That being said despite these complaints, Apple is expected to ship more units than ever this year. This is according to China’s Economic Daily News in which it was predicted that Apple could end up shipping 15 million MacBooks in 2017. This is supposed to represent a 10% increase from last year (suggesting a higher demand), which apparently will be achieved by 2017’s MacBook Pro refresh which is said to offer up 32GB of RAM and is also apparently cheaper. Whether or not that is true remains to be seen, but combine that with the rumors of Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, it could finally be the laptop that MacBook Pro users have been asking for. That being said let’s not forget that Apple is also expected to refresh its 12-inch Retina MacBook which was last refreshed in April 2016, which means that we’ll probably be seeing another refresh in the coming months, although right now we’re not sure what we might be able to expect from it.

The complaint alleges among other things the company “precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016.” The FTC also charged Qualcomm maintains a “no license, no chips” policy that requires handset makers to agree to Qualcomm’s licensing terms to get supplies of its baseband chips. The company also refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors, the FTC said. In its complaint, the FTC charged, "Qualcomm is unique in requiring an OEM, as a condition of sale, to secure a separate patent license requiring royalty payments for handsets that use a competitors components." The FTC’s action comes less than a month after the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won (nearly $1 billion), charging unfair patent licensing practices. The KTFC levied similar charges of failing to license standards-essential patents to competitors and forcing customers to agree to unfair terms including “making them provide [the customer’s] patents for free.” Qualcomm said it will appeal both cases. It described the U.S. complaint as a politically opportunistic move that got the facts wrong and is based on flawed legal theory. “Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms,” it said in a statement. "This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez's departure and the transition to a new Administration, which reflects a sharp break from FTC practice," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen voted against the filing that passed in a 2-1 decision. In dissenting comments she said the decision was “based on a flawed legal theory…that lacks economic and evidentiary support, that was brought on the eve of a new presidential administration, and that, by its mere issuance, will undermine U.S. intellectual property rights in Asia and worldwide." Last year Apple started using Intel baseband processors in its iPhone 7, teardown reports showed in September, a fact the FTC complaint notes. “Samsung and Huawei have recently self-supplied some premium LTE baseband processors for [their] handsets, respectively, but this has not provided Qualcomm with meaningful competition in the merchant market,” the complaint said. Qualcomm dominated the 1.3-billion unit smartphone baseband market in 2015 with a 57% share, followed by Mediatek at 25% and Spreadtrum at 6%, according to figures from market watcher Forward Concepts. Samsung was in fourth place at 3% and Huawei’s had a 2% share with a chip from its HiSilicon division used only in its own phones and not for sale in the merchant market. Before it got the deal to supply an estimated 20 million LTE basebands to Apple, Intel shared last place at 1% with Leadcore and Marvell. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid $975 million as part of a settlement over patent disputes in China. The deal also cut royalty rates Qualcomm was charging in China. Regulators in other jurisdictions, including Taiwan, are also investigating Qualcomm, a Reuters report said.

Th firm said Windows 7 “does not meet the requirements of modern technology, nor the high security requirements of IT departments”. Microsoft has warned that the Windows 7 operating system is outdated and more susceptible to malware attacks that wouldn’t affect Windows 10. Head of Windows at Microsoft Germany, Markus Nitschke, said: “It provides for higher operating costs – for example, maintenance, lost working time due to increased malware attacks, or increased support requests. “At the same time, many hardware manufacturers no longer provide drivers for Windows 7, which means that modern peripherals such as printers are no longer recognised. “So Windows 10 is the only version of Windows provides the appropriate support for the latest chips from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. “In addition, many programs are already written or developed for the newer versions of Windows.” Windows 7’s extended support ends on January 14, 2020. The operating system left mainstream support in 2014, meaning that for the last two years—and next three—it only receives security fixes.

This afternoon the United States Federal Trade Commission, which has been investigating Qualcomm for possible anti-trust issues since 2014, has moved on to the next stage in their investigating by formally charging the company with multiple antitrust violations. This is the latest in a series of moves from national regulatory authorities, which has seen China, South Korea, and the European Union all fine, settle with, or investigate the company. As with the cases against Qualcomm in other nations, much of FTC’s suit sounds similar: that Qualcomm refused to follow FRAND practices on its patents, and that it used its leverage to force device manufacturers to use its modems by making competing modems more expensive via royalties. Furthermore the FTC also alleges that Qualcomm worked to prevent the adoption of competing (non-LTE) technologies altogether. The FTC summarizes their key points as follows: [Qualcomm] Maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms. The FTC alleges that this tactic forces cell phone manufacturers to pay elevated royalties to Qualcomm on products that use a competitor’s baseband processors. According to the Commission’s complaint, this is an anticompetitive tax on the use of rivals’ processors. “No license, no chips” is a condition that other suppliers of semiconductor devices do not impose. The risk of losing access to Qualcomm baseband processors is too great for a cell phone manufacturer to bear because it would preclude the manufacturer from selling phones for use on important cellular networks.   Refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors. Despite its commitment to license standard-essential patents on FRAND terms, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license those patents to competing suppliers of baseband processors.   Extracted exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors. Points 1 and 2 are fairly straightforward. If Qualcomm was not licensing their patents out at all, or not licensing them under FRAND terms, then that would allow the company to discourage the use of competing modems, either via royalties or the risk of a lawsuit for violating their patents. Qualcomm holds a number of standards-essential patents for both CDMA and LTE, with both network technologies seeing heavy use in the roughly decade-long time period the complaint covers. Similarly, once device vendors agree to use Qualcomm’s chips, Qualcomm is also accused of forcing them to accept the company’s patent licensing terms, which according to the FTC is not a standard industry practice. The end result being that device vendors would be locked into paying higher patent royalties. But perhaps the most interesting – and certainly most novel – aspect of the FTC’s complaint is specifically the company’s agreement with Apple. In their complaint, the FTC alleges that Qualcomm forged a deal with Apple specifically to prevent competitors (e.g. Intel) from getting a foothold in the market and eroding Qualcomm’s dominance. This aspect of the FTC’s complaint also extends to competing technologies, with the FTC further accusing Qualcomm of forging agreements with Apple in part to prevent the adoption of WiMax, which is now a failed standard that was overtaken by the more Qualcomm patent-heavy LTE. Ultimately in filing this complaint, the FTC is looking to force Qualcomm to halt what the commission sees as anticompetitive actions and to ensure a competitive market for cellular modems/basebands. It’s worth noting that as this is just the initial complaint, unless the FTC and Qualcomm were to settle early, this likely will be a multi-year legal battle just to prove or disprove the FTC’s complaints (and that doesn’t include any potential remedies/fines). At the same time, LTE is now well-entrenched and 5G technology is under development, so the market won’t be standing still one way or another while this case is going on. Finally, in response to the FTC’s complaint, Qualcomm has issued their own press release denying the allegations against them. Along with refuting the FCC’s claim that they withheld chips, the company is also voicing their disagreement at the FTC’s underlying legal theory and what they see as a lack of evidence. The company is also questioning the timing of the suit, noting that it comes days before the new presidential administration takes power, insinuating that the suit was filed now to get the case started before the new administration (and its appointed FTC members) took control.

POST A COMMENT 39 Comments View All Comments invinciblegod - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Ironic that the Intel who paid PC manufacturers to exclude AMD was handicapped with the same method by Qualcomm. Reply thestryker - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link In my estimation it's even worse as you're right they're doing the same type of stuff as Intel, who got caught and fined massive amounts as well as being under extra scrutiny. Unlike Intel vs AMD however there are market players with huge capital who can fight in the mobile market whereas AMD was somewhat crushed by what had happened. This could easily have relatively quick impact in the mobile space. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link "fined massive amounts" It was literally crumbs. The amount of money intel was fined and hat to pay is a fraction of the damage they inflicted and the money they made on it. As far as intel is concerned, that is a win. They already inflicted irreversible damage than rendered their sole competitor effectively and perpetually impotent, and all they received was a slap on the wrist, while getting to keep their monopoly. Reply Nagorak - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Yeah, I don't have any sympathy for Intel in this case. Turnabout's fair play, as far as I'm concerned. Reply beginner99 - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link It' did not matter at that time as AMDs fab were running 100% and they could not have produced more chips anyway. So it was kind of a dumb move from Intel. Reply Samus - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link Intel wasn't trying to hold back AMD's sales, they were trying to hold back their name recognition, particularly by restricting sales through Dell (the largest PC maker at the time) which crippled them when they ramped up production. The lost revenue during that period (they produced tens of thousands of chips they couldn't even sell around the time the Core 2 Duo launched in 2005-2006) was destructive to AMD's long term R&D and they have never rebounded with architecture or process competitiveness. As far as Qualcomm goes, it is downright damning to restrict sales of modems or other auxiliary components to an OEM that isn't buying your SoC's. It's hard to imagine they thought they would even get away with it since there are so many OEMs they've been doing this too and they all have evidence. Reply Oxford Guy - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link "Intel wasn't trying to hold back AMD's sales, they were trying to hold back their name recognition, particularly by restricting sales through Dell (the largest PC maker at the time) which crippled them when they ramped up production.

Don't forget how AMD's processors weren't using SSE2 at all with programs compiled with the Intel compiler because of the "Genuine Intel" trick. I think that led to 3DMark being drastically distorting for AMD in addition to other problems. Reply Samus - Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - link But in reality, at least those in the know (who read sites like Anandtech or magazines like CPU) knew in day-to-day tasks AMD delivered an overall better performance through the entire Netburst-generation of Intel products, and was entirely competitive with Intel up until the Nehalem microarchitecture in performance. SSE2 hurt benchmarks and some professional applications but most programs and games optimized for "Genuine" Intel didn't show substantial gains because the floating point performance of the Athlon was very competitive with the Core microarchitecture, which depended on large caches to best AMD, something sadly AMD couldn't implement, being so far behind on manufacturing technology from the revenue they gambled on having through the early 00's. I shouldn't have brought it up, talking about what Intel did to AMD is depressing. But that's why I don't have pity for Qualcomm, as they have essentially been doing the same shit to their competitors, and even potential competitors they are strongarming out of the industry. This anti-competitive behavior destroys innovation. Reply webdoctors - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Should be interesting to see what evidence the FTC publishes. These are pretty specific accusations, they must have obtained contracts signed by the relevant parties and some damning emails to reach this point. Reply Shadowmaster625 - Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - link Yet another company is punished for being too damn good.

Thank you, Dak Prescott, Zeke Elliott, Jason Witten, Jerry Jones and all the many, many players and personnel who brought fun back to football in Dallas. You provided us, your fans, with such a fantastic year for the first time in a really long time. Dallas and its fans can't wait for next year and the further success that you are all so destined for. Congratulations and enjoy your time off -- you'll need it because we expect even more greatness next season. Mollie McAuliffe, Midland Robbed of a great victory When you have a bye and then use the final regular-season game as a scrimmage, you have to use the first half of the playoff game to warm up. I predicted this. But you would think that a professional coaching staff would have enough sense to know that. The coaching staff and Jerry Jones robbed two amazing rookies of a chance of a lifetime, both in that scrimmage game and for the season. And they robbed the Dallas Cowboys fans of a great victory. Dwayne Collins, Flower Mound Heart belongs to the 'Boys Dallas Cowboys, the fans have enjoyed and celebrated your success! Thank you for the hope and community you've given Dallas. We have had a very wild, fun and memorable ride with you. We are so proud of you. My heart belongs to the 'Boys! Sign me, a Cowboys fan always -- through thick and thin. Amy Renegar Powell, Dallas Time for a Romo trade I'm a Rams fan, so I have justified hatred for your Cowboys since they always beat us. But next year, I see close to total domination by Dallas, if you'd consider trading Tony Romo to tighten up your secondary. All cylinders will be firing hot. Do you hear me, Jerry Jones? Time to think a little outside the coach's box. John Houchens, Los Angeles Keep us moving forward As we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I am struck by the sad irony of the bookends for this week -- MLK Day and Inauguration Day. I can't think of two more antithetical things than what and who these two days represent in 2017. It gives one great pause to go from a man who lived and died because he embodied tolerance, equality, unity, hope and humility to a man who embodies and espouses the exact opposite and more every day. One man helped move us forward, the other man wants to take us backward. Now more than ever, we must do what we each can in our communities for the nation and for the planet to keep us moving forward. George Dailey, Dallas/West Village Inauguration isn't coronation Re: "Toby Keith, Lee Greenwood to perform at inaugural concert," Sunday Arts & Life story. I fully support Donald Trump. However, I do not understand the need for extensive festivities paid for by me. This is being treated as a rare coronation, and not an every-four-year event. Extravagant! Doug Davis, Garland Time to act presidential I sincerely hope that once Donald Trump takes the oath of office he will begin acting like a president should. Stop the tweeting, stop acting like a spoiled child whenever someone criticizes him. He needs to take a page from President Barack Obama's playbook and start acting presidential. I pray for our country. Thelma S. Clardy, DeSoto Obama policies do not work Re: "Obama bids farewell, offers reassurance -- President returns to Chicago for emotional defense," Jan. 11 news story. President Barack Obama's farewell address in Chicago was a well-produced event but failed to disguise the fact that his policies do not work. Obama had a great opportunity to change the country for the better. I think, sadly, he squandered a lot of those opportunities as a partisan and as an ideologue. I believe he created more racial divisions since becoming president in 2008. Beverly Walker, McKinney A self-indulgent farewell Regarding President Barack Obama's self-indulgent "me me me" farewell address, one observer noted that Skynet would become self-aware before Obama does. Paul Lonsdorf, Plano Better off than in 2008 Thank you, President Barack Obama, for setting a new standard of professionalism, honesty and integrity. Thank you for setting such a grand example for your own daughters and all our children of how a president should lead and not follow. In the face of illiterate howls from our darkest, meanest elements, you remained a beacon of hope for the future. We have more jobs, better incomes, fewer terrorist leaders and far fewer of our children fighting in harm's way. We are far, far better off than we were in 2008. Thank you! Eric Foster, Gun Barrel City Naive about bathroom bill Re: "Stop the Bathroom Bill -- Governor, speaker must be stronger in opposing it," Sunday Editorials. I am writing to express my disappointment with your aggressive attack on legislation that would protect our daughters in shower rooms. Most editorials you choose to print say the bathroom law cannot be enforced. A naked man in a shower room of naked women, who says he feels like a woman, seems somewhat open to enforcement.
