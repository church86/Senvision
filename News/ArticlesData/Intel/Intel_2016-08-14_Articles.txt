Technology Intel Developer Forum Spotlights Apple-, Google-, Tesla-Rivaling Segments Intel, which held its 2016 Developer Forum in April in Shenzhen, China, holds its Developer Conference this week in San Francisco. (Intel) ALLISON GATLIN 8/15/2016 Reprints No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will follow up the BMX bikers and mechanical spiders that populated last year's Intel Developer Conference with a fresh focus this week on autonomous driving, virtual reality and machine learning. The red-hot growth drivers have Intel rivaling fellow tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla Motors (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Chipmakers are scrambling to target the next growth vector, as smartphone sales slow amid saturation. IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, with an IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Broadcom is winning, analysts say, with its penchant for M&A. Get the IBD Stock Checkup here. IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is up 10% this year amid the virtual reality and autonomous driving bonanza. Intel stock is flat for the year, but it's 6% extended from a 32.85 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 23. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel shares ended trading up 1% to 34.91. The 2016 Intel Developer Conference is set to kick off Tuesday, with CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote. The San Francisco conference will run through Thursday at the Moscone Center West. Last year, Krzanich's keynote featured a BMX biker outfitted with Intel's Curie chip, a six-axis sensor capable of capturing motion data from the handlebars and seat, as well as speed. This year, the company says Krzanich will share Intel's latest innovations and product demonstrations. Wednesday's keynotes are slated to highlight connected-world and data center/cloud infrastructure innovations. Both fit in well with the event's overarching theme -- virtual reality, autonomous driving, machine learning and the coming 5G broadband era. More than 140 businesses are expected to attend the three-day conference. On Thursday, Krzanich will also kick off the Intel SoC FPGA Developers Forum with a discussion of the importance of field-programmable gate arrays in the smart world. This event will be co-located within the Developers Conference. It will focus on FPGAs within the Internet of Things, data center, cloud computing, networking, industrial and automotive segments. Intel's FPGA unit stems largely from its Altera acquisition last year, with competitors that include Xilinx (XLNX).

[Related: Partners: Microsoft Extension Of Windows End-Of-Life Policies 'Great News'] Partners said they would like to see real-life use cases and new technology that will help them figure out how to tap into the many opportunities that IoT creates. Jon Bach, president of Puget Systems, a Kent, Wash.-based Intel system builder partner, said he hopes to learn more about Intel’s strategy around 5G – the next phase of the mobile telecommunications standard that could feed all the device needs as part of IoT – in addition to any high-performance computing news. “On the IoT side, I'd expect Intel to talk more about their 5G plans,” said Bach. “The big one, across [high-performance computing] and enthusiast, is Optane [solid state drives].  There is a lot of anticipation for that, from everything from content creation to scientific computing.” Intel over the spring outlined a future with more investments in data center, cloud and Internet of Things as it aims to lessen its dependence on the PC market. As the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company makes this shift in strategy, partners will have a more important role than ever, Maurits Tichelman, Intel's general manager, worldwide reseller channel, told CRN in June. The shift in strategy is in part because of a stagnant PC market: Intel in the beginning of the year lowered its PC market expectations, saying it expects the market to decline in the high single digits in 2016. Meanwhile, the company's data center segment, which grew 5 percent year over year in the second quarter, as well as its Internet of Things segment, which grew 2 percent year over year, are becoming increasingly lucrative markets.  "Looking at IoT and data center, there are many more new business models being developed where Intel technology can be at the core and heart of solutions," Tichelman told CRN in June. "But we want to make sure that our channel stays close to us so we can learn from our channel and can keep developing great products, not only for today but for the future."

Intel’s Andy Grove (right) shakes hands with Microsoft’s Bill Gates in Burlingame in 1992. Photo: PAUL SAKUMA, AP Intel looks for new uses for its paranoia 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Andy Grove, the renowned CEO of Intel who died in March, coined a phrase beloved in Silicon Valley: “Only the paranoid survive.” That sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides. Intel is the world’s biggest semiconductor company because when Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers. Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting the Santa Clara company’s profit. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies such as Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people. But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the Internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine. “The mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,” Brian Krzanich, Intel’s current CEO, said in an interview. From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now “where computing is constantly shifting.” Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel’s core, but Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets. The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum at Moscone Center in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what’s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world. Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years. At the Developer Forum, Krzanich will deliver a keynote speech, in which he is expected to dwell on topics like virtual reality, sensors and artificial intelligence, which was in the news last week when Intel bought an AI startup, Nervana Systems, that has technology that will be used in Intel’s data-center chips. Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. “Intel has four main business lines — PCs, mobile, Internet of things and servers — and it’s hitting on one of them,” said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now CEO of VMware. The factories where Intel builds chips “now cost $10 billion, at least,” each to set up, he said, “and the competition is catching up.” In April, Intel announced it would cut its workforce by 12,000 people, about 11 percent of workers. About a quarter of the executives who report to Krzanich come from other companies, a big deal at a place where leaders rise through the ranks over decades. In his speech, Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers’ skin. Even so, Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with New Balance. The part he is looking forward to, Kraznich said, is a one-hour question-and-answer session with 200 elite developers. “It’s a much broader group” than even a couple of years ago, he said. “People writing for machine learning and AI, networking chips, how virtual reality feeds into PCs.” Even in decline, PC chips still make up half of Intel’s revenue. If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud. Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore’s Law, is getting revised. Named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip’s power doubles every 18 to 24 months without a rise in costs. Grove’s paranoia championed and fed on Moore’s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence. Silicon Valley treats Moore’s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behavior of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips. It is changing, Krzanich said, because phones, sensors and cloud systems develop at different rates. “It’s lengthened to 24 to 36 months,” he said, and expanded into other areas. That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations seven-fold. There would be a historical precedent to that shift. Years ago, Intel’s main business was in memory chips, a market that collapsed three decades ago, leading the company to move toward making number-crunching processors for PCs. That shift, which arguably saved the company, was the lesson that led to Grove’s paranoia. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

It is changing, Krzanich said, because phones, sensors and cloud systems develop at different rates. “It’s lengthened to 24 to 36 months,” he said. “The performance of the ecosystem is much more than Moore’s Law.” That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations sevenfold. ©2016/THE NEW YORK TIMES Quentin Hardy Topics: IntelBrian Krzanichtechnologyprocessorsprofit More from this Section Shapoorji Pallonji to buy 100 acres land in affordable housing push Airlines brace for demonetisation headwinds by advancing flash sales GVK Airport in talks to raise $200 million to refinance loans Endura Mass maker Medinn Belle in talks with PE funds to sell 40% stake Lok Capital targets 5-6 investments in FY17 Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Tracking demonetisation: Our reading list India may gain from Donald Trump’s TPP pullout threat First Published: Tue, Aug 16 2016. 12 50 AM IST Latest News Maximum e-wallet transactions in 25-35 age group: data Globalization is alive and well Rupee volatility Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Latest News Globalization is alive and well Rupee volatility Final norms for insolvency professionals Kerala CM hits out at PM for refusing to meet delegation on crisis in cooperative banks Inter-state sales issue trips progress on GST Mint On Sunday The dilemma of Draupadī’s disrobing The prodigals return to Neroca US elections: How slogans can make or break a candidate Now, the crowd can bankroll your research How to maximize judicial time Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Atom chips for cars and IoT could shed ugly mobile past Intel's siloed business units unify around IoT and connectivity How Intel plans to change servers as it breaks away from PCs Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles For decades, PCs were at the center of Intel's business. Not anymore. Self-driving cars, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence are more attractive to Intel, which no longer views PCs as a priority. That's the message the company will try to deliver at Intel Developer Forum, starting on Tuesday. IDF attendees will see drones fly around and robots roaming the floor, and they will be able to try on cool wearables and VR and AR (augmented reality) headsets. Unlike past years, attendees won't be wowed with a lot of blazing laptops and desktops running upcoming PC processors. Instead, Intel will provide an insight into its internet-of-things and data-center strategies.  PCs have been at the heart of Intel's operations, but that's changing. In April, the company started rebuilding itself around the fast-growing markets of servers, IoT, and connectivity, with the shrinking PC market becoming a lower priority. It was a painful decision. The company laid off 12,000 people as part of the restructuring. Soon after, it jettisoned its pursuit of the mobile chip market, a doomed effort that cost the company billions of dollars. Top Intel executives want the water-cooler talk among their employees to be about the new areas of focus, not about PCs. If the employees buy into the new focus areas, the change to a new Intel will be swift and successful, executives have said. At IDF, the chip-maker will highlight virtual reality, IoT, and machine learning. Intel will show FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are reprogrammable chips for servers, cars, and IoT devices. "I still think we will see a little about their PC plans, but more on IoT and the data center," said Patrick Moorhead, president at Moorhead Insights and Strategy. Intel won't spend a lot of time talking about its upcoming PC processors code-named Kaby Lake, which succeed the current crop of Skylake chips. However, Intel will likely demonstrate Kaby Lake PCs because the chip release is close. Asus and HP are readying products with the chips, and Lenovo and Acer will announce Kaby Lake PCs ahead of the IFA show in Berlin next month. Intel will show off VR and AR headsets developed both internally and by partners. The company will show what seems like its version of Microsoft HoloLens, called Remote EyeSight, a set of head-worn AR smart glasses for remote collaboration. Many of the VR and AR announcements will focus around its RealSense 3D camera, which can recognize objects, measure distances, and like Microsoft's Kinect, track gestures. PCs still generate the most revenue for the company but ultimately could be replaced by data-center products like server chips and networking and storage equipment. Servers are involved in machine learning and in analyzing data sent from IoT devices, which will be a big focus at the show. Intel will announce new Atom chips for IoT devices, drones and robots. Atom chips previously designed for smartphones and tablets are being reassigned to IoT devices like information kiosks, digital advertising signs, casino machines, and ATMs. Intel is tying server chip sales to the number of IoT devices sold, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. With more IoT devices sold, more server chips will be needed to analyze information in the cloud, he said. Intel will also discuss its burgeoning AI strategy, which got a boost last week when it announced plans to acquire Nervana Systems, which offers deep-learning software and chip technology. Intel is trying to catch with its competition on machine learning. Nvidia's GPUs drive machine learning at companies like Facebook and Google, and companies like KnuPath and Numenta offer specialized deep-learning chips. Google has announced such a chip called Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which it is using internally. On the last day of IDF, Intel is hosting a sideline conference called ISDF (Intel SoC FGPA Developer Forum), which, oddly, has rival ARM as a sponsor. These sessions will be targeted at developers working with FPGAs from Altera, which was acquired by Intel for $16.7 billion last year. Intel wants to put FPGAs in servers, storage devices, cars, IoT devices, robots, and drones.

Intel Graphics Driver SVM Support Back To Being Worked On Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 15 August 2016 at 01:16 PM EDT. 5 Comments Intel Open-Source Technology Center developers are back to working on SVM support for the Intel i915 DRM driver. Jesse Barnes had begun working on SVM support several months ago, but he since left Intel. Intel's Mika Kuoppala has now picked up this work and has sent out revised patches. Jesse Barnes presented on Intel DRM SVM support back at FOSDEM 2016 to cover this pointer sharing between the CPU and GPU, pointer sharing with buffers, pointer sharing with a bufferless API, and other functionality. Those Intel SVM slides from the graphics context are here in PDF form. The revised SVM support patches were mailed out today on the intel-gfx list. Hopefully they'll be ready for merging in Linux ~4.9. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Daniel Cooper , @danielwcooper 08.12.16 in Opinion Comments 555 Shares Share Tweet Share Save If recent reports are to be believed, Jawbone is in serious trouble after missing a payment to a creditor. Sources close to the company have denied it, but this isn't the first time we've heard such rumors. The Information reported earlier this week that the firm is running out of money and has put itself up for sale. If that's the case, then I can think of the perfect suitor: Intel. After all, the chipmaker has both the money and a smartwatch division in need of a win, while Jawbone has arguably the best fitness app on the market. From the position of an armchair quarterback, it's a match made in heaven -- at least on paper. Why is Jawbone's mobile app worth saving? Up, by Jawbone, is an iOS and Android app that seems more determined than its rivals to help you develop healthful habits. The key selling point is that it will proactively do things to help you reach the goals that you've set. Motivation, after all, is the key to sticking with life changes, but most apps assume you're capable of pushing yourself every morning. As well as eschewing the usual 10,000-step target for something more tailored to your body type, it offers something beyond just inactivity alerts. Up is great for proactively identifying problems in your activity patterns over longer periods of time and suggesting ways to remedy it. For instance, if you spend a long week sitting down, it'll give you a prod to counter that laziness. Basically, the advice is more personalized than an hourly buzz to the wrist. On the surface, Up is friendly and unthreatening with clean, colorful, easy-to-read graphs. Its unintimidating design belies a hidden strength, with the more granular data hidden away unless you want to see it. If want to closely examine your stats much more exhaustively, you can do so in the trends menu, which lets you compare two sets of data against one another over time. So, for instance, if wanted to look for a correlation between calorie burn and sleep, or carbs consumed vs. resting heart rate, you could. Intel has great hardware and bad software. Jawbone has the opposite problem. Merging the two together would see two fine products become one class leader. There's also a robust social component that lets you compete with friends and colleagues in so-called duels, or just keep an eye on their progress. Many apps don't have much in the way of social features, and there's little to create a sense of community with your friends. With Up, meanwhile, Duels allow you to engage in one-on-one challenges that'll see you and a friend going head-to-head. There's also diet tracking, which is clumsy in practice, but still effective for making you more aware of what you're eating. More than once I wanted more detail on outlining portions, since it's hard to quantify "1.5 servings" of bolognese sauce. Why Intel needs it Until a few weeks ago, the Basis Peak was one of the best -- and most underrated -- wearables in the market. Unfortunately, the company found that a handful of devices were overheating and burning users' skin, which forced Intel to issue a recall. Earlier this week I outlined what otherwise made the Peak such a great device. Rather than trying to replicate the experience of a smartphone on your wrist, it stuck to the basics: fitness and sleep tracking, smartphone notifications, not to mention vibrating alarms. Hell, it was even able to automatically detect exercise down to the type of action you were doing. That made it effective and seamless, with a battery that could last almost a working week between charges. But, thanks to these overheating concerns, Peak has been taken off the market, and may never return. But what Basis can do in hardware can't be overstated: Its main issue (aside from dodgy batteries) was that its companion app was awful. As good as the watch was, the app was ugly, unfriendly and designed for gym nerds who obsessed over minutiae. Intel has great hardware and bad software. Jawbone has the opposite problem. Merging the two together would see two fine products become one class leader. Then there's the fact that Intel really could do with a hit, something that will help the company with its long-overdue reinvention. Intel's fate has always been inexorably bound to that of the PC market, and as people buy fewer desktops and laptops, its financial dominance will begin to wither. Back in 2013, then-CEO Paul Otellini admitted that it was a mistake not to build ARM-designed chips for smartphones, namely the iPhone. The move effectively tied Intel to the mast of a sinking ship and allowed Samsung, Qualcomm and TSMC to become the chipmakers of the 21st century. Earlier this year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich conceded that the company will have to fire 12,000 people as it begins to refocus. Intel is making inroads into other businesses, like consumer hardware -- wearables and drones -- as well as the internet of things. Buying Jawbone would give it a quirky, reasonably decent consumer hardware maker that could benefit from Intel's backing. It also, crucially, has the Up app, and Up is such a good piece of software that it could form the center of Intel's wearables universe. Intel is also one of the few companies that could afford to buy Jawbone. The struggling company raised $165 million at the start of the year, and at the time was valued at around a billion. Even with banks cutting their expectations for Jawbone, it'll still cost Intel a few hundred million to pick up the business, but that's pocket change for a company that still generates $1.3 billion in quarterly profit. Why this is all a fantasy For starters, spending hundreds of millions on a company to get at one component of its business makes iffy sense to most CEOs. As we've seen with Snapchat and Instagram Stories, if you're really committed to building a competing product, you can easily build something similar in-house. I'm not suggesting Intel rip off the concept behind Up -- just that it wouldn't be the first time such a thing has happened. Intel could, theoretically, hire some software designers and build a comparable app for significantly less than Jawbone's asking price. (Though to be fair, it hasn't yet.) Jawbone doesn't make much sense as an acquisition target because of the baggage it carries as a troubled company. It has constantly overpromised and underdelivered on its devices and struggled to produce reliable hardware. Search for any combination of "Jawbone," "Up" and "broken" and you'll find the internet awash with disgruntled users. The Jawbone patent portfolio isn't worth much either, now that judges have ruled several of them invalid in the company's ongoing lawsuit with Fitbit. Plus, Intel would have to deal with the messy business of deconstructing Jawbone to get at the meat it really wants. That would require layoffs (expensive, bad PR) and sales (time-sapping) that it could otherwise avoid. Plus, it would inherit a Bluetooth audio division that's tangential to Intel's current and future plans. Besides, Jawbone has reportedly already tried several times to sell its speaker arm, so Intel would likely have to sell it at a knock-down rate. Fundamentally, this is pure speculation on my part, and Jawbone has too many problems to make a rescue worthwhile. But it deserves repeating that the Up software is a great app that deserves to live on in the face of whatever corporate drama is unfolding at Jawbone. It'd be nice if some white knight would come and rescue Up from possible death. And it'd be especially nice if Intel were the one on the back of the horse.

Intel's battle for relevance USA TODAY 15/08/2016 Bob O'Donnell © Remy Gabalda, AFP Getty Images Intel has released its mid-year diversity numbers, which show only slight changes from late 2015 despite the tech company's $300 million to drastically change the makeup of its workforce. FOSTER CITY, Calif.— It’s an interesting situation. The company that arguably started and dominated the intelligent devices market for decades now finds itself in the role of an underdog, just as we’re entering an era when the number of smart, computing-capable, connected things is exploding all around us. But that’s exactly the position that Silicon Valley stalwart Intel finds itself in on the eve of its big annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF), being held in San Francisco this week. Intel’s long-term strength, of course, has been providing the vast majority of the computing brains (the CPU) for the PC market. After several years of declining PC shipments, however, that legacy advantage has turned into a disadvantage, even despite signs that commercial PC shipments could be on the rebound. Earlier in the year the company announced large layoffs and an intentional focus away from PCs, which still made up about 55% of the company’s revenues in its last quarterly earnings. One of the biggest issues is that the company infamously missed the mobile market opportunity, particularly with smartphones. For literally billions of people around the world, smartphones have become their primary computing device, and Intel has had little impact there to date, even despite purchasing cellular radio manufacturer Infineon back in 2011. Now, however, there are increasing signs that smartphone shipments have also started to peak — ironically, just as rumors are increasing that Intel may have won at least some of the cellular radio business in Apple’s next iPhone — so the race is on to discover the next big tech opportunity. The problem for Intel, and many other tech companies, is that there is no obvious choice as to what that “next big thing” will be. Instead, it’s becoming increasingly clear that there’s going to be a highly splintered range of many different, but generally much smaller opportunities in tech. In that context, Intel is expected to highlight its progress on a range of new initiatives at IDF this week, notably 5G, deep learning and cloud computing, several of which can take advantage of major purchases the company has made fairly recently. In the case of 5G, Intel is hoping to leverage not only their growing strength around cellular modems, but even more importantly, the move to software-defined network infrastructure. Major telecom carriers, such as AT&T, are aggressively working towards updating much of their core equipment as they migrate towards the new wireless standard, and that creates an opportunity for Intel-powered open hardware to replace proprietary equipment from vendors like Cisco Systems. Last week’s purchase of Nervana Systems gives Intel a much stronger presence in the growing market for deep learning applications. Fields ranging from scientific discovery to digital personal assistants to autonomous driving and much more are expected to greatly benefit from deep learning over the next decade or so. With Nervana, Intel is gaining blueprints to a new deep learning “accelerator” chip that should prove useful in cloud-based computing applications and even individual devices longer term. Speaking of cloud computing, Intel is also hoping to highlight its growing data center business and advancements from last year’s Altera purchase at IDF this week. The FPGA (field programmable gate array) customizable chip technology that Intel acquired as part of that deal is supposed to have a big benefit for several types of cloud-based applications and services, but its impact to the bottom-line has been minimal to date. Not all of Intel’s efforts to integrate new companies, products and technologies recently have been successful, however. After the company purchased Basis Science a little over two years ago, for example, they made a big push into wearables. Just a few weeks ago, the company seemingly gave up on the effort, though. They recalled all existing Basis smartwatches because of a potential defect that they were unable to fix which could cause burns on the wrist of users and offered no options for replacement. They also announced that they were shutting down the data service for the smartwatch at the end of this year. Like many other maturing tech companies, including Apple, Intel is in the process of transitioning its business from one that’s been heavily weighted towards a legacy market that has likely peaked, to one that’s more focused on smaller, but growing opportunities. The path for Intel to remain relevant won’t be an easy one, despite the company’s incredibly robust, though little-appreciated chip manufacturing capabilities. But they are making the moves to keep their presence known even after Moore’s Law becomes history.

The London Summer School focuses on health and wellbeing this year as part of an annual pan-European programme. Jonny Hancox, Health and Life Sciences Group at Intel, said: “Successful companies rely on having markets for which their products are relevant. Therefore, it is essential to have boots on the ground – teams who work with scientists, researchers, clinicians and tech start-ups to help support their activities with great computing experiences. In this way, Intel supporting EIT Digital events benefits everyone because it helps encourage the next wave of technological innovation, whilst also ensuring that computing technology is tuned to modern workloads.” The school encourages both EIT Digital Master School students and external entrants from academia and industry to apply their skills and experiences of the wellbeing market, developing a better understanding of how ideas become viable commercial solutions. UK director of EIT Digital Dennis Moynihan added: “We’re thrilled to host this diverse, creative, and vibrant set of students at this year’s London Health and Wellbeing Summer School. Having met the attendees, I’m confident that we’re looking at entrepreneurial leaders of tomorrow. On behalf of my EIT Digital colleagues, we’re proud we can play a role in shaping their future. EIT Digital is committed to helping learners build innovation and entrepreneurial skills, not only to create great opportunities for individuals but also to help ensure a strong pool of technical talent for cutting-edge European companies.” EIT Digital contributes to the EU’s Horizon 2020 principles by addressing societal challenges and funding innovation.

Used with permission In May, we reported on an Embedded Linux Conference talk by Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) Executive Director Mike Richmond on the potential for interoperability between the OCF’s IoTivity IoT framework and the AllSeen Alliance’s AllJoyn spec. We also looked at how the OCF has evolved from the earlier Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) and acquired the assets of the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Forum. Here, we examine another ELC 2016 talk about the specifics of those integrations, as well as other changes planned for the IoTivity 2.0 release due later this year. The Iotivity 2.0 talk (see full video below) was presented by Vijay Kesavan, a Senior Member of Technical Staff in the Communication and Devices Group at Intel Corp. Kesavan is a seed contributor to the core IoTivity library, and currently serves as the Business Development Task Group chair for OCF. Speaking shortly after the release of IoTivity 1.1, Kesavan told the ELC audience about plans to support new platforms and IoT ecosystems in v2.0. He also explained how the OCF is exploring usage profiles beyond home automation in domains like automotive and industrial. Joining the IoTivity Party: iOS, Windows, UPnP, and Arduino 101 IoTivity currently supports Linux, including specific Ubuntu and Android support, as well as Arduino. Version 2.0 will expand that to Windows and iOS. For iOS, the OCF is essentially doing what it did for Android: adding support in the “upper stack built on C++” rather than the lower C-based stack, in order to expose IoTivity to the iOS API, said Kesavan. The Windows integration will be more substantial. “We’re porting IoTivity to Windows so it can build upon Visual Studio 2013,” he said. New hardware targets will include Intel’s Arduino 101 board. Arduino 101 runs the Arduino IDE on the Intel-developed, open source Zephyr OS, which itself runs on an Intel Curie module based on an Intel Quark SE chip. “Zephyr and IoTivity have the same data model, but the APIs are not yet compatible,” said Kesavan. IoTivity 2.0 will also support Samsung’s Linux-ready Artik embedded modules. Integrating IoT ecosystems is a more challenging problem. Much of v2.0 is about supporting legacy UPnP devices. “We’re doing a lot of work in protocol translations, exposing UPnP devices using a plugin mechanism,” said Kesavan. “A UPnP device will essentially be discovered and seen as an OCF device.” In the future, the OCF will translate IoTivity’s REST APIs to UPnP’s SOAP/XML representations, he added. There are also plans to integrate the UPnP AV data model directly to IoTivity to support audio and video. IoTivity 2.0 will also include “some work” in interoperability with AllJoyn, although in v2.0, this work will not be as comprehensive as the UPnP integration. “There will be an AllJoyn plugin that maps AllJoyn into the OCF model and talks to AllJoyn routers, and maybe talk to some of the thinner devices like lightbulbs,” said Kesavan. Additionally, IoTivity 2.0 will include the beginnings of interoperability with EEBus, a European IoT spec for energy management in homes and smart buildings. Specific device integration will also be provided for IoT device families like Nest, LIFX, and Hue. Presumably, the Nest support would include some integration with Nest’s Weave IoT protocol, but Kesavan did not go into specifics. NodeJS and Group Management The big news for developers in v2.0 is the support for NodeJS at the API level. There will also be better group management features, making it easier to create and manage conceptual groups of IoT devices, and detailing “how you add and remove devices and add security,” said Kesavan. Other new developer-focused features will include Pub/Sub integration, more cloud extensions, and better tools and documentation. When asked whether IoTivity would expand to different transport protocols beyond its Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to support HTTP, Kesavan said there were “no plans for 2.0 but we’re looking into it.” Finally, IotTvity 2.0 will feature end user improvements including better support for “network onboarding” of tools. “This will make it easier for end users to add a device to a WiFi or BLE network,” said Kesavan. New Industrial Domains: Supply Chain, Automotive, and More For future release, the OCF is beginning to look beyond the smart home to new industrial domains with very specific usage requirements. In the shipping business, for example, there are considerable questions about how IoTivity could be modified to support asset tracking and smart logistics in the supply chain. “The industry wants to move beyond bar codes to add smart sensors that continuously monitor shipments,” said Kesavan. Sensors are being implemented first for high value goods and perishables like vaccines and food that need to maintain consistent temperature and other conditions. “Today, you don’t know about the quality of the goods until you open the box,” said Kesavan. “But if you knew the temperature threshold was being breached closer to the time it happened, you could take action earlier. We’ll see coin-cell driven sensors attached to boxes and pallets to measure things like temperature, shock, and humidity. At each step, that data can be read and aggregated through a gateway to the cloud.” Industrial supply chains present challenges like scale, density, and quality of service that are less common in the home. “If you have all these boxes all transmitting status over BLE or ZigBee, how do manage interference?” said Kesavan. “We can have gateways coordinate with each other on load balancing, handoffs, and channel allocations.” The OCF is looking into how to integrate DDS for quality of service, and how to operate on highly constrained devices. “We’ll also need to look at better security at both the device and hierarchical level,” he added. Other domains under evaluation include medical and automotive. In automotive, the OCF is working with both the Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) and GENIVI standards organizations. “The next step will be creating an automotive profile for IoTivity,” said Kesavan. “We’ll look at how you integrate wearables, and communicate between the car and a home gateway, including scheduling smart charging. We’ll look at how we talk to various automotive buses, as well as other cars or infrastructure using V2V or V2I.” As the OCF’s industrial workgroups pull together requirements for these and other domains, they need more participants with domain experience. “Please join the OCF,” said Kesavan. “We need your expertise.” Log in or register to post comments Print This Like  (0 likes) 1 Comments Comments WhizzSystems | August 16, 2016 Permalink An IoT Gateway is able to perform various tasks including the likes of device connectivity, translations of protocols, processing and filtering of data among many others.  Log in or register to post comments 1 Like Like Leave this field blank Click Here!

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date, specs: hinge to be replaced Hercules Reyes Aug 17, 2016 5:17 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)A Microsoft logo is seen at a pop-up site in New York. Microsoft is set to release a new Surface Book, called the Surface Book 2, and it is expected that the device would be delivering improvements on both its hardware and design. In terms of power and specs, it is expected that the upcoming Surface Book 2 laptop/tablet hybrid would be running under the new Intel Kaby Lake series of chipsets. The successor to Intel's current Skylake series have yet to be released but the new chipsets may come in just in time for the rumored release of the Surface Book 2 which is said to be sometime this fall. The new Intel Kaby Lake chipsets offer more power and processing capabilities than its predecessor. Due to the power of the Kaby Lake processor, the Surface Book 2 is expected to support a resolution that reaches up to 4K Ultra HD, as well as support of virtual reality (VR) gaming and highly detailed 3D graphics for gaming and video playback purposes. On the other hand, in terms of the device's new physical design, it was said that Microsoft would be ditching the troublesome hinge featured on the first generation Surface Book. The said hinge was supposed to be what would enable to device to transform from being a laptop to a tablet with full Windows 10 capabilities. However, it became one of the most criticized aspects due to the gap that the hinge leaves on the device when it is folded. It has allowed for dust and dirt to enter the device when it is stored, not to mention that some users have found the gap to be unpleasant looking, if not ugly. This would be changed, according to reports, to something called the Dynamic-Fulcrum hinge. While no word was given as to how this new design might look like, it was promised that Microsoft would be reinventing the hinge system of the Surface Book 2 and will look for more ways to improve on it.

Last year the focus was on the new Skylake microarchitecture, and this year we have down on our list a number of 3D XPoint and Xeon Phi discussions and announcements. One of the first to contact us with their IDF news was ASRock Rack, the server arm of ASRock, about their high-density Xeon Phi solution. Overview of Xeon Phi X200, Knights Landing The Xeon Phi many-core platform is transitioning from an add-in card to stand-alone processor, with the latest Knights Landing generation offering up to 72 high performance cores (now a couple of generations away from a pure Atom core) with combined high-bandwidth MCDRAM and the potential for Intel Omnipath support directly on the package. We covered the discussion and launch of Knights Landing last year at Supercomputing15, and saw some preview customer systems at Computex a couple of months ago, however the mix of ISC16 and IDF16 has most of the enterprise consumer-focused system releases surrounding Knights Landing. For a segment of Xeon Phi customers, density is important. Pack ‘em, rack ‘em and stack ‘em is the end goal, and the 2U4N-F/X200 aims to do just that. The 2U server uses half-width modules to fit in four separate systems in the chassis, each with an X200 Xeon Phi CPU, six DIMM slots with support for DDR4 2400/2133 RDIMM/LRDIMM, four 2.5-inch storage slots (either 4xSATA/SAS or 2xNVMe+2xSATA/SAS), two PCIe 3. X2 slots, one M.2 slot, a combination 1600W 80 PLUS Platinum redundant (1+1) power supply for the four nodes, two GbE Intel i350 network ports and integrated IPMI 2.0 (via AST2400) with KVM and a dedicated LAN port. P1 Socket for Xeon Phi, seen at Supercomputing15 Xeon Phi uses Intel’s P1 socket, which we saw back at Supercomputing15 and has been characterised in recent media as the LGA-3647 socket. At this point in time, Intel has only confirmed this socket for Xeon Phi use, and other use cases are not yet verified. ASRock Rack states that their platform on show at IDF16 this week will support all the main Xeon Phi X200 CPUs, and they have support in the works for Omni-path associated SKUs. Professional users interested in ASRock’s high-density platform will have to get in contact with their regional branch for more information and pricing.

Reply andychow - Thursday, August 18, 2016 - link I'm not sure if you're joking or not, but these are pin-less. The motherboard has spring loaded "pins", that are really curved strips, and the processor has little semi-spherical indentations. It's reverse what we had 10 years ago, and pins no longer get bent.

Reply mdw9604 - Monday, August 15, 2016 - link "That's what he said" Reply SunLord - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link I'll put this here also so people will actually see it but the Specs listed here are somewhat wrong compared to the asrock listed specs "2U4N-F/X200 supports totally four of Intel Xeon Phi X200 processor on each node. It is equipped with 6 of DDR4 DIMM slots per node, 2 of PCIe3.0 x8 slots and 2 of 10G LAN ports. " http://www.asrockrack.com/general/news.de.asp?id=1... Reply p1esk - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link Actually, it seems like the Asrock link has been corrected, now it says there are two GLAN ports, which I assume mean 1GbE. However, and more importantly, these processors support Intel Omni-Path networking technology, and the link mentions QSFP 28 connectors for 100GbE networking. I don't see any QSFP connectors anywhere in the pictures though. Reply Shadowmaster625 - Monday, August 15, 2016 - link Everyone knows its "pack ‘em, stack ‘em and then rack ‘em" Reply Mr Perfect - Monday, August 15, 2016 - link I'm not at all surprised that this has a VGA port on it for compatibility with existing infrastructure, but can't they offer a modern port too? It seems that we're stuck in a loop where all the consumers are using VGA because there's nothing else available, and manufacturers are only offering VGA because that's what all the consumers are using.

An example is Boston's new Venom workstation, the 2501-0P, which sports the latest Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors along with faster 2,400MHz DDR4 RAM. But that's not its only claim to fame, and there's a lot more under the hood to make workstation buyers sit up and take notice of what the 2501-0P has to offer. Thinking inside the box Often given scant attention by prospective purchasers, the chassis housing this particular Venom is surprisingly compact for a workstation -- particularly a dual-socket one. More than that, a good deal of thought has gone into the design to make it both look the part and take best advantage of what the new Xeon processors have to offer, especially through the use of liquid cooling technology. Clocked at up to 3GHz and with a TDP as high as 160 watts per processor, the v4 Xeons can get really hot, so instead of passive heatsinks, closed-loop CoolIT ECO III technology is employed with a radiator and a pair of large-diameter fans to push unwanted heat out of the top of the chassis. This, in turn, features a magnetically attached mesh cover for ease of cleaning, with another pop-out filter grill at the front of the tower servicing the needs of two more fans positioned to direct cooling airflow through the storage bays. Closed-loop liquid cooling keeps the Venom 2501-OP's powerful Xeon processors at a comfortable temperature. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet There's lots of room here, with bays for six 3.5-inch and four 2.5-inch drives plus a couple of external bays, one of which holds a Blu-Ray rewriter. You get a 1000-Watt power supply to cope with all this, complete with modular cabling to help keep it neat and tidy. The end result is a well-configured workstation that keeps its cool without being unduly noisy, generating little more than an industrious 'hum' most of the time. Performance to go Based around a stock Supermicro motherboard and Intel C612 chipset, any of the new v4 Xeons can be specified. Our review system featured a couple of E5-2690 v4 chips. Sporting 14 cores (28 threads) each, this 2.6-3.5GHz processor has a TDP of 135W and is a good choice for both demanding analytic and graphical workloads. Buyers on a budget can save money by opting for one of the more modest SKUs, while those after the ultimate in performance can splash out to get more cores and threads with 22/44 available on the 2.2-3.6GHz E5-2699 v4, for example. Another option would be a higher clock speed by opting for the 3.0-3.5GHz E5-2687W v4, although this only has 12 cores and can hit 160W and, on balance, may not deliver the same level of performance of slower-clocked alternatives. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Eight DIMM slots to take up to a terabyte of 2,400MHz DDR4 RAM are provided and, filled with 16GB ECC modules, gave us a more than decent 128GB. Together with the 28 cores and 56 threads in the Xeons, this enabled the Venom 2501-0P to turn in some impressive benchmark figures, including a score of 68733 for the 64-bit Geekbench 3 suite -- the highest we've seen for a workstation to date: Two E5-2690 v4 Xeon processors helped the Venom 2501-0P post an impressive Geekbench 3 result. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Of course, fast processors by themselves are of limited value unless the other components are able to keep pace. The graphics subsystem is particularly important here, and with no CPU-integrated graphics controller a plug-in GPU card is required. Boston uses an Nvidia Quadro M4000 as the default offering on the Venom 2501-0P. Graphics are handled by an Nvidia Quadro M4000 card. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet A mid-range GPU designed specifically for workstation applications, this graphics card has 1664 CUDA processing cores and 8GB of GDDR5 memory. It also features four DisplayPort interfaces each able to handle a 4K display (4,096x2,160 at 60Hz with 30-bit colour) and, again, performed well in our benchmarks. Running Cinebench R15, for example, it enabled the Venom 2501-0P to achieve just under 160fps (frames per second) when running the OpenGL benchmark. The mid-range Nvidia Quadro 4000 helped the Venom 2501-OP to an impressive score on the Cinebench R15 OpenGL test. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet A good choice for a wide range of CAD/CAM and other graphically intensive applications, more demanding buyers can opt for even better productivity by upgrading to Nvidia's latest ultra-quick Quadro M6000. A 2-slot card, this comes with 3,084 CUDA processing cores and either 12GB or 24GB of GDDR5 memory, making for a real beast of a GPU that can really accelerate video processing. However, it's a far from a free ride, the Quadro 6000 bumping the Venom 2501-0P's price up by a massive £3,000 (ex. VAT). Capacity and speed Boston has also opted for a slightly different approach to the storage inside its new Venom. For large amounts of data the usual hard disks are employed, the default configuration being two 2TB SATA drives cabled to the on-board controller and configured as a mirrored pair (RAID 1). The boot drive, however, is a flash SSD, which is fast becoming a standard option these days. On the Venom it's not an ordinary SSD interfaced using the on-board SATA controller, but an NVMe (Non Volatile Memory express) drive that plugs into a PCIe slot for much faster communication with the processors using four lanes of the PCI Express 3.0 bus. Intel's NVMe-based SSD 750. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Predicted to, ultimately, supersede SATA and SAS altogether, NVMe drives are only just starting to hit the mainstream and, as with any new technology, carry a price premium. As such Boston has opted for a relatively modest 400GB Intel SSD 750 for the Venom, the idea being that it will be used primarily for the operating system and high-performance temporary storage of drawings, models and other work in progress. Because it uses four PCIe lanes, the NVMe drive is rated as up to four times as quick as the equivalent SATA SSD; in our tests it really sparked up the performance of this Venom workstation. Other features worth noting include two GbE network interfaces for LAN connectivity, six USB 3.0 ports and built-in RealTek audio as standard. Together these add the final finishing touches to what in our tests proved itself to be a well-configured yet compact workstation. Capable of handling a wide range of applications, from CAD/CAM and digital content editing to high-end data analytics and visualisation, the Boston Venom 2501-0P has all the right features and high performance technologies needed to make the most of the latest Xeon v4 processors.

peteris.rocks Blog About My Dell XPS 15 Review My review of Dell XPS 15 9550 (2016) FHD 1080p Last updated on August 16, 2016 #1 on Hacker News for an hour on August 15, 2016 I treated myself to a Dell XPS 15 9550. I got it when my previous laptop had an issue with the screen after 2.5 years of use. This is my experience with Dell XPS 15 after one month of daily use. Specs Requirements Design & build Display Battery Keyboard & touchpad Summary What I like What I don't like Alternatives Conclusion Specs Intel Core i7-6700HQ 6th gen Skylake at 2.6 GHz, up to 3.5 GHz with 6 MB cache 16 GB RAM (2x8GB) 2133MHz DDR4 512 GB SSD PCIe NVME M.2 by Toshiba NVIDIA GeForce 960M 2 GB DDR5 15.6" 1080p (1920x1080 aka Full HD/FHD) matte (anti-glare) display, non touch 84W 6-Cell Lithium-Ion battery, lasts ~6-8 hours backlit UK keyboard, 1.3mm travel, no numpad, no Home/End/PgUp/PgDown keys Weight: 2 kg (4.4 lbs) USB 3.0 (2x), Thunderbolt (1x), SD card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC), lock slot, HDMI Mini, headphone 3.5mm jack You can also pay a bit extra and get a model with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD. Requirements I am a software developer and use virtual machines extensively. This is why I wanted an i7, that extra RAM and an SSD was a must. I don't play games but I've gotten into video editing and this is the reason I needed a dedicated graphics card. I also like to train some neural networks for educational purposes, so I was looking for NVIDIA graphics cards with CUDA support. Paying extra and getting a laptop with a 1080p three years ago was a very good decision. I still believe having a good screen with a high resolution is even more important than the choice of the CPU. None of my laptops have ever lasted more than 3 hours on battery power, so I finally wanted one with a good battery life. Finally, my last laptop had a good design and that's what I wanted this time as well. It had to look somewhat professional in a business setting and hopefully not like a gaming laptop. Design & build Dell XPS Infinity Edge looks very, very good. No complaints there. It is also lightweight about 2 kg. It's amazing how much power you can squeeze into such a small form factor. Imagine describing this laptop and what it can do to someone 30 years ago. This laptop has a 15.6" display but thanks to the very thin bezels, its size is more like that of a 14" laptop. The laptop is also quiet (fans are not spinning) most of the time when I'm surfing the web, watching videos and doing web programming or even light compiling. One thing that I did not expect and am very annoyed about is coil whine. It's there and I can hear it when the fans are not spinning and it's quiet in the room. Disabling Intel Skylake power saving states in BIOS seemed to reduce it somewhat but it was still there. This laptop attracts your oily fingerprints like crazy. The lid is acceptable but the carbon fiber palm rest and the touchpad can look ridiculous in day light. The screen also attracts dust but not much more than other laptops that I've had. I've gotten small, barely noticeable scratches on the sides of the laptop (mostly near the USB ports) during one month of daily use. When I shake the laptop lightly with care, I can hear something move inside the laptop. Coupled with the problems I've noticed and the fact that many other people have sent their units to be replaced, this laptop does not feel reliable to me. Display Dell XPS 15 offers a choice between a 1080p and 4k display. I got a model with a 1080p display for two primary & one less important reason: the screen was matte (anti-glare) battery lasts longer no problems with scaling While the 4k screen seems to be fantastic (excellent color accuracy, touch screen, 4k resolution), I am very happy with my choice. While the better color accuracy would have been useful, it is not that important to me yet. The touch screen is nice but I can live without it. I also don't have a use for the 4k resolution and am happy to avoid problems that come with scaling in Windows. The biggest win for me, however, was the increased battery life over 4k (reportedly extra 2-3 hours) and the anti-glare screen which I am used to. There are a few problems with the screen, however. First, the screen will noticeably flicker on white background when the brightness is less than 30%. I guess this was expected (I saw it mentioned in an online review when I noticed it). What was not expected was electric buzzing sounds caused by Intel Graphics drivers when the screen is redrawn e.g. when scrolling websites. Apparently, when you uninstall the drivers the buzzing goes away. Intel has released a new version of their drivers which makes the buzzing slightly less noticeable but it is still there. If you are in a room all alone and there is no noise and the fans are not spinning, you can hear this buzzing, other than that it is not too obvious but it's still there. I changed the color profile to the one provided by notebookcheck.net because there seemed to be something wrong with the default profile. Battery It feels great not having to take a charger with me when I go out to work (10 AM - 6 PM with a lunch break inbetween) and still having some juice left (unless I'm doing something very CPU heavy). I would say that I get about 6-8 hours of battery life. It'd be 8 hours if I just surf the web, some light document processing and not much more. Charging is fast and you can even configure it in the BIOS to have faster charging (it gets to something like 60% quick and then it's slower) but sacrifice battery longevity or just have a sensible tradeoff which is the default. The charger is very slim. It's got a nice design and it is also light. There's a light on the power cable when it's plugged in which is kind of nice which saves time when looking for it. One downside is that I'd say the light is a little too bright so I sometimes put a small napkin over it if I'm charging it at night in the same room I'm sleeping. Another minor quirk is that if you are charging the laptop while it's on, the fans will not be quiet even if there's no load on the computer. What I don't like about this laptop is that there is no indicator light that it's turned on when the lid is closed. Normally you would never need such a light, but the problem is that this laptop can wake up randomly and if it's in your bag it can overheat. And there is no way to tell if it's on. At one point I could not suspend it, it would resume automatically in 5 seconds or immediately restart when I tried to shut it down. What helped me was to hold the power button for 10 seconds and that seemed to help. It hasn't occurred again since then. As for preventing it in the future, I configured Windows 10 to never wake up automatically (disabled updates, scheduler tasks, modified battery saver plans, etc.). When the laptop is turned on, plugged in and charging three white lights are on (power button, charger cable and on the side of the laptop in front of the touch pad). Keyboard & touchpad The keyboard is not good. It's not bad but it's not good. Lots of people in their reviews have said that they would not write a book on this keyboard. Even though there is space, there are no Home/End keys and the arrow keys are tiny. I have remapped the PrtScr key to Home and the Insert key to Delete. But these keys are very far from the arrow keys which is not good for writing and editing code. One month in and I, like many others, have a squeaky spacebar key. Very annoying since I press it all the time. I've gotten some dirty looks because of it in the silent room at the library. The touch pad is very nice. Apparently, it's one of the nicest other people have used but to me it seems good just like many other track pads. Summary There were many problems that I noticed with this laptop initially, problems that should not exist when you pay this much for a laptop. As a result, while the laptop is fantastic, it does not feel reliable at all. I am worried it will not last long. I do hope I am wrong though. What I like screen touchpad design light weight powerful specs battery life charging time charger size light on charger speakers are ok quiet What I don't like spacebar squeaks coil whine screen redraw buzzing screen flicker at < 30% brightness random wake up no indicator if it's on when the lid is closed fans are spinning when charging no home/end keys tiny arrow keys keyboard is not good attracts fingerprints like crazy & also dust not super easy to open does not feel reliable Alternatives These are the alternatives that I considered. MSI GS60 Ghost Pro - gaming laptop, better graphics, worse battery, nice keyboard Asus ROG G501VW - good alternative but gaming laptop Asus Zenbook Pro UX501VW - bad touchpad positioning, no 16 GB RAM Lenovo Ideapad Y700 - cheaper but bulkier Dell XPS 15 won because it looked so damn nice. Conclusion I can't in my good conscience recommend this laptop because of the coil whine, buzzing and spacebar squeak. The laptop also does not feel reliable. If you do decide to get one, I suggest having a backup laptop ready just in case. When these kinks are fixed and they use the next generation NVIDIA graphics card, then I would recommend it with no hesitation. Other than that, it's a good laptop and ignoring these quirks and if you get a good unit it is a good looking and powerful laptop to have.

The latest Intel diversity report would appear to follow the trend of similar reports from many companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, with an increase in the number of women and minorities in employment, but not as big an increase as would have been hoped. This is despite the company’s figures showing that, since December 2014, the percentage of staff being hired from diverse backgrounds – including women and ethnic minorities – has increased by 11.5pc. At the beginning of 2015, Intel announced that it was taking the obvious lack of diversity within the tech sector seriously. with a new $300m fund, with the company’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, describing it as a “bold statement”. However, its overall representation of women among its US staff has increased by only 0.6pc in the past year, while the number of women in its newest recruits has actually fallen by 0.1pc on 2015. The biggest percentage rise among women employees within Intel has been among its senior staff, with a rise of 1.7pc. Retention proving difficult Better results have been found among what the company calls underrepresented minorities (URM) as, since December 2014, the number of URM staff hired has increased by 4.1pc. Yet in a similar trend to the number of women hired, URM recruitment among graduates and younger people has fallen by 0.4pc on last year. Also, the figure for its overall URM representation has fallen by 0.1pc on last year, but has returned to the same level as December 2014. When breaking down what URMs are being hired by Intel, it appears that, despite greater numbers of staff being hired from the Hispanic community – growing from 7.4pc of hires to 8.1pc – the percentage of Hispanic people working in the company has dropped by 0.4pc on 2015. While it is certainly not easy to turn around years of company culture, Intel has revealed that there is now 99pc pay equity for URMs, while in 2015, the company said that it had achieved pay equity between men and women.

Home About vMotion Publications @frankdenneman frankdenneman.nl CPU / Deep Dive NUMA Deep Dive Part 1: From UMA to NUMA by Frank Denneman · Published July 7, 2016 · Updated August 22, 2016 Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a shared memory architecture used in today's multiprocessing systems. Each CPU is assigned its own local memory and can access memory from other CPUs in the system. Local memory access provides a low latency - high bandwidth performance. While accessing memory owned by the other CPU has higher latency and lower bandwidth performance. Modern applications and operating systems such as ESXi support NUMA by default, yet to provide the best performance, virtual machine configuration should be done with the NUMA architecture in mind. If incorrect designed, inconsequent behavior or overall performance degradation occurs for that particular virtual machine or in worst case scenario for all VMs running on that ESXi host. This series aims to provide insights of the CPU architecture, the memory subsystem and the ESXi CPU and memory scheduler. Allowing you in creating a high performing platform that lays the foundation for the higher services and increased consolidating ratios. Before we arrive at modern compute architectures, it's helpful to review the history of shared-memory multiprocessor architectures to understand why we are using NUMA systems today. The evolution of shared-memory multiprocessors architecture in the last decades It seems that an architecture called Uniform Memory Access would be a better fit when designing a consistent low latency, high bandwidth platform. Yet modern system architectures will restrict it from being truly uniform. To understand the reason behind this we need to go back in history to identify the key drivers of parallel computing. With the introduction of relational databases in the early seventies the need for systems that could service multiple concurrent user operations and excessive data generation became mainstream. Despite the impressive rate of uniprocessor performance, multiprocessor systems were better equipped to handle this workload. In order to provide a cost-effective system, shared memory address space became the focus of research. Early on, systems using a crossbar switch were advocated, however with this design complexity scaled along with the increase of processors, which made the bus-based system more attractive. Processors in a bus system are allowed to access the entire memory space by sending requests on the bus, a very cost effective way to use the available memory as optimally as possible. However, bus-based systems have their own scalability problems. The main issue is the limited amount of bandwidth, this restrains the number of processors the bus can accommodate. Adding CPUs to the system introduces two major areas of concern: The available bandwidth per node decreases as each CPU added. The bus length increases when adding more processors, thereby increasing latency. The performance growth of CPU and specifically the speed gap between the processor and the memory performance was, and actually still is, devastating for multiprocessors. Since the memory gap between processor and memory was expected to increase, a lot of effort went into developing effective strategies to manage the memory systems. One of these strategies was adding memory cache, which introduced a multitude of challenges. Solving these challenges is still the main focus of today for CPU design teams, a lot of research is done on caching structures and sophisticated algorithms to avoid cache misses. Introduction of caching snoop protocols Attaching a cache to each CPU increases performance in many ways. Bringing memory closer to the CPU reduces the average memory access time and at the same time reducing the bandwidth load on the memory bus. The challenge with adding cache to each CPU in a shared memory architecture is that it allows multiple copies of a memory block to exist. This is called the cache-coherency problem. To solve this, caching snoop protocols were invented attempting to create a model that provided the correct data while not trying to eat up all the bandwidth on the bus. The most popular protocol, write invalidate, erases all other copies of data before writing the local cache. Any subsequent read of this data by other processors will detect a cache miss in their local cache and will be serviced from the cache of another CPU containing the most recently modified data. This model saved a lot of bus bandwidth and allowed for Uniform Memory Access systems to emerge in the early 1990s. Modern cache coherency protocols are covered in more detail by part 3. Uniform Memory Access Architecture Processors of Bus-based multiprocessors that experience the same - uniform - access time to any memory module in the system are often referred to as Uniform Memory Access (UMA) systems or Symmetric Multi-Processors (SMPs). With UMA systems, the CPUs are connected via a system bus (Front-Side Bus) to the Northbridge. The Northbridge contains the memory controller and all communication to and from memory must pass through the Northbridge. The I/O controller, responsible for managing I/O to all devices, is connected to the Northbridge. Therefore, every I/O has to go through the Northbridge to reach the CPU. Multiple buses and memory channels are used to double the available bandwidth and reduce the bottleneck of the Northbridge. To increase the memory bandwidth even further some systems connected external memory controllers to the Northbridge, improving bandwidth and support of more memory. However due the internal bandwidth of the Northbridge and the broadcasting nature of early snoopy cache protocols, UMA was considered to have a limited scalability. With today's use of high-speed flash devices, pushing hundreds of thousands of IO's per second, they were absolutely right that this architecture would not scale for future workloads. Non-Uniform Memory Access Architecture To improve scalability and performance three critical changes are made to the shared-memory multiprocessors architecture; Non-Uniform Memory Access organization Point-to-Point interconnect topology Scalable cache coherence solutions 1: Non-Uniform Memory Access organization NUMA moves away from a centralized pool of memory and introduces topological properties. By classifying memory location bases on signal path length from the processor to the memory, latency and bandwidth bottlenecks can be avoided. This is done by redesigning the whole system of processor and chipset. NUMA architectures gained popularity at the end of the 90's when it was used on SGI supercomputers such as the Cray Origin 2000. NUMA helped to identify the location of the memory, in this case of these systems, they had to wonder which memory region in which chassis was holding the memory bits. In the first half of the millennium decade, AMD brought NUMA to the enterprise landscape where UMA systems reigned supreme. In 2003 the AMD Opteron family was introduced, featuring integrated memory controllers with each CPU owning designated memory banks. Each CPU has now its own memory address space. A NUMA optimized operating system such as ESXi allows workload to consume memory from both memory addresses spaces while optimizing for local memory access. Let's use an example of a two CPU system to clarify the distinction between local and remote memory access within a single system. The memory connected to the memory controller of the CPU1 is considered to be local memory. Memory connected to another CPU socket (CPU2)is considered to be foreign or remote for CPU1. Remote memory access has additional latency overhead to local memory access, as it has to traverse an interconnect (point-to-point link) and connect to the remote memory controller. As a result of the different memory locations, this system experiences “non-uniform” memory access time. 2: Point-to-Point interconnect AMD introduced their point-to-point connection HyperTransport with the AMD Opteron microarchitecture. Intel moved away from their dual independent bus architecture in 2007 by introducing the QuickPath Architecture in their Nehalem Processor family design. The Nehalem architecture was a significant design change within the Intel microarchitecture and is considered the first true generation of the Intel Core series. The current Broadwell architecture is the 4th generation of the Intel Core brand (Intel Xeon E5 v4), the last paragraph contains more information on the microarchitecture generations. Within the QuickPath architecture, the memory controllers moved to the CPU and introduced the QuickPath point-to-point Interconnect (QPI) as data-links between CPUs in the system. The Nehalem microarchitecture not only replaced the legacy front-side bus but reorganized the entire sub-system into a modular design for server CPU. This modular design was introduced as the "Uncore" and creates a building block library for caching and interconnect speeds. Removing the front-side bus improves bandwidth scalability issues, yet intra- and inter-processor communication have to be solved when dealing with enormous amounts of memory capacity and bandwidth. Both the integrated memory controller and the QuickPath Interconnects are a part of the Uncore and are Model Specific Registers (MSR) ). They connect to a MSR that provides the intra- and inter-processor communication. The modularity of the Uncore also allows Intel to offer different QPI speeds, at the time of writing the Intel Broadwell-EP microarchitecture (2016) offers 6.4 Giga-transfers per second (GT/s), 8.0 GT/s and 9.6 GT/s. Respectively providing a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 25.6 GB/s, 32 GB/s and 38.4 GB/s between the CPUs. To put this in perspective, the last used front-side bus provided 1.6 GT/s or 12.8 GB/s of platform bandwidth. When introducing Sandy Bridge Intel rebranded Uncore into System Agent, yet the term Uncore is still used in current documentation. You can find more about QuickPath and the Uncore in part 2. 3: Scalable Cache Coherence Each core had a private path to the L3 cache. Each path consisted of a thousand wires and you can imagine this doesn't scale well if you want to decrease the nanometer manufacturing process while also increasing the cores that want to access the cache. In order to be able to scale, the Sandy Bridge Architecture moved the L3 cache out of the Uncore and introduced the scalable ring on-die Interconnect. This allowed Intel to partition and distribute the L3 cache in equal slices. This provides higher bandwidth and associativity. Each slice is 2.5 MB and one slice is associated with each core. The ring allows each core to access every other slice as well. Pictured below is the die configuration of a Low Core Count (LCC) Xeon CPU of the Broadwell Microarchitecture (v4) (2016). This caching architecture requires a snooping protocol that incorporates both distributed local cache as well as the other processors in the system to ensure cache coherency. With the addition of more cores in the system, the amount of snoop traffic grows, since each core has its own steady stream of cache misses. This affects the consumption of the QPI links and last level caches, requiring ongoing development in snoop coherency protocols. An in-depth view of the Uncore, scalable ring on-Die Interconnect and the importance of caching snoop protocols on NUMA performance will be included in part 3. Non-interleaved enabled NUMA = SUMA Physical memory is distributed across the motherboard, however, the system can provide a single memory address space by interleaving the memory between the two NUMA nodes. This is called Node-interleaving (setting is covered in part 2). When node interleaving is enabled, the system becomes a Sufficiently Uniform Memory Architecture (SUMA). Instead of relaying the topology info and nature of the processors and memory in the system to the operating system, the system breaks down the entire memory range into 4KB addressable regions and maps them in a round robin fashion from each node. This provides an 'interleaved' memory structure where the memory address space is distributed across the nodes. When ESXi assigns memory to virtual machine it allocates physical memory located from two different nodes when the physical CPU located in Node 0 needs to fetch the memory from Node 1, the memory will traverse the QPI links. The interesting thing is that the SUMA system provides a uniform memory access time. Only not the most optimal one and heavily depends on contention levels in the QPI architecture. Intel Memory Latency Checker was used to demonstrate the differences between NUMA and SUMA configuration on the same system. This test measures the idle latencies (in nanoseconds) from each socket to the other socket in the system. The latency reported of Memory Node 0 by Socket 0 is local memory access, memory access from socket 0 of memory node 1 is remote memory access in the system configured as NUMA. NUMA Memory Node 0 Memory Node 1 - SUMA Memory Node 0 Memory Node 1 Socket 0 75.7 132.0 - Socket 0 105.5 106.4 Socket 1 131.9 75.8 - Socket 1 106.0 104.6 As expected interleaving is impacted by constant traversing the QPI links. The idle memory test is the best case scenario, a more interesting test is measuring loaded latencies. It would have been a bad investment if your ESXi servers are idling, therefor you can assume that an ESXi system is processing data. Measuring loaded latencies provides a better insight on how the system will perform under normal load. During the test the load injection delays are automatically changed every 2 seconds and both the bandwidth and the corresponding latency is measured at that level. This test uses 100% read traffic.NUMA test results on the left, SUMA test results on the right. The reported bandwidth for the SUMA system is lower while maintaining a higher latency than the system configured as NUMA. Therefore, the focus should be on optimizing the VM size to leverage the NUMA characteristics of the system. Nehalem & Core microarchitecture overview With the introduction of the Nehalem microarchitecture in 2008, Intel moved away from the Netburst architecture. The Nehalem microarchitecture introduced Intel customers to NUMA. Along the years Intel introduced new microarchitectures and optimizations, according to its famous Tick-Tock model. With every Tick, optimization takes place, shrinking the process technology and with every Tock a new microarchitecture is introduced. Even though Intel provides a consistent branding model since 2012, people tend to Intel architecture codenames to discuss the CPU tick and tock generations. Even the EVC baselines lists these internal Intel codenames, both branding names and architecture codenames will be used throughout this series: Microarchitecture DP servers Branding Year Cores LLC (MB) QPI Speed (GT/s) Memory Frequency Architectural change Fabrication Process Nehalem x55xx 10-2008 4 8 6.4 3xDDR3-1333 Tock 45nm Westmere x56xx 01-2010 6 12 6.4 3xDDR3-1333 Tick 32nm Sandy Bridge E5-26xx v1 03-2012 8 20 8.0 4xDDR3-1600 Tock 32nm Ivy Bridge E5-26xx v2 09-2013 12 30 8.0 4xDDR3-1866 Tick 22 nm Haswell E5-26xx v3 09-2014 18 45 9.6 4xDDR3-2133 Tock 22nm Broadwell E5-26xx v4 03-2016 22 55 9.6 4xDDR3-2400 Tick 14 nm Up next, Part 2: System Architecture The 2016 NUMA Deep Dive Series: Part 0: Introduction NUMA Deep Dive Series Part 1: From UMA to NUMA Part 2: System Architecture Part 3: Cache Coherency Part 4: Local Memory Optimization Part 5: ESXi VMkernel NUMA Constructs Part 6: NUMA Initial Placement and Load Balancing Operations Part 7: From NUMA to UMA Share on your social network: Twitter Reddit Google LinkedIn Facebook Pinterest Frank Denneman Follow me on Twitter, visit the facebook fanpage of FrankDenneman.nl, or add me to your Linkedin network 9 Responses Comments9 Pingbacks0 awesome says: July 7, 2016 at 16:49 you just fucked my brain with this amazing post.. now i feel i am relaxed Askar Kopbayev says: July 8, 2016 at 03:34 I thought I knew pretty much about NUMA, but turns out I knew nothing. Awesome deep dive, Thanks a lot. Question - how does SUMA manage to provide a uniform memory access time? I thought the access time difference between NUMA and SUMA was a physical characteristic difference due to number of hops between cores and memory banks and due to different bandwidth/latency specs of local memory channels vs QPI. And thanks for tick&tock explanation - that was pretty interesting. Phil Morris says: July 8, 2016 at 11:28 @Askar As Frank as explained - the logical memory addressing in sequence is interleaved or round robin-ed between the physical memory locations(nodes). Eg: Assuming a two CPU system (2 nodes) Logical memory address 0 - on node 0 Logical memory address 1 - on node 1 Logical memory address 3 - on node 0 Logical memory address 4 - on node 1 .... So the law of averages - some address will be super quick and some not as the requested memory location as to mapped to the physical location (node). If you use the table frank provides - Socket 0 memory 0 = 75.7 memory 1 = 132.0 (memory 0 is local, 1 remote) 75.7 + 132.0 = 207.7 / 2 == 103.85 very close the the SUMA score of 105.5 & 106.4. Hope this help explains it. Phil @the_vMonkey Askar Kopbayev says: July 8, 2016 at 12:09 Hi Phil, yes, that makes sense. I think I got confused by the table with SUMA nodes memory access latency numbers. The table looks like even with node interleaving enabled each core was testing local and remote access separately, however, the core was actually accessing two different memory banks in round-robin fashion. Thanks for the explanation. 4c74356b41 says: July 8, 2016 at 13:44 @askar Well, they are using 2 CPU system, so effectively, you place half the memory on one CPU and half on the other (we are talking about memory we are utilizing, not the RAM itself). So your application accesses memory from CPU1 as equally as memory from CPU2 (well, if its truly random). At least that's how I understood it. I might be wrong. Phil Morris says: July 8, 2016 at 16:35 The point been made is that SUMA is like a 'lazy' admins fix or if the Operating system does not understand NUMA and it underlying CPU/RAM infrastructure. If using NUMA and don't take not of it you could have a case of two VMs - that have total different performance - eg VM 1 as its confg mapped to a single node - thus ram is local. Another might have ram that is split across nodes. Eric Singer says: July 20, 2016 at 18:58 Great post, thanks for sharing. I've never thought of it before, but it almost tells a story of why HCI *may* be the future. That is HCI = NUMA and shared storage = UMA. I don't think the bandwidth and latency limitations are any where near as constrained in storage as they are in a CPU, but an interesting similarity none the less.

Lays Rodrigues QString("C'est la vie"); Menu About Me Search for: Cross-Compile: Configure QtCreator for Intel Edison A few months ago a new friend gave to me an Intel Edison board to play =) When I got back home I mounted the board and start to configure. Download from Intel the environment necessary to programming using Node.Js and others frameworks. Since the Intel XDK environment is too heavy, and I like to use QtCreator, I will configure the Cross-Compile environment to use QtCreator like my editor. I will try in the future write Qt Applications and run them on the Edison, but that is a subject for an another post. So in the Intel Forum, I found a tutorial in how to build the cross-platform environment for QtCreator on your machine to build apps for the board. Is a tutorial from 2015, but I will replicate in my way. =) For this tutorial I assuming that you know what is: QtCreator, CMake, GDB, and ssh access. #1 You need to download the Cross Compiling tool from the Intel site, you can find the list of operational systems and the right SDK  Tools here. #2 Extract the files in your personal folder. And execute the script to install the libraries. #2 Fail This is the same error that I found when I was trying to install the package of Intel Edison board in Arduino IDE. Is a parameter that isn’t written like +111 anymore. You need to open the script file and change it to /111. After that run the script again: sudo ./install_script.sh I didn’t execute the script in sudo mode. And that made all the installation in my local folder. That would be a problem if I delete the folder for example. Even running the script in sudo mode, didn’t installed the files in the right folders. Apparently don’t have any settings to install in /opt/poky-Edison. After one hour testing, me and a friend of mine conclude that the install script is awful. It has an environment variable to the default folder: DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/poky-edison/1.6.1 And the target dir is empty: target_sdk_dir=”” In the line 61 it sets: target_sdk_dir=$(pwd) To run some commands that use others files in the i686 folders. So if I change, to the DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR, it brokes and the scripts end with an error. In any other place in the script, have an attribution of the DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR in the target_sdk_dir. I don’t have much knowledge with Shell Script to fix the install script. So I will leave like that and hope that I don’t delete this folder for some reason. If you want to check the script click here. #3 Now you need to open QtCreator. After that go in Tools -> Options -> Devices Click Add… to add a new device. Select the option of a New Generic Linux Device: After that configure you need to configure the access for your Edison: Click to finish the Wizard, and QtCreator will try to open an ssh connection to your Edison. If return Success, you are set up, else you need to discover the issue and solve it. =) #4 Now you need to add a new Kit in QtCreator, this Kit will lead to you to compile the source code to your Intel Edison. Go to Tools -> Options -> Build and Run Open the Tab Compilers. You need to add a new GCC compiler for the Intel Edison device, so you need to search where on your system the file: i685-poky-linux-g++ In my case is here: “/home/lays/Downloads/i686/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/i586-poky-linux/i685-poky-linux-g++” Now you need to set up the Kit, go to the tab Kits, and click to add a new Kit. Set the Sysroot path to: Important #1! On the Device Type you will choose the Generic Linux Device, and on the Device option bellow should appear your Edison automatically. Important #2! You need to setup the Cmake Tool because is the tool that will manage the Cross Compile and the project. Important #3! Select the Qt version for None. Well, click Ok and now you finish your setup of your Kit for the Edison board. #5 Now we need to setup one CMake Configuration file to tell the Edison what’s need to be done. Were put the deploy files, what compile, flags to use, and so on. You can name the file to Edison.cmake, this file can be general for any project that you want to do. But if you need something more specific you need to edit for your necessity. You can access my version of the Edison.cmake here. #6 Well, now you only need to create a new project, using a CMakeLists.txt to make the library and build control adding this flag: #This is where all the settings to compile for the Edison are stored. INCLUDE(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Edison.cmake Now you have all your environment for Cross Compile projects to your Intel Edison from your QtCreator. If you need more info, you can access the base post here. In the next post, I will make my test, and maybe include some Qt code and see what happens. But for now… That’s all folks!

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Re-examining the unusual frame time results in our Radeon RX 470 review by Jeff Kampman  1:33 PM on August 12, 2016 It's never fun to admit a mistake, but we made a big one while writing our recent Radeon RX 470 review. That piece was our first time out on a new test rig that included an Intel Core i7-6700K CPU and an ASRock Z170 Extreme7+ motherboard. Once we got that system up and running, it delivered some weird-looking frame time numbers with some games. For example, the spikiness of the frame-time plot below didn't match any test data we had ever gathered before for Grand Theft Auto V, and we puzzled over those strange results for some time. We decided to go ahead and publish them anyway after doing some extended troubleshooting without seeing any improvement. Compare that to a more typical GTA V result from our Radeon RX 480 review, as demonstrated by three GeForce cards running on an X99 testbed: The spikiness caused by what turned out to be high deferred procedure call (or DPC) latency didn't seem to affect average framerates much (save one major exception), but it did worsen our 99th-percentile frame time numbers considerably. Given how much we use those 99th-percentile numbers in formulating other parts of our conclusions, especially value plots, the error introduced this way had considerable negative effects on the accuracy of several key parts of our review. The net effect of this error led us to wrongly conclude that the Radeon RX 480 8GB and the Radeon RX 470 were closely matched in performance, when in fact they're quite different. Upon reflection, we should have stopped the RX 470 review at that point to try and figure out exactly what was going on, but the pressure of deadlines got the better of us. When these weird frame-time plots appeared once more in the preliminary testing work for our review of the Radeon RX 460, however, we had to acknowlege that something unusual was going on. Of course, that also meant that our published RX 470 review had problems that we had to deal with. We believe that in the interest of full transparency, it's important to explain exactly what happened, be clear about how we messed up, and resolve not to make the same mistakes in the future. The issue While I was testing the Radeon RX 460 and tearing my hair out over the wild frame time plots our cards were generating, TR code wizard Bruno "morphine" Ferreira brought the possibility of high DPC latency to my attention. DPC latency is usually of interest to musicians running digital audio workstations, where consistently minimal input lag is critical. Bruno pointed me to the LatencyMon app, which keeps an eye on DPC performance and warns of any issues, as a way of figuring out whether DPC latency was the root cause of this problem. LatencyMon thinks something is up with my main desktop. I'll have to look into it soon. I didn't capture any screenshots during my frenzied troubleshooting, but LatencyMon did show that our test rig wasn't servicing DPC requests promptly. Wireless networking drivers are generally considered the first place to look when troubleshooting DPC issues, and I use an Intel Wireless-N 6205 card in our test system. Oops. Even after disabling that wireless card, however, the issue persisted. After killing every potential bit of software that might have been causing the problem without getting any improvements, I took Bruno's suggestion of updating our motherboard's firmware. "The BIOS can't possibly be the cause!" I thought to myself smugly. Pride goeth before a fall, of course, and the DPC latency issue vanished with the new ASRock firmware installed. The frame-time plots for GTA V began to resemble the flat, tight lines we've come to expect with modern hardware. I had to quash the urge to drive over the motherboard a few times and burn the remains before coming to grips with the fact that I would have to throw out large amounts of testing data. So what happened? You see, ASRock sent us its Z170 Extreme7+ board during a brief period in which the company was promoting its ability to overclock locked Intel CPUs with a beta BIOS. I had hoped to explore that possibility with some ASRock motherboards and cheap CPUs, but Intel swiftly put the kibosh on the concept. We got busy with other work, and the beta firmware remained on the motherboard through our first attempts to test graphics cards with it. I don't know precisely what was wrong with this beta firmware that was causing it to wreak havoc on DPC latency, but updating the firmware did fix it, so Occam's razor suggests something weird was going on. The fallout Having solved the underlying problem, I now had to contend with the fact that I had published a very public and widely-read review that contained what seemed like reams of contaminated data. To see just how wrong I had been in my conclusions, I retested every title we had slated for our RX 470 and RX 460 reviews on our ASRock test rig, using the same settings we had initially chosen for our reviews. As it turns out, high DPC latency doesn't affect every game equally, or at least not in a way that shows up in our frame-time numbers. While GTA V, Hitman, and Rise of the Tomb Raider all showed significant changes in average FPS and 99th-percentile frame times after a retest on the updated hardware,  Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 did not. That second trio of games certainly felt more responsive to input after the critical firmware update, but the data they generated wasn't meaningfully different. We're talking fractions of milliseconds of difference in before-and-after testing, and those deltas are almost certainly imperceptible in real-life gaming. Given that behavior, we're confident that the numbers we generated for Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 are representative of the performance of the Radeon RX 460, the Radeon RX 470, and the other cards we tested in those reviews.  The resolution Given the large differences in performance we saw with GTA V, Hitman, and RoTR, the only acceptable way to fix our mistake was to retest all of the cards in our Radeon RX 470 review from the ground up with those games. We've done that now, and as a bonus, we did that retesting with the same data-collection methods we just premiered in our RX 460 review. As a result, we now have Doom Vulkan and OpenGL numbers for the RX 470 and RX 480, plus DirectX 12 numbers for Rise of the Tomb Raider and Hitman. We've also extensively re-written the conclusion of our Radeon RX 470 review to account for this new data, much in the same way that we crunched our results for the Radeon RX 460 and friends. We've accounted for the differences in our results there, so I'd encourage you to go read up on what changed. If you read our original Radeon RX 470 review, we're deeply sorry to have misinformed you. We also extend our sincerest apologies to everybody at AMD and Nvidia for presenting incorrect information and misguided conclusions about their products. In the future, we'll strive to be both correct and swift with our reviews, but we also won't hesitate to delay a piece when clear warning flags are evident. We hope this clarification reinforces your trust in The Tech Report's reporting. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a comment below or email me directly.

The Trust will convene the first-ever Women Advancing Africa (WAA) Forum in 2017 to highlight the critical role that women play in shaping Africa's development. Over the past decade, Africa has experienced unprecedented economic growth but women and children have shared least in its prosperity. Today, African women constitute 70 percent of the informal economy, while one third of Africa's formal small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are owned by women but only 47 percent of these are financially served. African women are a powerful untapped force and creating more opportunities for women to participate in the economy will improve their earning potential, assist families to move out of poverty and drive inclusive and sustainable growth. Women Advancing Africa plans to build an intergenerational movement of women whose experience and wisdom will lead to collective action to address these economic imbalances. To identify priorities and help shape the agenda for the inaugural Women Advancing Africa Forum, the Trust convened a roundtable meeting of African women leaders across sectors in Magaliesburg, South Africa from August 11-13. The intimate gathering was hosted by Mrs. Machel, who shared her vision for Women Advancing Africa and invited participants to share their stories and develop targeted goals for the initiative moving forward. "Africa's continued journey towards full economic and social prosperity will only be achieved when women take the lead in setting the continent's development agenda and have equal opportunities to participate at all levels in society," said Mrs. Machel. "Now is the time to shape a collective agenda for the economic advancement of African women." At the meeting, more than 40 African women leaders worked together to identify priorities and outline key focus areas for the 2017 Forum. Under the overarching theme of driving social and economic transformation, WAA will focus on three core pillars in 2017: promoting financial inclusion, increasing market access and driving social change. "It is rare to experience a completely safe space in which we can tell our truth, own our stories and challenge each other," reflected Renée Ngamau, participant and member of the Graça Machel Trust Women in Media Network. "The WAA roundtable created that space and challenged me to powerfully take on next steps in my journey; not just for myself, but for other women younger, or less privileged than I am." The Trust has selected APCO Worldwide, the largest women-owned communications firm in the world, to be the convening partner for the Women Advancing Africa initiative. Working closely with the Graça Machel Trust, APCO will leverage its global network and communications expertise to bring the initiative to life at the inaugural meeting. The Forum will take place next year in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania and will be attended by at least 250 of Africa's most influential women leaders, the continent's rising stars and committed global champions. Initial support for the WAA initiative has also been provided by founding sponsor, The Intel Foundation. Through the "She Will Connect Program" Intel will also establish a dedicated online platform to connect a pan-African community of women leaders. Additional support has been provided by The UPS Foundation, Discovery, The United Nations Foundation, The Skoll Foundation and The Bridgeway Foundation. These partners share the Trust's belief that advancing women economically is crucial to the health and prosperity of African families, communities and nations. A detailed communique outlining the next steps and actions to be taken by the Trust is forthcoming.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date, Specs and News: Premium Laptop Coming with Latest Intel Processor By Neal A. Lasta Aug 15, 2016 | 10:47 AM The release date of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has yet to be announced, but customers can't wait to get their hands on the device. For now, people can only speculate about not just the release date, but also the specs in this new Microsoft laptop/tablet hybrid. Here are the latest news and rumors about the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Release Date The initial rumors about the release of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was set in June of this year, according to Tech Times. But since the Surface Pro 5 relied on Intel Kaby Lake Processors, at least according to speculations, and this processor is set to be released at the later months of 2016, then this means that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will most likely be released next year. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The Surface Pro 5 is a premium laptop/tablet hybrid, so it's natural to assume that it won't run on nothing less than the latest Intel processor. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 was released in October,2015, so many customers considered the possibility that the Surface Pro 5 will be released in October 2016. However, Microsoft usually doesn't follow any constant release date cycles. In fact, the first Surface Pro was released on a June, the Surface Pro 2 was made available on a September, while the Surface Pro 3 was in June 2014. Specs The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will utilize the Kaby Lake processor and the Microsoft Windows 10 OS Redstone 2 update. Both specs are the reasons why the release of this device is delayed. The screen of the Surface Pro 5 is rumored to be 4K Ultra HD. It is also assumed that the tablet/laptop hybrid will have a USB Type-C port, which CNET describes as having similar ends, "allowing for reversible plug orientation. You also don't need to worry about plugging it in upside down." The Surface Pro 5 will also have 16 GB RAM, latest Nvidia Pascal architecture, or AMD Polaris. The device will also come in two display variations; 2K and 4K. Another improvement is centered on the Surface Pen. The Surface Pen was a success with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, sporting 1024 pressure points which allowed for a realistic pen experience, and an eraser on the other end. For the Surface Pro 5, a lot of people are expected that the Surface Pen will be rechargeable, and not use AAA batteries like its predecessors.

Display a Point Cloud grabbed by the Microsoft Kinect v2 in a OpenGL control Last version 0.9.0.9  version 0.9.0.9 Source code 3.7 MB version 0.9.0.9: Eexecutables : 2.0 MB Old version 0.9.0.5  version 0.9.0.5 Source code: 2.9 MB version 0.9.0.5: Executables : 2.3 MB Introduction This article is the follow-up of my article on grabbing a point cloud using the Microsoft Kinect v2. Main features:  grab a point cloud using the Kinect v2 scanner or the Intel Realsense F200 scanner real time display of the point cloud in a OpenGL control possibility to adjust scanning parameters like maximum depth, scanned point cloud as obj file save For the details of the OpenGL implementation, please read this article. It uses the library OpenTK as C# interface for OpenGL. Quick Start A short how for the main program: Start the program PointCloudScanner.exe Click on „Capture“  Click on „Show Point Cloud“ to open the point cloud View the point cloud with or without color info  Motivation Why not using the Kinect SDK samples Since some time, but in fact after I published this article, the Kinect SDK samples include the Kinect Studio Explorer, which allows a live viewing of the point cloud in 3D. Before that, only 2D images of the Depth, color, body and infrared frames were possible. However, the Kinect Studio Explorer is available only as executable file and not as source code, so you cannot use this in your own project, This available source code allows viewing in 3D as well as some additional features in comparison to the Kinecet Explorer, like cutting the grabbed data etc. Why OpenGL First you may ask: Why not use a WPF window for displaying point clouds, but the OpenGL control I used? Well, in WPF you cannot display simple point clouds. You can only display surfaces (or areas, triangles). So you would have to first program a triangulation – which is not an easy task. And I have to admit: I dislike WPF. The main reasons why WPF has been introduced is: Separation between UI and logics – which in principle should allow a designer to use Blender for designing the UI, and a programmer to use Visual Studio for coding. Support for graphics/animation and desktop programs There are other reasons like data binding, ability to run in a browser, etc. which I consider to be only not so relevant reasons. Now the main reasons why I dislike WPF is related to the above points: Changing the UI is VERY time consuming – e.g. why should I use two tools for a simple change in the UI?? Code change in the WPF is very tedious. Try to open a simple WPF control in Visual Studio – it takes more than 5 s for displaying. The Message box appearing which says, I could do other tasks during this time is a kind of joke. What other task should I do - I just want to change the code now! Then you have to search for your control, found out which is the code handler for an event, then search in your code for this method. About 4 steps to do. With Windows Forms this was a double – click. The support for graphics within WPF is poor and slow. A Point Cloud cannot be displayed in WPF. Displaying large data is slow. Besides that, the OpenGL community is large, and there are several code tips and libraries which help development.   Code If you follow the process of scanning starting from clicking on the button to displaying the data in the 3D control, it goes 1. ScannerUC.StartScanning() We use the Kinect camera, this calls the method 2. KinectBO.StartScanner() The KinectBO class encapsulates everything done by Kinect, like frame capturing, data conversions to 3D etc. The StartScanner method sets delegates for receiving the data from the scanner and sets the output to display the data on the user control 3. KinectBO.Scanner_MultiSourceFrameArrived() is called on every frame from the scanner. For displaying the 3D data, the method called is 4. KinectBO.ProcessDepthFrame() and from here, the method: 5. KinectBO.UpdateOpenGLControl() Here, the frame data is converted to a point cloud in the method: 6. KinectBO.ToPointCloudRenderable(false); This is done in the line: 7. MetaDataBase.ToPointCloudVertices(this.ColorMetaData, this.DepthMetaData, this.coordinateMapper); The depth frame data and the color frme data are malled to world points by  myCoordinateMapper.MapDepthFrameToCameraSpace(myDepthMetaData.FrameData, myRealWorldPoints);

myCoordinateMapper.MapDepthFrameToColorSpace(myDepthMetaData.FrameData, mycolorPointsInDepthSpace); After that, the point cloud is created by taking the depth frame and getting color data for each pixel in the method: 8. MetaDataBasePointCloudVerticesWithColorParallel() th Here I use parallelisation, otherwise the performance is very low, and an update of the UI is done about once per second or slower. By using parallisation, the performance is up to 10 frames/s. The code used is:   private static PointCloudVertices PointCloudVerticesWithColorParallel(ColorSpacePoint[] mycolorPointsInDepthSpace, CameraSpacePoint[] myRealWorldPoints, ColorMetaData myColorMetaData, DepthMetaData myDepthMetaData)
        {
           
            Vertex[,] arrVectors = new Vertex[DepthMetaData.XDepthMaxKinect, DepthMetaData.YDepthMaxKinect];

            PointCloudVertices pc = new PointCloudVertices();
            try
            {
               
                //for (int x = 0; x < DepthMetaData.XDepthMaxKinect; x++)
                System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For(0, DepthMetaData.XDepthMaxKinect, x =>
                {
                    for (int y = 0; y < DepthMetaData.YDepthMaxKinect; y++)
                    {
                        int depthIndex = (y * DepthMetaData.XDepthMaxKinect) + x;

                        if (myDepthMetaData.FrameData[depthIndex] != 0)
                        {
                            ColorSpacePoint colorPoint = mycolorPointsInDepthSpace[depthIndex];


                            int xColor = Convert.ToInt32(colorPoint.X);
                            int yColor = Convert.ToInt32(colorPoint.Y);
                            int depthIndexColor = depthIndex * MetaDataBase.BYTES_PER_PIXEL;

                            if ((xColor >= 0) && (xColor < ColorMetaData.XColorMaxKinect) && (yColor >= 0) && (yColor < ColorMetaData.YColorMaxKinect))
                            {
                                int colorIndex = ((yColor * ColorMetaData.XColorMaxKinect) + xColor) * MetaDataBase.BYTES_PER_PIXEL;
                                Vector3d vect = new Vector3d(myRealWorldPoints[depthIndex].X, myRealWorldPoints[depthIndex].Y, myRealWorldPoints[depthIndex].Z);
                                System.Drawing.Color c = System.Drawing.Color.FromArgb(myColorMetaData.Pixels[colorIndex + 3], myColorMetaData.Pixels[colorIndex + 2], myColorMetaData.Pixels[colorIndex + 1], myColorMetaData.Pixels[colorIndex]);
                                
                                Vertex v = new Vertex(0, vect, c);
                                arrVectors[x, y] = v;
                              

                            }
                           
                        }
                    }
                });
                //};
            }
            catch(Exception err)
            {
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(" error in PointCloudWithColor " + err.Message);
            }
            for (int x = 0; x < DepthMetaData.XDepthMaxKinect; x++)
                for (int y = 0; y < DepthMetaData.YDepthMaxKinect; y++)
                {
                    if(arrVectors[x,y] != null)
                        pc.Add(arrVectors[x, y]);
                }

            return pc;
        }   However, the mapping of color, method; MapDepthFrameToColorSpace behaves strange. -The doc says, you should get a list of "colorpoints" of size of the depth frame (i.e. 512* 424 = 210788 points) which contain the color info. The colorpoints contain x and y coordinates, which should map to the color image (i.e. from coordinate 0,0 to 1920, 1080). If you inspect the result while debugging, most of the points contain negative coordinates or infinity values. OK, you ignore them (see also the code snippet above, where you check the x and y coordinates to be in the bounds -still, the result contains artefacts at the edges of objects, E.g. if you scan a human face, you will see curious artefacts at the edges I read all MS docs, and scanned the internet for known samples. As also the Kinect Studio from Microsoft does not show the point clouds coloured, I assume this is a known problem. Usage of the Unit Tests I have spent a lot of effort to put the whole functionality of the code in unit tests. Work is in progress for some functionality – mainly the triangulation. Hopefully some of you will contribute to fill the gaps! Just send some code, and I will incorporate it. To see the samples, you would have to first install NUnit and then configure the path of the NUnit exe in the Visual Studio project, in order to run the tests. Hint: I did not manage to use NUnit 2.6 which uses .NET 2.0, but compiled NUnit using .NET 4.5. Possible that NUnit 3.0 (alpha  version) works as well – I did not try that.   e.g. to open a Point cloud   public class ExampleModelsFromDisk : TestBase

    {

        [Test]
        public void OpenObjFile()
        {
            string fileNameLong = path + "\\KinectFace1.obj";
            OpenTKTestForm fOTK = new OpenTKTestForm();
            fOTK.OpenGLControl.LoadModelFromFile(fileNameLong, true);
            fOTK.ShowDialog();

        } This calls the method OpenGLRenderer.LoadModel(string file, string NoOpenCLMessage) Which creates a Model3D (the base class of what is displayed in the OpenGL control), calling Model3D.readOBJfile Class Diagram of the Kinect project This is a very rudimentary class diagram, created within Visual Studio just as an overview. But the code hierarchy is so simple that sophisticated class diagrams are not required :)   What is shown when starting the program KinectPointCloud is the form "MainWindow", which contains a user control: ScannerUC. This user control encapsulates all Kinect code. Here you have methods for start/stop grabbing, building the entropy image, statistic display, opening the grabbed point cloud in the OpenTK dialog etc. There are two business objects for scanning, one for the Kinect, the other for Intel Real Sense camera. The code for Intel realsense is not yet ready, since I do not use the Intel driver, but try to attach multiple RealSense cameras. This works, but I do not have the color info for the point cloud, as I need a mapper between color and frame data - and for the mapper I need the exact calibration data between color and depth sensor. Some important members of the Kinect user control are the classes for handling the data grabbed by the Kinect. As the name suggest, you see the DepthMetaData for handling depth, resp. the ones for color and body meta data. Within theses classes you find numerous methods (mostly static) for data handling, like conversion, I/O.   Class Diagram of the OpenTK project Again, the same rudimentary class diagram What is displayed is the OpenGL user control, which contains a more basic control, without any combo boxes, etc This OpenGL Control contains all methods for the 3D handling within OpenGL resp. the OpenTK port of OpenGL. The member doing all 3D work is OpenGLContext, which contains 1..n 3D objects of type RenderableObject. They contain the PointCloud objects.   Image and Feature gallery 1. The 3D Bunny from the Stanford university, in various views:   The images show (from left to right): Point cloud, wireframe, solid, convex hull wireframe, convex hull solid. You can get the first three views by loading the bunny file (included in the bin/TestModels directory), and then changing the View mode. The convex hull you can get by using the NUnit testcases  ConvexHullTest.Bunny_Hull 2. A sphere in the 3 Views   Other code used I took various codes from others, here is the list. You can see the list also in the Help-About window. Points of Interest The triangulation should be improved, the whole part is work in progress. I will soon publish an article on different methods to align point clouds via different ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithms.

Please try to open the project in Visual studio, and compile. This should give you a hint of what is missing. Distorted pointclouds Member 1258919517-Jun-16 1:24 Member 12589195 17-Jun-16 1:24  This code is very helpful. One bug I found: The pointclouds have a large amount of distortion (planes become curved surfaces) It appears that you generate generate the X and Y coordinate for each point by taking each pixels row and column, and mapping it to a fixed width and height. So a pixel with the same row and column will always get the same X and Y coordinate, no matter the depth. I don't think this is correct. Ms has a CoordinateMapper to map the depth pixels to actual SkeletonPoints. see 3d - Kinect Point Cloud Curved Walls - Stack Overflow[^] Re: Distorted pointclouds Edgar Maass17-Jun-16 3:48 Edgar Maass 17-Jun-16 3:48  Thanks.

The studio has hired a huge Quality Assurance team to help iron out these bugs, and rolled out a new Experimental Branch PC patch that promises to help enable max frame rates, boost performance on CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, and the frame rate stutters caused by inefficient GPU shader caching.   Sadly the game still runs awkwardly on AMD Phenom processors--"Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten overnight to support AMD CPUs," says Sean Murray--NVIDIA G-Sync has been disabled by default, and the game will likely never run on Intel GPUs. For the time being, Hello Games suggests trying the current workarounds to see if they fix your problem or opting in to the Experimental Branch beta update. Check the full patch notes below, and the Steam discussions board for more info.   On the off chance your copy of No Man's Sky is working perfectly, be sure to check out our startup guide for tips and tricks to make the best of your journey.     Experimental patch adds the following optimizations:   Improved AMD Phenom Support Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten overnight to support AMD CPUs. Unfortunately whilst the game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics still requires "Supplemental SSE 3", which was not supported until "Bobcat" and above. We're discussing with Havok.   Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved.   Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on (this will be fixed in future). This is particularly true on ATI cards   Mouse Jitter Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in "Mouse Smoothing".   Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been improved.   Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved.   Intel GPUs The game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high-end GPU has not been selected.   Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users   Here is how you access it   To access the Experimental branch right-click on the game from the library page and select "Properties". Among the available tabs will be the "BETAS" tab.   Code: 3xperimental   Your new branch should be listed in the dropdown menu under "Select the beta you would like to opt into:" NEWS SOURCES:Madeforgaming.com, Steamcommunity.com Recommended for You Nintendo Switch listed at $245, to release March 17...

Kutraleeshwaran. It was on this date that Kutraleeshwaran -- one of the youngest Arjuna Award receipients -- swam across the English Channel in 1994. "I wanted to cross the Channel on August 15," the Guiness World Record holder for swimming six channels in a single year told IANS on Sunday. As a 13-year-old boy, he achieved that feat and on August 14 and 15 of every year Kutraleeshwaran muses about that swim across the English Channel. "While I was practicing at the English Channel, other swimmers would come and tell me to go back to India and that crossing the channel was an impossible task. But the same people came back on August 16 and told me that I had proved them wrong," Kutraleeshwaran reminisced. Wanting to set the records straight, he said the Tamil Nadu government helped him fully in achieving the Guiness World Record and that the central government funded participation in one of the international competitions. "My quitting professional swimming when I was in Class 12 was a conscious and practical decision. In the 1990s, there were no corporate sponsorhips for swimmers. I had also seen great sportspersons doing odd jobs for their livelihood," Kutraleeshwaran said. "The only option for a middle-class person then was to focus on studies and come up in life, which I did. I do not have any regrets," he added. Today, the Intel engineer-turned-investment banker at Barclays Capital and Citibank has returned to India after working abroad for over a decade. Queried about his decision to quit as Vice President, Corporate and Investment Bank, Citi, Kutraleeshwaran said: "It may look irrational, but that is the way I am. I do not have any back-up plan. It may be risky but that is the way of life. When there is no back-up plan, one will focus on the goal and achieve it." He said he wanted to get a management degree and quit Intel and joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technlogy-Sloan School of Management. According to him, his sporting achievement certainly added value to his resume. "A professional athelete competing in global arena implicitly conveys that he is a hard worker, dedicated and disciplined," Kutraleeshwaran said. "I came back to India nearly a month ago. I am yet to finalise my entrepreneurial plans, which can also be related to swimming as a sport," Kutraleeshwaran remarked. "Swimming should be like walking. Every Indian should know how to swim. If swimming is taught in all the schools, then the sample size will grow bigger, thus paving the way for more talented swimming champions," he said. Kutraleeshwaran said corporates could sponsor this under CSR (corporate social responsibility), a new way to build brand equity and also get a return on investment. Looking back upon his swimming career, Kutraleeshwaran said: "I started swimming in traditional pools. But I found swimming in the sea with friends more interesting and challenging." Then the coach suggested participation in the five-km sea swimming competition here and Kutraleeshwaran came fourth. After this, he participated in long-distance swimming competitions across the country, bagged medals, and set his eyes on crossing the English Channel. "It was the swimming coach K.S. Illangovan who spotted Kutraleeshwaran's talent in long-distance swimming. Further, then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa decided to provide the needed support. And late T.V. Gnanavelu, Secretary, Tamil Nadu Aquatics Association, then suggested crossing the Palk Strait first," S.V. Ramesh, advocate and Kutraleeshwaran's father, told IANS. "We are indebted to these three persons for Kutraleeshwaran's achievements," Ramesh added. In 1994, he first crossed the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka. It was then that his father came to know about Mihir Sen's achievement of swimming across five channels in a single calendar year and wanted Kutraleeshwaran to break that 30-year record. After the English Channel, Kutraleeshwaran crossed Rottnest Channel in Australia, the Straits of Messina and Zannone Circeo, both in Italy, and finally the Ten Degree Channel between Little Andaman and Car Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal -- all with the help of the Tamil Nadu government. Asked about the precautions taken before a long-distance sea swimming event, Kutraleeshwaran said: "To protect the skin as I would be in salt water for several hours, petroleum jelly will be applied on the whole body." "But nothing can be done about the mouth and there will be blisters on the lips and even on the tongue. For at least two days after an event, I would be on liquid diet. One can't even eat a chocolate due to the blisters," he said. Asked about his name, Kutraleeshwaran said it is the name of the deity in a temple in Kutralam in Tamil Nadu. "My grandfather insisted that I was named like this as it was part of fulfilling his vow," he said. "It is a unique name. On seeing the name in my passport many immigration officials immediately recognise the name and wish me," he remarked. Many Indians abroad, on hearing my name, used to tell me that there was a boy in India, a popular long-distance swimmer, with identical name. I used to tell them the boy was me," he said.

CHUWI HiBook (Windows 10 and Android) 2-in-1 Review GO The most affordable Windows 10 and Android 2-in-1 right now Aug 14, 2016 07:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  INTRODUCTION DESIGN HARDWARE CONCLUSIONS CHUWI isn’t exactly a premium device manufacturer, but it’s certainly improving, so while the fact that it’s based in China could more or less impact its sales, holding one of their devices in hand makes you reconsider your options. On paper, CHUWI builds products that are surprising, to say the least, as they follow the recipe of Chinese manufacturers and offer pretty much everything you’d expect from a modern computing device, but without compromising quality and performance. This is what CHUWI promises, and we hearing about this, the HiBook 2-in-1 device certainly seems compelling, mostly because it mixes two different operating systems and promises to do good in the hardware department too. The CHUWI HiBook 2-in-1 “ultrabook tablet PC,” as the manufacturer calls it, isn’t quite an expensive device and can be purchased for just $195 from GearBest (Update, September 12, 2016: Pricing drops to $190.99 with coupon code PediaHibook). For an extra $40, you also get a keyboard, which, in our opinion, is a must-have if you really want to make the most of this device, especially when using it with Windows 10. Since it all sounds too good to be true, we wanted to find out what this is all about on our own, so we took the CHUWI HiBook for a test. Read on to find out what we think about the device. CHUWI HiBook design DESIGN If the first impression is important to you, then you’re going to like the CHUWI HiBook. At first glance, it looks like a really premium device, and the metal casing gives it a shiny appearance that you rarely find on such affordable models. The screen, or the tablet if you wish, measures 26.20 x 16.75 x 0.85 cm / 10.31 x 6.59 x 0.33 inches, and according to the official specs, it weighs 0.5 kilos. And yet, you’ll certainly feel it heavier than that, and you’ll be shocked when you first hold it in your hand, especially if a keyboard is attached. The keyboard itself also adds some 0.5 kg, so the 2-in-1 device tips the scales at approximately 1+ kilograms (2.2 pounds). The design of the screen is nothing unusual, and it’s just the typical tablet that you find these days. It’s full of ports on one side and the other, including TF card, USB Type-C (used for connectivity and charging), micro USB, micro HDMI, headphone jack, and a magnetic port for the keyboard. “Heavier than you think.” The screen measures 10.1 inches and has a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels, which is pretty decent for the price you have to pay, but also for its size. The keyboard, on the other hand, looks surprisingly good and feels nice to the touch, although the mechanism used to attach it to the screen isn’t really the best we’ve seen. Of course, we’re not going to compare it with the Microsoft Surface, which is one of the most expensive premium devices on the market, but there’s still plenty of room for improvement, and you’re going to feel it when trying to detach or connect the keyboard for the first time. While the latching system looks perfectly alright, you need to pull the screen and the keyboard apart very hard, and a kid might really have a hard time doing it. Everything could get a bit loose over time, but during our test, the exact same thing happened over and over again. The keyboard seems nice to the touch, although the plasticky feel of the keys doesn’t quite align with the impression you get when looking at it. It works fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. We’ve heard many people complaining about the position of the screen on the keyboard, and some said the “laptop” could easily get flimsy, but we experienced exactly the opposite. Everything was strongly kept in place, and we could adjust the angle just as we wanted - sometimes, it was even very hard to open the lid, given that extra strength was needed. Other than that, the CHUWI HiBook looks good, and it is, indeed, a little bit too heavy, it remains the kind of device that you won’t feel embarrassed to show up with in a room full of people. HARDWARE #CPU, GPU, storage If you were considering buying the CHUWI HiBook to play games, think again. The device comes with an Intel Cherry Trail Z8300 64-bit quad-core clocked at 1.44GHz and reaching 1.84 GHz in turbo mode, which is coupled with 4GB of RAM and Intel HD eight-generation GPU. At first glance, this configuration seems powerful enough to deal with the majority of activities you perform every day on your PCs, but when actually using it, things are entirely different. The CPU was launched in the second quarter of 2015 and is based on the 14nm architecture, with a 2MB cache and 4 cores. It’s a processor specifically designed for low-cost devices where pricing is the main thing to have in mind, so it won’t be able to handle more than regular web browsing, video, and music playback. If you’re the type of user who browses the web with just one tab open, then you’re safe, but whenever multitasking is involved, the CHUWI HiBook really struggles. We’ve tried to use it with Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and while it performs smoothly with just one tab, it’s getting slower as you open more. “Gaming? Nope. Solitaire? For sure!” We’ve discovered Android (our sample unit is a dual-boot model) is a bit more resource-friendly, and everything seems to be running more smoothly, mostly because it’s an operating system that’s more appropriate for tablets. Microsoft worked hard to make Windows 10 a better OS on such devices, but it’s still slow on budget configurations. For gaming, the CHUWI HiBook won’t be able to deal with anything else beyond Solitaire and old games, such as Starcraft, but it’s not even supposed to. The 10.1-inch IPS screen with 1920x1200 pixels resolution is more appropriate for casual browsing and movie watching than for playing games, but it still does a decent job if you want to play poker or things like that. What’s important to have in mind is that, while some people claim this is Retina display, it is certainly not. It offers average quality and nothing beyond that, and you really can’t compare a Retina display with the screen available on the HiBook. But the difference in price between this display and Retina is huge, so you’ll be fine with CHUWI’s choice anyway. #Keyboard, touch, and trackpad Thanks to the fact that it’s a 2-in-1 device, the HiBook is both a tablet and a laptop, so it comes with a detachable keyboard that can be reattached whenever you need to type faster. The touchscreen is just like you’d expect it to be, and it’s quite responsive, providing pretty good value for the money. You can use it in both portrait and landscape modes, and thanks to optimizations made in Windows 10, the display reacts very fast to touch input. The keyboard, on the other hand, feels nice to the touch, but it loses important points when you look at the HiBook as to a regular laptop. The big weight of the tablet makes it pretty difficult for the keyboard to hold it in place, and there are moments when the HiBook can’t stay on the desk in the typical laptop position because it falls over. CHUWI HiBook magnetic port The magnetic connector that should help recognize when the keyboard is attached and removed works well at first, but after a few days, you might need to clean it up a little bit because otherwise a connection might not be detected. The touchpad, unfortunately, is quite awful, and not only is it small (it can’t be otherwise, given the size of the device), but it’s also super unresponsive. There are moments when you click something by mistake, but there are also cases when you browse the web, and it doesn’t recognize a click, so it’s up to how lucky you are to get a better or worse experience. #Battery life As far as the battery is concerned, the CHUWI HiBook comes with a 6,600 mAh battery that can provide you with 5 to 6 hours of average use. The experience we had here was pretty mixed. First of all, if you want to use the HiBook for the typical stuff, such as browsing the web, chatting, or working on a document, you can really reach those 6 hours of battery life. On the other hand, if you want to watch movies on the HiBook, expect no more than somewhere between 3 and 3 and a half hours of autonomy, also depending on the quality of the video. The recharging process takes place via a USB Type-C port, and the CHUWI device is super handy in this regard. You don’t even have to carry a charger with you all the time, and a Type-C cable is enough - and with more manufacturers adopting this standard, USB Type-C cables will soon be everywhere. It doesn’t take more than one hour and a half to fully recharge the battery, and this is also partially thanks to the Type-C port. Without a doubt, the Chinese manufacturer made the right choice here. #Other features And because it’s a tablet manufactured by a Chinese company, it comes with everything you’d ever want on a modern laptop. It runs both Android 5.1 and Windows 10, it comes with a USB Type-C port, it also features 64GB of eMMC storage, but also boasts a TF card port if you want more space. Micro HDMI is also available if you want to connect it to an external screen, and so are Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi. There are also two cameras for photos and videos calls, and the front-facing one comes with 2 megapixels while the rear one features 5 megapixels. And that’s not all. The CHUWI HiBook features a microUSB slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack (heard that, Apple?), as well as two speakers - the quality of the sound, however, isn’t really impressive, and we’ve found ourselves using the headphones more often just because of the poor quality. CHUWI HiBook side view THE BOTTOM LINE In the end, CHUWI HiBook is living proof that the Chinese are no longer building just cheap devices that offer terrible quality and products leaving a lot to be desired. The HiBook is an interesting combination of premium look and decent hardware, and when you add an affordable price, the result is compelling, to say the least. Truth be told, the HiBook can’t really be a productivity machine, and this is only because the hardware doesn’t meet expectations, and at certain times, Windows 10 becomes painfully slow. In Android, the device runs everything more smoothly, but there’s no other option than Windows 10 if you really want to be productive on the go (we’re pretty sure that many of you won’t agree with us here, but when it comes to working, Windows is clearly a better option than Android). The HiBook, on the other hand, can be used as an occasional device that lets you perform certain things, such as browsing or chatting, more quickly while on the go, but nothing beyond that. Fortunately for those who hoped CHUWI HiBook would not be the typical Chinese product, the old saying claiming that what you pay is what you get isn’t entirely valid right now, and for the price of this 2-in-1, you actually get plenty of stuff. Obviously, this doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone should buy it, but it shows that Chinese products are improving. It’s not yet the revolution, but it’s a good place to start.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (20 Images) #CHUWI#Windows 10#Windows 10 laptop#laptop review#Android laptop subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it CHUWI HiBook (20 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Band 2 vs. Samsung Gear Fit 2: Battle of the Bands Microsoft Band 2 Now Super Cheap in the US As Third Generation Debut Nears The Free Upgrade Brought Windows 10 on 20 Percent of the PCs in the World Microsoft Confirms Surface Pro 3 Battery Issues, Promises Fix Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 20 photos    CHUWI HiBook running Windows 10 New Apps Dopamine Portable: Seamlessly organize your music collection and find your favorite tracks based on title, artists, genres, albums or playlists with this software solution Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Seymour: Browse through, edit, convert and arrange your photo collection in categories based on the author with this user-friendly application Dopamine: Keep your music collection neatly organized based on albums, genre, playlists or tracks so you easily find tracks using this music player Vectorworks: Designed for professionals, this application enables you to create architectural designs, landscapes, theatrical productions and more Portable PhotoLine: A simple to use application bundled with photo editing functions that allows you to enhance, distort, as well as paint over an opened picture Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Reader comments Load old comments   Fitbit Blaze Review - Jack of All Trades, Master of One more on: Fitbit i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Share People on borrowed time Independent.ie Can computers learn from experience just as you and I do every time we get behind the wheel? The answer apparently is yes, so thinking cars are set to become science fact, not science fiction. And the reality is that cars may become better drivers than humans. http://www.independent.ie/life/motoring/car-news/people-on-borrowed-time-34963402.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article34963308.ece/5fdee/AUTOCROP/h342/Main25People.jpg Email Go To Comments Tech companies such as Intel and Google and major car corporations, including Toyota, are sending cars in to real world driving situations to "learn" how to avoid accidents. And the developments are timely, as some European countries - Spain for example - are drawing up lists of guidelines on restrictions that over-65s may face on their driving licences in the not-to-distance future. These include limits on mileage per journey, speed, driving on motorways and driving at night depending on medical condition. A fully trained car could come to the rescue. Scientists are working on deep-learning frameworks which will evolve today's semi-autonomous cars into self-driving vehicles that can handle all traffic scenarios, in all environments, by learning from experience rather than being pre-programmed for every eventuality. Deep-learning frameworks is a form of artificial intelligence, which scientists plan to build into on-board computers which can learn to make big calls, like choosing between hitting a bus queue or a stray dog. The deep-learning frameworks technology gets computers to mimic neurons (cells in the human body specialised in carrying messages through an electrochemical process - the human brain has approximately 100bn neurons) by creating artificial neural networks to quickly absorb and pass on information on road and traffic conditions. Toyota has invested $1bn into its Toyota Research Institute which has autonomous vehicles as a priority and Intel has acquired Altera, a maker of programmable logic devices with automotive applications for $1.6bn. Experts at both companies are developing autonomous cars that not only adhere to set protocols like keeping between white lines, but react to unpredictable scenarios too. Toyota research expert Dr Gill Pratt says that part of the Institute work is to focus on augmenting machine learning and measuring the robustness of systems for all types of scenarios, while Altera's partner in the UK, i-Abra, is developing deep-learning frameworks for autonomous cars. "Ultimately you are trying to replace human sense and action with artificial intelligence by acting on data collected from the car's sensors, cameras, radar and maybe audio," says managing director Ian Taylor. "If bricks fall off a truck the idea is to stop the car as quickly as possible," he says. "The car can learn from experience and then share the experience across a fleet that is constantly connected. The moral maze is presented every day to humans - do you hit the deer or the tree? If a human can make the decision, a computer can too." Taylor admits that machines are fallible but far less so than humans. "The fully autonomous car would not only have more experience than a 17-year-old driver, but also his father. Autonomous cars will also save fuel, cut journey times and save lives," he argues.

The claim was reported Monday morning by the UK Daily Mirror, which provided no further details.

ISIS claimed responsibility for a massive bombing in Kabul three weeks ago, which claimed over 80 victims. Update, 10:45 AM EST: A spokesman for the NATO-US mission in Afghanistan has debunked the Islamic State’s claim of assassinating a U.S. military commander. “That claim is false,” said Adam Stump, a civilian spokesman at the Pentagon. “No Resolute Support people, U.S. or otherwise, hurt in today’s IED attack in Kabul, which targeted an Afghan army vehicle.

Penney Is Still Not Out of the Woods Icahn’s CVR Corp. Said to Be Readying Offer for Delek Holdings (DK) Articles > Market Commentary > NVIDIA’s Rally Still Has Legs NVIDIA’s Rally Still Has Legs Despite concerns about its valuation, NVIDIA (NVDA) has managed to breach its all-time high levels multiple times this year. The stock is up almost 150% since its February lows and it looks like its rally still has legs. The company reported robust quarterly results yesterday, showing 27 percent year over year and 9 percent sequential top-line growth. On the other hand, the company’s operating expenses surged 6 percent whereas its operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share escalated 65 percent, 65 percent, and 56 percent on a year over year basis, respectively. Considering NVIDIA’s robust results, it can be surely said that the company’s new “Pascal” architecture has started paying off, as its GPU business surged 25 percent as well as its Tegra Processor surged 30 percent throughout the year before period. On the other hand, the company detailed that its GPUs are being installed in an escalating number of data centers for machine learning purposes, as they are designed to process certain science applications at a hastier rate compared to Intel’s industry-standard Xeon processors. Furthermore, NVIDIA whirled its Tegra mobile chips in the direction of connected cars, which gave it strong traction in infotainment systems and onboard PCs for autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA recently launched its new Pascal-based graphics cards that included the likes of GTX 1080. However, the company is now on its way to launch its new monster graphics cards, Titan X. As per testing performed by TechPowerUp, the Titan X is approximately 31.5 percent hastier than the GeForce GTX 1080 in games at a stunning resolution of 3840 by 2160. Great thing comes at great prices, and same is the case with NVIDIA’s Titan X, as it will be available in the market for around $1,200. Apart from this, NVIDIA’s chips are also being used to power infotainment and navigation systems. BMW, Tesla and Honda account for the major automakers and all of them uses NVIDIA’s chips for various purposes. The company is still growing rapidly in several high-growth sectors, which is why, after triple-digit returns; I am still bullish on the stock going forward. Conclusion NVIDIA’s recent results show that the company still has a lot of room to grow. Due to the company’s presence in several high growth markets, NVIDIA should continue moving higher in the long run. Thus, I think investors should ignore the valuation concerns and continue buying NVIDIA. Published on Aug 15, 2016 By Prudent Investor Copyrighted 2016. Content published with author's permission.

The Annual Conference, which takes place from September 25 through September 28 in Orlando, Florida, bills itself as providing end-to-end supply chain solutions. Its 16 session tracks cover topics such as demand planning, government and regulations, manufacturing and service operations, order fulfillment and customer service, procurement and supply management, transportation and logistics, and warehousing. The seminars include analysis of current research and surveys, panel discussions with industry thought leaders, and case studies from such big-name companies as Airbus, Dell, Intel, and Nike. These 30-plus hours of educational sessions promise to investigate not only the latest supply chain technology trends, data analytics, and economic analysis but also real-world strategies for process improvement, profit maximization, budget oversight, and talent development and retention.? The last day of the conference will feature three in-depth "mega-sessions" looking at hot topics in supply chain management. In "Is Your Business Intelligence Really All That Smart?" presenters will focus on how companies can harness big data and analytics to improve supply chain efficiency and productivity. For the second session, a panel of experts, including supply chain executives from L'Oreal, Mars, and Michael Kors, will investigate innovations in the supply chain and how to lead change within your organization. Finally, in "Inside Track: Real-Life Solutions that Work for Supply Chains," panelists will share stories about their greatest hits and misses in transportation, logistics, and customer service. In addition to the educational sessions, the conference also includes the Supply Chain Exchange, an exhibition of leading supply chain products and services. At the Exchange, attendees will have the opportunity to view demonstrations, equipment, systems, and technologies that provide cutting-edge solutions to a wide range of supply chain challenges. You'll also get an in-depth look at the parts that make up a top-performing supply chain.

The code for the new Fuchsia operating system, as it is described on GitHub, was posted over the weekend. The open source operating system supports 64-bit ARM and Intel-based PCs and will soon support the Raspberry Pi 3. There's speculation that this new OS may well be designed to power Google’s smart home efforts, such as the Google Home gadget. Related: 8 Android Nougat features worth chewing over It’s not yet clear what Google, if anything, plans to do with Fuchsia, which looks like it may have a Material Design-based UI. This may be an experiment that never makes it to market, or it could be the software that eventually unites Android and Chrome. As Android Police, which explored the code, points out, the company may also be developing a third, lightweight OS that’s akin to Samsung’s Tizen.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Phase change memory can operate thousands of times faster than current RAM Phase change memory can operate thousands of times faster than current RAM By Joel Hruska on August 15, 2016 at 1:47 pm Comment As existing scaling methods for memory and logic (CPUs) come to an end, researchers have been searching for next-generation alternatives to conventional DRAM and circuit design. Phase change memory has a lot to recommend it as a long-term replacement for DRAM — it’s fast, it can retain data for long periods of time, and Intel’s Optane / 3DXPoint is thought to be partially based on phase change memory technology. One of the principle concerns with any new technology is how much the new design can potentially scale. Switching to a new memory type isn’t trivial and chip designers want to know what kind of performance they can expect in 5-10 years, not just the next 18-24 months. Now, new research from a 19-member team of scientists led by Aaron Lindenberg at Stanford has shown that phase change memory can begin to switch between its two states (amorphous and crystallized) on the picosecond timescale. Conventional DRAM operates at nanosecond timescales, which means phase change memory could theoretically be thousands of times faster than conventional RAM. The gap between memory and CPU performance In theory, phase change memory could eventually present a solution to the so-called memory wall, or memory gap. The major problem with DRAM is that while memory clock speeds have increased enormously over the past 30 years, memory latency has dropped much more slowly. Typically latency increases with every clock speed jump; DDR4-3200’s memory cell cycle time in nanoseconds is roughly on par with DDR3-1600, and DDR3-1600 is on-par with DDR-400. Phase change memory (PCM) works by shifting between two states: An amorphous state with high resistance and a crystalline state with low resistance. The question that Dr. Zalden’s team set out to answer is how quickly does phase change memory begin to change from one to the other, and whether we can take advantage of the speed. Here’s where things get a bit odd. What Dr. Zalden’s team found is essentially this: Exposing phase change memory to a 0.5THz electric pulse for picoseconds at a time can create crystallized filaments that can be measured and theoretically used to store data. Remember, memory fundamentally works by creating a measurable state we can label as a 0 or a 1 (on or off). The ability to create crystal filaments within a memory cell at the picosecond timescale means that next-generation memory might finally close the latency gap with CPUs. These crystalline filaments come into existence while the bulk of the material is still amorphous — but they represent a difference in state that can be measured and therefore used. If you need a rough analogy, imagine a marsh or swamp that stretches for miles. People who wish to cross the swamp must trek across it on foot. Draining and dredging the swamp would be extremely expensive and time-consuming. What this research paper shows is that it’s possible to create a floating bridge across the swamp without going to the trouble of draining the entire area — and this bridge can also be reversed (removed, in our analogy) without harm to the underlying material. If you leave the bridge in place, it’ll stay there and continue to provide a useful function — drastically reducing how much time it takes to cross from Point A to B. That said, there are some significant barriers between us and memory that’s orders of magnitude faster than anything on store shelves today. THz pulses haven’t been created in circuit boards yet as far as we’re aware; the signal doesn’t propagate well down the thin copper wires used in modern designs. Now that we know that phase change memory can switch so quickly, however, we also know that there’s more potential headroom in design than some may have previously thought. This is more critical than you might think. One issue we’ve covered repeatedly at ExtremeTech is the rapidly rising cost of next-generation fabs and foundries. These costs have to be justified by product sales and overall performance — and while you might think this makes companies hungry to find solutions, it also makes them wary of betting on unproven technologies that might never fulfill their potential. Proving that phase change memory can operate at picosecond timescales doesn’t guarantee that the tech will replace DRAM, but it does demonstrate that PCM could potentially operate at frequencies that DRAM can’t touch. We spoke to Peter Zalden, first author on the paper, who confirmed to us that the strength of today’s research is that it confirms the speed of PCM while simultaneously offering a much lower-power solution due to the absence of leakage currents. Given that Intel’s Optane memory technology is at least theorized to rely on some principles of phase change memory it’s possible that we’ll see a renewed focus on this technology over the next several years.

There are a few ways the tech industry has serviced this need, most notably cloud storage and Video-On-Demand. For those with home entertainment and central file server needs, the cut-and-dry method seems to gravitate towards a home NAS system, with the more robust being SOHO (small office home office) solutions. I’ve never used a NAS device before, so the dual bay QNAP Turbo NAS TS 251 was as much a learning experience as it was a test of its features and capabilities, something I came to enjoy quite a bit. Priced at around R5 700 just for device excluding any hard drive makes the NAS seem a touch expensive, but there are many redeeming factors and qualities to justify investing in a NAS device given the features on offer. The NASty Bits NAS devices are pretty much mini-computers with a dedicated purpose—centralising control of your home networking capabilities. To do that requires some hardware capable of dealing with many devices connecting to and making use of its storage and applications. To run these tasks the NAS has a Intel Celeron J1800 CPU, a nimble 2.41GHz dual core CPU with an “Al-Gore approved” 10W TDP. This particular unit comes with a 1GB of low power DDR3 RAM, which is upgradeable to 8GB. Bear in mind that the unit only has two DIMM slots, so upgrade accordingly. The unit also comes with two Gigabit Ethernet ports, so it has more than enough throughput to your router. Coming with two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 ports mean it has enough connection options for a variety of devices. This dual bay NAS device is lightweight, even with the 4TB Western Digital Red hard drive installed. The unit is small enough to fit alongside or under your desk or within a breathable space in your TV cabinet. Its white finish may be more “chic” than I am used to, but I found it more or less “Feng Shui” enough for my Qi—i.e it’s not horrible looking. A surprisingly pleasant feature was the stubbornness of the unit—even though there are no suction cups or hardcore rubberised feat, the material they use on the feet is simply excellent at keeping it in place; perfect if you have little ones or a cat who doesn’t want you to have nice things. My First Time…Setup Placing the unit was simple—right next to the router by my desk. Proximity to the device itself does mean the spinning disk is heard, but it’s a sound that I found at worst to be mildly audible when doing heavy lifting tasks like transcoding or installing new applications. Setting the unit up was a simple affair—simply screw the Hard drive in place, power up and plug the Ethernet cables into a router and use the QR code on the side of the unit to access, add and set up the unit through the myQNAPcloud interface. Installation using my cellphone threw up some errors, so eventually I went through setup on the desktop. The instructions were simple to follow and after about 20 minutes the device has been setup and paired to an account with a username and password. To access the device you can either install Qfinder Pro which is a “top layer” software interface to access your NAS or change some basic setting. For the more robust features, you have to access the device itself via IP. Related:   G.Skill RipJaws KM 780 RGB Review: Young, Dumb And So Pretty Performance, Interface and Features The initial interface appears very neat with your installed apps and is almost mobile-like in its layout—moving to the top “hambuger” icon revealing more apps and system options, with the control panel section that opens up a layout familiar to desktop users—it is also far more intimidating for fist timers as you’re presented with a ton of unfamiliar icons and words like “LDAP Server”. Although jolting at first, eventually the interface and navigation opens up as you explore the different options, settings and apps. Once you are really “jacked” in to the device it reveals itself to be a very feature rich device with loads of apps to use, from business to entertainment apps all the way to apps that turn your NAS into a virtualised cloud storage device. If a NAS device is meant to simply store, manage, backup and share files over a network, then the QNAP 251 delivers superbly in this regard. But then again, so do many other NAS devices. To truly stand out, software and ease of use are key, and I believe QNAP has delivered in this segment as well. Besides the included default apps covering media functions, business apps and server tinkering, the App center reveals an ever larger swathe of apps to download. For the more tech-savy user the QNAP 251 is capable of creating Virtual Machines. This opens up the device to a lot more creative use case scenarios, where for instance you can have a business centric VM for your online store while the main OS on the NAS is a file server for home entertainment. Sadly, this unit had that capability chopped off at the knees since the device needs at least 2GB of RAM to create a Virtual Machine, and this unit only shipped with 1GB of RAM. Since I don’t have a business to run, a blog to update or a VM to create, I used the NAS how most would use it—as a media and file server for the home. I was also unable to test the RAID 1 capabilities  such as RAID 1 rebuilding or backup functions since I was only sent one HDD and I did not have a spare to use with it. Copying over the network yielded a consistent 11.1 MB/s,  but for the quickest results using a USB 3.0 external to copy to the device was much faster. It has you covered in the download department as a low power torrent box with an okay default torrent client. For media consumption the standard music, photo and video application could do with some more “modern” touches, but for the most part they perform just fine. Some BluRay/MKV rips of mine could not play through the standard video player/XBMC player on my Xbox, so using Plex Media Server proved to be the most rewarding. Although, the NAS has a transcoding card up its sleeve which helps make it a very capable pseudo-cloud entertainment driver. Related:   ASUS ROG STRIX GTX 1080 OC Review: Aura-inspiring Plex Media Server transcodes on the fly, and for home PCs with a modern i3 or better CPU, this CPU intensive transcoding on-the-fly is a piece of cake; for this little dual core Celeron, not so much. On-the-fly transcoding would bring the Celeron to its knees and slow down the unit far too much.  As a work around QNAP have built in an automatic transcoding feature in which you can set the NAS to automatically (either at set times or when new files are added) transcode and convert files that are in specific folders. It’s capable of converting files to 1080p and down 240p. Be warned, though, the most recent Codex update meant that transcoding some MKV files and video using DTS audio became unsupported, requiring me to manually install an older Codex to retain those capabilities. The on-the-fly and automatic transcoding feature is great if you travel a lot and want to access your media while being limited to a home ADLSL internet upload connection of 512KB/s. I’m typing this as I’m watching media on the NAS while waiting for my flight to Taiwan in a few hours—so, pretty nifty, especially if you have a better home connection. The presence of an HDMI port also means this NAS, if connected to the internet while connected to the TV, can effortlessly transform your TV into a pseudo Smart TV. The HybridDesk Station App comes chock full of apps like Kodi, iTunes and Plex, Skype, Facebook, Google Chrome and even Youtube. The HybridDesk Station app does need to be installed through your computer initially, but if you are looking for a easy plug-and-play entertainment box, look no further. The only sticking point is if you don’t have your NAS connected to the internet while connected to the TV, you cannot use your phone as a remote control. You can, however, make use of wireless mouse or keyboard and use the aforementioned USB ports to power them. The kind of effortless portability and instant functionality is something you don’t really get with a HTPC. Conclusion: It’s very NAS As a first time user of any sort of dedicated NAS there is not a great deal of past experience I can bring towards evaluating NAS devices beyond their stated capabilities as a centralised home server, something a regular HTPC can be used for. The only sticking point is the price; one could build a cheaper HTPC box with a hard drive included than for the price of the QNAP Turbo NAS 251. However, what you lose out on is an easy plug-and-use setup, portability and ultra low power consumption, let alone the mountain of apps and features you can use it for. Although I could not test the device along more business applications or make use of its RAID 1 functions, for those who do work from home, this could very well serve as small business server for those running a home business, provided you make sure the unit you buy comes with more RAM and you get two hard drives for RAID 1 failsafe options.   Share this: Twitter Reddit Facebook WhatsApp Google More LinkedIn Pinterest Telegram Pocket Conclusion Reviewing the QNAP TS 251 was a learning and illuminating experience in the world of NAS devices. Not simply “dumb” file servers I can happily say that I am starting to take them seriously as a replacement for a dedicated HTPC/Home server machine, especially when the level of App support and ease of use is so robust.

 BMW will release self-driving cars in China in 2021 Danielle Muoio Aug. 15, 2016, 9:29 AM 2,558 facebook linkedin twitter email print BMW's driverless concept car the Vision Next 100. BMW BMW is ramping up its driverless car efforts. The German automaker is planning to release self-driving vehicles in China in 2021, Maximilian Doemling, senior manager for highly automated driving at BMW Group, announced over the weekend at an artificial intelligence summit in China, China Radio International first reported. Doemling said future BMW cars will be able to drive autonomously on the highway by "pressing the button." The automaker is working with Intel and Mobileye to develop its self-driving cars. Mobileye is an Israeli firm that develops cameras and software so cars can "see" the world around them. It's a client of General Motors, but recently ended its partnership with Tesla. BMW is also committed to releasing an all-electric car with the autonomous capabilities in late 2021 as part of its Project i20. By 2025, the Project i20 will be fully autonomous. The automaker is also working to complete a ride-sharing program for driverless cars by 2021, Wired reported. As of July, BMW's fleet of roughly 12 cars had driven 1.3 million miles in autonomous mode, according to the report. By comparison, Google's driverless ar fleet has driven more than 1.8 million miles in autonomous mode as of July.

August 15, 2016 08:00 ET DT Research All-in-One Medical-Cart Computers First to Power Continuous Data Access at Point-of-Care Breakthrough Hot-Swappable Battery Design Eliminates Delays in Patient Care and Addresses COW Challenges in Healthcare SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - August 15, 2016) - DT Research, the leading designer and manufacturer of purpose-built computing solutions for vertical markets, today announced the DT590 series of All-in-One Medical-Cart Computers, integrating small and inexpensive hot-swappable batteries to facilitate mobility for healthcare applications. The unique design of the DT Research Medical-Cart Computers addresses long-standing challenges with Computers on Wheels (COWs) and Workstations on Wheels (WOWs) by providing a cordless, lightweight, and anti-microbial computer system that operates continuously with batteries that can be dynamically changed. The DT590 series is the next generation of medical computing solutions, making data access efficient, optimizing staff workflow, and minimizing the total cost of ownership. "Doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals at hospitals, medical clinics, laboratories and retirement communities have been plagued by significant computer design deficiencies while trying to enter and access patient data at the point-of-care, which has been a gating factor for many care facilities to fully embrace Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems," said Daw Tsai Sc.D., president of DT Research. "We studied the issues with COWs and WOWs -- all were related to unreliable, heavy, and expensive power supplies. Our focus for the DT590 series was to address the power supply issues, while also improving upon key medical computer functionality." The DT590 series features a vivid 19", 22", or 24" display with a high performance Intel® 5th Generation Core™ i7, i3, or Celeron processor in a compact, mountable package. It boasts a 3-bay hot-swappable battery system for zero downtime work environments to increase mobility over traditional workstations and decrease costs and maintenance associated with COWs. Designed to sustain at least one working shift without adding charged batteries, DT Research Medical-Cart Computers use inexpensive Lithium-ion batteries to combine for 250W capacity for up to 16 hours of runtime. With battery power and wireless connectivity, this computing solution is ideal for health professionals to manage patient information, dispense medication and work collaboratively. "Hospital Products Australia (HPA) has supplied the DT Research Medical-Cart Computers to a variety of healthcare facilities in Australia and the demand for the carts has been extraordinary," said Shawn Wigham, Managing Director of Hospital Products Australia. "Large healthcare facilities such as Royal North Shore, Bankstown and Gosford Hospitals have selected the DT Research Medical-Cart Computers as their preferred digital patient care solution. The computers offer clinicians a flexible workflow, enabling direct entry of patient care data into the eMR. The mobile solution eliminates the need for desk-based computers. Hospitals chose the DT Research solution for its unique mobility, durability and highly responsive touch screen design that streamlines patient care without compromising allocated hospital budgets." "Staff at many Midwest Health locations have to be available 24 hours depending on the care needed, so it was essential to have a battery that could keep up with the operating hours demand," said John Tryon, Network Administrator for Midwest Health. "Midwest Health looked at other options and found that the DT590 from DT Research had better battery capacity, faster processing, and was overall more reliable than other computers they tried. Now nurses at the various skilled care facilities are able to focus on personalized care rather than waiting for the computer to 'catch up'. Overall, the staff at Midwest Health has seen improved productivity, better service, and improved mobility with a reliable battery that allows the DT590 to operate anywhere. Midwest Health now has a tool to help make customer service a high priority." The DT590 series has the power and flexibility to fulfill multiple roles, whether the application is at-patient care, in the ICU, or administering medications. Each unit features up to 6 USB ports, 4 legacy COM ports, 2 HDMI-out ports supporting concurrent 4K resolution, and RJ45 LAN connection. An optimized operating system running Microsoft Windows® 7 or 10 means healthcare providers that have existing medical solutions do not need to have their applications and equipment re-engineered to run on the DT590 systems. With a VESA standard mount, the DT590 series is compatible to the various medical carts, desktop stands and wall mounts available. The DT590 Medical-Cart Computer series are purpose-built systems for medical environments with: 3-Bay Hot-Swappable Battery System Anti-microbial Coating Fanless Design IP65 Rated Front Panel - Water and Dust Resistant Legacy COM Ports 4K HDMI Dual-Output Medical Certifications - CB (IEC60601-1), CAN/CSA-C22.2 No.601.1, EN55011, FCC CFR47 Customizable Options DT Research offers customizable options for the DT59x series including an optimized OS, programmable buttons, and BIOS. Customers can choose to have the options below fully-integrated. Capacitive Touchscreen - 10-point Touch Smart Card / CAC-card Full-slot Reader RFID 13.56MHz reader (ISO 15693 and 14443 A/B compliant) Camera - 2 Megapixel with autofocus (DT590) The DT590 Medical-Cart Computer series takes full advantage of advanced Windows 10 IoT Enterprise OS security including Device Guard enterprise hardware and software security features that only allow the system to run trusted applications with TPM 1.2 or 2.0 support. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise also includes advanced Lock Down features that stop access to unauthorized USB peripherals, protect against malicious users, and increase system reliability. "Hospitals and healthcare facilities have a growing number of data-generating computers and IoT devices," said Helen Fanucci, GM of Americas Device IoT Experience at Microsoft. "Creating a complex mesh of connected devices need not be such a difficult task. The open device interoperability standards built into Windows 10 reduces complexities and simplifies connectivity among devices by enabling interoperability and communication across a range of devices regardless of connection specifics and OS platform."

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile iPhone 7 Plus Shown Off in the Black Color Variant With Its Rumored Dual Camera as Well By Omar Sohail Posted Aug 13, 2016 44Shares Share Tweet Submit There are several color models expected to be unveiled at Apple’s September event, when the announcement of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are kicked off. However, before the grand unveiling, here are some more photos of the phablet showing off its highly anticipated dual camera setup. Very Subtle Design Changes Between iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7 Plus – Check Out the Images Right Here From a design standpoint, there isn’t really much separating the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 7 Plus, but not if you look closely. For starters, the most prominent difference you will find out from iPhone 7 Plus is its dual camera setup present at the rear side, and if you look at the bottom side of the phone, the antenna lines are arranged much differently compared to that on an iPhone 6s Plus. However, perhaps the biggest difference is the color model shown in the images below, but do let us know what differences you were able to find from both handsets. Last year, when iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were announced, only Qualcomm was tasked with producing the LTE chips for the tech giant. This time however, Intel has also become a mass producer of LTE chips for the company, which is very shrewd thinking on Apple’s part. From a business standpoint, with both companies manufacturing LTE chips, Apple can easily negotiate the prices at which it wants to acquire these chips, and both Qualcomm and Intel will do their level best to provide the best possible deals to the company. In this way, Apple can guarantee itself a much higher profit margin with its iPhone 7 sales. Advertisement The iPhone 7 Plus is also expected to feature larger battery capacity, higher internal storage, as well as boast a new chip developing technology called FoWLP, which stands for Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging. Using this technique, smartphone OEMs, including Apple can heavily reduce the thickness of their future mobile devices because this particular technology does not require a PCB. Additionally, FoWLP also contributes to efficiency up to 30 percent, and combining Apple’s improved CPU design, optimized design and FoWLP, we have a real winner on our hands. The iPhone 7 Plus Resurfaces With Dual Camera Rumors Yet Again What did you think of the latest images of iPhone 7 Plus? Tell us your thoughts and concerns right away.

"The Race for Fusion," the cover read. "Why The Stakes are So High." It was the height of the frenzy about nuclear reactions at room temperatures, and the media was obsessing about how this "cold fusion" might solve all our energy problems. The minister said something about the marriage being a similar kind of miracle, and the crowd chuckled. Backchannel Softchoice Analysis Finds Few North American Businesses Taking Advantage of Windows 10 One year after the release of Windows 10, most North American businesses have yet to embrace the security and productivity upgrades of Microsoft's latest operating system – this according to recent TechCheck IT asset management analysis by Softchoice, a leading North American IT solutions and managed services provider. Softchoice Hacker demonstrates how voting machines can be compromised Concerns are growing over the possibility of a rigged presidential election.

CBS The first IBM PC was released 35 years ago today - How it changed computers forever On this day 35 years ago the first modern computer was released to the public. It was the IBM 5150 and the pioneer of personal home computing, thanks to its innovative design, specifications and price tag. Costing a hefty $1,565, which is the equivalent of $4,150 today (£3,200), the IBM 5150 wasn't necessarily affordable. But its small size and IBM's ability to produce a a high volume of them made it the first accessible computer on the market. The Telegraph Envisioning Bitcoin's technology at the heart of global finance A new report from the World Economic Forum predicts that the underlying technology introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin will come to occupy a central place in the global financial system. A report released Friday morning by the forum, a convening organization for the global elite, is one of the strongest endorsements yet for a new technology -- the blockchain -- that has become the talk of the financial industry, despite the shadowy origins of Bitcoin. The NY Times There's now a cryptocurrency created by participating in DDoS attacks Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have long been criticized for the absolutely insane amount of electricity and computing resources they require. As of last year, the Bitcoin network -- comprised of all the machines on Earth running the Bitcoin software -- used 6,000 times more computing power than the world's top 500 supercomputers combined to run the decentralized system that mines and tracks the digital currency. Vice The world cup of 'Rocket League' looked a lot like the future of eSports This past weekend saw the inaugural Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS), the world cup of boost-propelled football. It is not the first Rocket League tournament ever held but, as the game expands in popularity, developer Psyonix bet on its future in eSports with an ambitious tournament setup and a glitzy Hollywood finals. Parts of RLCS felt like a glimpse of the mainstream future for eSports, and it was all down to the game. Vice The Skylake Core i3 (51W) CPU Review: i3-6320, i3-6300 and i3-6100 tested Out of every generation of Intel processors, the headline acts are the high core count parts, the ones with a high-frequency or the most expensive models. Of course, any manufacturer that has a high performing halo product will want that story out of the door on day one, but for typical user sales, it is the mid-range that is more relevant. AnandTech - related read on TechSpot: The Best CPU for the Money: Intel Core i3-6100 Skylake Tested Tesla Model S and X with 100 kWh battery pack and ‘~380 miles of range’ approved by European authority The long-rumoured 100 kWh battery pack that will bring the Tesla Model S and X to a new level of performance is finally coming. After first being revealed by a ‘Tesla hacker’ through a cryptic message to Elon Musk 5 months ago, the new battery pack has now been approved by RDW, the Dutch regulator and European authority used by Tesla to approve its vehicles in for European roads. Electrek One in five vehicle vulnerabilities are 'hair on fire' critical One of every five software vulnerabilities discovered in vehicles in the last three years are rated "critical" and are unlikely to be resolved through after the fact security fixes, according to an analysis by the firm IOActive. "These are the high priority 'hair on fire' vulnerabilities that are easily discovered and exploited and can cause major impacts to the system or component," the firm said in its report, which it released last week. The Security Ledger Hackaday prize entry: An oven of Raspberry Pis When the Raspberry Pi was introduced, the world was given a very cheap, usable Linux computer. Cheap is good, and it enables one kind of project that was previously fairly expensive. This, of course, is cluster computing, and now we can imagine an Aronofsky-esque Beowulf cluster in our apartment. Hackaday MIT develops self-shading windows A team of researchers at MIT has developed a new way of making windows that can switch from transparent to opaque, potentially saving energy by blocking sunlight on hot days and thus reducing air-conditioning costs. While other systems for causing glass to darken do exist, the new method offers significant advantages by combining rapid response times and low power needs. MIT They quite literally don't make games the way they used to Spend any time with your grandparents and at some stage the age-old phase "they don’t make them like they use to" will pop up as nostalgia gets the better of them. Usually it's just the rose-tinted glasses talking, but for video games it's a fact: they quite literally don't make them like they used to.

If you’re looking for some ideas on what to invest in for the school year, we’ve compiled 11 great gadgets for use in the dorm room, lecture hall, or while walking around between classes. (While this week focuses on high-school and college picks, next week’s Surf Report column will look at educational tech toys for younger students.) All in the wrist Students are often on the run, and so a wrist-mounted smartwatch might be a convenient way to stay on top of your busy life. Crafted with stainless steel and strong glass, the Pebble Steel ($179.99) is Bluetooth-connected watch that talks to a nearby smartphone (Apple iOS or Android), and works with thousands of apps and customizable watch faces. Apps can show you who’s calling or texting, live sports scores, turn-by-turn navigation, fitness info, playable games, music control, and more. This waterproof watch comes with both metal and leather straps. Print, scan, repeat The HP Envy 5660 Wireless e-All-In-One ($149.99) is compact wireless printer, scanner and copier, that can produce lab-quality photos and laser-quality documents from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop -- even when you’re out of the home or dorm room. Other features include 2.7-inch color touchscreen, automatic 2-sided printing to save on paper, a 125-sheet main input tray, and support for HP Instant Ink, a smart service (from $2.99/month) that automatically sends new ink to your door when the all-in-one detects its running low. My buds The just-launched Samsung Gear IconX ($199.99) is a pair of wireless earbuds that can hold up to 1,000 songs on its 4GB of internal storage – therefore not taking up any valuable space on your smartphone – but can also wireless connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth, if you prefer. This teeny product has another trick up its sleeve: it’s also a fitness tracker that can give you audible info like speed, distance, duration, calories burned, and heart rate. After your workout, sync the Gear IconX with your Samsung smartphone for a deeper dive on your stats. On the surface Microsoft's Surface Pro series is catching on with users.  (Photo: Microsoft) There are tablets and there are laptops, but the Surface Pro 4 (from $899.99, not including 10 percent student discount) straddles that line between the two form factors. By day, write notes using the bundled Surface Pen on the 12.3-inch HD touchscreen. At night, prop up the kickstand, attached an optional Type Cover keyboard and crank out an essay. Or use your fingertips to flick through movies, games, or ebooks. Powered by an Intel Core processor and full Windows 10 OS, Surface also has a USB port, microSD slot, and more. Wham cam, thank you ma’am Want to make sure your college roommate isn’t touching your stuff when you’re not there? The mydlink HD Day/Night Wi-Fi Camera (model # DCS-936L; $79.99) is a discrete wireless camera that not inly saves recordings onto a microSD memory card – once it triggers sound or motion – but you can get notifications on your phone wherever you may be (and with no monthly fees). Along with night vision support and a wide-angle 130-degree lens to get more in, this camera also has a Wi-Fi signal indicator to help you find the optimal spot to place it in. What’s your type? Rather than lug a laptop between classes, students might only need a smartphone or tablet and Logitech’s portable and afford K380 Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard ($39.99). Whether you’re on an iPhone, iPad, Android, or Windows device, this one portable keyboard can be used wirelessly with up to three different devices. Along with multiple colors to choose from, a comfortable QWERTY keyboard and handy shortcut keys, battery life lasts up to 2 years (via two AAA batteries, preinstalled). Beam me up, Scotty When is a tablet more than a tablet? When it’s also a projector for your dorm room. Say, what? The Lenovo Yoga Tablet 3 Pro ($599.99) is a stunning 10.1-inch tablet with a trick up its sleeve: press a button on the side to splash a movie on your wall up to 70 inches. This Android-powered device also has a built-in kickstand, front-firing JBL speakers, expandable memory, and a killer battery that lasts up to 18 hours between charges. Thanks for the memory Your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s is a pretty sweet smartphone, but a clever accessory can expand its storage, boost its battery, and protect it from the bumps and knocks of every day student life. Starting at $59.99 (for 32GB), the SanDisk iXpand Memory Case can automatically back-up photos and videos from your camera roll, or let you play movies off the case so it doesn’t take up any internal storage. A 64GB and 128GB option is available, too. The optional $39 SanDisk iXpand Battery pack adds a magnetic 1900mAh boost to the back of the case. Music matters Add some boom to your dorm room with the House of Marley Get Together ($199.99). With a built-in rechargeable battery and integrated Bluetooth connectivity, this portable sound system is perfect streaming your tunes wirelessly from your favorite device. With front and back panels made of natural bamboo, as well as exclusive Rewind fabric (made from recycled water bottles, hemp and organic cotton), this great-looking speaker doesn’t just sound great but is also attractive and environmentally sustainable. More monitor While you might be happy with your existing computer, you might want to supersize your view. LG’s massive 34-inch LG UltraWide Curved LED Monitor (model #34UM88C; $908.99) offers a ton of real estate – ideal for serious multitaskers – thanks to its 21: 9 aspect ratio, which is like having two monitors side by side. Also recommended for movie lovers, computer gamers, and video editors, this IPS monitor offers Quad HD resolution, multiple connectivity options, and integrated speakers. Java junction College-bound students could probably use some good coffee to help them through long study sessions. The Keurig K200 Coffee Brewer ($119.99) is an ultra compact premium coffee maker – ideal for the tiniest of dorm rooms – and can brew in one of nine sizes, such as 4 oz. or 10 oz. cups, or even a full carafe for a late night exam cram. Available in white, red or black, the K200 also features separate settings for hot cocoa and other specialty beverages, like chai tea.

Mexicans carry more than 100 million mobile phones and only 15 percent use credit cards, making financial tech a lucrative nascent market. Yet Avila—whose family left Mexico in the 1990s only to return a decade later—faces a dangerous caveat to success. Espiral is based in Guadalajara, a place locals call the Silicon Valley of Mexico. With startups galore, and deep-pocketed multinationals like Intel, HP, and Oracle all tapping the relatively affordable engineers, this city is home to tech innovation. But what the guidebooks don’t tell you is that this place is also home to very real terror. Three police officers were killed in a rich suburb here in February—in broad daylight—days before I met Avila. Last year, buses were set on fire in downtown Guadalajara, blocking traffic and allowing cartel leaders to escape police. Last May, members of that same cartel used a rocket-propelled grenade to shoot a military helicopter out of the sky. Indeed, the drug-related violence in Mexico is leading Avila and other entrepreneurs to consider tough questions. “I think everyone in Mexico asks, ‘What happens if I’m successful?’” he says. Avila has a green card in the United States. He frequently travels to Los Angeles to visit his cofounder and cousin Francisco Diaz-Mitoma, who lives in Santa Monica, and was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2012; and Jason Kline, a third partner. With glasses and a thick beard, he resembles his U.S.-based partners in manner and speak. His English is flawless. He resettled in Riverside, California, at the age of two, and returned to Mexico at 13. Upon returning, Avila studied civil engineering at the prestigious Western Institute of Technology and Higher Education, calling himself a lifelong geek. But what Avila faces that his Yankee brethren don’t is the nagging question of whether the place he works is truly secure—and Avila calls Guadalajara safe by Mexican standards. Espiral has 650 clients in Mexico, and is already profitable. But it may soon become extremely profitable since Avila recently signed deals to handle all mobile transactions for the city of Tijuana, and the Caliente Group, which owns the soccer club Xolos. Espiral will allow visitors at stadiums to order food, drinks, and merchandise from their seats. And the Tijuana venture includes in-app payment processing, plus pre-installing Espiral into more than 800 tablets and readers in all of the city’s mobile payment venues. Espiral takes a cut from each purchase. The idea for Espiral came when Avila, Diaz-Mitoma, and Kline were vacationing in Sayulita, a hippie beach town adjacent to Puerto Vallarta. It was Christmas 2012, and the then-twentysomethings needed cash. Bars and restaurants wouldn’t take credit cards, and local ATMs “would charge $8 to $15 just for withdrawing, and there was a limit to $100 a day. That’s when we started brainstorming.” The trio tapped one of Avila’s cousins for an angel round and Espiral was born. “We got a couple coders from India, which led to a second round, and another $35,000 from a private group.” Kline, who has an MBA from Pepperdine, handled financials, and Diaz-Mitoma and Avila focused on business development. But Avila was the only one in Mexico—challenging from both a communications and day-to-day level. Feeling the stress, and solitude, he hired a full-time developer in 2014. Days would turn to nights and they’d still be working. And that’s when things really started moving, he says. Around that time, Avila landed his first major client after a one-hour meeting with Banorte, Mexico’s third-largest bank, turned into a four-hour marathon. At the end of the interview, Banorte signed on as a partner. Now Espiral had a banking system to facilitate transactions. With a legitimate financial institution’s support, Espiral gained immediate credibility. Avila then entered and won Naranya, a startup competition in Monterrey, which led to another $40,000 in funding and free office space in an accelerator shared by Google staffers. This co-working atmosphere helped him bounce ideas off of other entrepreneurs, many of whom were from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, places that felt many of the same financial woes as Mexicans. Alejandro Avila A year and a half later, Avila’s team has swelled to 15, and he’s now working with three large banks, and expanding beyond card processing. The next big play is remittances, which Avila says would allow locals to bypass their banks and use Espiral without paying transaction fees. “We’re going to try to compete with Google Wallet and Apple Pay with direct partnerships with the banks we work with,” he says. And with the city of Tijuana as a client, Avila says he doesn’t see himself going back to the U.S. anytime soon. Despite the potential for danger, he says, “I’m more comfortable in Mexico.” Someone has to be on the ground for meetings and management, he adds. Yet when pressed, Avila admits to worrying about security, casually mentioning last year’s narco blockades, and a recent clash pitting Uber and taxi drivers, which shut down the city for hours. And he gets more serious when he mentions that danger has hit close. Last year, Avila’s grandmother and aunt had secured a loan with Banamex, a bank owned by Citigroup.  They wanted to pay off a $25,000 debt, and got a loan for $30,000. But after they got the money and drove home, gunmen ambushed them and stole the funds. “Now they owe $55,000.” Like most entrepreneurs, no matter where they are, Avila’s chasing a dream. A chase that may make him grab a tiger by its tail. But if that leads to the wealth every founder dreams of, what choice is there but to keep tugging? Update: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the Avila attended the Monterrey Institute of Technology. He attended the Western Institute of Technology and Higher Education.

[Xinhua] German carmaker BMW says it is planning to launch self-driving vehicles in China. The plan was announced at a summit on artificial intelligence and robotics in China's southern city of Shenzhen. Maximilian Doemling, senior manager for highly automated driving at BMW Group, says the self-driving car will hit roads five years from now. "If you're expecting autonomous function where you can be on the highway, pressing the button and the car is doing everything for you, like lane changing and driving and that stuff, and you can play with smartphone, and you're always safe, I mean we had the big announcement with Intel and Mobileye that we will have the i-Next in 2021." The "i" series, which has two existing models, are electric vehicles manufactured by BMW. Self-driving vehicles is a field explored by quite a number of automakers as they seek new ways to boost sales. Google and Apple are also said to be interested in this area. IHS Automotive, an US auto market analysis company, estimates self-driving vehicles will account for around 10 percent of the global auto market in 2035. However, it's been suggested by analysts there is still a long way to go to manufacture a completely reliable driverless car. A fatal car accident in the US state of Florida earlier this year, which involved the autopilot mode of Tesla, a forerunner in exploring self-driving vehicles, has raised concerns about the safety of self-driving vehicles, even though Tesla has avoided using "self-driving" to describe its autopilot mode.

And since FreeBSD is used on a lot of servers, the default ports configurations (and the configurations that the official, FreeBSD package repos use) have those options disabled.

Photo / Alicja Grocz After 13 years in the digital business space and surviving the 2009 global financial crisis, Method Studio owners Sam Ramlu and Euge Eastlake know a thing or two about adapting to changing markets - and therefore changing times. Managing director Sam Ramlu sheds some light on Method Studios. What does your business do? We're a digital agency with a new-tech focus. What that means is we work on online, interactive and digital projects, anything from websites and games to currently augmented and virtual reality. What are the augmented and virtual reality projects Method Studios works on? At the moment we have one virtual reality project that we launched last year for UniTec and that was really an integrated experience. With augmented reality we've got a couple of things we're working on at the moment, but I probably can't say too much as they are at the prototype stages. Is the business owned by you and your partner? Yes. I look after the strategy and client side, and manage the business, and my partner is the creative and technical director. What gave you the idea for business? We initially set up because we saw a real market opportunity for really experienced-based websites. Continued below. Related Content Kiwi coconut milk startup expanding to Australia and US Small business: Catering to the gluten-free market Small business: BeezThingz For us it has always been about making the online experience engaging and interactive. At that point we had seen a lot of cookie-cutter websites and we wanted to make sure that people got the most out of their online experience. It is somewhere you spend a lot more time than you would in any traditional media so we saw real opportunities there. As the industry has changed in the last 13 years, digitally, we have grown with it and always aim to be at the fore-front of the market. Back then we were doing amazing experience-based Flash websites and then when mobile came in to play we moved along with that and when HTML was big and now this new virtual and augmented reality space. Method Studios' team. Photo / Alicja Grocz Along the way we have always worked with new technologies, but not just tech for tech sake. We've made sure there's been an actual reason to have it and that there is value compositions for it as well... and that actually brings to life the product of the story we are trying to sell or push. What big client names have you worked with? A lot of the projects we have done have had the agency name against them. We've done work for Intel, Microsoft, BayCorp, Harrison Grierson, Panuku Development Auckland which includes Wynyard Quarter, Bell Tea and Coffee Company, Unitec, Moccona, Honda, TVNZ, Dot Kiwi - a varied range of industries. What are the biggest challenges you have faced? I don't know if it is a challenge of sort, but one of things is keeping up with changing technologies. One of the things for us was that we were really big on Flash websites so when Flash started dying off we had to change the way we worked and the people we had working with us because it meant a whole new skill base. We found 2009 was really difficult for us with the Global Financial Crisis because we found that instead of people going in to digital and spending less money doing similar marketing, they did not want to take the risk with doing stuff online. In New Zealand specifically they were sticking to things they knew as they did not want to risk their dollars on something they were not sure about, so that was quite difficult for us. What has been the best thing you've done? The best thing we have done to date has been the work we have done for Heart Kids. Euge and I are partners, life partners as well. We had our son a couple of years ago and he was born with a congenital heart defect, had to undergo open heart surgery - it was massive - but eight weeks after that Heart Kids were looking for an agency and we sort of put our hands up and said, 'look we'll help you out'. We ended up being their agency for everything and last year we worked with them on their August Awareness month campaign (which is on again now) and did an amazing website for them which was first of all great for us to be able to give back and do something for a charity and it also allowed us to use our creative license a little bit. A little bit of help along the way is only going to help grow your business. Sam Ramlu The site has kind of gone accolade after accolade. We won a few online awards last year, we were up for a Webby last year and we have just found out that we're up for a Best Award as well. The work we have done through that and raising awareness for Heart Kids has probably been some of my proudest moments and our team's, just really proud of the work they did as well, sort of helping us because they know it is something close to our hearts. What advice would you give to other small business operators? I think getting the right team around you is important. We've had to wear a lot of hats so as quickly as you can you should try and expand your team, even if it's being a little bit smart about it. Recently we offered some unpaid internships just to get people in and getting them working on stuff before they became full-timers. It sounds really cliché but sometimes you have to spend a bit of money to get a little bit known out there. We've always been the type that has tried to do it all ourselves, but it can be really hard as a small business. A little bit of help along the way is only going to help grow your business. We did 12 years really hard and then thought 'well, we should actually be making the most of some of these opportunities and use them to our advantage.' - NZ Herald By Aimee Shaw Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Creative Commons Zero A few weeks ago, Citrix and Bitdefender launched XenServer 7 and Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection, which together compose the first commercial application of the Xen Project Hypervisor’s Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) infrastructure. In this article, we will cover why this technology is revolutionary and how members of the Xen Project Community and open source projects that were early adopters of VMI (most notably LibVMI and DRAKVUF) collaborated to enable this technology. Evolving Security Challenges in Virtual Environments Today, malware executes in the same context and with the same privileges as anti-malware software. This is an increasing problem, too. The Walking Dead analogy I introduced in this Linux.com article is again helpful. Let’s see how traditional anti-malware software fits into the picture and whether our analogy applies to anti-malware software. In the Walking Dead universe, Walkers have taken over the earth, feasting on the remaining humans. Walkers are active all the time, and attracted by sound, eventually forming a herd that may overrun your defences. They are strong, but are essentially dumb. As we explored in that Linux.com article, people make mistakes, so we can’t always keep Walkers out of our habitat. For this analogy, let’s equate Walkers with malware. Let’s assume our virtualized host is a village, consisting of individual houses (VMs) while the Hypervisor and network provides the infrastructure (streets, fences, electricity, …) that bind the village together. Enter the world of anti-malware software: assume the remaining humans have survived for a while and re-developed technology to identify Walkers fast, destroy them quickly and fix any damage caused. This is the equivalent of patrols, CCTV, alarmed doors/windows and other security equipment, troops to fight Walkers once discovered and a clean-up crew to fix any damage. Unfortunately, the reality of traditional malware security technology can only be deployed within individual houses (aka VMs) and not on the streets of our village. To make matters worse, until recently malware was relatively dumb. However, this has changed dramatically in the last few years. Our Walkers have evolved into Wayward Pine’s Abbies, which are faster, stronger and more intelligent than Walkers. In other words, malware is now capable of evading or disabling our security mechanisms. What we need is the equivalent of satellite surveillance to observe the entire village, and laser beams to remotely destroy attackers when they try and enter our houses. We can of course also use this newfound capability to quickly deploy ground troops and clean-up personnel as needed. In essence that is the promise that Virtual Machine Introspection gives us. It allows us to address security issues from outside the guest OS without relying on functionality that can be rendered unreliable from the ground. More on that topic later. From VMI in Xen to the First Commercial Application: A Tale of Collaboration The idea of Virtual Machine Introspection for the Xen Project Hypervisor hatched at Georgia Tech in 2007, building on research by Tal Garfinkel and Mendel Rosenblum in 2003. The technology was first incorporated into the Xen Project Hypervisor via the XenAccess and mem-events APIs in 2009. To some degree, this was a response to VMware’s VMsafe technology, which was introduced in 2008 and deprecated in 2012, as the technology had significant limitations at scale. VMSafe was replaced by vShield, which is an agent-based, hypervisor-facilitated, file-system anti-virus solution that is effectively a subset of VMsafe. Within the Xen Project software however, Virtual Machine Introspection technology lived on due to strong research interests and specialist security applications where trading off performance against security was acceptable. This eventually led to the creation of LibVMI (2010), which made these APIs more accessible. This provided an abstraction that eventually allowed exposure of a subset of Xen’s VMI functionality to other open source virtualization technologies such as KVM and QEMU. In May 2013, Intel launched its Haswell generation of CPUs, which is capable of maintaining up to 512 EPT pointers from the VMCS via the #VE and VMFUNC extensions. This proved to be a potential game-changer for VMI, enabling hypervisor controlled and hardware enforced strong isolation between VMs with lower than previous overheads, which led to a collaboration of security researchers and developers from Bitdefender, Cisco, Intel, Novetta, TU Munich and Zentific. From 2014 to 2015, the XenAccess and mem-events APIs have been re-architected into the Xen Project Hypervisor’s new VMI subsystem, alt2pm and other hardware capabilities have been added, as well as support for ARM CPUs and a baseline that was production ready has been released in Xen 4.6. Citrix and Bitdefender collaborated to bring VMI technology to market: XenServer 7.0 introduced its Direct Inspect APIs built on the Xen Projects VMI interface. It securely exposes the introspection capabilities to security appliances, as implemented by Bitdefender HVI. What Can Actually Be Done Today? Coming back to our analogy: what we need is the equivalent of satellite surveillance to observe the entire village. Does VMI deliver? In theory, yes: VMI makes it possible to observe the state of any virtual machine (house and its surroundings in the village), including memory and CPU state and to receive events when the state of the virtual machine changes (aka if there is any movement). In practice, the performance overhead of doing this is far too high, despite using hardware capabilities. In our imagined world that is overrun by Walkers and Abbies, this is equivalent to not having the manpower to monitor everything, which means we have to use our resources to focus on high value areas. In other words, we need to focus on the suspicious activity on system perimeters (the immediate area surrounding each of our houses). This focus is executed by monitoring sensitive memory areas for suspicious activity. When malicious activity is detected, a solution can take corrective actions on the process state (block, kill) or VM state (pause, shutdown) while collecting and reporting forensic details directly from a running VM. Think of a laser beam on our satellite that is activated whenever an Abbie or Walker approaches our house. In technical terms, the satellite and laser infrastructure maps to XenServer’s Direct Inspect API, while the software which controls and monitors our data maps onto Bitdefenders Hypervisor Introspection. It is important to stress that monitoring and remedial action takes place from the outside, using the hypervisor to provide hardware-enforced isolation. This means that our attackers cannot disable surveillance nor laser beams. Of course, no security solution is perfect. This monitoring software may not always detect all suspicious activity, if that activity does not impact VM memory. This does not diminish the role of file-system-based security; we must still be vigilant, and there is no perfect defense. In our village analogy, we could also be attacked through underground infrastructure such as tunnels and canalisation. In essence this means we have to use VMI together with traditional anti-malware software. How does VMI compare to traditional hypervisor-facilitated anti-virus solutions such as vShield? In our analogy, these solutions require central management of all surveillance equipment that is installed in our houses (CCTV, alarmed doors/windows, …) while the monitoring of events is centralized very much like a security control centre in our village hall. Albeit such an approach significantly simplifies monitoring and managing of what goes on within virtual machines, it does not deliver the extra protection that introspection provides. You can find more information (including some demos) about VMI, XenServer Direct Inspect API and BitDefender Hypervisor Introspection here: Xen Project Virtual Machine Introspection XenServer Direct Inspect API Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection Conclusion The development of VMI and its first open source and commercial applications show how the Xen Project community is innovating in novel ways, and is capable of bringing revolutionary technologies to market. The freedom to see the code, to learn from it, to ask questions and offer improvements has enabled security researchers and vendors such as Citrix and Bitdefender to bring new solutions to market. It is also worth pointing out that hardware-enabled security technology is moving very fast: only a subset of Intel's #VE and VMFUNC extensions are currently being deployed in VMI. Making use of more hardware extensions carries the promise of combining the protection of out-of-guest tools with the performance of in-guest tools. What is even more encouraging is that other vendors such as A1Logic, Star Lab and Zentific are working on new Xen Project-based security solutions. In addition, the security focused, Xen-based OpenXT project has started to work more closely with the Xen Project community, which promises further security innovation. A few of these topics will be discussed in more detail during Xen Project Developer Summit happening in Toronto, CA from August 25 - 26, 2016. You learn more about the event here.

As more devices get connected to the Internet and to one another, the magnitude of threat to our data too increases. Mobile phones were once considered safe in comparison to PCs. But not any more. India ranked the highest among 10 countries for total number of unique infections, according to the McAfee Labs Threats Report, June 2016. John Giamatteo, Corporate V-P, Intel Security Group, spoke to B. Pradeep Nair on emerging threats. Excerpts: What are the new challenges in the security landscape? One of the biggest challenges is the vast number of connected devices. The access points for bad guys have increased, making it easier for them to infiltrate. The number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices is expected to grow from three billion to 13 billion in the next four years. That means there are going to be 13 billion access points for the bad guys. Every hour more than 4.3 million attempts were made (via emails, browser searches, etc.) to entice our customers into connecting to risky URLs in Q1, according to the McAfee Labs Threats Report. The bad guys are more sophisticated than they have ever been. They are also better funded than they have ever been. What are the top security threats? The number one threat, in terms of growth and complexity of attack, is ransomware. While on PCs, it tends to encrypt files and demand money to unlock them, on Android devices, the trend is to lock the user out until a fee is paid. Miscreants also tend to make bogus legal threats to frighten users into paying up. There are also password breaches. The threat is so high that we built our own biometric solution. We have a product called True Key. It is a cross-platform application that uses facial features, the devices you own, like a phone, tablet or computer; fingerprint etc for flexible multi-factor protection. How vulnerable are our mobile devices? Very vulnerable. Especially in markets like India, where more and more people are skipping the PC stage and directly using the mobile devices for accessing Internet. So, mobile protection is one of our strategic initiatives. And we have made it very easy to get the solution cover all your devices. Now with IoT, we are extending the protection to wearables as well. We will soon introduce more device coverage. Our philosophy is security as a service that protects all your digital life, irrespective of which device you are on. We have partnerships with Samsung and LG, wherein our solution comes embedded in the device. Apps are driving mobile usage, but how safe are they? It’s major point of vulnerability. As many as 37 million devices were affected by malware coming from mobile app stores in the last six months, with mobile malware samples up 24 per cent in Q4 of 2015 itself. Our products are designed such that they constantly scan apps. We also tell what data is shared with the app, like location. There is also now the new trend of ‘mobile app collusion’. Here, different apps, that don’t pose a threat individually, in combination become dangerous. One of them could access local information, and it could transfer data to another app using channels for inter-app communication. The second app would then transfer the data to an outside device. What are the new ways ensuring the safety of consumers? We are employing new algorithms and other technologies, like machine-learning and cloud-based infrastructure. In June 2015, we had 100 million users; today, we protect 190 million users. With more users, we get more samples and all that data is fed into the Global Threat Intelligence system making the technology smarter. Another area we are looking at is the ‘home gateway’, or the Wi-Fi router. A heightened level of protection for Wi-Fi users could be compelling for telecom companies.

The goal, you see, is not to make one object shine, but to make the objects bleed together in synergy to make the entire effect shine.      PHOTO 1 2 3 4 Naoto Fukusawa’s deceptively simple Papilio chair 1 2 3 4 “My... work is to draw the line between substance and air... We have to design for intangible things.” -- furniture designer Naoto Fukusawa 1 2 3 4 Designer Naoto Fukusawa gave a lecture on his design philosophy as part of the 50th anniversary of Italian furniture company B&B Italia, with which Mr. Fukusawa has worked with since 2005. 1 2 3 4 The Titikaka resort bench, made of aluminum and teak, was inspired by the waves on a lake, and looks to some like an unfurled piece of fabric.    RELATED STORIES An unusual palette for fall A P200,000 mattress Personalizing one’s kitchen Dual purpose furniture for condos A good mattress means a good night’s sleep This, in a nutshell, was the point made at a talk given by designer Naoto Fukusawa, hailed in Bloomberg Businessweek as one of the world’s most influential designers. The magazine cites him as inspiring Apple and Intel in the 1990s. As for his personal oeuvre, he’s better known for creating more mundane objects such as a humidifier, mobile phones, and -- one of his best known works -- a CD player for Japanese home goods store MUJI. Mr. Fukusawa flew in to the Philippines for the 50th anniversary of Italian furniture company B&B Italia, distributed in the Philippines by Focus Global, Inc. Mr. Fukusawa has worked with B&B Italia since 2005, creating furniture which can well be described by the word “masterpiece”: think his Papilio chair, named after the butterfly, inspired by a butterfly spreading its wings. At first glance, it looks merely like a rounded blob forming the outline of a chair, with soft flares against its extremities suggesting the mere whisper of design. But ah! The rounded shape cradles the back and posterior, as if you were born for such a chair. Thanks to its popularity, the Papilio line has extended to include armchairs, and even a bed. For its 50th anniversary, B&B Italia released the chair covered in plush sheepskin. Mr. Fukusawa gave a talk called “The Outline of Things,” expressing the value and values of a line -- it sounds awfully simplistic, but Mr. Fukusawa’s deceptively simple design philosophies extend far beyond the chairs, the beds; integrating itself into life: as is the goal. “My... work is to draw the line between substance and air,” said Mr. Fukusawa, expressing the almost-mystical line in businesslike tones. “We have to design for intangible things.” By intangible things, Mr. Fukusawa focuses on air, light, smell -- the minor details that create the character in a room, more than the things in it. “It does not only show the object; it’s more kind of giving you a hint to live in a... [a certain] quality of life.” “You should see more [of the] ambient, not really focus too much... [on an] individual piece].” “I think, you have to be careful to make an exact line to fit into the life you already have.” The exact line, and life, draws from things such as a shared culture, history, and memory, among other things. “A designer is a road to making the things embodied, which we already share... in [the hidden] mind,” he said. “You and me, [we] share already some sort... of the images. I just embody it... to show you... those are the things [you like]. “How do you know? Because we all already share already the lifestyle background. That’s why, I know you... and I can make it... I can describe your soul in this way. “Design is a communication like that.” After his lecture, he explained to BusinessWorld what he needs to design. “I have to feel as someone else feels,” he said. “That is my kind of attitude... if I am happy, people should be happy.” His other pieces, although possessive of a simplicity of form, are not what he would call minimal, or minimalist: “This is not minimalist at all! This is quite radical.” See, for example, the Titikaka resort bench, made of aluminum and teak, inspired by the waves on a lake, looking to some like an unfurled piece of fabric. In any case, he credits the Japanese love of most things that are simple to a simple step. “Following nature... human beings are a part of nature... learn from nature, as harmony,” he said. “Nature means, not just nature, the environment. It’s nature as a kind of, human behavior...” As he told BusinessWorld: “It’s harmony. I think it’s not just to simplify. Minimalism is [more of matching] the surround[ings]. That’s why radical expression sometimes [needs] to be minimal.” Mr. Fukusawa then warns about the presence of ego in design; and how he frames it makes anything else other than the search for true form almost selfish. Many designers, he said, use design to try “to express the personalities, and the ego, or [a] message, or whatever.” “Design the things just for making your life better.” As he elaborated after the lecture: “Design is two parts: one is, expression of the artist. The other one is just to be of function; for use. A designer is just making the things as functional, not [just] for the part of expression of the maker.” The transcendence then, of design as mere expression, but a contribution to simplify lives, imbues a piece with the immortal, and leaves a lesson: “If people love... without ego, they keep loving forever. But once ego [is] detailed in it, they might be... bored of that.” The simple forms, bereft of ornamentation, can sometimes seem bland.

Thread: Dual Titan X and Thunderbolt with Asus X99 Deluxe II?

This recent build was working very well, first with GTX1080, then with a single Titan X Pascal I bought from a reviewer on eBay a couple of weeks ago. I went ahead and got a second Titan X to see if there was any appreciable improvement. System Details: ASUS X99 Deluxe II Intel 6950 M2 Samsung 950 Boot SSD 64gb RAM GTX 10 series Titan X (Pascal) Slot 1 Second Titan Slot 3 ASUS Thunderbolt 3 EX Card in Slot 5 I've been using this system with a single GPU without issue, but adding a second GPU triggered some kind of failure loop at power on, and a string of error codes repeatedly: 25, 41, 6F, 60, 68, 70, 79, 91, 95 I reset the CMOS, and the system will post, enter bios, and shows both GPU in the system manager. Because I'm using an M2 SSD, bios correctly shows X16/X8 lane configuration. After I enable the Thunderbolt card in BIOS, then restart, the system is again unable to POST - putting it back into a failure loop. Right now I've just disabled the Thunderbolt card while I play with the dual GPU setup, but if this is a long term solution I'd like to get both working at the same time.     #2   Ryan Canon View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jul 2008 Posts 138 08-14-2016, 10:46 AM I'm happy to share some performance feedback, if anyone has any requests. So far performance feels about the same in real world playback, with 8K full debayer playing back a bit better with both GPU. The single Titan X with half debayer is pretty great to work with on its own, though. I haven't done any transcoding tests, feedback so far is purely subjective.     #3   Andrei Goaga View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Jan 2015 Posts 255 08-14-2016, 01:22 PM Are you overcloking the CPU multiplier, or the BCLK?     #4   Ryan Canon View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jul 2008 Posts 138 08-14-2016, 06:37 PM With one GPU the system is stable at 4ghz.

Same string of error codes that resulted in continuous boot loop.

There are more reports of this, going back a year on other forums. I've seen another reference to dual GPU and Thunderbolt working with the Rampage board in this post, and that will probably be what I try next unless I receive any direction from the Asus support team.     #9   Maik Müller View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Oct 2009 Location Dresden, Germany Posts 1,973 08-16-2016, 12:30 PM Did you try to set the board to 3way sli to force it into a different split of PCIe lanes? It sounds like the board is assigning all the available lanes to the slots with the titans, then M.2 and ends up without having free lanes for the thunderbolt card... Just an idea.

I can't put a Titan in slot 5 because it interferes with the USB headers. I assume I could try 1 & 4 - I haven't done that yet. I could also try 5, and pulling the USB cables while I test. I'm also considering changing to a U.2 boot drive to get the SSD off of the lanes shared with PCIE Slot 3, and trying it in U.2_1 (which shares lanes with PCIE Slot 5). I'm not sure if this will make a difference, but I'm not sure what else to do.     Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Quick Navigation Post-Production HARDWARE Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

Maximilian Doemling, senior manager for highly automated driving at BMW Group, says the self-driving car will hit roads five years from now. “If you’re expecting autonomous function where you can be on the highway, pressing the button and the car is doing everything for you, like lane changing and driving and that stuff, and you can play with smartphone, and you’re always safe, I mean we had the big announcement with Intel and Mobileye that we will have the iNext in 2021.” Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Harald Krüger, said that the iNEXT will be, “our new innovation driver, with autonomous driving, digital connectivity, intelligent lightweight design, a totally new interior and ultimately bringing the next generation of electro-mobility to the road.” The new model is the centerpiece of BMW’s effort to defend its position in the luxury-car market as consumers’ preferences are changing and shifting towards electric and self-driving automobiles. BMW is responding to pressure from Tesla and traditional rivals like Mercedes as well as the potential iCar by Apple. IHS Automotive estimates self-driving vehicles will account for around 10 percent of the global auto market in 2035. However, it’s been suggested by analysts there is still a long way to go to manufacture a completely reliable driverless car.

But the exact nature of that change will be determined by the social, political, and business choices we make. A digital platform economy is emerging. Companies such as Amazon, Etsy, Facebook, Google, Salesforce, and Uber are creating online structures that enable a wide range of human activities. This opens the way for radical changes in how we work, socialize, create value in the economy, and compete for the resulting profits. Their effects are distinct and identifiable, though certainly not the only part of the rapidly reorganizing global economy. As the work by Michael Cusumano, Annabelle Gawer, and Peter Evans has shown, these digital platforms are multisided digital frameworks that shape the terms on which participants interact with one another. The initial powerful information technology (IT) transformation of services emerged with the Internet and was, in part, a strategy response to intense price-based competition among producers of relatively similar products. IT-enabled services transformation, as our colleagues Stuart Feldman, Kenji Kushida, Jonathan Murray, and Niels Christian Nielsen have argued in other venues, was based on the application of an array of computable algorithms to myriad activities, from consumption and leisure to services and manufacturing. The movement of these algorithms to the cloud, where they can be easily accessed, created the infrastructure on which, and out of which, entire platform-based markets and ecosystems operate. Platforms and the cloud, an essential part of what has been called the “third globalization,” reconfigure globalization itself. These digital platforms are diverse in function and structure. Google and Facebook are digital platforms that offer search and social media, but they also provide an infrastructure on which other platforms are built. Amazon is a marketplace, as are Etsy and eBay. Amazon Web Services provides infrastructure and tools with which others can build yet more platforms. Airbnb and Uber use these newly available cloud tools to force deep changes in a variety of incumbent businesses. Together they are provoking reorganization of a wide variety of markets, work arrangements, and ultimately value creation and capture. This digitally based new economy has been given a variety of names derived from some of its perceived attributes. How we label this transformation matters because the labels influence how we study, use, and regulate these digital platforms. Its boosters have called it the Creative Economy or the Sharing Economy, whereas those less convinced of its beneficence have dubbed it the Gig Economy, the Precariat, or the 1099 Economy, focusing on its impact on workers and how they are compensated. And there are wide variations within these labels. Consider the Shared Economy. Examples include Uber and Airbnb, which are very distant from the visions of Wikipedia, with its communal construction of knowledge; from Napster, which shared music regardless of whether it was legal; or from open source software creations such as Linux and Apache. Despite the attractive label and the entrepreneurial successes, Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook are not based on “sharing”; rather, they monetize human effort and consumer assets. Indeed, the advantage of platform-based companies often rests on an arbitrage between the practices adopted by platform firms and the rules by which established companies operate, which are intended to protect customers, communities, workers, and markets. Lyft and Airbnb are entrepreneurial initiatives that facilitate the conversion of consumption goods such as automobiles and apartments into goods that are monetized. This “sharing” has a more than passing resemblance to the putting-out economy that existed before factories, when companies would ship materials to people to assemble items such as shoes, clothing, or firearms in their homes. In the current manifestation of putting out, the platform operator has unprecedented control over the compensation for and organization of work, while still claiming to be only an intermediary. On the other hand, the rapidly growing mobile phone app stores and user-generated content platforms such as YouTube and Instagram are structured as digital consignment industries, borrowing from the way artists sell their work through galleries. We are in the midst of a reorganization of our economy in which the platform owners are seemingly developing power that may be even more formidable than was that of the factory owners in the early industrial revolution. We prefer the term “platform economy,” or “digital platform economy,” a more neutral term that encompasses a growing number of digitally enabled activities in business, politics, and social interaction. If the industrial revolution was organized around the factory, today’s changes are organized around these digital platforms, loosely defined. Indeed, we are in the midst of a reorganization of our economy in which the platform owners are seemingly developing power that may be even more formidable than was that of the factory owners in the early industrial revolution. The proliferation of labels is simply a reflection of the recognition that platforms are already having powerful consequences for society, markets, and firms, and that we are unclear about their dynamics and directions. Whatever we call the transformation, the consequences are dramatic. Utopia or dystopia The debate about the impact of the platform economy is an extension of a discussion that began in the early days of the IT revolution, when figures such as Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs claimed that they were creating a future that would open the world to new possibilities and prospects. Optimists still abound, and San Francisco is now experiencing what may be its biggest gold rush yet, with investors, entrepreneurs, and data scientists working furiously to create “disruptive” new businesses. For investors, inherently optimists, the question is how to build platforms, attract users, and then capture the value that is generated from the emerging ecosystem. Regardless of the platform, all of them are based on mobilizing human beings to contribute. Whether it is Google monetizing our searches, Facebook monetizing our social networks, LinkedIn monetizing our professional networks, or Uber monetizing our cars, they all depend on the digitization of value-creating human activities. The optimistic version of the emerging techno-economic system suggests that society can be reconstituted with producers becoming proto-entrepreneurs able to work on flexible schedules and benefit from these platforms. And this certainly will be the case for many. Similarly, the utopians argue that platforms, such as the car-sharing services Uber and Lyft, can unlock the commercial value in underused personal assets; other platforms, such as Airbnb, promote the notion that vacant rooms in one’s house or apartment can become sources of income whether technically hotel rooms or not. Advocates believe that all of this can occur for the greater social good without negative consequences. But can we really foresee all the repercussions of these new economic arrangements? For example, platform businesses matching workers and tasks may make labor markets more efficient, but if they become pervasive and organize a significant portion of the work, they are at the same time likely to generate fragmented work schedules and increasing levels of part-time work without the employment-related benefits that previously characterized much employer-based full-time work. For now, it is not clear whether these digital platforms are simply introducing digital intermediaries or actually increasing the extent of gig or contract work. Even as the digital era unfolded in its utopian phase in the 1970s, there were skeptics who feared that the new technologies would result in unanticipated and undesirable consequences. Perhaps most prescient was Kurt Vonnegut’s 1952 novel Player Piano, which even gave a bit part to the great mathematician Norbert Weiner. Vonnegut envisioned a digital future of material abundance—albeit a digital future of machines built with tubes, not semiconductors—with a radical social division between a highly credentialed and creatively employed elite and an underclass. His dystopian vision is now finding full expression in the fear that digital machines, artificial intelligence, robots, and the like will displace work for a vast swath of the population. Bill Davidow, once at Intel and then at his own Silicon Valley venture capital firm, expressed this in his Harvard Business Review article “What Happens to Society When Robots Replace Workers?” The MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee explore this trend in more detail in their book The Second Machine Age. The impact on employment and the character of work is certainly one element in assessing whether we will have a utopia or dystopia. In our view, that outcome is yet to be determined. As a society we will have to make choices about how to deploy new technologies, choices that will be critical in shaping the ultimate impact. The questions are really: what balance will there be among jobs created as the digital wave flows through our economy and society, and which workers will be displaced? Certainly it is feasible to catalogue existing work, particularly work that is routine, as likely to be replaced or reconfigured by digital tools, and perhaps, as some have tried, to estimate the numbers of such existing jobs that will be digitized away. By contrast, the new kinds of work that are now being created and the existing jobs that will be redefined and reorganized in the future are more difficult to forecast, so we can only speculate. Algorithms and databases are automating some kinds of work, but even as this occurs other value-creating opportunities are appearing. There will be new products and services as well as new production and service processes, which are likely to be design and creativity intensive, as well as algorithm-enabled. Some of the early indicators of the new or transformed work can be enumerated, but certainly not exhaustively counted. Moreover, existing jobs will be redefined and reorganized in the future. The character of some existing work—how much or how little, we cannot know—will be reframed but not eliminated by digital technology. Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Handy, and other platform firms are transforming industries by connecting “producers” with customers in new ways. In some cases, this is displacing or threatening existing, often regulated, service providers, such as taxis and hotels. In other cases, it is formalizing previously less organized or locally organized work. Still other platforms, such as app stores and YouTube, are creating entirely new value-creating activities that are formalizing into what can be seen as precarious careers, such as a YouTube producer or smartphone app developer. Finally, existing organizations are creating new digital and social media marketing departments and jobs. The question in these cases is what system of control and value capture will be in place. Our sense is not necessarily that there will be less work, but that for a growing number of jobs, the relationship with an employer will be more tenuous than ever. These changes are not likely to result in the workerless society. One possibility is a society in which the preponderance of the work and value creation is more dispersed than ever before, even as the platform owners centralize the transactions and capture their value. Indeed, we may, unless policy rules lock in the position of the emerging incumbent, see another round of innovation and job creation. The use of digital automation presents a classic dilemma: anything that can be characterized sufficiently to become computable can be copied, as our colleague Niels Christian Nielsen has argued elsewhere. At that point, another round of innovation and imagination will be required. Can automation innovate itself? More likely, teams of people and digital tools working together will be required to be competitive. The Turing test might be able to establish that a digital machine can imitate intelligence, but the test does not establish consciousness or consider whether human consciousness in all its diversity differs in fundamental ways from current algorithmic tools. The debate over jobs created or destroyed is useful and worth continuing, but we should be clear that it has no end, and there will be no definitive answer. For now, there are only indicators and traces to suggest an outcome. And that outcome, we emphasize and repeat, will be shaped by choices about technology deployment that turn on entrepreneurial initiative, corporate strategies, and public policies. As in the discussion of what is being called the Internet of Things or the digitally based reorganization of manufacturing, in our research with colleagues at the Research Institute for the Finnish Economy, we find significant differences among national emphasis and investments. German policy is directed toward maintaining its competitive position in manufacturing built on a base of skills and with a fabric of small and mid-sized companies even as the foundations of production evolve. The U.S. emphasis seems to be on developing and applying high-end sophisticated tooling for aerospace and military applications. On the consumer side, some communities have simply banned Uber and Lyft, whereas others welcomed it. Which communities, this leads us to ask, are most likely to be the sources and beneficiaries of the emerging platform economy? Which are most likely to be discomfited? Although technologies may not dictate our future, they frame the choices to be made and the questions to be answered. Will the platform economy, and the reorganization it portends, catalyze economic growth and a surge in productivity driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs? Or will the algorithmically driven reorganization concentrate substantially all of the gains in the hands of those who build the platforms? Will it spark a wave of entrepreneurial possibilities, unleash unimagined creativity, free workers from oppressive work schedules, or unleash an avalanche of dispossessed workers who are trying to make a living with gigs and temporary contracts? If we do not interrogate these technological trajectories, we risk becoming unwitting victims of their outcomes. What questions should we be asking? The key technologies The algorithmic revolution and cloud computing are the foundations of the platform economy. But computing power is only the beginning of the story. That computing power is converted into economic tools using algorithms operating on the raw material of data. The software layer that stretches across and is interwoven with the economy is a fabric of algorithms. That software layer, that algorithmic fabric, is being extended to cover manufacturing, giving birth to the Internet of Things, the Internet of Everything, or the Industrial Internet, with its implied webs of sensor networks. It is no exaggeration to say that software was formerly embedded in things, but now things—services as well as physical objects—are woven into software-based network fabrics. This software layer extends the availability and lowers the cost of access to digital tools and traditional tools accessed by and controlled by digital processes. Moreover, costs drop through the use of open-source software, cloud storage and computing, and physical spaces such as those provided by TechShops that enable individuals to work with advanced industrial-scale equipment. Among other consequences, this certainly lowers the cost of entry for newcomers. Cloud computing rests on the virtualization and abstraction of computing processes. One of us (Zysman) has examined the character, emergence, and deployment of cloud computing in work with Jonathan Murray, Kenji Kushida, Patrick Scaglia, and Rick McGeer. Although the details of how it works do not matter for this essay, the consequences do. For the providers of cloud services, scale matters enormously. For users—individuals, small- and mid-size enterprises, startups, and corporations—the consequence is a radical reduction in the cost of computing resources and information and communication technology tools, a radical reduction in barriers to usage. Users can rent resources as they require them rather than having to own or build entire computing systems. Computing and the applications and platforms it facilitates are now available as an operating expense rather than a capital expense. Digital platforms are complicated mixtures of software, hardware, operations, and networks. The key aspect is that they provide a set of shared techniques, technologies, and interfaces to a broad set of users who can build what they want on a stable substrate. Android and IOS are platforms. Although they somewhat restrict the applications that one can build or sell, they are, in general, open to app builders. Android is also a platform for hardware (handset and other device makers) because the code is open, not just the interfaces. Indeed, platforms can grow on platforms. Many of the current Internet platform firms use Amazon Web Services. Many of these platforms attract a myriad of other contributors that, when sufficiently rich, can result in the formation of an ecosystem. For example, in the case of the apps stores, complementary businesses are emerging. AppAnnie is a firm that ranks the revenue generated by apps; there are advertising agencies that analyze YouTube ad buying; TubeMogul classifies YouTube “stars” and measures their reach; and there has been a proliferation of agencies that cultivate new YouTubers. These “complementors” are powerful allies in building and maintaining the lock-in for the master platform. Of course, building a platform is work, but platforms themselves then generate or organize the work of others by providing the digital locations for the connections that organize work and other activities. A looser definition of a platform, as noted previously, is one in which social and economic interactions are mediated online, often by apps. For example, Uber, so far as we know, does not yet provide a platform upon which others can establish businesses, such as organizing a pizza delivery fleet. Nevertheless, as an algorithmic structure providing a digital market and potentially an ecosystem, albeit one it controls, Uber should be considered as a firm operating a platform. Digital platforms facilitated by key technologies such as the cloud, including digital marketplaces such as Amazon and Internet firms such as Google and Facebook, are restructuring ever more parts of the economy. The discussion is complicated because, as noted, there is not yet a clear definition of digital platforms that allows us to specify precisely what is in and out of the category. The term “platform” simply points to a set of online digital arrangements whose algorithms serve to organize and structure economic and social activity. In the IT world, the term means a set of shared techniques, technologies, and interfaces that are open to a broad set of users who can build what they want on a stable substrate. As used more widely, and by us in this essay, the term also points to a set of digital frameworks for social and marketplace interactions. Speculations aside, while there is a rich and emerging literature, at the moment there is no real theory of the effect of these diverse platforms on the overall economy. To sense the scope of the market and regulatory impact of the loosely labeled platform economy, let us consider some of the most salient types of digital platforms. In all these examples, across all the categories, the algorithmic underpinnings of the online activity are most evident. For example, Lyft connects drivers with customers algorithmically. The algorithms integrate mapping software, real-time road conditions, and the availability of drivers to provide a price estimate. Drivers are vetted through online checks, which, of course, work only as well as the data they have. Payment is made by credit card information that is on file. Economic consequences What we do know is that these platforms are in many cases disrupting the existing organization of economic activity by resetting entry barriers, changing the logic of value creation and value capture, playing regulatory arbitrage, repackaging work, or repositioning power in the economic system. As a starting place for discussion, we might ask the following questions about each platform or type of platform. How is value created? The platform economy comprises a distinctly new set of economic relations that depend on the Internet, computation, and data. The ecosystem created by each platform is a source of value and sets the terms by which users can participate. Who captures the value? Indeed, what is the distribution of risks and rewards for the platform users? There are a variety of mechanisms with various implications for gains distribution. Some platforms allow the owner to “tax” all transactions, whereas others monetize their services through advertising. Platforms can transform work previously done by traditional employees into tasks performed by contractors, consigners, or quid pro quo workers—or create entirely new categories of work. There are also what Gina Neff calls “venture laborers,” that is, the people who work at the platform firms. They receive high wages, and if the firm is successful, the value of the platform is capitalized in the stock market, resulting in remarkable amounts of wealth for the firm’s direct employees and entrepreneurs. If the firm falters or fails, these individuals must find new employment. There is also a growing cohort of what some call “mini-entrepreneurs” and others call “consignment workers,” who provide goods—usually but not necessarily “virtually”—for platforms such as app stores, YouTube, or Amazon Self-Publishing. Although the vast majority of them are unsuccessful or marginally profitable, some can be enormously successful, and despite the fact that this phenomenon is as yet unmeasured, it is clearly creating many new opportunities for entrepreneurship. In certain cases, particularly in apps, those in the consignment economy sometimes grow so large that venture capitalists will invest in the entrepreneur/firm, and the employees become venture labor. Some of these apps can become platforms themselves. Put differently, the consignment model has significant upside for participants, but it is accompanied by high risk. Who owns or controls the platform? The answer varies by platform, and the differences are important. The distribution of benefits differs considerably, for example, at these platforms: Wikipedia, where the network is managed by a consensus set of rules; the Danish Agricultural Cooperative platform, in which participant owners know one another and there are clear boundaries between inside owners and others; and Uber, in which the platform is owned by a small group of entrepreneurs and their venture capitalists and where the value will eventually be capitalized by the sale of a controlling interest through either acquisition or a stock offering. How is work packaged and value created, and what percentage of work is now organized in these radically new ways? What happens to the organizational forms of work? Certainly, some workers, such as those employed by Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook, retain traditional employment relationships. Although these firms expect long working hours, they also provide considerable scheduling flexibility as well as a variety of free food, drinks, transportation, and other benefits that can make them appear to be corporate paradises. By comparison, those who obtain work as gigs, consignments, or contracts through digital platforms have radically different experiences. Although they have control of their work hours, they rarely receive any other employee benefits. Conceptually, if not literally, Uber converts taxi company employees or former medallion owners into contractors, whose access to income is through the Uber platform, while removing government from the rate-setting equation. Are these contractors mini-entrepreneurs, employees in all but name, or yet something else? Further, what is the proper employment category for individuals who hope to be one of the winners by producing apps, YouTube videos, or self-published books on Amazon? In these activities, there is a power law of returns by which a few big winners are remunerated by advertising, product placement payments, personal appearance fees, and even crowd-funding campaigns, while a very long tail of producers are creating the vast bulk of consigned content without monetary return. Many are now concerned that rather than creating a new source of productivity we are legitimating a new form of putting out. Can Uber drivers be self-supporting contractors in a 1099 economy rather than stable workers in an employment economy, or are they just extremely vulnerable gig workers? And, more broadly, as Ruth Collier asks, what will be the consequences for mass politics and political structures? Are we generating labor market flexibility, or a precariat that resembles a cyberized Downton Abbey replete with a small elite composed of the platform owners and a new and sizable underclass? Making choices What sort of an economy and society will we create in the transition to digital platforms and the accompanying reorganization of significant portions of the global economy? And importantly, what choices will we have? Before we turn to the long list of issues, with each issue opening an array of questions and debates, two points need to be made. First, Larry Lessig famously claimed that code is law; that is, code represents binding restrictions on behavior. Algorithms and platforms structure and constrain behavior; the law in the books is often difficult to apply or enforce in the digital world where action is possible only if it conforms to frameworks expressed in the code that shapes and directs behavior. Consider the fight between the Justice Department and Apple; the warrant has no meaning if it cannot be executed in code; for the warrant to be implemented, the code would have to be modified. Platform entrepreneurs increasingly believe that if they possess a first-mover advantage, they can, in fact, remake existing law by creating new practices on their platforms that essentially establish new norms of behavior. It is often said in Silicon Valley, “Don’t ask permission; ask forgiveness,” as, perhaps, was the case with Volkswagen’s “fix” for “clean” diesel engines. Of course, this forces two sets of questions. First, who writes the code, and whose values are expressed in code? The code writers, taking Uber as an example, have already reshaped social behavior. Government rules will influence how the new technologies are deployed and their consequences, but in a platform economy, government decisions may be constrained by the “facts” in the software. Second, although public policies are obviously important, corporate strategies also have far-reaching effects. Do companies view workers only as costs to be contained or as assets—even in an era of algorithms, data, and robots—to be developed and promoted? And equally important, are those assets directly tied to the firm? Who should bear the costs of their retention and upgrading? Acknowledging the constraints of code and the centrality of company choice in shaping outcomes, our platform future, the character of market, and the social logic established will depend on an array of policy choices. What market and social rules are appropriate for a platform economy and society? Our old labels and categories, not just old rules, are being thrown into disarray. To begin sorting this out, let us start with the firm. In the late nineteenth century, the corporation emerged as a means of orchestrating economic activity and organizing markets. In the twenty-first century, we speculate that these functions will be taken on by the platform in the cloud. Take Google, the platform economy giant, which, despite its 2014 revenues of $66 billion, has only 50,000 employees. Uber has only about 1,500 employees and is already a global business. What policy and political issues arise when the orchestrators of economic activity are relatively small firms, rather than organizations as large as Ford Motor Company, General Electric, or General Motors—all of whom also require sophisticated supplier and distribution networks? It is evident that platforms open up many entrepreneurial opportunities. Some entrepreneurs, such as Robin Chase at Zipcar, envisioned an alternative social, not just economic, model because digitally enabled car sharing could dramatically reduce the incentive to own a car. If that model spread widely, it might result in a drop in overall demand for auto production. This may or may not disrupt Hertz (Zipcar was sold to Avis), but it might dramatically affect automakers. Indeed, automakers responded by developing partnerships with Uber and Lyft. In other words, such “sharing” solutions could have unforeseen ripple effects on entire market ecosystems, as encyclopedia and book publishers are discovering to their dismay. But many platforms by their very nature prove to be winner-take-all markets, in which only one or two companies survive, and the platform owner is able to appropriate a generous portion of the entire value created by all the users on the platform. More important, however, is that as the power is centralized, the platform owner can become a virtual monopolist. In that case, the platform owner can squeeze the platform community—the drivers or customers on Lyft or Uber, the content providers, the consigners, the customers, essentially any of the participants in the ecosystem who are instrumental in creating the value in the first place. Perhaps competition among platforms in a similar domain, Uber and Lyft for example, might mute the consequences of the power inside the platform. In any case, a monopoly position or even a strong oligopoly might inhibit, or sharply constrain, further entrepreneurial efforts. Indeed, the appropriate market rules for competition/antitrust, labor market, and intellectual property among many others are becoming increasingly difficult to specify and legislate. Policy and political interests among the players, even among the winners, are far from uniform. Consider such domains as antitrust policy, where the European Commission has done battle with U.S. tech companies; intellectual property, where the interests among information and communications technology firms and platform firms are less consistent than it might seem at first glance; network policy, where carriers such as AT&T have radically different interests from Netflix or Google; and labor market policies. Indeed, the wireless carriers have announced they will start blocking advertisements on smartphones, thereby directly attacking the Google and Facebook business models. As we have shown with Bryan Pon, the turbulent environment in the smartphone ecosystem is leading to complex competitive strategies that have technical, social, and political ramifications. The question of outcomes goes beyond the question of whether digital platforms spawn entrepreneurs or monopolists. We need to ask whether a society organized around platform owners servicing mini-entrepreneurs, contractors, and gig workers portends an even more unequal society. Does the answer depend on the character of platforms or on the policies and politics of the platform economy? The issues of entrepreneurship and those of work organization that we discussed earlier are tightly interwoven. The policies that we adopt now might determine the balances achieved later. If we want an entrepreneurial spirit to infuse the platform world, then we want risk-taking entrepreneurs, whether they are forming the platforms or seeking advantage as contractors or consigners within it. But what encourages risk? Fear, or a safety-net certainty that if a gamble fails, one can always play again? Similarly, if we want workers to accept the new arrangements, how do we assure them that if they accept the flexibility, they will not be the victims but rather the beneficiaries of the ever-greater social value and wealth that is being created? All studies of technology adoption have shown that those who believe they will be victims will resist; if they believe they will be beneficiaries, they may help facilitate the shift. Of course, the largest group consists of those in the middle who are joining the platform economy because they have no choice and do not feel empowered to resist. Balancing the need to sustain initiative while cushioning the consequences of significant socioeconomic transformation leads us to a focus on social policy, not just market policy. Social policy, sometimes called welfare, shapes the risks that workers and entrepreneurs take and their evaluation of whether to support or resist change. In the United States, benefits such as pensions and health-care coverage (the latter, until the passage of the Affordable Care Act) have been tightly tied to employment. Lose your employment, lose the protections. The U.S. debate often assumes that expanded welfare protections dampen initiative, pointing to Europe as an example of how investing in social protections limits economic dynamism. Aside from whether this was, in fact, ever the case in Europe, the question is whether social protection will inherently discourage initiative now. In our view, the real issue is never the fact of protections themselves—and indeed we believe that facilitating social and economic adjustment by easing the burdens of those dislocated is both a social obligation and an economic necessity—but how social policy is paid for and organized. The emerging platform economy, with expanding contract work and gig employment, has encouraged many to look at the Nordic social policy model. The Danish flexible security model suggests that social protections can lubricate the engines of change. Simply put, many social benefits in that model are associated with citizenship, and the notion of flexible security gives employers extensive rights to adjust their workforce as needed while still providing workers with social protections in the form of training, job placement, and basic income. Certainly, this is no panacea, and indeed the Nordics are themselves reopening and intensely debating the character of their social policies. But we must consider whether addressing the downside risks of entrepreneurial efforts while providing worker flexibility with broader social safety nets as social rights can make the platform economy a source of sustainable growth. What assurances of social safety do we want to give to risk takers? The debate over policy will not be straightforward or simple. As with all economic transformations, the disruptions will create winners and losers. Who will decide how the results of increased productivity are distributed? The reality is that the winners and losers in markets depend on who can participate and on what terms. There are no markets, and no market platforms, without rules, but what happens to the politics if important market rules are made unchallenged by the platform owners? Many political struggles will be waged over these rules, and those fights will be part of defining the market and society in a platform era. Political fights will break out over protections for communities, clients, and workers as markets are disrupted. Some of those fights will be about business models that are playing a game of policy arbitrage, whereas others may be about rules for the consignment platforms. In any case, how many instances of disruption will there be? Should we view these disruptions as creating a flood of viable entrepreneurial possibilities or as destroying the security of employment relations for many? Can they create new sources of income and reasonably compensated work? Can policy encourage labor market arrangements that facilitate innovation, provide protection for workers, are efficient, and promote decent, sustainable lives for citizens? In the platform world, is there a Henry Ford who recognizes that everyone in the ecosystem requires a reasonable income in order to buy his products? This will not be a straightforward process. The reorganization of the economy around platforms will inevitably change the very configuration of the interest groups that influence how the law tries to shape the code. In sum, these battles, often engaged in isolation from each other, will interweave to reshape our communities and social life, as José van Djick has shown, as well as the character of markets and market competition. In the era of the platform, the future remains open. Answers to crucial questions are for the moment unknowable. The answers depend on our choices, not just on the technology. For example, will cloud technologies and the platform-driven economic reorganization they cause drive the productivity growth on which sustained real income improvement occurs? Will these reorganizations destroy jobs or reduce the required skill levels? The technologies—the cloud, big data, algorithms, and platforms—will not dictate our future. How we deploy and use these technologies will. When we look at the history of innovations such as electric utility grids, call centers, and the adoption of technology standards, we find that the market and social outcomes of using new technologies vary across countries. Once we start on a technology path, it frames our choices, but the technology does not determine in the first place exactly which trajectory we will follow. We will be making choices in an inherently fluid and ever-changing environment shaped to some degree by unpredictable technical change and social reactions to these changes. Ultimately, the results will depend on how we believe markets should be structured—who gains and who can compete; how we innovate; what we value in society; how we protect our communities, our workers, and the clients and users of these technologies; and how we channel the enormous opportunities created by these sociotechnical changes. It is up to us to sidestep a dystopia and to create, if not a utopia, at least a world of ever greater benefit for communities and citizens.

More recently its Douglas Rushkoff chiming in here with a critical view of digital platforms. From his blog and his book Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, he warns that the promise of the digital age is being hijacked by a rampant form of old-style capitalism, a modus operandi akin to that of the robber-barons of the 19th century. ‘These platforms don’t exist to help people exchange with one another,’ he says. ‘They really are scorched-earth efforts at achieving monopolies in particular industries, not in order to serve those industries or even sustain them or grow them, but in order to hop over into another industry altogether. Has rampant capitalism hijacked the promise of the digital age? University of Maryland legal academic Frank Pasquale, who focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications of information technology, calls them the ‘Silicon Valley oligarchs’. ‘I think the fundamental problem is that people don’t like to face up to the reality of monopolisation,’ says Pasquale, speaking about the global rise of Uber, Airbnb and other so-called sharing economy companies. ‘It’s much more convenient to believe the comforting myth that these markets are always contestable. ‘A firm like Uber is an appeal to venture capitalists—speculative capital—that wants to see massive returns via monopolisation. Let’s not mistake the business model here. The model here is for one of these firms to come in and to take over various aspects of commerce, to take over the rides that are in an area, to take over availability of non-hotel rooms to sleep in, et cetera. I think that this is really a perversion of the original aspirations of the sharing economy.’ http://www.rushkoff.com/rampant-capitalism-hijacked-promise-digital-age/ Reply ↓ Robin Farrell May 28, 2016 at 6:24 am An excellent multi-faceted article. The rise of global (and more localised) platforms has far reaching implications for current socioeconomic and governance infrastructures. Transitions that might historically have taken decades might now occur in years (and without the same degree of localised investment). These will no doubt be accompanied by complementary developments in property rights and governance frameworks, to better suit the emergence of these new constructs and technologies. We can expect to see further innovations in alternative forms of societal / common rights, alongside the development of automated governance / self-regulated platforms, to better suit the increasing instancy and interdependence of the networked world. Reply ↓ Robin Farrell May 28, 2016 at 6:54 am How the socioeconomic evolution might occur is to be explored further. Probably more a systems evolution issue than one of choice / policy e.g. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245024299_Evolutionary_drive_New_understanding_of_change_in_socio-economic_systems Reply ↓ Rudolf Olah August 14, 2016 at 4:09 pm Very surprised that there is no mention of rent-seeking especially when Uber is mentioned. Many of these platforms are based on lock-in and rent-seeking. I will always remember how Twitter and Facebook cracked down on 3rd party applications using their API and especially how Twitter has bought out or shut down 3rd party apps. Uber is notorious for burning through venture capital and artificially lowering taxi rates. Taxi drivers and UberX drivers are already making less and less thanks to Uber’s profit increases.

The open-source OS could run on PCs, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Meanwhile, the Google OS features user modes and support for advanced graphics and 64-bit Intel PCs, and uses the Alphabet company's in-house Dart programming language.     Advertisement Like Us on Facebook Google will release Android Nougat in less than one month. However, the new OS spotted at the GitHub hosting service shows that the company is making plans beyond its mobile OS.   The OS at the Git storage space is probably brand new. Its description tells visitors to pick purple, which is not a color that represents Chrome OS or Android. The new OS kernel includes many high-end OS features. They include a capability-based security model and user modes.   Fuchsia can also support ARM architecture, which is a group of computer processor designs introduced in 1985. The new OS is powered by the Magenta and LK kernel. Magenta targets high-tech smartphones and PCs with fast processors, while LK targets small systems.   Google's Fuchsia OS can be tested on a PC or virtual machine. Travis Geiselbrecht is a Google software engineer and has worked on several other OS projects. He explained that Fuchsia will soon run on the mini CPU Raspberry Pi 3, according to Engadget. It is not unequivocal that the new OS will replace Android or Chrome OS, and Google has not made any official statements about the matter. It is now just an experiment that could be part of bigger projects. Google recently unveiled its smart speaker Google Home to challenge Amazon Echo. The new OS could provide more power and flexibility than Brillo for IoT devices, but fewer features than Android. In related news, Russia has fined Google $6.75 million for pre-installing apps on Android mobile devices, according to The Verge. Last year local search engine company Yandex filed a complaint against the United States-based company. Most Russian smartphones and tablets run on Android.       The small fine is the amount of money Google makes in one hour. However, it shows that the tech giant is facing more hatred in Europe.  Here's a Google Nougat preview: Advertisement Tags:google fuchsia google fuchsia operating system new google os Google News google non linux os google OS Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

Early Benchmarks Of FreeBSD 11.0 vs. DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Distributions Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 14 August 2016. Page 1 of 5. 16 Comments Following last week's DragonFlyBSD 4.6 benchmarks I carried out a fresh comparison of FreeBSD 10.3 vs. FreeBSD 11.0 (Beta 4 at the time) along with the DragonFlyBSD results and a few of the popular Linux distributions. Here are those numbers. Tested for this comparison were DragonFlyBSD 4.4.3, DragonFlyBSD 4.6.0, FreeBSD 10.3, FreeBSD 11.0-BETA4, Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, Ubuntu 16.10 in its current development state, Intel Clear Linux, and CentOS Linux 7. The x86_64/amd64 version of each OS was tested on a clean install each time using the same system hardware and each OS left to its default settings/packages. The system used for testing had an Intel Xeon E5-2687W v3 Haswell CPU (3.1GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo), MSI X99S SLI PLUS motherboard, 16GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770, and PNY CS1211 120GB SATA 3.0 SSD. All of the Linux and BSD operating systems were benchmarked in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

What concerns me is the amount of RAM your system has, 4GB is relatively low, even in my q6600 system I had 8GB of ram at 1060MHz, it's more likely your bottleneck is the RAM. However, with all this said, take this with a pinch of salt as sverek has pointed out, the engine Dota2 is running on has been updated to source 2 which could very well be much more cpu intensive however, I don't believe this to be a case for concern as achieving the same graphical fidelity and frame rate performance should be possible, if not better (I'd likely say, that previous dota2 max settings will likely now be medium settings in reborn).     Only Intruder View Public Profile Find all posts by Only Intruder   (#9) nz3777 Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga Gtx 780 Acx Sc Processor: Fx 8320 E @ 4ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming7 Memory: 8gb 1600mhz/Ballistic Soundcard: SoundBlaster Recon 3d PSU: Corsair Hx 850 08-18-2016, 21:09 | posts: 1,283 | Location: Willowbrook ill.

The Linux Rain Linux General/Gaming News, Reviews and Tutorials Toggle navigation Home About Contact Submit Tip/Article Categories Reviews News Tutorials Editorials Announcements Previews Upcoming Advocacy Overviews Finding unmatched braces (brackets) By Bob Mesibov, published 13/08/2016 Recently I was checking for unmatched braces in a big text file with nearly half a million lines (300+ MB). Was there a closing brace for every opening brace? The text file was called 'beetle' and was actually a tab-separated table with each line divided into 77 fields. What I wanted to do was find any lines in which unmatched braces appeared within fields. Here's the command I used: awk -F"\t" '{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++) if (split($i,a,"(") != split($i,b,")")) {print NR": "$0; next}}' beetle > unmatched The command took 1 minute 13 seconds to execute, which isn't bad for an operation that checked 36,036,077 data fields (with an Intel i3 dual core processor and 4 GB of RAM). To explain how the command works, I'll use a small tab-separated table called 'demo' with 3 fields: AWK has a 'split' function which takes 3 or 4 arguments. The first argument is the string to be split and the third is the character or characters on which to do the splitting. The second argument is the name of an array into which the split-out bits will be stored, and the fourth (optional) argument is an array containing the separators. What 'split' returns is the number of split-out items in the array. In the command below, each line in 'demo' is split using '(' as a separator and the number of split-out items is printed for each line: Note that AWK found 4 split-out items in the first line, namely a, aaa)[tab]bbbb[tab], cccc plus an empty item separated from the rest by '('. In other words, the number of items put into an array by 'split' will always be just 1 more than the number of separators. Note also that AWK emptied the array 'a' before splitting the next line. Repeating the command with ')' as separator and loading an array 'b', we get: Now to see whether the number of opening and closing braces is the same in each line. In the following command, AWK is asked to check whether the same number of split-out items is found for each brace type, and if not, then the line number is printed followed by the whole line: That worked well, but note that line 2 only has matching braces as a whole line. Fields 2 and 3 in line 2 both have unmatched braces. To look within fields, the full command above uses a for loop to do the checking on each field in turn. If unmatched braces are found in any field, AWK prints out the line number and the whole line, then jumps to the next line following the 'next' instruction. The full command isn't perfect because it won't find a line in which a field has braces matched 'backwards', like this: aa)aaa(a. I checked that possibility with another AWK command using a rather complicated regex. Here the command is looking at 'demo_new' with an added line including 'backwards' braces: There were no such lines in 'beetle', but the command at the beginning of this article did find 35 lines in 'beetle' containing fields with unmatched braces. I checked the 35 lines individually to see what the problem was (typo? truncated string?), then fixed each one with sed. For example: I repeated this process for unmatched square brackets ([]), curly brackets ({}) and greater-than/less-than arrows (<>). A fiddly proofreading job, made easier on this monster file with AWK! About the Author Bob Mesibov is Tasmanian, retired and a keen Linux tinkerer.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Gaming New No Man’s Sky Experimental Branch Available On Steam; Improved Shader Caching & Performance, Disabled G-Sync By Aernout Posted Aug 14, 2016 47Shares Share Tweet Submit Developer Hello Games has released a new No Man’s Sky experimental branch through Steam, which should resolve many issues that players have been reporting. Yesterday we reported on how No Man’s Sky didn’t have the best launch day – many PC players reported crashes and performance issues. Hello Games and its founder, Sean Murray, reassured to be aware of the issues however, and a patch was promised to be released in the near future. In a new post on the game’s Steam hub, Hello Games has now promised that this patch will be made available for all players early next week. The hot fixes included with the patch are currently being tested by Hello Games’ test team. For those who can’t wait till next week, the patch is also made available in a new Steam Branch. Please note that is an ‘experimental’ branch for now. The new No Man’s Sky Steam branch is said to improve shader caching by replacing the game’s GPU caching system, offers improved performance for CPU’s  with 4 threads or less, and has Gsync disabled by default. Additionally, Hello Games states that mouse smoothing has been improved, and AMD Phenom support is said to be improved as well. We’ve already resolved many issues for people who reported them by moving them over to this branch. Here’s what’s different Improved AMD Phenom Support Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten overnight to support AMD CPUs. Unfortunately whilst the game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics still requires “Supplemental SSE 3”, which was not supported until “Bobcat” and above. We’re discussing with Havok. Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved. Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on (this will be fixed in future). This is particularly true on ATI cards Mouse Jitter Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in “Mouse Smoothing”. Advertisement Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been improved. Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved. Intel GPUs The game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high end GPU has not been selected. Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users Here is how you access it To access the Experimental branch right-click on the game from the library page and select “Properties”. Among the available tabs will be the “BETAS” tab. Code: 3xperimental Your new branch should be listed in the dropdown menu under “Select the beta you would like to opt into:” Hello Games has also posted a list of the most common issues and workarounds in a separate post.

Gen. Michael T. Flynn has cast the presidential race as a continuation of the career he spent battling dangerous enemies in distant wars. “The enemy camp in this case is Hillary Rodham Clinton,” he said at a rally in Florida this month, pointing his thumbs down in disgust. “This is a person who does not know the difference between a lie and the truth. … She is somebody who will leave Americans behind on the battlefield.” As chants of “Lock her up!” rose from the crowd, Flynn nodded with enthusiasm and said he was “so proud standing up here to be an American.” It was a jarring moment in a race full of them — a retired three-star general comparing a presidential candidate to the al-Qaeda militants he faced in Afghanistan and Iraq, calling for a former senator and secretary of state to be imprisoned. Advertisement Continue reading The appearance was only the latest eyebrow-raising episode from Flynn, 56, who was one of the most respected military intelligence officers of his generation but who has spurned the decorum traditionally expected of retired U.S. flag officers and become the only national security figure of his rank and experience to publicly align himself with Trump. The unruly 2016 campaign has drawn dozens of former senior national security officials into the fray, including 50 Republicans who this month signed a letter saying Trump “lacks the character, values and experience” to be president. Denunciations of Trump from retired Marine Gen. John Allen — who spoke at the Democratic convention — and former acting CIA director Michael J. Morell struck some as compromising their former institutions’ apolitical role in American democracy. But Flynn, who vaulted to public attention with his speech at the Republican National Convention last month, has rattled even some of his most long-standing colleagues, engaging in harsh, partisan rhetoric that, to his critics, seems to clash with the principles and values he spent a career defending. He has called President Obama a “liar,” declared the U.S. justice system “corrupt” and insisted that he was pushed out of his assignment as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency because of his views on radical Islam. The claim has left former superiors seething, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to current and former officials who said Flynn was removed because of management problems. Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to the Russian leader. “People went crazy,” said retired Brig. Gen. Peter B. Zwack, the former U.S. military attache in Moscow. “They thought it was so out-of-bounds, so unusual.” Zwack emphasized that he regards Flynn as a “patriot” who “would never sell out his country.” Flynn, who was no longer in government but got a DIA briefing on Russia before the trip, said the invitation and payment came through his speaker’s bureau. He said he used the visit to press for collaboration in Syria, Iran and the Middle East and dismissed the ensuing controversy as “boring.” Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets. “What’s CNN? What’s MSNBC? Come on!” said Flynn, who has also occasionally appeared as an unpaid on-air analyst for RT and other foreign broadcasters. Advertisement Continue reading Dismayed by Flynn’s behavior since he left the military, former colleagues have contacted him to urge him to show more restraint. Among them are retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who relied heavily on Flynn in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and retired Adm. Michael Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. McChrystal declined to comment. Mullen provided a written statement saying that “for retired senior officers to take leading and vocal roles as clearly partisan figures is a violation of the ethos and professionalism of apolitical military service.” Officers are sworn to execute orders without regard for political positions, an oath to the Constitution that “is inviolable and presidents must never question it or doubt it,” he said. Flynn and Allen “have violated this principle and confused that clarity,” Mullen said. “This is not about the right to speak out, it is about the disappointing lack of judgment in doing so for crass partisan purposes. This is made worse by using hyperbolic language all the while leveraging the respected title of ‘general.’ ” Allen noted that retired U.S. military officers have frequently taken public positions in presidential campaigns, including a number of recent chairmen, and that he did so out of concern with Trump’s calls for resuming the use of torture, killing families of terrorism suspects and mass-bombing cities in Syria. “Retired senior officers should not take lightly the impact of public commentary in a political environment,” Allen said. “I chose to do so because I believe that Trump was proposing policies and orders to the U.S. military as a potential Commander in Chief, which I believed would create a civil-military crisis. This is a matter of conscience for me, because in moments of crisis such as these, credible voices must speak out.” In interviews, Flynn said he respects his former superiors but rejected their entreaties as attempts to silence him and impinge his free speech rights. “When someone says, ‘You’re a general, so you have to shut up,’ ” he said, “I say, ‘Do I have to stop being an American?’ ” Flynn dismisses his critics as closet Clinton supporters or misguided colleagues who have put their pursuit of corporate board seats and lucrative consulting contracts ahead of their concern for the country. Most retired generals “are afraid to speak out,” he said, because they use their stars “for themselves, for their businesses.” Flynn said his foray into politics began last year when he volunteered to advise five Republican candidates. He said that he first met Trump 11 months ago and that he spoke with him by phone several times before being asked to deliver a speech at the Republican convention. Advertisement Continue reading Trump is a “very serious guy. Good listener. Asked really good questions,” Flynn said. His role in the campaign has yet to be defined. Flynn said he has never met with Trump’s foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, and has not been promised any position if the real estate baron wins. Flynn’s credentials and vocal backing of Trump have fueled speculation that he could be in line for a high-level national security job if Trump is elected. He was briefly considered a potential Trump running mate before the candidate picked Mike Pence, the Republican governor of Indiana. Rather than scaling back, Flynn, a registered Democrat, has become an avid campaigner for Trump whose views and impulses increasingly echo those of the Republican candidate. He sees the nation as beset by darkness and corruption, with voters split between “centrist nationalists” and “socialists.” The divide has weakened the nation’s ability to grasp what he regards as an existential threat from “a diseased component” of Islam. “There’s something going on in the Muslim world,” he said. “Why do we have heightened security at our airports? It’s not because the Catholic Church is falling apart.” Flynn’s sudden political prominence represents a departure from a 33-year military career spent largely in the shadowy realm of military intelligence and Special Operations missions. Former colleagues said they could not recall Flynn ever discussing politics while in uniform or voicing the views he has embraced since his career came to an abrupt end. The son of a World War II and Korean War veteran, Flynn was one of nine children in a close-knit Irish family in Rhode Island. His brother Charlie is a two-star general in the U.S. Army. Flynn’s early years in uniform coincided with the end of the Cold War, but he made his mark after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as an intense officer with a string of important intelligence assignments. Advertisement Continue reading He has held senior positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and at U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Throughout his career, he was seen as a charismatic and unconventional officer with a talent for mapping terrorist networks — qualities prized by superiors. But his hard-charging approach was at times seen as disruptive or undisciplined. He is best known for his integral role in the lethal machine that McChrystal assembled in Iraq to eviscerate the al-Qaeda affiliate there. Together, they perfected an approach known as “find, fix, finish” that relied on the elite Joint Special Operations Command to carry out raids and then used intelligence from captured militants and materials to identify new targets at a blistering tempo. When McChrystal was put in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he tapped Flynn again to serve as his top intelligence officer. Flynn used that job to position himself as a gifted strategist, helping co-author a 26-page article, “Fixing Intel,” that depicted the intelligence-gathering mission in Afghanistan as a failing endeavor — too focused on finding targets rather than understanding cultural complexities. The article was praised by some in the military as insightful, but critics considered it grandstanding at the expense of his predecessors. Some of Flynn’s other moves angered superiors. Former U.S. officials said Flynn was scolded after traveling to Pakistan in 2009 or early 2010 and revealing to Pakistani officials sensitive U.S. intelligence on the militant Haqqani network accused of staging attacks on American forces. U.S. officials said the move was aimed at prodding Pakistan to crack down on the militant group, but that Flynn exposed U.S. intelligence capabilities that only helped Pakistan protect an organization it used as a proxy ally. Flynn also came under investigation by the Pentagon over an allegation that he had inappropriately shared highly classified intelligence with Australian and British forces. “I’m proud of that one,” Flynn said in an interview. “Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies! Please!” The probe delayed but did not derail Flynn’s ascent through the ranks. Always pushing for a deeper understanding of terrorist networks, Flynn convinced Clapper in 2011 to let him form a team to reexamine the materials recovered from bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan, searching for clues overlooked by the CIA. In 2012, he was tapped by Obama for one of the highest positions a military intelligence officer can attain, running the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn arrived with a mandate for change. He began trying to reorganize the agency into regionally focused centers, station more analysts overseas and build a spying capability that could rival the CIA. In public remarks, he warned any employees who resisted his agenda that he would “move them or fire them.” Almost from the outset there were concerns at the Pentagon that Flynn was struggling to execute his reform plans and that the agency was beset by turmoil. A career staff officer, Flynn had little experience running a large organization, let alone a plodding institution like the DIA, with nearly 20,000 employees. Advertisement Continue reading Former subordinates at the DIA said Flynn was so prone to dubious pronouncements that senior aides coined a term –“Flynn facts” — for assertions that seemed questionable or inaccurate. The DIA job is ordinarily a three-year assignment. But early in Flynn’s second year, his bosses — Clapper and then-Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers — summoned Flynn to a meeting at the Pentagon to tell him that he was being removed. As the search for a replacement stalled, Flynn attempted an end-run around his superiors, appealing directly to the vice chief of staff of the Army to extend his tenure. The move infuriated Clapper, according to former officials who said the DNI warned Flynn that if he made any other attempt to circumvent the outcome he would be fired on the spot. Clapper declined to comment for this story, but several current and former officials confirmed the account. Flynn disputed the account as well as the claim that he had shared sensitive intelligence with Pakistan, saying in an email that the claims are “all false.” Flynn characterizes his ouster as a political purge orchestrated by an administration unwilling to heed the warnings he was sounding about militant Islam. Asked for evidence, he said, “I just know!” adding that Clapper had once told him that the issue behind Flynn’s ouster was “not your leadership, or I would have removed you right away.” The decision to remove Flynn was “about turbulence and a destructive climate,” said a former senior U.S. intelligence official. “I don’t think anybody in the administration was even aware of his views” on radical Islam. Flynn’s views have become more strident since leaving DIA and are increasingly aimed at Obama. He said he is “sick and tired” of Obama taking credit for approving the 2011 mission that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. “This decision to kill bin Laden … so what?!” he said. “What did it really do?” Once firmly against waterboarding and other banned interrogation measures, Flynn now appears at least willing to consider supporting Trump’s threat to reinstate those methods, saying he would be reluctant to take options off the table. Asked on Al Jazeera in May whether he would allow the military to carry out Trump’s threat to kill any families of suspected terrorists, Flynn replied, “I would have to see the circumstances of that situation.” Advertisement Continue reading In February, Flynn posted a video about a Pakistani terrorist group on his Twitter account with the comment: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” His views are difficult to reconcile with some of the prescriptions for fighting terrorism that he outlines in a recent book, “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,” that he co-authored with neoconservative analyst Michael Ledeen. In the book, Flynn argues that the United States needs new partnerships with Middle Eastern countries and a deeper understanding of radical ideology. He said Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia should shoulder more of the responsibility for ridding their nations of terrorists, accept more Syrian refugees and deploy soldiers in Syria. Asked whether his comments about Islam or Trump’s behavior — threatening to ban Muslims from entering the United States, vilifying the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier — might alienate those potential Middle East partners, Flynn said, “I don’t see it that way. I see a lot of Muslims who actually want this conversation. They want this point to be made.” — Greg Jaffe and Julie Tate contributed to this report. — Video embed code: &#8212;Video direct link:</p><p><a href="http://wapo.st/2blk6UO" target="_blank">http://wapo.st/2blk6UO</a></p><p>(c) 2016, The Washington Post.</p></div><script type="text/javascript">try{_402_Show();}catch(e){}</script> </section> </div> <aside class="sharing-sidebar"> <div class="fixed-container"> <ul class="sharing" data-lnk-loc="sharing sidebar"> <li class="fb-share"><a href="" data-lnk-pos="facebook"><i class="icon-facebook"></i>Share</a></li> <li class="tw-share"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Nearly the entire national security establishment has rejected Trump &#8211;

By Owen Hughes August 15, 2016 18:37 BST The new Google operating systems is nicknamed Fuchsia, after the flowering plantCC Google is working on a brand-new operating system designed to run on everything from desktop PCs to smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Code-named Fuchsia, the open-source OS is being built from scratch and unlike Android and Chrome OS is not based on Linux. Google's work on Fuchsia was spotted by Android Police via the project's GitHub page, which simply bears "Pink + Purple = Fuchsia (a new Operating System)" by way of description. This appears to be alluding to the new kernel on which the OS is based, called Magenta. According to the project's GitHub repository, Magenta is being proposed as an alternative to commercial embedded operating systems like FreeRTOS and ThreadX. However, it has also been designed to scale across everything from embedded IoT applications with limited RAM and a bounded set of functions, all the way up to modern smartphones and 64-bit Intel PCs with advanced graphics capabilities. Fuchsia will also use Google's own Dart programming and a new user interface based on Flutter, the open source mobile development framework built for creating high-performance apps in keeping with Google's Material Design language. Exactly what Google has planned for Fuchsia will remain unknown until the company decides to officially let slip on the project. One possibility is that it could eventually replace Android and Chrome OS as Google's all-encompassing operating system. Google is known to be trying to bring both platforms closer together, recently announcing that Chromebooks would be given support for Android mobile apps. On the other hand, Google has previously dismissed reports it is phasing out Chrome OS, meaning Fuchsia's implementation might be limited to embedded hardware, if it sees any implementation at all. For now, we can only speculate. More tech news from IBTimes UK Android 7.0 Nougat tipped for August rollout Google Nexus Sailfish spotted in wild?

Michael Flynn speaks in Cleveland on the first day of the Republican National Convention. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In campaign appearances for Donald Trump, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has cast the presidential race as a continuation of the career he spent battling dangerous enemies in distant wars. “The enemy camp in this case is Hillary Rodham Clinton,” he said at a rally in Florida this month, pointing his thumbs down in disgust. “This is a person who does not know the difference between a lie and the truth. . . . She is somebody who will leave Americans behind on the battlefield.” As chants of “Lock her up!” rose from the crowd, Flynn nodded with enthusiasm and said he was “so proud, standing up here, to be an American.” [The GOP’s new convention theme: ‘Lock her up!’] It was a jarring moment in a race full of them — a retired three-star general comparing a presidential candidate to the al-Qaeda militants he faced in Afghanistan and Iraq, calling for a former senator and secretary of state to be imprisoned. The appearance was only the latest eyebrow-raising episode involving Flynn, 56, who was one of the most respected military intelligence officers of his generation but who has spurned the decorum traditionally expected of retired U.S. flag officers and become the only national security figure of his rank and experience to publicly align himself with Trump, the Republican nominee. Flynn vaulted to public attention with his convention speech. (Republican National Convention) The unruly 2016 campaign has drawn dozens of former senior national security officials into the fray, including 50 who served Republican presidents and who this month signed a letter saying Trump “lacks the character, values and experience” to be president. Denunciations of Trump from retired Marine Gen. John Allen — who spoke at the Democratic National Convention — and former acting CIA director Michael J. Morell struck some as compromising their former institutions’ apolitical role in American democracy. But Flynn, who vaulted to public attention with his speech at the Republican National Convention last month, has rattled even some of his most long-standing colleagues, engaging in harsh, partisan rhetoric that, to his critics, seems to clash with the principles and values he spent a career defending. He has called President Obama a “liar,” declared the U.S. justice system “corrupt” and insisted that he was pushed out of his assignment as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency because of his views on radical Islam. The claim has left former superiors seething, including Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., according to current and former officials who said Flynn was removed because of management problems. Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia. In interviews with The Washington Post, Flynn acknowledged being paid to give a speech and attend a lavish anniversary party for the Kremlin-controlled RT television network in Moscow last year, where he was seated next to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin. [Here’s what we know about Donald Trump and his ties to Russia] “People went crazy,” said retired Brig. Gen. Peter B. Zwack, a former U.S. military attache in Moscow. “They thought it was so out of bounds, so unusual.” Zwack emphasized that he considers Flynn a “patriot” who “would never sell out his country.” Flynn, who was no longer in government but received a DIA briefing on Russia before the trip, said the invitation and payment came through his speaker’s bureau. He said he used the visit to press for collaboration on Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and dismissed the ensuing controversy as “boring.” Asked why he would want to be so closely associated with a Kremlin propaganda platform, Flynn said he sees no distinction between RT and other news outlets. “What’s CNN? What’s MSNBC? Come on!” said Flynn, who also has appeared occasionally as an unpaid on-air analyst for RT and other foreign broadcasters. Flynn, center left, sits next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at an event last year to mark the Kremlin-controlled RT television network’s 10th anniversary. (Michael Klimentyev/Sputnik via Associated Press) Dismayed by Flynn’s behavior since he left the military, former colleagues have contacted him to urge him to show more restraint. Among them are retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who relied heavily on Flynn in Iraq and Afghanistan, and retired Adm. Michael Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. McChrystal declined to comment for this article. Mullen provided a written statement saying that “for retired senior officers to take leading and vocal roles as clearly partisan figures is a violation of the ethos and professionalism of apolitical military service.” Officers are sworn to execute orders without regard for political positions, an oath to the Constitution that “is inviolable and presidents must never question it or doubt it,” he said. Flynn and Allen “have violated this principle and confused that clarity,” Mullen said. “This is not about the right to speak out, it is about the disappointing lack of judgment in doing so for crass partisan purposes. This is made worse by using hyperbolic language all the while leveraging the respected title of ‘general.’ ” Allen noted that retired U.S. military officers have frequently taken public positions in presidential campaigns, including a number of recent chairmen, and that he did so out of concern with Trump’s calls for resuming the use of torture, killing families of terrorism suspects and mass-bombing cities in Syria. “Retired senior officers should not take lightly the impact of public commentary in a political environment,” Allen said. “I chose to do so because I believe that Trump was proposing policies and orders to the U.S. military as a potential Commander in Chief, which I believed would create a civil-military crisis. This is a matter of conscience for me, because in moments of crisis such as these, credible voices must speak out.” In interviews, Flynn said he respects his former superiors but rejected their entreaties as attempts to silence him and impinge on his free speech rights. “When someone says, ‘You’re a general, so you have to shut up,’ ” he said, “I say, ‘Do I have to stop being an American?’ ” Flynn dismisses his critics as closet Clinton supporters or misguided colleagues who have put their pursuit of corporate board seats and lucrative consulting contracts ahead of their concern for the country. Most retired generals “are afraid to speak out,” he said, because they use their stars “for themselves, for their businesses.” [Transcript: Trump adviser Michael T. Flynn on his dinner with Putin and why Russia Today is just like CNN] Flynn said his foray into politics began last year when he volunteered to advise five Republican candidates. He said that he first met Trump 11 months ago and that he spoke with him by phone several times before being asked to speak at the Republican convention. Trump is a “very serious guy. Good listener. Asked really good questions,” he said. Flynn’s role in the campaign has yet to be defined. He said he has never met with Trump’s foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, and has not been promised any position if the real estate developer wins. Flynn’s credentials and backing of Trump have fueled speculation that he could be in line for a high-level national security job if Trump is elected. He was briefly considered a potential Trump running mate before the candidate picked Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Rather than scaling back, Flynn, a registered Democrat, has become an avid campaigner for Trump whose views and impulses increasingly echo those of the Republican candidate. He sees the nation as beset by darkness and corruption, with voters split between “centrist nationalists” and “socialists.” The divide has weakened the nation’s ability to grasp what he considers an existential threat from “a diseased component” of Islam. “There’s something going on in the Muslim world,” he said. “Why do we have heightened security at our airports? It’s not because the Catholic Church is falling apart.” Flynn’s sudden political prominence represents a departure from a 33-year military career spent largely in the shadowy realm of military intelligence and Special Operations missions. Former colleagues said they could not recall Flynn ever discussing politics while in uniform or voicing the views he has embraced since his career came to an abrupt end. The son of a World War II and Korean War veteran, Flynn was one of nine children in a close-knit Irish family in Rhode Island. His brother Charlie is a two-star general in the Army. Flynn’s early years in uniform coincided with the end of the Cold War, but he made his mark after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as an intense officer with a string of important intelligence assignments. Flynn, then director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testifies on Capitol Hill in 2014. (Lauren Victoria Burke/Associated Press) He has held senior positions in the 18th Airborne Corps, at the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and at U.S. Central Command, which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East. Throughout his career, he was viewed as a charismatic and unconventional officer with a talent for mapping terrorist networks — qualities prized by superiors. But his hard-charging approach was at times considered disruptive or undisciplined. He is best known for his integral role in the lethal machine that McChrystal assembled in Iraq to eviscerate the al-Qaeda affiliate there. Together, they perfected an approach known as “find, fix, finish” that relied on the elite Joint Special Operations Command to carry out raids and then used intelligence from captured militants and materials to identify new targets at a blistering tempo. When McChrystal was put in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he tapped Flynn again to serve as his top intelligence officer. Flynn used that job to position himself as a gifted strategist, helping to co-write a 26-page article, “Fixing Intel,” that depicted the intelligence-gathering mission in Afghanistan as a failing endeavor that was too focused on finding targets rather than understanding cultural complexities. Some in the military praised the article as insightful, but critics considered it grandstanding at the expense of his predecessors. Some of Flynn’s other moves angered superiors. Former U.S. officials said he was scolded after traveling to Pakistan in 2009 or early 2010 and revealing to Pakistani officials sensitive U.S. intelligence on the militant Haqqani network accused of staging attacks on American forces. U.S. officials said that the move was aimed at prodding Pakistan to crack down on the militant group, but that Flynn exposed U.S. intelligence capabilities that only helped Pakistan protect an organization it used as a proxy ally. Flynn also came under investigation by the Pentagon because of an allegation that he had inappropriately shared highly classified intelligence with Australian and British forces. “I’m proud of that one,” Flynn said in an interview. “Accuse me of sharing intelligence in combat with our closest allies. Please!” The inquiry delayed but did not derail Flynn’s ascent through the ranks. Always pushing for a deeper understanding of terrorist networks, Flynn persuaded Clapper in 2011 to let him form a team to reexamine the materials recovered from bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan, searching for clues overlooked by the CIA. In 2012, Obama tapped him for one of the highest positions a military intelligence officer can attain, running the Defense Intelligence Agency. U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testifies during a House Appropriations hearing on "World Wide Threats" on Capitol Hill on Feb. 25. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Flynn arrived with a mandate for change. He began trying to reorganize the agency into regionally focused centers, station more analysts overseas and build a spying capability that could rival that of the CIA. In public remarks, he warned any employees who resisted his agenda that he would “move them or fire them.” Almost from the outset there were concerns at the Pentagon that Flynn was struggling to execute his reform plans and that the agency was beset by turmoil. A career staff officer, Flynn had little experience running a large organization, let alone a plodding institution such as the DIA, with nearly 20,000 employees. Former subordinates at the DIA said Flynn was so prone to dubious pronouncements that senior aides coined a term — “Flynn facts” — for assertions that seemed questionable or inaccurate. The DIA job is ordinarily a three-year assignment. But early in Flynn’s second year, his bosses — Clapper and then-Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael G. Vickers — summoned him to a meeting at the Pentagon to tell him that he was being removed. As the search for a replacement stalled, Flynn attempted an end-run around his superiors, appealing directly to the vice chief of staff of the Army to extend his tenure. The move infuriated Clapper, according to former officials who said the DNI warned Flynn that if he made any other attempt to circumvent the outcome he would be fired on the spot. Clapper declined to comment for this article, but several current and former officials confirmed the account. Flynn disputed the account as well as the claim that he had shared sensitive intelligence with Pakistan, saying in an email that the claims are “all false.” He characterizes his ouster as a political purge orchestrated by an administration unwilling to heed the warnings he was sounding about militant Islam. Asked for evidence, he said, “I just know!” adding that Clapper had once told him that the issue behind Flynn’s ouster was “not your leadership, or I would have removed you right away.” The decision to remove Flynn was “about turbulence and a destructive climate,” said a former senior U.S. intelligence official. “I don’t think anybody in the administration was even aware of his views” on radical Islam. Flynn’s positions have become more strident since he left DIA and are increasingly aimed at Obama. He said he is “sick and tired” of the president taking credit for approving the 2011 mission that led to the death of bin Laden. “This decision to kill bin Laden . . . so what?!” he said. “What did it really do?” Once firmly against waterboarding and other banned interrogation measures, Flynn now appears at least willing to consider supporting Trump’s threat to reinstate those methods, saying he would be reluctant to take options off the table. Asked on Al Jazeera in May whether he would allow the military to carry out Trump’s threat to kill any families of suspected terrorists, Flynn replied, “I would have to see the circumstances of that situation.” In February, Flynn posted a video about a Pakistani terrorist group on his Twitter account with the comment: “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” His views are difficult to reconcile with some of the prescriptions for fighting terrorism that he outlines in a recent book, “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,” that he co-wrote with neoconservative analyst Michael Ledeen. In the book, Flynn argues that the United States needs new partnerships with Middle Eastern countries and a deeper understanding of radical ideology. He said Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia should shoulder more of the responsibility for ridding themselves of terrorists, accept more Syrian refugees and deploy troops in Syria. Asked whether his comments about Islam or Trump’s behavior — threatening to ban Muslims from entering the United States, vilifying the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier — might alienate those potential Middle East partners, Flynn said, “I don’t see it that way. I see a lot of Muslims who actually want this conversation. They want this point to be made.” Greg Jaffe and Julie Tate contributed to this report. Read more: Transcript: Trump adviser Michael T.

He has been involved in open source for more than 10 years and is a member of the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors. » More about me Learn how you can contribute Flatpak: A new framework for building and distributing desktop applications Posted 15 Aug 2016 Allan DayFeed 44up 3 comments Image by :  opensource.com Fragmentation is a longstanding Achilles heel for the Linux desktop. In a world of myriad incompatible distributions, popular apps are typically limited to one or two of the most popular distributions, and the creation of new apps is stifled. The impact of fragmentation on application developers offers a good example of the problem: To release an app for Linux, a developer must contend with different package formats and a baffling number of distributions, all of which have their own particular conventions. For those apps that do exist, maintenance and pre-release testing is difficult, if not impossible. The constantly changing nature of Linux distributions adds another dimension of complexity for the application developer. Each release of a distribution can bring changes that are incompatible with applications, causing bugs or stopping the app from working altogether. When problems do emerge, users often encounter them first, before developers do. Flatpak, a new framework for building and distributing desktop applications, is intended to change all this. Flatpak decouples the platforms on which applications run from the distributions. This means that, instead of chasing distributions, application developers get to pick the platform that they want to use. Flatpak then makes sure that that platform is available on all the various distributions. Because Flatpak platforms are fixed, application developers don't need to worry about them changing unexpectedly, and they can test their applications against the platforms prior to each release. A number of Linux applications are already providing Flatpak apps, and many more experimental builds are already in the works. The Flatpak website features a growing list of these applications. One such application is LibreOffice. Michael Meeks, director of The Document Foundation (the non-profit organization behind LibreOffice), recently told Flatpak developers about the "horrible compromises" the organization was forced to make to achieve forward compatibility on Linux. LibreOffice was quick to start providing Flatpak builds of its office suite, which can be found at libreoffice.org/download/flatpak/. Flatpak is an independent upstream project hosted on Github. It is standards-compliant, making use of the Open Container Initiative specification, a Linux Foundation initiative intended to enable compatibility between container technologies. Flatpak shares several technologies with other projects, such as the Bubblewrap utility and OSTree, and it makes ample use of Linux kernel features. Importantly, all of these technologies and features are commonly available for all Linux distributions. Interestingly, the traditional Linux desktop is not the only target that Flatpak has in its sights. It can be used as the basis for custom solutions across a range of sectors, included embedded and in-vehicle infotainment. This is perhaps one reason why partners have been quick to engage. One early contributor is Endless Computers, which is making use of Flatpak for all its applications, both on Intel and ARM-based devices. Collabora, a prominent open source consulting firm, is taking an active interest, particularly with regards to embedded and commercial applications, and one of their developers is already contributing patches. It isn’t hard to imagine how a generic solution for application distribution might be of interest to a variety of industries. Challenges Back in the world of Linux distributions, Flatpak does face challenges, and its success will depend on adoption. It certainly has the advantage of compatibility—the Flatpak team has designed a framework that doesn't require changes to the underlying distribution in order to work. For distributions, adoption is simply a matter of packaging Flatpak and making it available. These packages are already available in Debian Experimental, Fedora, and Mageia Cauldron, as well as through unofficial repositories for Arch, Gentoo, and Ubuntu. Once Flatpak is installed on a system, the Flatpak application collection becomes available instantly. Whether Flatpak will be available by default in these distributions is another question. Only then will it be able to provide an effective out-of-the-box solution for software installation. Linux desktop environments, such as GNOME and KDE, are already working on Flatpak integration, and a fully Flatpak-capable app store—in the shape of GNOME’s “Software”—is just around the corner. Could this be the beginning of the universal app store for Linux? Visit flatpak.org to learn more about Flatpak or to join the community.

I am sure they can co exist. But ultimate reduction of fragmentation occurs when thrse technologies converge. Snappy is in many ways superior, flatpacks have other benefits...but having to learn different tools makes for more confusion. Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 FlaN Obrien on 15 Aug 2016 Permalink Thanks for the article Allan. IMO a little exaggerated and in the negative. Witness "The constantly changing nature of Linux distributions" (aka innovation). If people want a Microsoft world of no changes and poor security updates then that i easily achieved by turning off updates. Regarding the slightly different directory structures between major distributions (Arch, Gentoo, Debian, Redhat), that can easily be accommodated by adding a small abstraction layer. Actually, your article boils down to Debian versus Redhat, because Arch and Gentoo based distros have source based packages. In Debian there already exist Redhat packaging utilities and vice versa. Nonetheless if Flatpak can bridge Redhat/Debian without compromising functionality, integrity, security, etc, then fine. I would be interested to know more about the he "horrible compromises" of Libreoffice. Were they unable to write a small abstraction in their install script? Let us celebrate the richness of the Linux ecosystem not bemoan it.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums MasterLiquid Maker 92 puts the entire liquid cooler on the CPU by Jeff Kampman  11:00 AM on August 15, 2016 All-in-one liquid coolers are great performers, but they often require large, dedicated radiator mounting points inside a case. Cooler Master may be giving system builders the best of both worlds today with its MasterLiquid Maker 92 all-in-one cooler. This heatsink packs a pump, radiator, and two 92-mm fans into a dense module that occupies no more space in a system than a traditional tower-style air cooler. The MasterLiquid Maker 92's 6.6" (167.5 mm) height is large for a tower, but Cooler Master has gotten around this potential issue for smaller systems by giving the Maker 92 a trick. Unlike traditional tower coolers' rigid fin stacks, the Maker 92's radiator can swivel into horizontal or vertical modes, or any angle in between. This flexibility also lets builders direct airflow over the power circuitry around most CPU sockets. Unusually for a new cooler, the MasterLiquid Maker 92 only claims to be compatible with Intel LGA 2011v3 and LGA 115x sockets. It seems AMD builders are out of luck for now. Cooler Master warrants this heatsink for five years. Expect to see this distinctive new cooler on store shelves in September. True fans of the design can also sign up for a CM Fanzone account for a shot at a limited pre-order run August 30.

Up! Up! All three major US indexes close at record highs; materials lead Fred Imbert | @foimbert Monday, 15 Aug 2016 | 4:00 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Pisani: Record highs all around    Monday, 15 Aug 2016 | 9:36 AM ET | 04:47 U.S. stocks rose Monday, with the three major indexes posting simultaneous record closes for the second time in less than a week, as investors digested rising oil prices. "The fundamental picture has been mixed, so it's a little bit hard to look to that as the reason for what seems to be a solid rally," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. He also noted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over her GOP counterpart, Donald Trump, may be a contributing factor to the recent rally. "Not to make a statement on which candidate is better, but usually markets prefer for the incumbent party to retain the White House." The three indexes also posted new intraday highs, as benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite broke above previous intraday highs of 2,188.45 and 5,238.54, respectively, shortly after the open. The Dow Jones industrial average also posted a record high, rising past its previous high of 18,638.34. These previous records were all set last week, despite the indexes posting just slight weekly gains. "It's a major vacation time between now and Labor day," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The market right now is floating up on not a lot of news." "There's a lack of alternatives into other instruments," he said, noting that trading volume has been low recently. The S&P closed about 0.3 percent higher, with materials leading. Twenty-nine S&P components hit new 52-week highs, including Sysco — which reported quarterly results before the bell, Ross Stores and Procter & Gamble. "The market is being driven by the same theme," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, referring to low interest rates around the world and the "hunt for yield." "Until we get some optimism, the path of least resistance is higher. Nobody likes this market." Spencer Platt | Getty Images The Dow rose nearly 60 points, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The Nasdaq outperformed, advancing nearly 0.6 percent. "The market should continue to go higher on the no-alternative factor," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The market is feeding on itself." "In order to get a big move down, ... you need to see some news the market perceives as bad," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "We don't have that right now." Despite posting several milestones last week, stocks traded in a relatively narrow range. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near multi-year lows last week. On Monday, it rose 2.25 percent to 11.81. Investors, meanwhile, were watching oil prices as U.S. crude settled 2.81 percent higher at $45.74 a barrel in choppy trade. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak bolstered hopes that oil producing nations could take action to stabilize prices, telling a Saudi newspaper that his country was consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve market stability. "Good luck with that, if investors believe this. The move which we are seeing in the market is the real example how speculations can drive the price action. If you look at the demand equation, we had GDP data from the third biggest economy in the world and it is not something which is praising the demand for oil," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. On the data front, the Empire State Manufacturing survey index fell five points to -4.2. "The lack of even a whiff of volatility, however, prevents me from shifting my outlook from neutral to something more far more negative. The intraday range for the blue chip index has consistently fallen to 0.25-0.50% of the underlying index level. When this statistic falls into this tight band, the blue chips have secured a positive daily return 67.7% of the time since October 2001 compared to 54.5% for all sessions over the same period," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Monday note to clients. Other data released Monday included the NAHB housing index, which showed homebuilder sentiment rose 2 points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rose about 1 percent, led higher by Toll Brothers, which was up about 3 percent. Investors will also await for the Fed to release the minutes from its July meeting, although Schwab's Frederick said that he doesn't expect any big surprises from them. On the earnings front, several firms, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Cisco Systems, are scheduled to report results this week. "Through Friday's close, 459 companies, or 92%, of S&P 500 have reported 2Q 2016 results," said Nick Raich, CEO at The Earnings Scout, in a Monday note. "While 71% of those companies are exceeding their 2Q 2016 EPS estimates, 60% have had their 3Q 2016 EPS estimate go lower, on average by -1.79%, after releasing results." Last week, retail giant Macy's posted better-than-expected results. U.S. Treasurys fell on Monday, with the two-year note yield holding near 0.72 percent and the benchmark 10-year yields trading at 1.55 percent. The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.119 and the yen around 101.2. The pound also hit a one-month low against the greenback. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly flat. Asian equities traded mixed, as Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after its GDP data disappointed, while China's Shanghai composite rose more than 2 percent on stimulus hopes.

The Open Technology team leads IBM's strategy and involvement in key cloud open source technologies, including Docker, Cloud Foundry, and Openstack.

CC SA-BY 4.0 runC, a lightweight universal container runtime, is a command-line tool for spawning and running containers according to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification. That's the short version. The long version: The governance umbrella created by Docker, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat, and many other partners to create a common and standardized runtime specification has a readable spec document for the runtime elements of a container, and a usable implementation based on code contributed to the OCI by Docker. It includes libcontainer, the original lower-layer library interface originally used in the Docker engine, to set up the operating system constructs that we call a container. Given that runC is an open source project with a regular release cadence, you can find the code and respective releases on GitHub. If you download or build the runC binary you will have everything you need to get started using runC as a simple container executor based on the runtime spec elements: a JSON container configuration and a root filesystem bundle. Note that if you have an installation of Docker 1.11 or above you will automatically have a recent copy of runC installed on your system as well. It is most likely named docker-runC and installed in /usr/bin, and can be used outside of Docker just like any normal installation of runC. Benefits of using runC Even before the OCI and runC existed, many core Docker engine developers used a runC-precursor, nsinit, that allowed a simplified entry point into running and debugging low-level container features without the overhead of the entire Docker daemon interface. Now that runC exists, this is definitely one continuing use case, especially for someone potentially exposing a new Linux isolation feature. For example, the checkpoint/restore capability using the Linux Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace (CRIU) project first was made available via runC, and just now is being prepared for addition to the Docker daemon at the layer above runC. Of course, as runC/OCI expands beyond Linux this will be true for other operating system (OS) isolation primitives, such as Solaris zones or Microsoft Windows-based containers, both of which expect to have capabilities via the OCI runtime spec and runC implementation. Beyond new feature development at the operating system layer, runC is a useful debug platform for finding hard-to-solve bugs that are trickier to debug with the entire Docker stack above the container process. Challenges to getting started with runC Developers probably have gotten used to the low-friction entry point to containers with the overall Docker ecosystem, including using DockerHub (or private registries) for images, and simple docker run commands to enable and disable various features and configurations for their containers. With runC the developer must construct or export filesystem bundles from other systems to create their own starting point for a container. They also will need to put together the JSON configuration file that has similar "knobs" related to various docker&nbsp;run flags, but must be codified directly in the JSON file as the runC binary itself has a simple start, stop, pause, etc. interface with no flags. Overall container strategy How this fits into a developer’s overall strategy may depend on the intentions and desired outcomes of the developer. For a developer looking for a simpler model of container execution without needing broader Docker daemon capabilities, then runC paired with containerd, another Docker open source project used in the Docker 1.11 and above engines, may be a good fit. After my talk at DockerCon in Seattle, I had several developers come up and share full container cloud architectures they had built based on one or both of containerd and runC doing interesting workload and container lifecycles. In many cases, however, runC will probably be a lower-layer detail that may or may not be of general interest to a developer. Broadening the discussion a bit beyond purely runC, one use model we haven't discussed is the pluggability of runC with the Docker engine or other future OCI-compliant engines. Already in the OCI community there are projects like runv, runz, and others implementing the common OCI runtime specification with Solaris zones, or a lightweight hypervisor (see Intel clear containers as an example) as the OS-level isolation technology. Another way that runC, or runC-like implementations, are of interest is to developers of other isolation techniques or operating system containment capabilities. Mapping container features, such as seccomp and user namespaces Because libcontainer, that operating system layer library that does the real work of performing the container isolation primitives for your OS, is at the heart of runC, any OS-layer features—such as seccomp and user namespaces—must be implemented first in runC before they can be exposed to higher layers, like the Docker engine. This additional capability—to try out new features in runC that haven't been exposed yet at higher layers—is another attractive draw to runC, and several of the latest features that have been exposed in Docker were available in libcontainer and runC well before they made their way into Docker. This also means that during the development of these isolation features or enhanced security capabilities, runC is a great tool for testing and trying out unique configurations using the JSON configuration file. During his talk at ContainerCon, Phil will demonstrate this use case, and he will show how you can try turning on/off the ability to use certain syscalls using seccomp entries in the JSON configuration file and immediately observe the impact on an application. He also will show a workflow with existing open source tools to ease developer startup time with runC, using current Docker containers and images as an input to create runC-ready configurations and root filesystem bundles.

Google's new OS could replace Android and Chrome OS in the near future Published By: Ken Bock on August 15, 2016 07:55 am EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon GOOGL Reports have emerged of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is building a new operating system called the Fuchsia. Fuchsia, the OS, has caused a huge uproar in the online world. The question that arises now: Is Fuchsia taking over the Chrome OS and Android? It might be a bit early to say anything at this point, but the Android Police did not dismiss this prospect when it declared that Google could supplant Chrome OS and the widely popular Android OS with Fuchsia sometime in the future. It also stated that there is a probability of Google using Fuchsia as a lightweight OS for gadgets like Google Home and the OnHub switch, just the way Samsung does to its Tizen OS for its Gear smartwatches. Fuchsia OS is getting widely popular because it’s not Linux kernel-based like the other systems program, for example the Chrome OS, Android and Chromecasts. Fuchsia OS is said to work on almost anything- PCs, telephones, Chromebooks and other gadgets of the internet. This operating system emerged from the GitHub page. It supports 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel based PCs. It also uses Google’s Dart programming dialect, according to Engadget. For the present, Fuchsia OS is just another research by Google, and it’s a long way from being discharged at any point in the near future. Google could be aiming at using something comparatively larger than what it has now in the present. However, there has been no confirmation by Google. For the future, Google could be operating the Raspberry Pi 3, trusted reviews has studied. Google is also expected to be releasing the company’s latest Nexus devices next month and reports indicate that the tech giant has partnered with HTC to build the new devices. The new devices are expected to come with top of the line specs with a relatively low price and will house the latest Android 7.0 Nougat OS.

Thousands are expected to attend the 2013 Google I/O developers conference that runs through May 17. At the close of the markets today Google shares were at all-time record high at $916 a share, up 3.3 percent. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Fuschia, the brand new operating system of Goggle, is currently in the works with a promising Magenta Kernel. While rumors spread that this latest OS from Google might combine Android and Chrome OS into one, we dig deeper on Fuschia’s potential benefits and drawbacks. Google Source reveals the latest information and GitHub leaks it as "Pink+Purple=Fuchsia (a new Operating System)." The code repository does not discuss further details, though. The Fuchsia mission looks to be a promising OS but it's not going to replace Android anytime soon according to Android Central. Fuchsia is a new operating system developed by Travis Geiselbrecht (BeOS, iOS, and webOS) and Brian Swetland (Android, BeOS, and HiptopOS) as well as Google software engineer Petr Hosek. Linux has powered Google hardware like Chrome OS and Android for years. However, the Linux kernel is not ideal for embedded devices like GPS units in automobiles and car dashboards as the utilization of the said kernel might result in some issues. Similar to Linux, the Magenta kernel powers the larger Fuchsia operating system. Inquisitr reported that the Fuchsia OS has a kernel known as Magenta that has been designed to work on practically all compatible devices from a small embedded device to a desktop. Google Fuchsia also uses Google’s own Dart programming language and Flutter for the user interface to maintain Material design used by Android OS. Though Fuchsia is working well on Next Unit of Computing (NUC) personal computers using Intel’s platforms, its driver support is still a work in progress, which signals that hardware like keyboards and mice might not be supported just yet. Despite the overwhelming benefits Fuschia could offer, it is possible that this could just be another Google side project that may never hit reality, just like many others. This is another downside that we should anticipate.

He knows what you need 15 Aug 2016 at 13:26, Gavin Clarke Gavin Clarke Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Cloud, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Oracle Recent Articles OpenStack-flinger Mirantis signs landmark NTT deal UK fintech firm reaches for Ireland Brexit escape hatch Google lights toasty price war under S3's hot and cold data bits Apple’s plan to tackle the great iPhone sales slump is for it to produce, yes, more iPhones. CEO Tim Cook, in a scripted Q&A with the Washington Post, dismissed the six-month drop-off in sales of iPhones – and slowing smartphone sales in general. Apple is now expected to release the iPhone 7 in September. Cook reckons smartphones are equivalent to TVs, in that people will own more than one, with consumers unable to resist buying them thanks to features such as Siri. In a swipe at Wall Street, which has punished Apple’s stock price on the back of falling iPhone sales, Cook reckoned this is a long haul. He is counting on growth in India, where there’s a potential to replace a market dominated by feature and flip phones. India is the new China, as growth in the latter has slowed. Apple’s stock, meanwhile, has seen been at its lowest in two years as Wall Street worries about iPhone sales. Cook told the Washington Post, here: Over time, I’m convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won’t all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on earth from a consumer electronics point of view. Features will drive sales – including artificial intelligence, i.e. personal assistants – and device performance stats that Cook reckoned will “skyrocket”. I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, “Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by one per cent or decreased by six per cent.” You know, the global economy’s not that great right now. But if you’re in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth. What’s next from Apple, then? After five years under Cook, arguably the biggest new thing we’ve seen from Apple is yet another iPhone. Cook and Co have delivered six new makes of iPhone, with a further four derivations based on the overall brand. Differences revolve around newer hardware, size and new software. There’s been no product “moment” – no Jobsian move of the Mac from Power to Intel, no introduction of the iPhone or announcement of the iPad. Asked by the WP whether Cook was saying there’s nothing like a smartphone, he said: I’m not saying we’re not going to do anything else. I’m saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this “better days are behind us” thing. Apple closed 2015 on a big high: claiming record growth in China for Q4 thanks to new iPhones – sales for which were up 71 per cent, with 40 per cent growth in iPhone sales. But 71 per cent in Q4 became an 11 per cent fall in sales in China in Apple’s first quarter of 2016. The iPhone accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s business and sales were down 15 per cent to 40.4 million in the three months reported in July. iPhone revenue fell 23 per cent to $24bn. Apple started 2016 with iPhone sales falling 16 per cent in the first three months of the year to 51.2m units, with revenue down 18 per cent to $32.9bn. Q1 wasn’t just the first time sales of iPhones fell but the result helped upset Apple’s corporate sums, notching up the first fall in revenue in 13 years. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 79 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology The World Series of Hacking—without humans Seeking a future where networks patch themselves, DARPA stages an AI vs. AI smackdown. by Sean Gallagher - Aug 15, 2016 1:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 20 LAS VEGAS—On a raised floor in a ballroom at the Paris Hotel, seven competitors stood silently. These combatants had fought since 9:00am, and nearly $4 million in prize money loomed over all the proceedings. Now some 10 hours later, their final rounds were being accompanied by all the play-by-play and color commentary you'd expect from an episode of American Ninja Warrior. Yet, no one in the competition showed signs of nerves. To observers, this all likely came across as odd—especially because the competitors weren't hackers, they were identical racks of high-performance computing and network gear. The finale of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Cyber Grand Challenge, a DEFCON game of "Capture the Flag," is all about the "Cyber Reasoning Systems"(CRSs). And these collections of artificial intelligence software armed with code and network analysis tools were ready to do battle. Inside the temporary data center arena, referees unleashed a succession of "challenge" software packages. The CRSs would vie to find vulnerabilities in the code, use those vulnerabilities to score points against competitors, and deploy patches to fix the vulnerabilities. Throughout the whole thing, each system had to also keep the services defined by the challenge packages up and running as much as possible. And aside from the team of judges running the game from a command center nestled amongst all the compute hardware, the whole competition was untouched by human hands. Greetings, Professor Falken Sean Gallagher Waiting to rumble—the seven AI supercomputing hacker "bots" and their supporting cast hum quietly in the Paris Hotel ballroom Sean Gallagher Waiting to rumble—the seven AI supercomputing hacker "bots" and their supporting cast hum quietly in the Paris Hotel ballroom Some of the 7 supercomputers required just to keep tabs on the participating systems. The Airgap robot allows scoring data to be passed to DARPA's visualization team by moving burned Blu-Ray discs from one side to the other. It's time to rumble. Well, actually, they started 10 hours ago...it's just time for the show. Daniel Tkacik, Ph.D, Carnegie Mellon University The crowd watches as the show gets underway. The Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) was based on the formula behind the successful Grand Challenges that DARPA has funded in areas such as driverless vehicles and robotics. The intent is to accelerate development of artificial intelligence as a tool to fundamentally change how organizations do information security. Yes, in the wrong hands such systems could be applied to industrial-scale discovery and weaponization of zero-days, giving intelligence and military cyber-operators a way to quickly exploit known systems to gain access or bring them down. But alternatively, systems that can scan for vulnerabilities in software and fix them automatically could, in the eyes of DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar, create a future free from the threat of zero-day software exploits. In such a dream world, "we can get on with the business of enjoying the fruits of this phenomenal information revolution we're living through today," she said. For now, intelligent systems—call them artificial intelligence, expert systems, or cognitive computing—have already managed to beat humans at increasingly difficult reasoning tasks with a lot of training. Google's AlphaGo beat the world's reigning Go master at his own game. An AI called ALPHA has beaten US Air Force pilots in simulated air combat. And, of course, there was that Jeopardy match with IBM's Watson. But those sorts of games have nothing on the cutthroat nature of Capture the Flag—at least as the game is operated by the Legitimate Business Syndicate, the group that oversees the long-running DEFCON CTF tournament. This was the culmination of an effort that began in 2013, when DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge program director, Mike Walker, began laying the groundwork for the competition. Walker was a computer security researcher and penetration tester who had competed widely in CTF tournaments around the world. He earned this project after working on a "red team" that performed security tests on a DARPA prototype communications system. After a 2012 briefing he gave the leadership of DARPA's Information Innovation Office (I2O) on vulnerability detection and patching, the I20 leadership had one thought. "Can we do this in an automated fashion?" I20 Deputy Director Brian Pierce told Ars. "When it comes down to cyber operations, everything operates on machine time—the question was could we think about having the machine assist the human in order to address these challenges." The same question was clearly on the minds of Defense Department leaders, particularly at the US Cyber Command with its demand for some way to "fight the network." In 2009, Air Force Gen. Kevin Chilton, then commander of the Strategic Command, said, "We need to operate at machine-to-machine speeds… we need to operate as near to real time as we can in this domain, be able to push software upgrades automatically, and have our computers scanned remotely." Walker saw an opportunity to push forward what was possible by combining the CTF tournament model with DARPA's "Grand Challenge" experience. He drew heavily from then-deputy I20 director Norm Whitaker's experience running the DARPA self-driving vehicle grand challenges from 2004 to 2007. "We learned a lot from that," said Pierce. But even with a template to follow, "a lot of things had to be built from scratch." Those things included the creation of a virtual arena in which the competitors could be fairly judged against each other—one that was a vastly simplified version of the real world of cybersecurity so competitors focused on the fundamentals. That was the same model DARPA followed in its initial self-driven vehicle challenges, as Walker pointed out at DEFCON this month. The winning vehicle of the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, a modified Volkswagen Touareg SUV named Stanley, "was not a self-driving car by today's standards," said Walker. "It was filled with computing and sensor and communications gear. It couldn't drive on our streets, it couldn't handle traffic… it couldn't do a lot of things. All the same, Stanley earned a place in the Smithsonian by redefining what was possible, and today vehicles derived from Stanley are driving our streets." Similarly, the Cyber Grand Challenge devised by Walker and DARPA didn't look much like today's world of computer security. The systems would "work only on very simple research operating systems," Walker said. "They work on 32-bit native code, and they spent a huge amount of computing power to think about the security problems of small example services. the complex bugs they found are impressive, but they're not as complex as their real-world analogues, and a huge amount of engineering remains to be done before something like this guards the networks we use." Strange game A highlight reel from DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge finale. The "research operating system" built by DARPA for the CGC is called DECREE (the DARPA Experimental Cyber Research Evaluation Environment). It was purpose-built to support playing Capture the Flag with an automated scoring system that changes some of the mechanics of the game as it is usually played by humans. There are many variations on CTF. But in this competition, the "flag" to be captured is called a Proof of Vulnerability (POV)—an exploit that successfully proves the flaw on opponents' servers. Teams are given "challenge sets," or pieces of software with a one or sometimes multiple vulnerabilities planted in them, to run on the server they are defending. The teams race to discover the flaw through analysis of the code, and they can then score points either by patching their own version of the software and submitting that patch to the referee for verification or by using the discovered exploit to hack into opponents' systems and obtain a POV. The problem with patching something is that once a team patches, its code can be used to patch by everyone else. Patching generally means bringing down the "challenge set" code briefly to apply the patch. It's a risk for competitors: if the patch fails and the software doesn't work properly, that counts against your score. Based on 32-bit Linux for the Intel architecture, DECREE only supports programs compiled to run in the Cyber Grand Challenge Executable Format (CGCEF)—a format that supports a much smaller number of possible system calls than used in software on general-purpose operating systems. CGCEF also comes with tools that allow for quick remote validation that software components are up and running, debugging and binary analysis tools, and an interface to throw POVs at the challenge code either as XML-based descriptions or as C code. So just as with the human version of CTF, each of the CRSs was also tasked with defending a "server"—in this case, running instances of DECREE. The AI of each bot controlled the strategy used to analyze the code and the creation of potential POVs and patches. AIs made decisions based on the strategy they were trained with plus the state of the game, adapting to either submit patches (and share them with everyone else as a result), create a network-based defense to prevent exploits from landing, or go on the attack and prove vulnerabilities on other systems. While teams could score points based on patches submitted, successfully deflected attacks, and POVs scored against the other teams' systems, those points were multiplied by the percentage of time their copies of the challenge sets were available. Patching would mean losing availability, as the challenge sets would have to go down to be patched. That meant possibly giving up the chance to exploit the bug against others to score more points. Setting up an intrusion detection system to block attacks could also affect availability—especially if it was set wrong and it blocked legitimate traffic coming in. All of this makes for a complex set of game strategies in CTF, which really tests the flexibility of the AI controlling the bots. One of the major differences between human CTF and the DARPA version of the game was its pace. In a typical human CTF tournament, only about 10 challenge sets would be posted over the course of a two-day tournament. In the qualifying round of the Cyber Grand Challenge, held last August at DEFCON, there were 131 challenge sets with a total of 590 vulnerabilities. In total, 28 systems made the first cut over the course of 24 hours—so they could handle a challenge about once every 10 minutes. In the finale of the Cyber Grand Challenge, there would be 100—but they would be posted to systems at the rate of one challenge every five minutes. Another difference in this event was how the "offensive" part of the CTF worked. Rather than launching their POVs directly at competitors' servers to try to score, the POVs were submitted to and launched by the referee system. That way, the success or failure of any POV could be instantly assessed by the scoring system, just as any patch submitted by competitors could be independently evaluated. All of the action recorded by the referee system could then be played back through a set of visualization tools to show the results of each round. On top of all this was the hardware itself. CTF tournaments generally look like rooms full of people huddled at tables around laptops. The CGC version of the game required the construction of a portable data center, assembled in Las Vegas: an "air-gapped" network of 15 supercomputing systems, each with 128 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon processors (totaling more than 1,000 processor cores) and 16 terabytes of RAM. Physically disconnected from any outside network, the only way data left the "arena" network was via a robotic arm that passed Blu-ray discs burned with scoring data from one tray to another. Seven of the identical supercomputing racks ran the AI-powered "bots." Seven more were dedicated to running the match itself—handling the deployment of the challenge sets, verifying POVs and patches, performing forensic analysis, and tracking the score. The last system acted as a sparring partner for the competitors in warm-ups. The whole raised-floor rig was cooled by water piped in from three industrial chillers sitting on the Paris Convention Center's loading dock; it drew 21 kilowatts of power over cables snaked in from outside.

(Edi Israeli/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - After dropping by 20 percent over the same period the previous year during the February-April period, high-tech exports rebounded, rising 13 percent over the previous year’s numbers for the period during May and July, the Central Bureau of Statistics announced. High-tech constitutes 48 percent of Israeli industrial exports, not including diamonds. Even more impressive was the increase in pharmaceutical exports during that period – with an increase of 136.8 percent over the previous year’s period. With that, exports of computer hardware fell 40 percent. Most of that fall was due to sinking exports by Intel Israel, which dominates the field. Manufactured product exports, including exports of mined products (excepting diamonds) increased 7.7 percent during the period, after falling 10.8 percent during the February-April period over the numbers during that period a year earlier. On the other side of the equation, imports of raw materials during May-July were 15 percent higher than during that period in 2015. During February-April, they were up just 7.1 percent. During the latest reporting period, iron and steel imports rose 53.2 percent over the previous year’s numbers, while agriculture machinery and technology imports were up 35.1 percent. Imports of unprocessed food products were down 10.4 percent, the CBS said.

Not content with merely creating the world's thinnest laptop, it's also made it one of the loveliest Windows ultraportables to ever roll off a production line. That laptop is the Spectre 13. My first encounter with the Spectre 13 conjured memories from 2008. In particular, that iconic moment in Apple's keynote where Steve Jobs picked up a manila envelope and pulled a MacBook Air from within. Audible gasps. Applause. This time around, however, Steve Jobs' role was assumed by Reviews Editor, Jonathan Bray and the paper envelope was replaced with a stylish leather sleeve. Cue one quiet gasp. Design I was expecting a 12.9-inch iPad Pro clone, but instead the Spectre 13 slid into view. For a split second, mouth agape, I genuinely couldn't believe I was looking at a real laptop. If you needed to show someone just how far laptop design has come in the last ten years, then you wouldn't actually need to say a word. Just hand them a Spectre 13, and watch as their eyes widen. That said, the Spectre 13 will not be everyone's cup of tea. Attempting to tread that fine line between expensive-looking and gaudy is a pursuit which often ends in chintzy horrors, yet the Spectre 13 just about carries it off. If anything, that bold, bronze strip along the rear edge is a welcome contrast to the shimmering, dark grey plates of carbon fibre above and below. And, personally, I love the stylised HP logo on the lid, not to mention the little details: even the HP and Bang & Olufsen logos and keyboard typeface are all in a matching, light bronze hue.  Build quality has not taken a back seat, either. Given that the Spectre 13 weighs in at only 1.11kg, HP has done an amazing job of making it feel substantial. There is a little flex in the lid and base if you go looking for it, granted, but the extensive use of carbon fibre means that this doesn't feel worrying – it feels like a taut, controlled amount of give rather than a genuine weak point. Importantly, though, with the lid closed the Spectre feels as robust as any of its rivals at the price, so I wouldn't be worried about carrying this around day to day. The bare essentials By far the greatest compromise here is connectivity. HP has had to relegate the Spectre 13's ports to the rear panel, and here you'll find two Thunderbolt 3 ports alongside a third USB Type-C port that doubles as both a connection for the PSU and as a USB 3.1 Gen 1 port. There are no full-sized USB ports whatsoever, but HP has included a USB Type-C to full-sized USB adapter – which is nice. If you want any video outputs or an Ethernet socket, however, though, then you'll just need to go and shell out for a suitable USB Type-C adapter or dock. Image 6 of 8 Those limitations might prove irksome for certain people, but I'm not one of them. After all, I've been happy enough using the Apple MacBook with its single USB Type-C port, and the HP's combination of 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 meant that, as most of my data is in the cloud or Wi-Fi attached NAS devices, I didn't need to resort to a physical cable. If it really bothers you, though, then you're probably best directing your credit card towards the rather better-connected Dell XPS 13. It's heartening to find that the pursuit of world-beating slenderness hasn't borked the keyboard or touchpad – the Spectre 13's slip-thin frame somehow manages to accommodate a very fine pairing. The keyboard's half-height Enter key is one minor concession, but that's about it. This is as good a keyboard as you could ask for, with keys that feel light yet responsive enough to make for confident touch-typing. And it's worth noting that, unlike the Apple MacBook, the Spectre 13's ultra-slimline build hasn't forced HP to compromise with noticeably short-travel keys. Factor in the superb touchpad beneath, which just works as it should, and using the Spectre is a genuine pleasure. Display & sound If you're hoping for a high-DPI display to tickle your optic nerves, then prepare to be disappointed. As HP's weight-watching efforts have pared down the Spectre 13's battery to a bare minimum (more on which later), it's also had to abandon any thoughts of 4K displays in the interests of energy-efficiency. Don't be too disheartened, though: the Spectre 13's Full HD 13.3in display is about as good as it gets. It's not the brightest display ever – there's clearly some challenge in squeezing a bright backlight into such a tiny, tiny space – but the quality of images is beyond reproach. Colour accuracy is superb, and as the panel covers almost every corner of the sRGB colour gamut you'll find that photos and movies look nigh-on perfect. Delve into the numbers and there's nothing to moan about: brightness reaches a very respectable 304cd/m2; contrast hits an impressive 1,379:1; and an average Delta E of 1.89 is very, very good by laptop standards.   And if you're still smarting from the news that there's no 4K option, then the Bang & Olufsen speakers may offer some small consolation. There's no real bass to speak of – after all, HP's engineers aren't physics-defying magicians – but the depth and clarity makes a great fist of everything from music to movies. They're really very nice-sounding. Performance & battery life Granted, simply making a thin laptop isn't that remarkable an achievement, but it's the relative lack of compromises which makes the Spectre 13 so impressive. Where the quest for miniaturisation has forced other devices such as Apple's MacBook and HP's own EliteBook Folio G1 to adopt Intel's power-frugal Core M processors, the Spectre 13 somehow manages to accommodate full-fat Core i5 and Core i7 processors into its millimetre-thin chassis. The cheapest model in the Spectre line-up starts at $2,399 with a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB NVMe SSD, but the $3,099 model I have here bumps that up to a Core i7-6500U and a 512GB NVMe SSD. Sadly, though, 16GB of RAM isn't an option, presumably because just like the Apple MacBook, the Spectre's RAM is physically soldered to the motherboard. In most scenarios, that Core i7 CPU and the staggeringly nippy NVMe Samsung SSD alongside make for an ultraportable that feels considerably faster than you'd expect for such a lightweight device. The small fans do spin up fairly quickly under load, and you'll certainly notice their insistent whine if you're in a quiet room, but by and large the Spectre 13 is a surprisingly sprightly performer. Image 3 of 8 In fact, it was only once the Spectre 13 came face to face with our benchmarks that we were able to notice any difference between it and Dell's XPS 13. There was barely 1% difference between the two in the image editing section of the benchmarks, but that delta expanded to 13% under the sustained heavy load of Alphr's video editing tests and resulted in a multi-tasking performance which was 7% slower. It's not a difference you'll notice in everyday usage, but it is there. I was fully prepared for battery life to be utterly, utterly awful, but HP has managed to eke a surprising amount from the Spectre 13's 38Wh battery. By way of comparison, that's 7% smaller than the Apple MacBook's 41Wh battery, and a whopping 32% smaller than the Dell XPS 13's 56Wh power pack. Battery life obviously suffers due to the smaller capacity, but with the HP's display cranked up to a fairly bright 170cd/m2, our standard video rundown test saw the Spectre 13 keep going for 6hrs 10mins. That's some way off the Dell XPS 13's 11hrs 31mins, but it's not awful for a featherweight ultraportable. Verdict At this price, the HP Spectre 13 finds itself pitted against everyone's favourite ultraportable, the Dell XPS 13. And for all the Spectre 13's plus points, that buying decision boils down to one simple question: how much do you value having a laptop that's 118g lighter versus one that has significantly better battery life? Given that you'll likely need to carry the mains charger along with the Spectre anyway, you could argue that the weight benefit is somewhat moot in the first place. That's not to say the Spectre 13 isn't a fantastic ultraportable in its own right, because it is: put the middling battery life to one side and it really doesn't put a foot wrong. If eye-catching design is as important to you as a great display, brilliant keyboard and solid performance, then this is a featherweight tour de force. Forgive its flaws, and I think most people will probably agree: the Spectre 13 is by far the prettiest ultraportable on Planet Earth.

International Business Times 8/14/2016 Corazon Victorino © Provided by IBT US In a strange turn of events, reports about Google developing a new operating system surfaced this week. The OS that’s causing a huge noise in the online world is an open source, and it is dubbed as Fuchsia. With its existence coming into light, there is now one big question that needs to be answered: Is Google replacing its Chrome OS and Androi?  It may seem too early to tell at this point, but Android Police did not rule out this possibility when it stated that Google could be hoping to replace the Chrome OS and even the hugely popular Android OS with Fuchsia someday. The tech site also indicated that there is also the possibility of Google using Fuchsia as a lightweight OS for devices like Google Home and the OnHub router, just like what Samsung does to its Tizen OS for its Gear smartwatches.  Google’s Fuchsia OS is making headlines because it is not Linux kernel-based unlike the multinational company’s other operating systems, such as the Chrome OS, Android and Chromecasts, among others. Thus, this means the Fuchsia OS could run on almost anything — from PCs, Chromebooks, phones and Internet of Things devices.  Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.10 -0.70 -0.63% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 68.24 -7.75 -10.19% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.27 -7.06 -0.90% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.34 -0.78 -1.28% Fuchsia OS originally surfaced from the project’s GitHub page, where it is simply called “a new Operating System.” Part of the operating system’s documentation states that it has support for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. Also, it uses Google’s Dart programming language, according to Engadget.  For now, the Fuchsia OS is just seen as another experiment from Google, and it is far from being officially released anytime soon. Google could be planning on using it for something bigger than what it has now. Nothing’s really been confirmed about Google’s new operating system’s use as of late. The only thing known about what Google has in store for it in the near future is, it could be running the Raspberry Pi 3, Trusted Reviews has learned.  For interested techies, you can check out the project on its official site, but you must know that only limited information about the operating system is found there at present.

Paul C Dwyer, an internationally recognised information security expert for 25 years, said there is a significant cyber-crime threat in Ireland. The president of the International Cyber Threat Task Force (ICTTF) said “vulnerable” prisoners in Ireland and throughout Europe are being targeted by sophisticated ISIS cyber-recruiters. Mr Dwyer said: “It’s not just Irish prisons. “They’re working across Europe to recruit what they feel are disenfranchised and disaffected people who are more vulnerable to them. “What’s interesting is we’re seeing a parallel to the techniques they’re using that paedophiles and criminals would use to attract vulnerable children. “So they will bring them in from if you like the surface web on open social media and then bring them into more enclosed, encrypted types of communication links.” Secrets of ISIS revealed (Photo: Sky) Read More More than 4,000 people will be denied entry to Ireland in 2016 Mr Dwyer said prisoners in Ireland could be attracted by ISIS for a number of reasons. He said: “In some ways it can be egos, in some ways it can be actually money. “These guys are involved in organised crime, it’s not all idealogically based. “So the blurred lines between cyber terrorism and cyber-crime are getting more and more blurred all the time and how these guys actually interact with each other, how they communicate and how they exchange funds.” Speaking about ISIS and criminals who prey on vulnerable people online the internationally-respected cyber expert said by sharing information about scams and techniques, the flood can be stopped. He added: “The guards are under-resourced and like most law-enforcement agencies around the world they’re behind the curve in relation to how threat factors like ISIS will operate.” Read More Gardai and Army increase their monitoring of terrorist sympathisers in Ireland as threat increases Mr Dwyer has worked closely with law-enforcement, military and enterprises in combating cyber-threats for 25 years and he said the ICTTF have noticed a lot of common themes. He said: “We saw that there was a commonality that all the bad guys were working together and essentially exchanging information, Intel and helping each other for their various gain and whatever they wanted to do. “So we decided to form a group that was the opposite of that so good people around the world could work together. “And very quickly it was founded in Ireland and we had over 100 countries involved and over 4,000 members exchanging [information] and helping each other to deal with these types of cyber threats. Mr Dwyer said he has experienced everything from protecting organisations and their own data assets to working with protecting children. He said: “I work closely with the ISPCC, wherever those threat factors are we will give it time, give it energy and give our experience to stop them actually developing and progressing across. Mr Dwyer told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane Show children and teenagers are also being targeted and manipulated by ISIS and other criminal groups. He said: “The inquisitive child that takes a toy apart and puts it back together can often be seen as a hacker and unfortunately in society we lock up these brilliant children”. “A lot of them we’re finding have aspergers or are on the edge of autism and they’re the ones that get locked up. “If you look at any of the statistics on this it’s these children with brilliant brains that are being manipulated by criminals to become part of the criminal enterprise. “And then effectively you’re put into criminal university i.e prison and then they are part of that system and they’re used by the bad guys.” Read More Today's top stories McGregor could join WWE Abduction attempt of child in Donegal Joe O'Reilly "will never admit" murder Maynooth student 'may know her attacker' Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @irishmirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Crime Terrorism ISIS Cybersecurity ISPCC Prisons news all Most Read Most Recent World NewsWoman may have lain dead in bedroom for months while family carried on living as normal Inside the house of horrors were a host of animals including a pair of tarantulas, rats, a rabbit, a blind cat and a three-legged sheepdog NewsMan 'raped pregnant partner after she went into labour and was crying out in pain' Hull Crown Court was told the woman had got on all fours on her bed after entering the "advanced stages" of labour when she was attacked by her partner NewsWorld's tallest waterslide to be demolished after 10-year-old boy decapitated in freak accident Caleb Thomas Schwab died on the 168-foot-tall ride at the Schlitterbahn waterpark in August   Met EireannIrish weather: Weather warning issued for eight counties as temperatures plunge to -4C A yellow weather warning is in place for parts of Connacht and Ulster An Garda SiochanaGardai trawl through Maynooth assault victim Kym Owens' social media in bid to catch attacker Detectives are trawling through the student’s Facebook and Twitter accounts LottoLotto results: Winning numbers for tonight's €9.5 million jackpot on Wednesday, November 23 Plenty of punters tested their luck for a shot at the eye-watering prize CorkInquest hears Cork teen died after taking deadly 'designer drug' at house party Alex Ryan died on January 23 last after consuming a synthetic drug London 2012 OlympicsRio judge rules Kevin Mallon must pay €420,000 to return to Ireland It is an identical offer as that granted to former OCI president Patrick Hickey last week Northern IrelandEmergency services at the scene after young woman falls from 'Napoleon’s Nose' cliff in Belfast Emergency services are at the scene for rescue bid at Napoleon's Nose area Met EireannIrish weather: Weather warning issued for eight counties as temperatures plunge to -4C A yellow weather warning is in place for parts of Connacht and Ulster Most Read Most Recent World NewsWoman may have lain dead in bedroom for months while family carried on living as normal Inside the house of horrors were a host of animals including a pair of tarantulas, rats, a rabbit, a blind cat and a three-legged sheepdog NewsMan 'raped pregnant partner after she went into labour and was crying out in pain' Hull Crown Court was told the woman had got on all fours on her bed after entering the "advanced stages" of labour when she was attacked by her partner NewsWorld's tallest waterslide to be demolished after 10-year-old boy decapitated in freak accident Caleb Thomas Schwab died on the 168-foot-tall ride at the Schlitterbahn waterpark in August   Met EireannIrish weather: Weather warning issued for eight counties as temperatures plunge to -4C A yellow weather warning is in place for parts of Connacht and Ulster An Garda SiochanaGardai trawl through Maynooth assault victim Kym Owens' social media in bid to catch attacker Detectives are trawling through the student’s Facebook and Twitter accounts LottoLotto results: Winning numbers for tonight's €9.5 million jackpot on Wednesday, November 23 Plenty of punters tested their luck for a shot at the eye-watering prize Usain BoltUsain Bolt on Manchester United, cricket, the Olympics and more ahead of 'I Am Bolt' documentary The Jamaican opened up on a range of subjects from his achievements on the track to his beloved Manchester United and much more in between CorkInquest hears Cork teen died after taking deadly 'designer drug' at house party Alex Ryan died on January 23 last after consuming a synthetic drug FIFA 17Rejoice FIFA 17 players!

(Reuters/Gene Blevins) Share Written by Alex McKinnon Obsession Rio 2016 August 14, 2016 With every Olympics comes a renewed focus on how little money most Olympians actually make throughout their athletic lives. While a few newly made superstars (such as US gymnast Simone Biles) will strike it lucky by attracting the attention of sponsors, the vast majority of competitors at Rio will struggle to break even—let alone make a living off their talents. Nearly 150 athletes from the US team had to set up GoFundMe pages to cover their costs this year, and when it’s not Olympics season, many professional athletes in sports such as rowing, swimming, and javelin live on or below the poverty line. Maybe they should try running around in virtual worlds instead of real ones. If athletes played video games such as Call of Duty, League of Legends, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, or StarCraft II instead of pushing the limits of their physical bodies, they’d be making bank. While names like Sebastian Engwall and Min-Liang Tan might be even less recognizable to the public than a country’s table tennis squad in a non-Olympics year, professional gaming (or “eSports”) offers far more opportunities to make a steady buck than the Olympics and many other major sporting tournaments. For example, The International 2016 is a five-day Defence of the Ancients 2 (often abbreviated to Dota) championship tournament currently underway in Seattle’s 17,000-seat KeyArena. With a roster of 90 players and coaches from 22 countries, it’s dwarfed by the Olympics in every respect save one: the prize money. Based on their performance and ranking, the 16 teams competing will share in a gargantuan prize pool of over $20 million, which is largely derived from the proceeds of in-game sales from Dota’s millions of casual online players. The eventual champions will pocket almost $9 million split between the team of five (or six, if they have a coach) players, and even the lowest-placing teams will still take home $101,395 in consolation prize money. Placed side by side, the disparity between how much Olympic champions and eSports tournament winners earn for their victories is stark. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) doesn’t actually pay anyone who competes in the Games, leaving the winners’ countries to set their own monetary benchmarks. It’s true that there are several countries that lavish extravagant cash prizes on their rare medal winners, including Singapore, Azerbaijan, and Indonesia, and the United States. But even the US—by far the most prolific medal collector of any nation—only offers $25,000 for winning gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze. This means that Simone Manuel, who just took home the gold in the women’s 100-meter freestyle, will be awarded $25,000 by the US Olympic Committee. But at Blizzard Entertainment’s annual BlizzCon event last November, Swedish eSports player Sebastian “Ostkaka” Engwall took home $100,000 for winning the Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft World Championship. So did Korean gamer Kim “sOs” Yoo Jin after winning the Starcraft II World Championship Series. And the same goes for Olympics teams: The US women’s 4×200-meter freestyle relay team, which also won gold this week, will take home $100,000 between them, whereas the team of five who clinched first prize at the Epicenter Dota 2 tournament in Moscow back in May won $250,000. Like the road to Olympic glory, the path to championships like The International can also be long and expensive. Most competitors at top-tier eSports tournaments have to win regional qualifiers in the Americas, China, Europe, Southeast Asia, or the Pacific before advancing. This process can consume months at a time and involve significant costs with no prize money offered to the losers. But unlike athletes, some of whom may only get one Olympic shot every four years, eSports players have many more opportunities to compete. Tournaments of The International’s size come around far more often than the Olympics. Valve, the company that makes the Dota franchise, recently rolled out three more major annual Dota 2 championships in Manila, Frankfurt, and Shanghai, all with prize pools of $3 million. And that’s to say nothing of the myriad lower-tier tournaments hosted by organizations like DreamLeague, ESL One, America’s Major League Gaming, DreamHack, Blizzard, Activision, and others that routinely offer up prize pools in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. While gaming has long had the reputation as an individual pastime, the social aspect is becoming more and more prevalent. Many of the best pro gamers sign with pro gaming teams such as OpTic Gaming, FaZe Clan, Fnatic, and Enemy. These kinds of squads sign players to contracts in much the same way as pro football and baseball teams. For pros reluctant to sign with a team (or simply looking to bolster their income in tournament offseasons), there’s always another option: going it alone as “streamers” (short for “live-streamers”). High-profile eSports personalities such as summit1g and Mohamed “mOE” Assad have built huge standalone followings using nothing but social media and livestreams of them playing their games with running commentary. YouTube and streaming platform Twitch, whose staggering growth over the last few years has matched that of eSports, have provided pro gamers with an easy and effective means of gathering millions of followers. This enables them to build a brand, solicit donations, sponsorships and paid subscriptions, and sell their own merchandise and ad space. Like IRL athletes, the biggest and most entertaining gaming teams also attract lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Intel, Nissan, and Doritos. Teams also have their own clothing and accessory lines and can make celebrities out of their most successful and charismatic signees—or trade them away at will. In January, FaZe Clan signed a five-person lineup of Counter-Strike players from rival team G2 Esports for $700,000, potentially the largest such deal in the game’s history. But unlike Olympic athletes, who often have to foot their own bill as they bounce from qualifier to qualifier, most professional eSports players have their travel, accommodation, entry fees, and hardware costs covered by their teams or sponsors. While it’s still quite rare, some of the biggest organizations also pay their players a salary. Members of North American-based team Ember, for example, earn between $57,500 and $65,000 in base salary, with up to $27,000 in performance and signing bonuses on top. Riot Games, which owns League of Legends, pays players in its Championship Series a base salary that amounts to roughly $12,500 for three month’s worth of work. None of this is to say that the pro eSports circuit isn’t beset by the same problems facing other lucrative sports. Numerous events and teams have been fined and banned from major tournaments for refusing to honor contracts or pay players on time, while other teams have disbanded in protest at underpayment. Some events have been censured for failing to pay prize money, and America’s infamous vulture capitalist Martin Shkreli—the guy who’s made headlines for everything from price-gouging lifesaving HIV and cancer medications to being arrested on securities fraud charges —still owes around $75,000 to players and coaches ensnared in his short-lived and ill-fated foray into the pro League of Legends scene last year. There is also one huge caveat to all the moneymaking: gender. While women in pro sports frequently score less prize money than their male counterparts, in competitive eSports, they barely get a foot in the door in the first place—especially at the top level. Many eSports tournaments and championships are still segregated by gender, which is a policy the International e-Sports Federation claims is necessary to “improve female representation” in the professional scene and combat the boys-club mentality that pervades the heavily male-skewed industry. Some high-profile female pro gamers accept that rationale as a temporary means towards creating a more welcoming culture, which is currently filled with abuse, sexual harassment, and the general filth that is routinely hurled at female streamers and gamers. Outside of the co-ed sphere, however, all-female tournaments only attract only a fraction of the coverage and industry dollars of male championships. For example, the all-female Intel Challenge in Katowice, Poland offered a total prize pool of just $30,000 for its 2016 championship—a sum “never before seen” on the female circuit. How (or even if) the eSports industry deals with these issues over the next few years will be interesting to watch. But with the pro gaming scene set to continue its explosive growth, the players who make it so profitable are probably better placed financially than the athletes sweating it out in Rio right now. When the Olympics come to an end, thousands of world-class athletes will recede from the spotlight—and any real chance of making serious money for another lengthy period of time. The 16th-placed team at The International, meanwhile, can shrug, pocket their cool $20,000 each, and start prepping for the next major tournament in a few months’ time.

By Corazon Victorino On 08/14/16 AT 9:05 AM Close In a strange turn of events, reports about Google developing a new operating system surfaced this week. The OS that’s causing a huge noise in the online world is an open source, and it is dubbed as Fuchsia. With its existence coming into light, there is now one big question that needs to be answered: Is Google replacing its Chrome OS and Android OS with the new Fuchsia OS?  It may seem too early to tell at this point, but Android Police did not rule out this possibility when it stated that Google could be hoping to replace the Chrome OS and even the hugely popular Android OS with Fuchsia someday. The tech site also indicated that there is also the possibility of Google using Fuchsia as a lightweight OS for devices like Google Home and the OnHub router, just like what Samsung does to its Tizen OS for its Gear smartwatches.  Google’s Fuchsia OS is making headlines because it is not Linux kernel-based unlike the multinational company’s other operating systems, such as the Chrome OS, Android and Chromecasts, among others. Interestingly, the Fuchsia OS is said to run on almost anything — PCs, Chromebooks, phones and Internet of Things devices.  Related Stories Google Chrome To Block Flash Content Starting Next Month Fuchsia OS originally surfaced from the project’s GitHub page, where it is simply called “a new Operating System.” Part of the operating system’s documentation states that it has support for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. Also, it uses Google’s Dart programming language, according to Engadget.  For now, the Fuchsia OS is just seen as another experiment from Google, and it is far from being officially released anytime soon. Google could be planning on using it for something bigger than what it has now. Nothing’s really been confirmed about Google’s new operating system’s use as of late. The only thing known about what Google has in store for it in the near future is, it could be running the Raspberry Pi 3, Trusted Reviews has learned.  For interested techies, you can check out the project on its official site, but you must know that only limited information about the operating system is found there at present.

Design TL;DR Artist Rafael Varona crams magical stories into tiny GIFs By Andrew Webster on August 14, 2016 08:37 am 6 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share Two years ago, artist Rafael Varona caught the world’s attention with a series of animated GIFs that depicted magical worlds trapped inside tiny glass bottles. The success of the “Impossible Bottles” series led to a number of new illustration gigs, and Varona eventually moved from Berlin to Amsterdam to focus on animation. But he never stopped thinking about those tiny glass bottles. “It was clear that I always had to do a second part,” he says. “In between jobs I finally sat down and took some weeks off to concentrate on what I want to put into my bottles this time. Out came an insane robot and a naked giant golden goddess.” "It saved my life." The second edition of "Impossible Bottles" features miniature worlds that are even more dense with detail than the originals. One bottle shows a mad scientist powering his home with a massive, lumbering robot underground. Another features a group of foreign explorers apparently enslaving the local population, while unbeknownst to them, a massive living statue rests just beneath the surface. Despite their small stature, each animated GIF manages to tell a story — and that’s exactly what Varona is aiming for. "It's a journey for me as well as for the viewer," he says of his process. "I almost never know what the illustration is going to look like when I start drawing, so steps up to the final work are visible. I'm trying to add as much scenery and life as possible, chaotic with a sense of order, a lot of contrasts and as much fun as possible. Color and composition are very important to me. Also, sometimes if you want to and take some time you can find a little story that I mixed in." Outside of personal work like "Impossible Bottles," he’s also done illustration and design work for clients ranging from Intel to The Washington Post to German eyewear firm Mykita. He’s been passionate about art since a young age, to the point that as a kid he would often fall asleep with a pen still in his hand. "When I found out about graphic design as a study, and that you can earn money with it, it saved my life," says Varona. He cites British painter David Hockney and French comic artist Blexbolex as some of his biggest influences. As for what’s next, Varona is currently taking the "Impossible Bottles" series in an unexpected direction: he’s working with Berlin-based Honig Studios to turn the robot GIF into a mobile game. "Now a bunch of professionals are showing me the endless possibilities of interactions and levels," he says. It’s just about a dream project for him, though he can think of at least one other he’d love to do in the future. "An animated music video for MF DOOM, though…" You can find more of his work on his site.

There’s Android, Chrome OS, Chromecast, and several more. But yet another open source operating system from the company has been discovered, this one dubbed “Fuchsia.” Now, this is far from a finalized product, mind you, it’s just a new project that’s appeared on GitHub with the description “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” Right from the start, the most obvious difference between Fuchsia and Google’s other OSes is that it’s not based on the Linux kernel. Instead, it uses the new Magenta kernel, which is designed to power Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. As Android Police notes, this makes it a rival to other embedded OSes like FreeRTOS and ThreadX. However, Magenta is also designed to scale up all the way to things like smartphones and even desktop PCs. It includes features like user modes, a capability-based security model, and support for both ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. And because it uses Google’s own Dart programming language along with Flutter, Fuchsia could easily support the Material Design user interface. There’s no guarantee at this point that Google is planning to take Fuchsia beyond anything but IoT devices, but there’s a possibility that down the road it could be used to replace Chrome OS and Android. In the mean time, it’s more likely we’ll see Fuchsia used on future IoT devices like Google Home and OnHub; hardware that doesn’t need to run Android. While we wait to see what Google does with this latest project, you can play around and check out the details on Fuchsia on its GitHub page and on Google Git, and it looks like it will soon support the Raspberry Pi 3.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas August 15, 2016 06:24 BST Major UK software company Sage has been been hit by a data breach that may have compromised the personal information of employees at about 280 firms. Reuters UK business software firm Sage has been hit by a data breach that might have compromised the personal information for employees of 280 UK businesses. Listed on the FTSE 100, the Newcastle-based company provides business software for accounting, payroll and payment services to companies across 23 countries. "We believe there has been some unauthorised access using an internal login to the data of a small number of our UK customers so we are working closely with the authorities to investigate the situation," the company said in a statement on its UK homepage. "Our customers are always our first priority so we are communicating directly with those who may be affected and giving guidance on measures they can take to protect their security." The company did not specify whether the "unauthorised access" of information, which was reportedly accessed sometime over the past few weeks, was stolen or just viewed. However, a person "familiar with the situation" told the Financial Times that a Sage employee's login details were used to gain access to the sensitive information, potentially affecting a "maximum of between 200 and 300 companies." "We cannot comment further whist we work with the authorities to investigate but our customers remain our first priority and we are speaking directly with those affected," a Sage spokesperson said, BBC reports. The breach is currently being investigated by the City of London while the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is responsible for the enforcement of the Data Protection Act 1998, has been informed as well. If the ICO finds evidence of negligence on the company's part, the authority could take serious action against the firm including criminal prosecution, a company audit or non-criminal enforcement, according to the BBC. "The law requires organisations to have appropriate measures in place to keep people's personal data secure," the ICO said. "Where there's a suggestion that hasn't happened, the ICO can investigate, and enforce if necessary." The latest breach comes at the heels of multiple data breaches including an attack on Oracle's Micros point-of-sale credit card payment systems earlier this month, allegedly carried out by Russian cybercrime group Carbanak Gang. The same month, thousands employee accounts of Google, Apple, Intel and other tech companies were reportedly stolen by hackers from a developer's forum. In October, nearly 157,000 TalkTalk customers personal details were exposed in a much-publicised cyberattack on the telecom company that cost the firm about £60m ($78m) and a loss of 101,000 customers.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 14, 2016 at 7:11PM Image source: NVIDIA.  Not long ago, I wondered what NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) would use for its next-generation Volta architecture. The two possibilities were Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s tried-and-true 16-nanometer technology, and its upcoming 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Technology website Fudzilla reported last month that Volta would, in fact, be manufactured on 16-nanometer rather than on 10-nanometer. This report was later corroborated by known leaker USG Ishimura on Baidu. Although it seems that the next step for NVIDIA would be to transition from 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer, it now appears that the company plans to skip 10-nanometer altogether and move straight to TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. The proof is on the job boards A little while back, NVIDIA had the following job posting up on its website: Image source: Author screenshot of NVIDIA's website. The relevant part is on the third line in which the company talks about its products "manufactured in 28nm, 20nm, 16nm, 14nm and soon 10nm CMOS processes." The implication is that the next stop for NVIDIA's products would be a 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. However, NVIDIA recently put up an updated version of this job listing. The new listing is largely the same as the old listing, but with one important change: Image source: Author screenshot of NVIDIA's website. Notice now that in the third line, "10nm" in the old listing has been replaced with "7nm" in the new listing. To be clear, 7nm wasn't added to the list of manufacturing nodes: It replaced 10nm. It makes sense for NVIDIA to skip 10-nanometer altogether TSMC has indicated that 10-nanometer is going to be a fairly short node used primarily by mobile applications processor customers: think MediaTek, Apple, HiSilicon, and so on. Ten-nanometer is expected to go into production in early 2017 and last about a year as TSMC's flagship process, before 7-nanometer goes into production in the first half of 2018. Given that NVIDIA is reportedly building Volta on 16-nanometer rather than on 10-nanometer, I wouldn't expect NVIDIA to release a product on a post-16-nanometer manufacturing technology until sometime in 2019. At that point, 10-nanometer should be in the rearview mirror and 7-nanometer should be good to go. The only way 10-nanometer would make sense for NVIDIA would be if it planned to use it to build Volta in the 2017 or early-2018 timeframe. Any later than that, and NVIDIA is better off waiting for 7-nanometer, which should bring both performance enhancements and chip-area reductions. NVIDIA looks to be on a "tick-tock" schedule now At this point, it's really looking like NVIDIA is adopting a "tick-tock" model similar to what Intel had in place before the 14-nanometer generation. That is, instead of doing one product family on a given manufacturing technology and waiting for a new manufacturing technology to bring out a new architecture, NVIDIA will do two families on a given manufacturing technology. This strategy worked out quite nicely during the 28-nanometer generation (Maxwell delivered a massive performance-per-watt boost over Kepler, even though both were on the same manufacturing technology) and I'm optimistic that it'll work out well at 16-nanometer and beyond.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.
