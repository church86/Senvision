We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! Zen's Place in the Computing World By Richard Adhikari Aug 31, 2016 5:00 AM PT AMD, which has been clawing its way out of the doldrums, recently showcased its octacore, 16-thread Summit Ridge desktop processor featuring its Zen core in a performance match-up against Intel's octacore Broadwell-E Core i7-6900K CPU. The two similarly configured processors were locked at 3 GHz for the test, in which they ran the multithreaded Blender rendering application, in a demo presented earlier this month in San Francisco. AMD's Summit Ridge outperformed the Intel processor. "They showed a benchmark where, under the conditions they set, they came up neck and neck with Broadwell, which is Intel's highest-performing chip," acknowledged Martin Reynolds, a Gartner distinguished analyst. However, "that doesn't guarantee you great performance," he told TechNewsWorld. Souped-Up Pinto On the other hand, AMD "fixed all of the things that were obviously wrong with the previous generation," Reynolds pointed out, adding full dual-thread capability and dramatically improving cache bandwidth. "This is like taking your Ford Pinto and giving it eight cylinders, making sure it has a really good fuel and air injection system, and giving it proper controls," he observed. Zen is based on a clean-sheet design. It has a new cache hierarchy, improved branch prediction, and simultaneous multithreading. It will scale to meet a broad range of use cases, from fanless 2-in-1s to embedded systems, high-performance computing and data centers, AMD noted. AMD hasn't begun to focus, suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. However, "it's likely this part will do better than Intel on some loads and not as well on others -- that has yet to be determined," he told TechNewsWorld. Picking Up Steam AMD underclocked the Intel Broadwell to match Summit Ridge in the demo -- the Broadwell is clocked at 3.6 GHz, noted Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "We expect AMD will be able to match or exceed the Intel clock speeds when [Summit Ridge] ships in early 2017," he told TechNewsWorld. AMD also demoed the 32-core, 64-thread Zen-based Naples server processor, in a dual-processor server running Windows Server, at the San Francisco event. Both processors demoed are CPU-only, which is unusual for AMD. "AMD wanted to ... give a further glimpse of where we are in development of our next-gen product, and take the opportunity to demonstrate a variety of combinations," spokesperson Jay Marsden told TechNewsWorld. The company "has been strong on having graphics and the chipset together, but this is not an APU -- it doesn't have the graphics on the chip," Gartner's Reynolds noted. That makes it easier to debug the processor and "tells us they're designing the processor to go after high-performance segments -- server sockets and high-end gaming," he suggested. AMD will ship the Naples server in Q2 2017, and an APU processor with integrated graphics for the mobile and small form factor in 2H 2017. Processors for the embedded market will include both CPU-only items and APUs. Zen Processor Caveats "The Zen core achieved a 40 percent generational improvement in instructions per cycle, but IPC is not a good measure," Reynolds said. The speed at which a processor works is determined by how much time it spends waiting for instructions, so "even a really good processor might spend 40 percent of its time sitting around," he pointed out, "and if you make it twice as fast, that means it's waiting around twice as long." Further, Blender is "heavy on floating point," Reynolds noted, "We didn't get any kind of spread benchmark. The waiting around needs to be dealt with, and we need to see multiple benchmarks." The Zen core has dedicated PCIe lanes for cutting-edge USB, graphics, data, and other I/O, so it won't take lanes from other devices and components, AMD said. "Without dedicated lanes, devices can compete for resources, lowering performance," Enderle explained. Until the processors are independently tested, "this is more of a showcase of what the product may do, and not yet what it will do," he cautioned, but OEMS "are unusually excited about [the Zen core], which tends to suggest there is fire under all this smoke." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 30, 2016 at 5:22PM Image source: Intel.  Over the last five to six years, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked quite a lot about its efforts to become a major player in the market for processors and related components targeted at smartphones and tablets. Followers of the company's mobile strategy know that it was a spectacular failure. Intel couldn't deliver competitive products at the breakneck pace required to succeed in the market. As a result, as part of restructuring actions announced earlier this year, Intel cancelled all of the mobile processors that it had previously told investors to expect to come to market. At this point, it looked as though the company had effectively exited the market for smartphone processors altogether, opting instead to focus on building stand-alone modems with the aim of winning business at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, at a recent investor conference, an Intel executive indicated that Intel would eventually be back in the smartphone processor game. In this column, I would like to outline what I believe would be a winning strategy for the company in the mobile market. A three-pronged approach Intel's ultimate goal in mobile is to generate the heftiest return possible for its shareholders; this means keeping spending down and revenues (and gross profit margins) high. To that end, the company can go after this market in the following three key ways: contract chip manufacturing, sales of stand-alone modems, and sales of integrated applications processor and modem products. Let's take a look at what Intel's strategy could be in each of these segments. Contract chip manufacturing, but not for everybody I don't think Intel is particularly well set up to become a truly general purpose contract chip manufacturer. Where I think Intel can add value is for customers that are potentially willing to pay more in order to get better performance/power consumption than they otherwise could have from one of Intel's competitors (assuming that Intel's technology can remain superior to what the competition offers). Intel already announced that it will build chips for LG, and there are rumblings that Intel may be trying to win at least some of Apple's A-series chip business at some point down the line. I don't think Intel should (or, frankly, could) build chips for all of the mobile chip companies. However, if Intel is serious about this business, and if its technology is really ahead of the competition's, then going after high end mobile chip customers -- particularly ones that don't compete with Intel's own product lines -- could be a nice way for Intel to profit from mobile. The stand-alone modem opportunity When the tear-downs for Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 come in, many expect that Intel will supply modems for some of the models. As far as smartphones go, Apple is really the only company that still relies on stand-alone modems rather than on modems integrated into the same piece of silicon as the applications processor. As long as Apple continues to use such stand-alone modems, and as long as Intel builds competitive modems for this market, the iPhone could represent a nice opportunity for the chipmaker to try to profit from the mobile market. That said, this is the most "fragile" of the mobile opportunities in front of Intel. If Apple ever builds up a competent modem team and decides to integrate the modem into its applications processors, then Intel's iPhone-related revenue will go to zero within a couple of product generations. Integrated applications processors and modems As Intel's modems gain credibility in the marketplace, there may be an opportunity for the chip-maker to take those modems and integrate them into applications processors targeted at low-end and mid-range smartphones. In fact, I would imagine such applications processors would be fairly generic, packing ARM Cortex A-series processor cores, graphics and media engines from either ARM or Imagination, and a few in-house technologies (such as the image signal processor, memory controller, and modem). If these chips can meet the performance/power/feature requirements of low-end and mid-range smartphones, Intel could probably bring in a reasonable amount of revenue for a relatively small incremental investment. Intel shouldn't bother trying to build in-house chips for the high-end of the smartphone market. These chips tend to be more difficult/complex to produce and the market for them is quite small and increasingly dominated by in-house processor designs. Going after this segment via foundry is the smarter approach. Why this strategy could succeed Intel's prior strategy was to try to build products targeted at every segment of the smartphone market while relying on in-house technology. The strategy, for a number of reasons, clearly failed. What I have outlined above would have a much better chance of succeeding simply because it plays to Intel's strengths. Intel is a world-class chip manufacturer and it is becoming increasingly good at building modems. Attacking the high-end of the market by building other people's chip designs for them solves several problems that Intel faced previously: One problem that Intel faced is that it simply couldn't read the market properly and as such didn't wind up designing chips that were competitive in that segment. By letting mobile experts worry about defining the chip's features, Intel no longer has to deal with trying to predict future market trends. Another problem that Intel would have faced at the high end of the smartphone market, had it actually built competitive products, is that much of this market is held captive by Apple's own A-series processors, as well as in-house efforts from Samsung, Huawei, and others. Intel isn't going to win over Samsung (Samsung is a direct chip manufacturing competitor to Intel), but it could conceivably win over other customers. For the low-end of the market, Intel could leverage a lot of third party technologies in order to bring chips to market fairly quickly. Intel's main points of differentiation here would be the modem as well as the performance/power characteristics of its manufacturing technology. In this case, Intel would again have the benefit of not having to try to predict the future as it would presumably work with ARM and other third-party technology providers to do much of the heavy lifting. Intel's job would be to essentially bundle these technologies with its modems and manufacture them. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Called internally as 'Kaby Lake', the new processors are based on Intel's 14nm (or 14nm+) architecture and are a refined version of last year's 'Skylake' series. The buzzword this year for Intel is 4K, with the company having geared the processors for 4K media consumption and creation. If you're a desktop user and are wondering what's the big deal about 4K encode/decoding then it's worth noting that these new chipsets are primarily aimed at notebook and all-in-one computers, that often come without dedicated GPU and can get all the help they can need for high resolution media processing. According to Intel, the 7th generation processors are more than 70% faster CPU performance and 3.5x faster 3D graphics performance than a 5-year old PC. Compared to the previous generation Skylake, Kaby Lake provides 12% faster productivity performance and 19% faster web performance. Inclusion of HEVC 10-bit and VP9 decode help improve 4K UHD content playback. Intel claims 1500% faster times for creating and editing 4K UHD files. The new processors also come with support native for Thunderbolt 3 over USB Type-C, with 40Gbps bandwidth, dual 4K 60Hz monitor support, 100W power output, external graphics, and Thunderbolt networking support, all over a single cable. You also get support for Gen 3 PCIe support, supporting higher data transfer rates of 8 GT/s versus 5 GT/s with PCIe Gen 2. Intel is also claiming improved battery life, with 3x battery life improvement claimed over local 4K UHD video playback. The chips also run cooler, enabling more fanless designs. With today's announcement, Intel has announced the first six processors from the new series. Three of the parts (Kaby Lake-Y) have a 4.5W TDP and are meant primarily for tablets and 2-in-1 devices with dual core CPU and HD 615 GPU, and the remaining three (Kaby Lake-U) parts have a TDP of 15W and are meant for notebooks with dual core CPUs and HD 620 GPU. The Y series parts include an i7, i5, and m3 processor each, and the U series parts include an i7, i5, and i3. We will be seeing manufactures coming out with new products based on these new processors, possibly even Apple, in the coming months.

Like some of Intel's past CPU launches, low-power SKUs in the 4.5W to 15W range are coming to the market first, with Intel expecting the release of more than 100 designs in Q4 2016. More powerful Kaby Lake variants, including SKUs for desktops and high-performance notebooks, will be unveiled in January 2017. As expected, Kaby Lake is Intel's third processor line manufactured using a 14nm process. However, Intel has made some tweaks to their 14nm process to improve the performance of their CPUs, including improved fin profile and transistor channel strain. These factors help deliver a 12 percent process performance improvement, which brings superior performance and energy efficiency to Kaby Lake when combined with architectural gains. So what sort of performance gains are we looking at? Intel likes to obfuscate performance data in their press material, but it seems Kaby Lake brings around 25 percent better performance per watt than Skylake. Intel is also reporting double digit gains when comparing the new Core i7-7500U to the Core i7-6500U – 12% better "productivity" and 19% better web performance – although part of these gains can be attributed to Kaby Lake's higher clock speeds rather than pure IPC improvements. We'll have to wait until we can get some hands-on time with new Kaby Lake notebooks to see how real-world performance stacks up to last-generation products. One of the major upgrades that Intel has made in Kaby Lake is an improved media engine built upon the company's Gen9 graphics architecture. The Multi-Format Codec (MFX) has been upgraded to support the latest media standards, including 4K 10-bit HEVC decode/encode, 10-bit VP9 decode, and 8-bit VP9 encode. The Video Quality Engine (VQE) also sees improvements, bringing HDR tone mapping and Wide Color Gamut (Rec.2020) support. Intel has targeted power efficiency while designing the new media engine, which allows Y-series parts to support 4Kp30 HEVC encodes in real time. Power usage data shows significant decreases during 4K 10-bit HEVC and 4K VP9 YouTube playback on the Core i7-7500U compared to the i7-6500U, which will lead to increased battery life. Speed Shift technology has been improved in Kaby Lake as well, which allows 7th-generation parts to reach their maximum frequency in just 15 miliseconds. Reaching maximum clock speeds in a shorter amount of time translates into better performance and faster task completion. So far, Intel has announced six Kaby Lake SKUs: three 4.5W Y-series parts, and three 15W U-series parts. What we know about these CPUs is listed in the table below: Model Cores / Threads Base Frequency (GHz) Single-Core Turbo Frequency (GHz) Memory TDP Core i7-7Y75 2/4 1.3 3.6 Dual Channel DDR3L 1600 MHz LPDDR3 1866 MHz 4.5W Core i5-7Y54 1.2 3.2 Core m3-7Y30 1.0 2.6 Core i7-7500U 2.7 3.5 Dual Channel DDR3L 1600 MHz LPDDR3 1866 MHz DDR4 2133 MHz 15W Core i5-7200U 2.5 3.1 Core i3-7100U 2.4 N/A We should be hearing more about new Kaby Lake notebooks and convertibles over the coming days, with availability slated for Q4 2016.

Lifkin Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 1:28 pm | כ"ו אב תשע"ו Intel in Israel employs around 10,000 workers in its Kiryat Gat production center and in four development centers, in Haifa, Yakum, Yerushalayim and Petach Tikvah. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - Israeli high tech basked in the limelight of innovation on Tuesday as Intel unveiled its 7th generation core processor chip, largely a product of the company’s R&D center in Haifa. “The Israeli team did it again,” proclaimed Intel Israel’s head of R&D Ran Senderovit. “I think this is one of the great points of pride for Israeli technology,” he added. “This product will be sold to millions of users around the world.” The high-tech sector has been eulogized in recent months as a has-been of the startup nation, and the news will give it a much-needed boost. The new chip boasts a 12 percent rise in computer performance, longer battery life and better security. The Intel Core enhanced 14-nanometer-plus processor, called Kaby Lake, is its “strongest and fastest ever,” Intel said in a statement. It was built on the foundation of the Skylake processors, which the company launched last year and were also led from Israel. The Kaby Lake processors are more than 70 percent faster than a 5-year-old PC and 3.5 times better in 3D graphics performance, the company said. Kaby Lake will have a longer-lasting battery — 9.5 hours of 4K video playback — and better security, and will enable more natural and intuitive interactions of users with their PCs, Intel said. The chips are set for inclusion in products starting in September, and in 100 million devices on sale through 2016. They will be specially marked with labels identifying them as 7th generation chips.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Intel reportedly wooing Apple as a customer for its ARM foundry business Intel reportedly wooing Apple as a customer for its ARM foundry business By Joel Hruska on August 30, 2016 at 11:30 am Comment Well, that didn’t take long. Less than two weeks after Intel announced it would fab chips for LG as part of a new deal to build ARM products directly at Intel, there are rumors that Intel and Apple have sat down to talk about a similar deal between Cupertino and Santa Clara. Reports indicate that new chips could come as early as 2018, though we’d take that with a grain of salt — even when companies eventually shift suppliers, as Apple did by moving to Samsung from TSMC, it can take years just to iron out the contracts. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that Apple is already trying to nick Apple from TSMC, for all the obvious reasons. Pulling in Apple’s business would give Intel’s custom foundry division instant credibility and establish it as a force to be reckoned with. “TSMC could face tough competition as soon as 2018 or 2019 as Intel is likely to gain orders from Apple by then,” Samuel Wang, a veteran semiconductor analyst at research company Gartner, told the Nikkei Asian Review. “Intel has begun to engage with Apple and it aims to grab one or two top-tier customers from TSMC.” Intel, TSMC, and Samsung feature sizes at 14nm. Intel leads the market, but can it translate that leadership to advantages for its customers? Whether or not Intel can grab those customers successfully will depend on whether or not it can adapt its foundry technology and practices to service a very different set of clients. As we covered when Intel canceled its smartphone and tablet chips, Intel already took a serious go at this. Intel’s cost structures weren’t designed to serve the same markets where TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries find their customers, and the company had difficulty finding a business model for Atom that actually earned it enough money to make competing in the segment profitable. As for why Apple would want to forge a relationship with Intel, Chipzilla’s foundry knowledge may be to valuable to resist. While TSMC and Samsung have continued to push their own roadmaps, their upcoming 10nm products will apparently be hybridized designs — we’ve heard rumors of 10/20nm, though other sources have stuck to 10/14nm. Either way, Intel is likely to maintain a lead in terms of absolute foundry technology — they’ve still got the only full 14nm die shrink, and they’ll have the only 10nm shrink as well. The big question is, can Intel turn its foundry prowess into income for itself and its various customers? Apple is undoubtedly interested in Santa Clara’s foundry technology, it’d be a fool not to explore the possibility — but Intel will have to demonstrate that it can deliver the goods that Apple wants. Right now, 10nm chips from Santa Clara are expected in mid-2017, with 7nm not anticipated until 2019 or 2020. 2018 is probably the earliest we’d see chips from an Intel / Apple deal and it wouldn’t surprise us to see that date slip.

Looks like history's repeating itself this time around. Credit: Apple More like this When will Apple put Intel’s Kaby Lake chips inside new Macs? Thoughts on Apple’s MacBook Pro touchscreen plan 13 reasonable iPad Pro 2 rumors Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Reports of the death of the platform have, it seems, been exaggerated and Apple is about to answer the prayers of millions of Mac users with a rash of significant hardware improvements, announcing some of these this year. Mac attack It can’t come soon enough. Mac users have become anxious concerning Apple’s commitment to its PC platform. They feel that the company hasn’t been focusing on innovation and improvement for its machines. With no significant improvement made since 2013, how else should the company’s Mac Pro users feel? There has also been lots of speculation concerning any Apple plans to deploy Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, with some reports going so far as to claim the chip may not appear in Macs at all.   With no significant upgrades across most Mac models, there is no surprise that Mac sales have dropped in response. Apple has left Mac users wilting on the vine. Time for change Time is money for Apple’s pro users, particularly those of us whose tax liability exceeds the estimated 0.005 percent the world’s most profitable company thinks it ethical to pay. Performance and productivity demands mean Mac pros have wanted their Macs to be pro, and some have begun migrating elsewhere on strength of the company’s perceived lack of innovation in recent years. Things are about to change. Apple is preparing to introduce a range of new Macs this year, with major improvements across its iPad range planned for 2017. “The refreshed Mac hardware line includes new versions of the iMac desktop, MacBook Air laptop, and a 5K standalone monitor in collaboration with LG Electronics Inc., in addition to a thinner MacBook Pro laptop,” Bloomberg reports. This is also where we can expect to see the new MacBook Pro with a touchstripe controller. Late 2016 “The Macs are expected as soon as late 2016,” Bloomberg explains. That’s great news for Mac users, as it means we can get a little reassurance as to the value of the Mac platform to Apple and its future strategy. And we may even see these machines ship with more memory than before. That Apple plans to introduce these products before year’s end opens up an interesting possibility in light of recent claims concerning the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum, Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich promised the first systems containing these new chips would ship this fall. However, it has previously been claimed Kaby Lake chips suitable for use in iMacs, Mac minis and portable Macs won’t appear until next year. This may still be true – Apple may simply announce new models of these machines promising to ship them in the new tax year. It may also be true that Kaby Lake chips suitable for use in Mac Pro systems will be available. A new Mac Pro seems possible So, will Apple introduce a new Mac Pro this year? It seems possible, given Bloomberg’s claim that Apple is developing a 5K monitor with LG. Why wouldn’t you want an amazing monitor with your new and amazing pro Mac? You already have a 5K monitor in your iMac. Hopefully Apple will use this event as an opportunity to put the latest and greatest processors inside of Macs. The company hasn’t really kept pace in this. “The only Apple laptop computer with the sixth generation Skylake processor is the 2016 12-inch MacBook. The Mid 2015 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro uses the fourth generation Haswell processor. The late 2015 iMac has Skylake desktop-class processors,” says AppleInsider. Apple’s macOS illustrates its continued commitment to the OS, but putting the most powerful processors inside its most expensive Mac seems a no brainer. Just make sure you don’t spend all your money on new iOS kit this September. Google+?

[x] Countdown to 2017 with HEXUS and ARM [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU Laptop News 13 Intel launches 'Kaby Lake' 7th generation Core CPUs for laptops by Mark Tyson on 30 August 2016, 16:00 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qac6a3 Add to My Vault: Intel today launched the first chips in its highly anticipated 'Kaby Lake' 7th generation Core processor family. This initial selection of Y-Series and U-Series chips is destined for laptops and other compact form factor devices. In the headline improvements Intel promises "more responsive performance than ever before," efficient 4K entertainment viewing/streaming, gaming on the go, the thinnest and lightest devices ever and improved I/O support. In an email to HEXUS, Intel supplied some broad performance improvements stats for the new processors. To add numbers to its 'faster and more responsive' claims, Intel says that a 14nm+ 7th Gen Intel Core processor delivers up to 12 per cent faster productivity performance, and up to 19 per cent faster web performance, over the previous generation Skylake chips. 4K video Perhaps an even greater improvement comes for those who like to, or wish to, consume 4K content. Intel's 7th generation Core processors facilitate the creation, editing and sharing of 4K UHD and 360-degree clips up to 15 times faster than a 5 year old PC, thanks to the new media engine (Intel Core i5-7200U vs. Intel Core i5-2467M). Efficiency is perhaps more impressive with Kaby Lake portables capable of watching over 9 hours of 4K content on a single charge. The new Core i7-7500U has a CPU utilisation rate of around 5 per cent and power usage of 0.5 watts when playing local 4K video, for example. The new chips manage this feat with hardware encoding and decoding for 10-bit HEVC 4K video and 8 to 10-bit VP9 video. Furthermore Kaby Lake supports the Dolby Vision and HDR10 HDR standards for a greater colour gamut. Gaming Beyond the impact from the double digit general computing performance hike, those who rely upon integrated graphics could see significant gains with Kaby Lake. Again compared to a five year old PC, the new Kaby Lake chips can provide a threefold increase in frame rates in modern games titles. Intel provides an example of playing Overwatch smoothly "anytime and anywhere on a thin, light laptop". If you need 'moar powah' Intel reckons that there will be many more devices provided with Thunderbolt 3 which can facilitate external GPUs. I/O options Both Y- and U-Series chips support Gen 3 PCIe for faster compact fixed storage options. The aforementioned Thunderbolt 3 connector will become more prevalent and it can do much more than external gaming graphics, providing multi-screen connections, mouse, keyboard, even up to 100W AC power supply, plus USB speed of up to 40Gbps. If you are interested in specific processors in the Y- and U-Series, Intel details three of each in its fact sheet PDF, all of which are configured as 2C/4T designs (listed on page 10 and 11). Designs featuring the new mobile 7th gen Intel processors will start to become available in September. Intel says that it has over 100 design wins for 2-in-1s and laptop products scheduled for release before Xmas. For desktop Intel Kaby Lake chips, which many HEXUS readers will be most interested in, we will have to wait until January for official details and a launch.

Credit: Intel More like this Kaby Lake starts strong as Intel retools PC strategy Intel's Kaby Lake chips will include integrated 4K graphics processors Intel ships Kaby Lake chips, pointing to PC availability in a few months Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles New chips can be a reason to upgrade PCs. But does Intel's latest 7th Generation Core chip, code-named Kaby Lake, have enough bite to trigger replacements of old PCs? Intel hopes so. The company is framing Kaby Lake PCs as go-to devices for productivity, virtual reality, and 4K gaming and video. So far, Kaby Lake is off to a good start. About 100 laptops, 2-in-1s, and tablets with Kaby Lake installed will be available from PC makers by the end of this year. On paper, Kaby Lake's launch comes at an inopportune time. PC shipments are slumping, the replacement cycle has slowed to six years, and consumers are instead using smartphones and phablets for computing. Many older PCs are powerful enough to run Windows 10. Intel can't escape the overall decline in PC shipments, so it is focusing on the growing segments of 2-in-1s, gaming PCs, and virtual reality. It's also betting that Kaby Lake will aid in the revival of the PC, with the sudden emergence of VR. Kaby Lake is faster and more power-efficient than its predecessor, called Skylake. It is also the first Intel PC chip with native 4K graphics support, and that feature is especially important to the company's fast-emerging virtual reality and mixed reality plans. Intel may also have some surprises up its sleeve with Kaby Lake. There's a good chance that the Core processors make their way into an odd VR headset or two that need 4K graphics. For potential buyers, it may be worth upgrading to a sleek hybrid laptop-tablet PC with Kaby Lake if your current laptop feels slow. The Kaby Lake CPUs are 12 to 19 percent faster than Skylake. Applications will run better, and battery life of laptops will improve. Kaby Lake's graphics features stand out, with laptops able to play 4K video without the need for a discrete graphics card. Laptops will run continuously for 9.25 hours when running 4K video, said Chris Walker, vice president of Intel's Client Computing Group and general manager of Mobility Client Platforms. You'll be able to stream 4K video from the internet, and casual 4K games will run smoothly. The 4K support will be included on chips from the lowest-powered 2-in-1 Core chips drawing 4.5 watts to the 15-watt chips for mainstream PCs. The first batch of Kaby Lake chips will be targeted at Windows 10 PCs. There will be no Windows 7 PCs with Kaby Lake, Walker said. For Windows 10 laptops, Intel is hyping the "Windows Hello" features, in which biometric authentication techniques can be used to log into PCs.  In January, Intel will release a new batch of heavy-hitting Kaby Lake PC chips that will service VR headsets like Oculus Rift, which are attached to high-end PCs. Those chips will also be targeted at gaming PCs. Around that time, gamers should be able to get their hands on super-fast Intel SSDs called Optane, based on a groundbreaking 3D Xpoint technology. Over time, Kaby Lake will be installed in Intel's thumb-sized Compute Sticks and mini-desktops called NUCs. The chip will support Chrome OS, Walker said, meaning Kaby Lake will also be available for Chromebooks. Intel's PC future also includes VR and augmented reality headsets, though details on the chip strategy for those devices are grainy. The company doesn't make chips specifically for headsets, but some use PC-based, low-power Atom and Core chips.  At the recent Intel Developer Forum, Intel stunned the audience with its Project Alloy mixed reality headset. It included a Core chip code-named Skylake, and the device gave a subtle hint on the direction of Intel's PC chips. To be certain, the Project Alloy headset was a prototype, and its specifications aren't finalized. But it raises a question: Will VR and AR headsets have Kaby Lake chips someday? Intel made no promises, but it's a possibility. "Many of the power-performance attributes that 7th Generation [chips] have could be used in the future," Walker said. Specifications for Alloy will be released later. Alloy will use Windows Holographic, and possibly other platforms, to run AR applications. Intel's low-end Core Y processors, which consume 4.5 watts of power, could be used in headsets. They can handle 4K graphics, critical for VR headsets. The headsets won't match the experience of an Oculus Rift, but the performance should be good enough to stream movies from the internet. Beyond content consumption, Kaby Lake PCs could be powerful content creation tools for VR and AR by using hardware-based 4K graphics encoding and decoding. Kaby Lake is the third Intel PC chip made using the 14-nanometer process after Broadwell and Skylake. It broke the tradition of Intel making two PC chips per manufacturing process. Manufacturing problems forced Intel to add Kaby Lake to 14-nm and slow down its advance to the next-generation 10-nm manufacturing process. Manufacturing issues or not, Intel plans to deliver a new PC chip each year. The successor to Kaby Lake will be the 10-nm chip code-named Cannonlake, slated for release in 2017.

In today's announcement -- focused on the speed and 4K UHD support the new CPUs provide -- Intel officially unveiled its first Y-Series and U-Series processors, which could be included in future Retina MacBook and MacBook Air updates, respectively. The new Kaby Lake processors (prepared as a mid-generation update ahead of Intel's Cannonlake processors) offer a moderate upgrade on earlier Skylake chips, with Intel focusing on the user benefits of its 7th Generation Core processors. These advantages namely include: 4K ultra-HD video streaming, 360-videos, and more intensive graphical performance for video games on smaller computers. In addition to gaining access to 4K content from services like YouTube and Netflix, Kaby Lake will grant users the power to create and edit their own 4K content with speeds up to 8x faster than a five-year-old PC. Kaby Lake was manufactured using an upgraded version of Intel's 14-nanometer process, referred to as 14nm+, which the company claims has produced a processor with 12 percent faster productivity performance and up to 19 percent faster web performance over previous generations. Everyday users will see these manifested in smooth app switching, even within performance-heavy apps like 4K video editing software, and basic battery life improvements. In this department, Kaby Lake will bring up to 9.5 hours of playback on 4K videos in any computer it's found in this fall. The release of Kaby Lake will mark Intel's first processor released after the company abandoned its tick-tock release cycle, where "ticks" represented shrinking chip fabrication processes and "tocks" introduced new architectures. Kaby Lake "Y-Series" chips appropriate for MacBook The three Kaby Lake Y-Series processors announced today are suitable upgrades for the MacBook, which was just updated to Skylake chips in April and thus is not expected to see another upgrade in the near future. The three U-Series chips could potentially make their way into future MacBook Air models, assuming graphics performance is sufficient for Apple's needs. The new U-Series chips include Intel HD "GT2" graphics, while Apple has historically preferred to use chips with relatively higher-performance "GT3" graphics in the MacBook Air. Kaby Lake "U-Series" chips possibly appropriate for MacBook Air Apple is rumored to be launching updated MacBook Air models as soon as October, but it is unclear whether the machines will use Skylake or these new Kaby Lake chips, as the current models continue to run on earlier Broadwell chips. More powerful mobile Kaby Lake chips with Iris graphics and desktop chips such as those appropriate for the MacBook Pro and iMac are expected to begin debuting in January, but Intel did not release a specific timeline or specs for those families.

Anything coming out in the next two months has been locked for a while. Now lets all stop pretending they might sneak in Kaby Lake because it's only going to lead to some very sad faces around here in a couple of weeks if we all keep hoping with our fingers crossed regardless.

People here behave like they are running nuclear fusion simulations on their tiny laptops and crave for every extra instruction cycle ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle') boost. That's hilarious! The only sad but true argument about Apple is that; they don't lower prices on (CPU)outdated Macs. But whether you have the newest Kaby Lake or Hasswell architecture inside, you won't notice the difference while you work.

Reader MojoKid writes: Intel is readying a new family of processors, based on its next-gen Kaby Lake microarchitecture, that will be the foundation of the company's upcoming 7th Generation Core processors. Although Kaby Lake marks a departure from Intel's "tick-tock" release cadence, there have been some tweaks made to its 14nm manufacturing process (called 14nm+) that have resulted in significant gains in performance, based on clock speed boosts and other optimizations. In addition, Intel has incorporated a new multimedia engine into Kaby Lake that adds hardware acceleration for 4K HEVC 10-bit transcoding and VP9 decoding. Skylake could handle 1080p HEVC transcoding, but it didn't accelerate 4K HEVC 10-bit transcoding or VP9 decode and had to assist with CPU resources. The new multimedia engine gives Kaby Lake the ability to handle up to eight 4Kp30 streams and it can decode HEVC 4Kp60 real-time content at up to 120Mbps. The engine can also now offload 4Kp30 real-time encoding in a dedicated fixed-function engine. Finally, Intel has made some improvements to their Speed Shift technology, which now takes the processor out of low power states to maximum frequency in 15 milliseconds. Clock speed boosts across Core i and Core m 7th gen series processors of 400-500 MHz, in combination with Speed Shift optimizations, result in what Intel claims are 12-9 percent performance gains in the same power envelope as its previous generation Skylake series, and even more power efficient video processing performance. hardware intel amd ← Related Links → Grumpy Cat Wants $600K From 'Pirating' Coffee Maker Submission: Intel Unveils Full Details Of Kaby Lake 7th Gen Core Series Processors New Intel and AMD Chips Will Only Support Windows 10 Intel Confuses, Rebrands Some Core M Processors As Core I Why Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Zen Will Only Be Optimized On Windows 10 Apple Ordered To Pay Up To $14.5 Billion in EU Tax Crackdown, Cook Refutes EU's Conclusion This discussion has been archived.

By Kara Baskin Globe Correspondent  August 30, 2016 Do you crave Southern food in slinky surroundings? Cool Ranch-flavored plantains from a legendary restaurateur? Sashimi or salumi from a celebrity chef? Veggies cultivated in a hydroponic hotel garden? All this and more could be yours this fall, when Boston enjoys an especially busy season of restaurant debuts from national names and hometown notables. Read on for a rundown of Boston’s autumn openings. The fine print: Restaurant debuts are always subject to change, so dates are tentative. Area Four Boston Advertisement When: Early October Where: 262 E. Berkeley St., Boston Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Who: A4 founder Michael Krupp and executive chef-partner Jeff Pond Intel: Head to the Troy Boston building, near the Ink Block in the South End, for meals cooked over an open flame, including roasted meats, fish, vegetables, and the signature pizzas that earned fans in Cambridge. As for digs? The team calls the new space a cross between “vintage kitsch and high design.” The Automatic When: November Advertisement Where: 50 Hampshire St., Cambridge Who: East Coast Grill guru Chris Schlesinger and bartender extraordinaire Dave Cagle Intel: “Fun, fast, and flavorful but not fussy” is how Cagle describes his venture with Schlesinger. “Think ‘Cheers’ (the one on TV, not the tourist destination) with tattooed servers and punk rock music. Maybe a mix between the B-Side Lounge and East Coast Grill?” If this combo doesn’t entice you, chef Ian Andreotta’s menu surely will — an eclectic assemblage ranging from chili dogs to red curry mussels to the aforementioned Cool Ranch plantains. There’s a patio, too. Benedetto When: Late October Where: The Charles Hotel, 1 Bennett St., Cambridge Who: Giulia chef-owner Michael Pagliarini Intel: Pagliarini calls this 200-seat hotel restaurant a higher-end version of his Porter Square trattoria, Giulia, complete with a swanky private dining room and truffles served tableside, as well as a pasta table. Pastry chef Renae Connolly comes from Cambridge’s Café ArtScience. “She’s an absolute star,” Pagliarini says. The Burro Bar When: November Where: 1665 Beacon St., Brookline Who: Joe Cassinelli, chef-owner of Alpine Restaurant Group (The Painted Burro, Posto, Rosebud). Intel: Expect a smaller-scale version of the Davis Square Burro within the old Ribelle space, serving tacos, tortas, nachos, and hopefully their signature hot dog topped with chipotle ketchup and agave mustard. Buttermilk and Bourbon When: November Where: Back Bay, Boston Who: Maverick chef Jason Santos Intel: The aqua-maned Santos helms this 150-seat, Bayou-inflected enclave, which he describes as having “the energy of Toro and the food of Hungry Mother — Southern ingredients prepared properly.” Santos, ever creative, says he’ll cast aside gumbos and jambalaya in favor of biscuit buckets, house-fried chicken with Nashville hot sauce, and Scorpion bowls. At the entrance? A small bar with champagne on tap to set the mood. Catalyst Café When: November Where: 75 Binney St., Cambridge Who: Catalyst chef-owner William Kovel Intel: Kovel takes his fine-dining restaurant, Catalyst, down a notch with a casual cafe outside of Kendall Square, where he’ll serve breakfast and lunch. “We’ve been having a lot of fun with breakfast sandwiches and doughnuts,” he reveals. “Plus hot chocolate. My kids love hot chocolate.” Certified Meatball Company When: November Where: 429 West Broadway, South Boston Who: Boston Nightlife Ventures, the team behind Southern Kin and Wink & Nod Intel: BNV chief culinary officer Bill Brodsky wonders, “Who doesn’t love a good meatball?” Who indeed! He’ll serve six types of balls with sauce pairings, plus unusual combos like turducken balls, cashew-curried vegetable balls, and bao balls atop steamed bao buns. Cultivar When: Late fall Where: The Ames Hotel, 1 Court St., Boston Who: Mary Dumont, lately seen at Cambridge’s Harvest Intel: Savor foraged food, sustainable seafood, and dry-aged meats inside Boston’s first skyscraper, with many ingredients coming from the restaurant’s hydroponic and hanging gardens. “This is modern American food with a huge emphasis on the modern garden concept,” Dumont says. Cunard Tavern When: November Where: 25 Orleans St., East Boston Who:Ducali and Lucia owner Phil Frattaroli Intel: Frattaroli oversees this waterfront gastropub on the site of his grandfather’s former woodshop. But times have changed. “Now there’s tons of Italian, Mexican, and Central American food here, so I wanted to do traditional pub food,” he says. There are 65 seats, a 35-seat roof deck, and what Frattaroli describes as a “really good burger on an English muffin.” Brunch, too. East Coast Grill When: Early November Where: 1271 Cambridge St., Cambridge Who: Highland Kitchen’s Mark Romano and wife Marci Joy Intel: Romano and Joy hope to revive the Inman Square institution with a bigger drink menu, plus many of the spicy barbecue dishes fans knew and loved for 30 years. The original restaurant closed in January, much to the neighborhood’s dismay. Jemal Countess/Getty Images/file 2010 Chef Mario Batali. Eataly When: November Where: The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston St., Boston Who: Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich, and Lidia Bastianich, others Intel: Eataly Boston will have “the best seafood ever — and different than in other Eataly cities,” promises a rep for the Italian dining and shopping emporium. The 45,000-square-foot gastroplex at the Pru will also have a La Pizza & La Pasta restaurant (serving the obvious), plus a seafood restaurant, Il Pesce, and a hands-on cooking school. En Boca When: September Where: 8 Holyoke St., Cambridge Who: Ben Lacy (Ten Tables Cambridge), Devin Broo (Bar Boulud), and Classic Restaurant Concepts (forces behind The Asgard and The Kinsale pubs). Intel: The old Sandrine’s space morphs into a small plates restaurant with 132 seats and a menu divvied into “farm,” “land,” “sea,” and “garden,” plus a 17-seat bar with wines on tap. Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff/file Joanne Chang, owner of Flour Bakery and Cafe. Flour Harvard Square When: October Where: 114 Mt. Auburn St., Cambridge Who: Joanne Chang Intel: This is the first of several new Flours for Chang, including upcoming outposts in Kendall Square and the Back Bay. It is, however, the only one with the distinction of being housed in a former Chili’s. Gre.Co When: Late October Where: 225 Newbury St., Boston Who: Demetri Tsolakis from the Seaport’s Committee Intel: Committee is a nightlife destination; here, it’s all about Greek food on the go, with meats from Savenor’s Market; produce from Eva’s Garden on the South Shore; and loukoumades (Greek doughnuts) topped with honey, sesame seeds, pistachios, and other treats. La Casa de Pedro When: September Where: 505 Congress St., Boston Who: Pedro Alarcón, chef-owner at Watertown’s 20-year-old flagship. Intel: A patio! An outdoor bar! Live music! A ceviche bar, and even a takeout cafe! La Casa de Pedro brings a splash of Latin excitement to the Seaport, with dishes from Venezuela and beyond. The Watertown original is routinely jammed with couples, families, and boisterous groups swilling mojitos — expect the same here. Moona When: October Where: 243 Hampshire St., Cambridge Who: Mohamad El Zein, former operations director for Masa, and Rod Ouassaidi, owner of South End Pita. Intel: Moona translates to “pantry” in Arabic. As such, expect a focus on preserved ingredients like olives, pickles, cheeses, spices, and jams, used in Arabic and Eastern Mediterranean dishes designed to share. PABU When: Fall Where: Millennium Tower, 1 Franklin St., Boston Who: Acclaimed San Francisco chef Michael Mina and sushi master Ken Tominaga Intel: Boston gets its own two-story version of San Francisco’s lauded sushi bar and izakaya, tended by Benjamin Steigers from the California original. Mina’s excited for Boston’s seafood scene — “my very first restaurant [Aqua] was all fish,” he says — and an extensive charcoal-cooked meat program. Also look for multi-course sushi menus with ingredients from Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market and Japanese whiskey aplenty. RFK Kitchen When: Early October Where: 948 Great Plain Ave., Needham Who: Chef-owner Rachel Klein, recently seen at Liquid Art House Intel: A family-friendly yet sophisticated suburban boite with 100 seats, an open kitchen with a 25-seat dining counter, and a lounge. “We have an American menu with global influences. It’s a place you could go every day and have a burger or do a chef’s tasting menu,” says Klein, eager to bring a refined restaurant to the ’burbs (she’s also a resident). “I want a place I can go with my friends. Needham’s a great town with worldly people who enjoy food and eat out all the time,” she says. RUKA When: November Where: The Godfrey Hotel, 505 Washington St., Boston Who: The team behind Downtown Crossing’s Yvonne’s Intel: RUKA will grace the Godfrey’s lobby with a style of Peruvian-Japanese fusion known as Nikkei. Executive chef Preston Miller worked with chef April Bloomfield at New York City’s Michelin-starred The Breslin. Waypoint When: Now open Where: 1030 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge Who: Alden & Harlow’s Michael Scelfo and Seth Freidus Intel: Enjoy caviar service, roasts, a bakery program, pizza (the chopped clam version, above), and plenty of regional seafood from the Alden & Harlow team, with local help: Dine on plates designed by Boston ceramicist Jeremy Ogusky amid neon signage from collector Dave Waller. This is merely the beginning, of course. Also expect a branch of Island Creek Oyster Bar in Burlington, a Boston deli from Tasty Burger’s Dave DuBois, a waterfront restaurant at The Eddy luxury apartment in East Boston from former Pigalle chef Marc Orfaly, an Italian restaurant called MIDA in the South End, and the Seaport’s Oak + Rowan from the team behind Newburyport’s Ceia and Brine, with tableside liquor carts and a caviar program.

According to Chipzilla, the first wave of the new Cores will appear in 10mm-thick notebooks and two-in-one convertible tablets aimed at small businesses and normal folk. The CPUs will consume 4.5W to 15W, depending on the model, and go on sale in more than 100 laptop designs by the end-of-year shopping rush. They'll include Intel's usual integrated HD Graphics chipset. Come January, enterprise PCs, workstations and beefier notebooks and desktop systems will ship with the chips, some with Intel's Iris graphics chipset. Presumably that's when you'll be able to get your hands on individual processors to build you own rigs by hand. The processors are powered by the 14nm Kaby Lake microarchitecture. This is the Skylake microarchitecture – as used in 2015's 14nm sixth-generation Core family – with some tweaks and optimizations. Intel inserted Kaby Lake into its lineup after its tick-tock product cycle missed a beat. Usually, Intel shrinks a microarchitecture to a new process size and ships it (that's the tick), and later rolls out a new microarchitecture using that process size (that's the tock). There's a 12 to 18-month gap between the ticks and tocks. The latest tock was the introduction of Skylake on 14nm. The next tick was going to be Cannonlake, aka Skylake on 10nm, but that was delayed to 2017 because Intel couldn't perfect the shrink in time. So in the meantime, we've been lumped with Kaby Lake, an optimized Skylake redux on 14nm. (Intel has now given up on the tick-tock approach, for what it's worth.) What do we mean by optimized? Well, for one thing, better physical manufacturing techniques. Intel says it has improved the fin design and the channel strain in its FinFETs. The shape of the fin has a massive effect on the operation of the transistor, potentially reducing the leakage current significantly. Increasing the strain in the channel increases performance and lowers power consumption by cutting the atomic forces that interfere with electron flow. Intel's seventh-generation dual-core die with builtin GPU ... Click to enlarge any pics According to Intel, these fabrication improvements from Skylake to Kaby Lake, plus some CPU enhancements, give seventh-generation Cores up to a 12 per cent performance boost over the sixth-generation – well, when running the SYSmark benchmark on a seventh-gen 15W 3.5GHz Core i7 7500U versus a sixth-gen 15W 3.1GHz Core i7 6500U. When running the WebXPRT benchmark on the same chips, the performance boost from Skylake to Kaby Lake can reach up to 19 per cent, we're told. Generation debate ... How 2015 and 2016's Cores compare (Source: Intel) So in other words, changing up from a 2015 Core i7 to the equivalent 2016 part can speed up web browsing by up to a fifth, in theory. Chipzilla also says its seventh-generation Cores are more power friendly when streaming vids: the new Core i7 7500U can play 4K VP9 video for seven hours on a 66Whr battery that a sixth-gen Core i7 6500U chomps through in just four hours when streaming the same material. That's generation on generation, though. These figures are only of use to snarks like us who want to see what Intel engineers have achieved in the past year, and for geeks who upgrade their machines every 12 months. Intel really hopes Kaby Lake prizes punters off their 2011-era PCs; anyone tempted to replace their computer will be blown away by the improvements in the past five years and crack out their credit card. At least, that's the dream. "Most people who are going to buy a new PC are not buying to replace last year's – well, maybe we wish they were but they are not, they are replacing devices that are five or more years old," said Intel spokeswoman Karen Regis. "There are 400 million users who are using PCs that are five or more years old." Intel reckons today's seventh-gen Core i5 7200U is 70 per cent faster than its five-year-old Core i5 2467M equivalent in SYSmark benchmarks, can convert a 4K video to 1080p H.264 6.8 times faster, and score three times better in the 3Dmark gaming benchmark. More information on the individual chips, and their speeds and feeds, will appear, as always, on Intel's ARK closer to launch. Finally, there's an addition to Kaby Lake: a new media-processing engine. This performs VP9 and 10-bit HEVC/H.265 decoding in hardware, as well as the usual 1080p HEVC, to reduce power usage even when viewing high-res video – meaning more internet streaming before your battery runs out. Intel calls this "All Day 4K" where "all day" means "nine and a half hours." Highly technical ... Basic outline of the new media engine Kaby Lake chips are able to decode up to eight 4Kp30 AVC and HEVC streams at a time – useful for signs and surveillance gear – and decode 4Kp60 HEVC at up to 120Mbps, which is handy for watching high-quality films and TV on the internet. This video engine also enforces anti-piracy DRM protections as required by the major studios. Hollywood bosses didn't want to stream 4K ultra high-def content from online clouds without mechanisms in place to thwart casual rippers, and so Intel gave the entertainment giants what they wanted. "There are hardware-based protection mechanisms to make the studios comfortable with sharing high-quality content to PCs for the first time," said Regis. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 48 Comments More from The Register Not two, not four, but 10 cores in Intel's new PC powerhouse Perfect for the gamer with money to burn 27 Comments Intel keeps droning on, as PC sales continue to tumble Plans later, but for now here’s $60m, Yuneec 13 Comments Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Intel Reveals More Details About 7th Gen "Kaby Lake" Processors Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 30 August 2016 at 09:30 AM EDT. 21 Comments Intel is making public more details today about their forthcoming 7th Generation Intel Core CPUs, a.k.a. Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake is built for the "immersive Internet" and what they are talking up today includes: - Up to 12% faster productivity performance over Skylake. - Up to 19% faster web performance over Skylake. - Improved 4K UHD support with a new media engine on Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake will support hardware-accelerated Vp9 decoding along with 4K HEVC 10-bit encode/decode with this new media engine. - As already known, Kaby Lake graphics are built off the Gen9 Skylake architecture. But with Kaby Lake we should be seeing higher clock frequencies for the graphics. - Native Thunderbolt 3 support as "one port that does it all." - 2-in-1s and laptops powered by Kaby Lake CPUs will be available starting in September. These Kaby Lake designs for devices coming out this year are from 4.5 to 15 Watt. - The desktop and enterprise Kaby Lake launch isn't happening until early 2017.

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | August 30, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Processors Intel says that the modern-day consumer is now demanding an "immersive" experience from the internet and has unveiled the 7th generation Intel Core processor family to support this concept through 4K UHD, 360-degree video, and high-resolution video streaming. On Tuesday, the tech giant said the new range of processors has been designed for a concept Intel calls the "immersive internet," the idea surrounding the web becoming richer in content. According to Karen Regis, director of mobile platform marketing at Intel, consumers are demanding more immersive experiences such as 4K UHD, virtual reality, and e-sports -- alongside high-quality video -- and so the PC must transform to suit these trends. The PC is the "ideal device for the immersive internet," the executive says, but there must be enough processing power to follow suit. The 7th generation processors, developed under the codename "Kaby Lake," are built on the Skylake architecture. The 14nm processors are supported by a new media engine which is equipped with new HEVC 10-bit decode capabilities for better playback of media content up to 4K UHD and new VP9 decode features for improved 4K UHD,4K 360-degree playback while multitasking. Intel's new media engine In addition, the processor family -- including Intel Core m3, Intel Core i5, and i7 processors -- come with Intel HD Graphics, Turbo Boost, and Speed Shift capabilities, alongside improved photo and video editing, multiple video streams, and high-resolution video chat. The firm says there is a "significant" improvement in performance in comparison to previous generation hardware due to the new codecs and a new "media block" framework which speeds up hardware acceleration for both codecs and color depths. Intel also claims that on average, the new processors will allow consumers to watch up to 9.5 hours of 4K video playback without a problem. The 7th generation processors will also support Gen 3 PCIe usage, increasing data transfer rates. In addition, while Intel's first-generation processors used 18 watts of power as a design point, the company notes that the 7th generation uses only 4.5 watts, a vast increase in efficiency achieved over several decades. Intel expects devices equipped with the new processor range to begin shipping by September, and over 100 products have been developed using the new hardware at different price points for the first wave. Roughly 350 new designs expected to hit the market by January 2017.

At the time, ‘Kaby Lake’ as the name for Intel’s third crack at their 14nm process was well known, but users wondered if it was just another Devil’s Canyon (better overclocking) or a full on CPU launch. Well the answer is the latter, and the launch is staggered between today and January. Roll on Kaby Lake. Is that Kah-bee Lake, or Kay-bee Lake? Tick-Tock to Process-Architecture-Optimization (PAO) Intel’s two year processor cadence of Tick-Tock allowed the company to alternate reducing the lithography node (a tick) with an upgraded microarchitecture (a tock) with modest gains of performance. Each stage of the Tick-Tock would take 12-15 months, with new lithography nodes taking longer and longer to reach maturity. Eventually it has gotten to a point where 14nm took too long to become pervasive in Intel’s product stack. For a manufacturing company and a CPU company, slowly rolling out Broadwell notebook and low power parts and then gutting the mid-range desktop was the result of the troubles of bringing 14nm to the prime time. Now in 2016 we have the launch of full-sized Broadwell-EP server parts running up to 22 cores in a 145W envelope, but the low power parts are a couple of microarchitectures ahead. We have this strange situation of a stretched landscape, partially driven by markets but also for manufacturing. The move from Intel’s 14nm process to 10nm is a long, slow burn, taking much longer to develop than any process previous. We first saw 14nm in Broadwell mobile CPUs in Q3 of 2014, almost two years ago, and 10nm still isn’t on any public roadmap for early 2017. With the tick-tock strategy, and the launch of Skylake in mid-2015, this would leave Intel without a new CPU launch for almost two years, which is unheard of from Intel. Also, Intel’s partners rely on product cycles to announce and launch new products to generate revenue. To fill the gap, plus with a few other techniques, Intel moved to Process-Architecture-Optimization, or PAO for short. This means three bites of the cherry for 14nm before we see 10nm in prime time. First it was Broadwell, then Skylake, and today Intel is announcing Kaby Lake. As part of the release, Intel has mentioned that a number of key benefits for Kaby Lake will be based on an optimized 14nm process, called 14PLUS (or 14nm+, 14FF+). This process as a quick summary has a higher fin height and larger pitch, essentially giving a less-dense set of transistors that have more room to breathe. Normally a larger pitch means more voltage required, but this is offset by the fin height and Intel says is good for another few hundred MHz for performance. The less-dense design, in theory, may also help in overclocking, however we will have to wait until January to see those results. Today’s Announcement The reveal today covers several aspects of Kaby Lake. First is the actual SKUs that will be launched, which consist of three Kaby Lake-Y parts around 4.5W aimed at high-end tablets and 2-in-1 devices and three Kaby Lake-U parts at 15W for notebooks. Both sets of KBL-Y and KBL-U CPUs will feature in mini-PCs as well, so we expect to see the usual array of Zotac and ECS announcements in due course. We have details on all six CPUs to give you, including the new Core M branding regime for the 4.5W family of parts. The pre-briefings we have had go into some detail regarding changes in the processor, particularly regarding the new enhanced media blocks inside the GPU to support new encode/decode features. The graphics power, in terms of EUs or the microarchitecture, hasn’t changed but the fixed function hardware has some nice upgrades for an updated version of Gen 9 graphics aimed at the upcoming era of 4K support. Ganesh has gone into detail for us over what that means, especially where power and battery life is concerned for anyone creating/consuming 4K content. Kaby Lake also has an updated Speed Shift package, to accelerate the work already done with Skylake in boosting the performance of the CPU quicker to save power. Intel call it a refinement in the mechanism of handing frequency control back from the OS to the CPU, however ‘Speed Shift v2’ is an adequate moniker to show the upgraded difference. Intel hasn’t gone into much detail regarding the new 14nm+ process itself in terms of specifics, but has listed a number of performance gains that come out of the new CPU. The fundamental microarchitecture between Skylake and the new Kaby Lake parts is practically unchanged (DMI 3.0 now allows PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe drives from the integrated PCH), but the updated fin profile and reduced ‘strain’ by the larger fin pitch is being quoted as giving a 12% performance increase due to process alone, typically through additional frequency for the same power. The main benefits to KBL will be in that frequency due to the 14nm+ process as well as the new media capabilities. As always, Intel consistently emphasizes the difference between a new notebook/2-in-1 based on a 15W Kaby Lake processor compared to a 5-year old device, such one based on a mobile Sandy Bridge ULV part. Intel continually sees its market revolving around new experiences created by new form factors, and to generate revenue requires people to upgrade and decide how these new experiences can influence an upgrade. Intel expects to have over 100 Kaby Lake system designs in the consumer channel by Q4, including 120+ using Thunderbolt 3, 100+ using Windows Hello (either via a Real Sense camera or a fingerprint sensor), 50+ designs with 4K UHD as a primary feature and 25+ designs with contact enabled pens. Kaby Lake should be pin compatible with Skylake based designs, meaning that for a number of cases we will simply see a drop in, but others will have new design IDs on show.

POST A COMMENT 133 Comments View All Comments hansmuff - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Does any of the new fixed-function logic that is part of the GPU get to work when I use a discrete GPU instead of the integrated? I remember that on my old SB chip, the GPU just was turned off because I use discrete. How have things changed, if at all? Reply Ryan Smith - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Typically you'll be using the dGPU for video decoding since it's closer to the display pipeline. However you can totally use QuickSync for video encoding, even with a dGPU. Reply hansmuff - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Ah yes, QuickSync in particular was a question for me. While NVENC certainly does do a fine job, if I have a hardware encoder laying dormant in the CPU, it might as well do stream encoding for me :) Reply npz - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link It's trickier if you wanted to do real time streaming/encoding with it. You need software or a set of software actually to capture the raw video and pass it to the QS encoder. Reply fabarati - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link I just messed about with NVENC, QSVEncC and x265 when ripping som DVDs. X265 still gives the best quality and size. With a i5-6500, the encoding speed wasn't all that, at around 65 fps. Of course, QSVEncC was closer to 200 fps and NVENC (GTX 1070) clocked in at 1300-2000 FPS. Quality and size of the file are of course the opposite, with x265 looking the best and being the smallest, then QSVEncC and finally NVENC. Reply Guspaz - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Can you? Last I looked, that required enabling both the dGPU and iGPU simultaneously (and simply not plugging a monitor into the iGPU). Attempts to enable the iGPU while having a dGPU plugged in on my Ivy Bridge resulted in Windows not booting. Reply nathanddrews - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link I can't speak for your system, but my Z77 motherboard features Virtu multi-GPU support that allows me to use Quick Sync while having my monitor plugged into my dGPU. You have to activate both IGP and dGPU in BIOS, then load both drivers. It worked for me under W7 and W10. Reply Guspaz - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Errm, you've got dedicated hardware specifically for the purpose of supporting multiple GPUs (the Lucid Virtu), so that's not really a typical example. Reply extide - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Lucid Virtu is all software Reply Gigaplex - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Last I checked, it requires motherboard support. You can't just install some software and expect it to work. That's what they meant by dedicated hardware.

In short, Kaby Lake is a revamp of the 14nm Skylake with a few efficiency and power improvements thrown in. It’s the chip that bridges the gap until the 10nm Cannonlake, which Intel has penciled in for 2017. Kaby Lake also opens the door for Apple to finally upgrade its MacBook Pro (and maybe even Air) computers, after the Cupertino company opted to skip the Skylake architecture altogether with those models. Microsoft's Surface Book suffered from a number of power management problems relating to Skylake, and other PC manufacturers also had to issue an aberrantly high number of firmware and driver updates for their Skylake machines. Apple's abstinence from those chips could well have been motivated by those very same challenges, which Intel will surely have prioritized to fix with its new generation. With Kaby Lake, Intel is emphasizing experiences rather than hard specs. Being a second "tock" in Intel’s tick-tock strategy, Kaby Lake isn’t really going to differentiate itself from its predecessor with pure power or stamina improvements, so Intel’s focus is on the kinds of things its new CPUs would let people do. At the top of the list is video: multiple streams of 4K content, 360-degree videos, and virtual and augmented reality applications. Intel wants to be part of delivering all of those to more people, along with functionality like Windows Hello, the facial identification login, which is supported across more laptop models now. There are still a couple of measurable advantages to Kaby Lake, though, and those start with efficiency. Intel claims its 7th-gen Core chips are 10 times more efficient — in terms of performance per watt — than the first generation, whereas the 6th-gen family were only 8 times better. Also improved is web performance, by 19 percent in Intel’s benchmarks, along with productivity apps, which clock in at 12 percent faster. These are all best-case scenarios for Intel, and in the real world the Kaby Lake difference is unlikely to be quite so tangible. There'll be a sub-10mm-thick laptop this year, according to Intel Intel’s new processor announcements are always a good chance to look ahead to unannounced products, and one of the promises the chipmaker offers is of clamshells (aka laptops) "thinner than 10mm." That’s even less than the scarcely believable HP Spectre 13. With more than 100 new designs from all the various PC manufacturers already in the pipeline for this year, Intel’s Kaby Lake will find itself in many, if not most, of the computers sold this holiday season. It starts off with dual-core mobile chips in the Core M3, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processor families. Intel says OEMs should start shipping Kaby Lake-powered systems from the start of September and quickly ramp up from there.

By: Steven Bassiri | Intel CPUs in CPUs, Chipsets & SoCs | Posted: Aug 30, 2016 1:00 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Intel 7th Generation Core Processors] Page 1 [Intel 7th Generation Core Processors] Page 2 [Integrated Graphics Improvements] Page 3 [Benchmarks and Comparisons] Page 4 [Preliminary Lineup and Final Thoughts] Intel's Kaby Lake 7th Gen CPUs     With Intel's shift away from tick-tock and towards process-architecture-optimization, we finally have the first of many third installments of the same node. Intel introduced its 14nm process on Broadwell, it introduced a new microarchitecture on 14nm with Skylake, and it is delivering an optimization of their 14nm process with Kaby Lake. By definition, Kaby Lake is the final installment of Intel's 14nm node, they have dubbed it 14nm+ (plus).     Kaby Lake is Skylake's successor and brings more to the table regarding integrated graphics improvements than it does new CPU features. That isn't to say Intel has stayed stagnant on the CPU side; the 14nm+ process employees faster transistors and brings in 15-20% higher frequencies on the mobile side. Intel will keep their normal naming scheme for the Core family, but they have done away with Core M5 and M7 names, but not M3.     Intel's timeline is also worth a look. Kaby Lake won't launch all at once; Intel is waiting for after the holidays to release desktop and higher-end models. In the next few months, we will see Y and U series CPUs ranging from 4.5W-15W designed for mobile devices. Enterprise, workstation, Iris graphics, and H (high-end mobile) and S (desktop) series CPUs will come early next year. Intel's improvements to their 14nm node should bring noticeable frequency gains, which are always welcomed. The improved process will also allow for all cores to Turbo to maximum frequency at the same time instead of just one. While an i7-6500U was maximum 3.1GHz, the i7-7500U will run at a maximum of 3.5GHz.     So why is Intel focusing on its integrated graphics? The answer is simple - 4K video isn't a walk in the park. At an NDA briefing at IDF 2016 in San Francisco, Intel showed off some future notebooks using their 7th generation processors as well as a growing number of 4K capture devices. Most people know that the very popular GoPro cameras capture in 4K, but now with improvements to Intel's integrated graphics, working with them on-the-go should be much easier.   While 4K capture was very niche in the past, it has become more mainstream as everything from your phone to your drone can capture in this ultra-high resolution format. I have an Ivy Bridge laptop and a Panasonic camera that records 4K at 100 Mbps, and I can't even play back the video without the laptop screaming, and even then the video lags. Skylake brought a lot of improvements in regards to 4K, but Kaby Lake promises even more. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Nick Knupffer Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 6:03 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Intel turns to Overwatch to show off seventh-generation core Intel's CEO put his company's new core processor to the test on stage by playing Overwatch. 0:57 Close Drag Apple's new MacBook Pro is an eye-catching new computer. So are Microsoft's new Surface Studio and upgraded Surface Book. But none of them use Intel's latest processors. Is that a big deal? Not as much as you'd think. Here's our explainer from August on what "Kaby Lake" really means for your next PC. Original story published August 17: The clock has stopped. The chips are down. Intel's seventh-gen Core processors, codename Kaby Lake, are now official -- but they aren't as big an upgrade as you'd expect from Intel. Sure, they're a little bit faster and a little bit more power-efficient. But the best thing about Intel new CPUs might actually be this: the deals you'll find on PCs with last year's chips. Here's why Kaby Lake isn't such a big deal. What's a Kaby Lake? Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, the latest and greatest CPUs the company has to offer. They're the successor to Intel's sixth-gen "Skylake" processors from 2015. But Kaby Lake isn't a true successor to Skylake. It's more like Skylake+. Usually, Intel creates a powerful new processor architecture, then the following year shrinks down the circuits for better efficiency. (Intel, much like Ke$ha, is industry-famous for that "Tick-Tock" product cycle.) Enlarge Image Kaby Lake isn't huge. It's about twice the size of California's Lake Tahoe -- a popular vacation spot for Silicon Valley residents. Photo by Google Maps But Kaby Lake doesn't do either of those things. The circuits are the same 14 nanometer size as Intel's earlier Skylake and Broadwell chips, and it's not a new architecture either. Intel had been trying to shrink down to 10nm with a processor called Cannonlake, but those chips were delayed. So for now, we're stuck at Tock. No, really, what's a Kaby Lake? Is "Kaby" a kind of fish? Oh. No, it appears to be an actual lake in Canada. Maybe the CEO enjoys hunting moose in his spare time? Is Kaby Lake any better than my existing computer processor? Intel thinks so! The company says its thin laptop chips are 12 percent faster than Skylake in raw performance, and far more efficient at decoding 4K video. In fact, Intel claims you could get 3 more hours of battery life while streaming YouTube 4K videos (7 vs. 4 hours) compared to last year's chips. And for gamers, the company even showed an incredibly thin laptop playing fast-paced shooter Overwatch reasonably well. That sounds great, no? Sure -- until you take a hard look at how Intel generated those numbers. It's not too surprising that Intel's Kaby Lake CPU ran 12 percent faster than the comparable Skylake -- because the new chip is clocked 12 percent faster anyhow! Which could be a problem, because faster clock speeds tend to generate more heat and consume more battery as well. Enlarge Image Intel shows performance gains of 12 percent. Perhaps it's because the chip is working 12 percent harder? Photo by Intel And while Intel's battery life numbers for 4K video are hard to ignore, Intel tells me that battery life should be "similar" -- not necessarily better than Skylake -- across other kinds of workloads. We could easily be in a situation like Intel's Broadwell vs. Haswell, where the company claimed better performance with the same battery life, but devices actually consumed a bit more battery in real-world use. I'm optimistic, though, and we'll need to test for sure. What about the gaming performance? I wouldn't get too excited just yet. We took a closer look at Overwatch on a Dell XPS 13 with the new Intel chip, and it ran pretty smooth...but with a few caveats. Judge for yourself: Also note that Intel may still have some more powerful graphics in the near future: we haven't yet seen how far the company's souped-up Intel Iris graphics have come. Are there any sleek new laptops or tablets coming with Kaby Lake, at least? Sure! Feast your eyes on the new Acer Swift 7: 9 An early look at the ultra-thin Acer Swift 7 laptop We also saw a sleek HP Spectre with a new OLED panel, a refreshed Dell XPS 13, and a 6.9mm-thick Asus detachable tablet -- the Asus T305 -- with a fingerprint reader built right into the power button. Intel says there'll be over 100 different slim computers with Kaby Lake chips by the end of the year. When will Kaby Lake start showing up in new PCs? Enlarge Image Intel CVP Navin Shenoy holds up a Kaby Lake chip. Photo by Sean Hollister/CNET Well, that's the other thing...we'll see the first Kaby Lake computers in September and October, but only the types of chips that go into thin laptops and tablets. Quad-core laptop chips (like you'd find in a MacBook Pro), laptop chips with Iris graphics, business-class laptop chips with vPro and desktop chips won't appear until early next year. On the plus side, rumor has it you won't need a new motherboard for Kaby Lake desktop chips. They'll allegedly use the same LGA1151 socket as their Skylake predecessors. Will they appear in the new MacBook Pro? Depends on Apple (and Intel), but there's a decent chance they won't. Apple typically uses the most powerful Intel laptop processors available -- the 28-watt ones with better Intel graphics -- and again, Intel says they won't be ready until early next year. That's not nearly enough time to get them ready for Apple's September 7 event. However, Bloomberg reports that Apple won't refresh the Macs until later this year, and it wouldn't be the first time Intel has given chips to Apple ahead of schedule. And if Apple decides to refresh the MacBook Air -- another Bloomberg rumor -- those thinner Intel laptop chips are now ready. Update, October 27: Apple isn't using them. Everything you need to know about the major MacBook Pro upgrade After 4 plus years we'll finally see an all new MacBook Pro laptop. We could see the Apple Watch 2 and an updated first-gen Apple Watch this year. New iPhone 7 details, plus Apple TV is now looking to be a TV Guide. Yikes. by Brian Tong 5:59 Close Drag Should I wait to buy a new PC or Mac until Kaby Lake is available? It definitely couldn't hurt. It's usually better to get the latest and greatest if you can afford it -- and Kaby Lake definitely sounds better if you watch 4K video. But as I've outlined above, most PCs probably won't get a big boost to performance or battery life with Kaby Lake silicon. The real reason to wait: you'll almost certainly find some excellent discounts on Skylake computers once Kaby Lake hits the market. What about AMD's Zen? The Intel rival's new built-from-the-ground-up chips sound promising, but you won't be able to drop one into a desktop till 2017. AMD's new laptop chips will take even longer -- expect them in the second half of next year. How will I tell Kaby Lake apart from previous processors when I'm computer shopping? In one important way, Intel's making it easier than ever before: it'll say "7th gen" right on the familiar Intel sticker you'll find on the palmrest of a new laptop. It's a change we've been asking for. Enlarge Image The new "7th-gen" Intel Core branding scheme. Photo by Intel Unfortunately, Intel also made another change that could prove even more confusing. Ever heard of Core M, Intel's line of ultra-low-power 4.5-watt processors for incredibly thin, fanless PCs? As of now, the company's Core m5 and Core m7 processors are part of the Core i5 and Core i7 family, respectively. That means if you purchase a laptop with a "Core i7" label, it may not offer nearly the same sustained performance as a Core i7 machine from last year. Of course, a thin laptop's Core i7 chip already wasn't as powerful as a thick laptop's Core i7 chip, and neither were as powerful as a Core i7 desktop chip, so perhaps we're just continuing that trend. These days, it's really the size of your PC that indicates its potential performance. Besides, you can still tell the M chips apart if you look at the full model number. If you see a Y (e.g. Core i7-7Y75), it's one of the lower-performance processors. I like specs and codenames. Which processors are actually being announced today? Only six: Intel Core i7-7500U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7200U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz turbo) Intel Core i3-7100U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.4GHz, no turbo) Intel Core i7-7Y75 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.3GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7Y54 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.2GHz base, 3.2GHz turbo) Intel Core m3-7Y30 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.0GHz base, 2.6GHz turbo) Is Moore's Law dead? How could you possibly suggest such a thing? We're simply waiting for the clock's second hand to remember how to tick.

The new PCs coming to market now are the most innovative ever with not only touch interfaces, but IR cameras, pens, bio-metric inputs and so on. The PC is still on the leading edge for the immersive industry and the new Intel 7th Generation Core processors will help keep it that way. Today marks the official unveiling of the 7th Generation Intel Core Processors and we are happy to inform you that the processors are in mass production this very second and that the first mobile devices (2 in 1s and ultrathing notebooks) will be available to purchase in September. Intel says that their partners plan on having over 100 devices available for purchase in Q4 2016. In January 2017 the Kaby Lake desktop processors will be released along with the vPro skus for the enterprise market and more targeted mobile processors for the high-end gaming and VR markets. Intel thinks that another 350 designs to come to market from the channel and OEM partners. To get the most of the immersive internet you need the right processor and for that Intel believes the 7th Gen Intel Core Processors are the best choice. The 7th Generation Intel Core Processors are based on the Sky Lake architecture, but with more improvements. Intel 7th Generation processors are built using what Intel is calling the 14nm+ manufacturing process. Intel moved to the 14nm manufacturing processor with their 6th Generation of Sky Lake processors and have found a number of areas that could be improved upon since doing so at this node. The 14nm+ process features transistor improvements thanks to taller fin profiles and wider gate pitch. Intel also improved the interconnect speed through both pitch and the aspect ratio. Intel is seeing 12% performance increase at the transistor level thanks on the 7th Gen processors versus the 6th Gen processors due to these process improvements. Intel 7th Gen ‘Kaby Lake’ processors are 2x more efficient with regards to relative performance per Watt when compared to Intel 6th Gen ‘Sky Lake’ processors. Both series have 4.5W TDP processors, so that means the performance is that much better. Intel is using the overall performance score in SYSMark 2014 to come up with this number. If you go back to the first Intel Core series processor in 2010 the lowest powered mobile processor had an 18W TDP. Intel has gotten a 10x in efficiency as performance has gone up more than 2.5x while power has been reduced to 4.5W from 18W. The upcoming Intel Core i7-7500U ‘Kaby Lake’ processor is significantly faster than the Intel Core i7-6500U processor at the same CPU TDP (15W). The slide above shows that the Intel Core i7-7500U is 12% faster in SYSMark 2014 and 19% faster in WebXPRT 2015. Thanks to the aforementioned 14nm+ silicon level improvements, Intel has been able to increase the boost clock frequencies. Note that Intel was able to get a 400MHz boost clock increase year over year! For those that haven’t updated their computer in years the performance gains are even more impressive. For example, if you were updating a 5 year old PC and doing standard day-to-day work productivity tasks (converting Microsoft Word Docs to PDFs, sorting Power Point slidesrunning Excel Macros) you’d see 1.7x speedup.  If you are trying to create 4K video or 360-degree video content you see an 8.6x improvement with a 7th Generation Core processor versus a 5-year old PC. When it comes to Intel HD Graphics Processor you’ll see a 3x improvement for gaming on-the-go. Intel showed us a gaming demo where they played Overwatch on a gaming laptop with a Full HD display with medium image quality settings and was getting above 30 FPS without a discrete graphics solution! When it comes to 4K UHD content the PC is still the better device for consuming, creating and working with that media.  This is because PC’s have large screens, powerful processors, large fast storage locally, great software and the best input devices around. Intel now has updated their dedicated media engine (video decode) on the 7th Gen Kaby Lake processor that will make it easier than ever to create and share 4K content. Intel moved from VP8 to VP9 (decode) and HEVC 10-bit decode/encode capability in 7th Gen processors. This is because 25 Billion hours of video content has been watched on Youtube thanks to the VP9 codec and all of that was in HD. This means Intel had to move to a more efficient codec as the 6th Gen Skylake processors only supported AVC and VP8 on video content up to 108oP on hardware. Anything over 1080P was done with software on Skylake. On the new 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors this can now be done in hardware with the new updated media block. Intel showed a demo where an employee shot multiple short 4K movies on a personal vacation that he wanted to edit with MAGIX Fastcut video editing software. His seven video clips totaled 55 minutes in length and were 23.6GB of data. Using an Intel laptop powered by an Intel 7th Gen processors he was able to create a 30 second preview of the single video he created almost real time. The preview was uncompressed video that was dynamically pulled together from the video, so he can edit in basically real-time until he was happy with the brightness of the clips. On a 5-year old PC this would take minutes if not hours to apply the changes and then be able to watch the clip. What changes did Intel do to make processor graphics better? All of the 7th Gen Intel Core processors have at least GT2 graphics (Gen9 Graphics with 24 EU’s) that debuted on Skylake, but with additional improvements. Typically you have a bunch of fixed function units outside the the rendering compute engine and those are called unslice. Intel has placed more media engines (functions) on the slice. In the slide above the two purple boxes that have been highlighted by the green box shows that Intel has improved the Multi-Format Codex (MFX) and the Video Quality Engine (VQE). Here are more details on the updated areas highlighted by the green box in the previous slide. The Multi-Format Codec (MFX) ‘box’ has the traditional decoder and multi-format legacy support. Intel still sees the AVC codec still being used for the next 3-5 years and sees no value to remove it from onslice. HEVC 8-bit decode was first added with 6th Gen processors, so the key new feature added was 10-bit HEVC encode/decode as well as VP9 encode to the MFX block. Why is Intel not supporting VP9 10-bit encode? Google has not finalized the VP9 10-bit encode spec, so Intel is waiting on that. The Video Quality Engine (VQE) that was first introduced on 4th Gen processors now has wide color gamut (Rec.2020) support and High Dynamic Range (HDR) to Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) Tone Mapping Supporting. This is the engine that normally handles image processing features are done (deinterlacing, noise reduction, color enhancement, color corrections and so on). Intel has also power optimized this engine and it only used 40-50 mW of power. By supporting HDR and and wide color gamut it should ensure the best experience on 4K HDR panels. This slide shows the capability of what 7th Gen processors. The high-throughut decoder has always supporting multi-stream, but now you have support for up to eight 4Kp30 multi-stream AVC & HEVC decode support. Intel is ready for premium 4Kp60 content at 120Mbps as well on both the 4.5W Y-series and 15W U-series 7th Gen processors. Ready for a real world example about how these improvements matter? One of the largest end user benefits from all this is power consumption. On the 6th Gen Intel Core processors, Intel is using a hybrid decode that uses both the GPU and CPU to run a 4K HEVC 10-bit local video. You’d be using about 50% of the processor to run the clip and the average power draw on the CPU/GPU you are looking at 10.2W on a system using the Intel Core i7-6500U processor. On the new 7th Gen Intel Core Processor you are using basically none of the processor since the decode is all being down in the media block and the CPU/GPU power draw is just 0.5W on an Intel Core i7-7500U processor. (Intel was using Tears of Steel in 4K to get these performance numbers.) This is a 20x improvement in CPU/GPU power and best of all you are looking at up to 2.6x longer battery life when doing local 4K video playback! What about 4K content that isn’t local? If you go to Youtube today and are using the Chrome browser you’ll be feed a 4K video stream with VP9. The benefits of VP9 would be high quality at over half the bit rate of h.264. An Intel Core i7-6500U used 5.8W of power on the CPU/GPU versus 0.8W of power on the Intel Core i7-7500U. This means you can do 4K UHD video streaming and have ‘All Day 4K’ battery life. You also have enough performance  to run multiple 4K 360 content streams, so you have multiple UHD video stream friendly mobile devices right around the corner! One other benefits of the 14nm+ technology is that Intel was able to get 400-500MHz higher boost clocks thanks to all the small changes they made while the power envelope remains the same. Before an Intel Core i7-6500U would boost up to 3,100 MHz with Intel Speed Shift Technology. The new Intel Core i7-7500U stabilizes out at 3,500 MHz and gets to that speed sooner, so system responsiveness should be better than ever. 7th Gen processors reach maximum clock frequencies in just 15 millseconds! How does this impact real life usages? Intel likes using WebXPRT for responsiveness as does image manipulation and stuff that really happens in real life. They are seeing up to 19% performance gains and most of that is coming from the higher clock speeds (3.1GHz on the 6500U and 3.5GHz on the 7500U). When it comes to a productivity benchmark Intel went with SYSMark 2014 and showed up to a 12% performance improvement due to mainly the higher clock speeds. Intel is also updating the badges that they place on systems, so rather than just showing Core i3/i5/i7 on the sticker it will now also include the generation of the processor. Kaby Lake Die Shot So, to wrap this up… 7th Generation Intel Core processors built on the 14nm+ process technology are Intel’s most scalable yet and were designed for the immersive internet. Intel is seeing up to 15x performance gains to create and share 4K content and up to 70% faster productivity. With 7th Gen Processors you’ll be able to take premium Hollywood content on the road with you and the ability to enjoy content on the web in new ways with multi-streaming and 360 degree video. The higher boost clock speeds are exciting to see and we can’t wait to see the new 7th Generation Intel Core U and Y series processors come out in September. We are also excited to see the new desktop processors when they debut in 2017! Intel appears to be ready for the immersive web with gobs of 4K content, so hopefully we’ll see more mobile devices with 4K UHD displays on them when the new devices come to market. Intel put a ton of emphasis on 4K content as they put significant time and effort into the media block improvements on their 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors. We are fully aware that 4K content is becoming more popular, but not many people have 4K displays right now. The clock frequency improvements are great to see as getting 400-500 MHz higher boost clocks without raising the power envelope is impressive for both mobile and desktop users (The Intel Core i7-7700K is rumored to have a base clock of 4.2GHz and a boost clock of 4.5GHz). If you have a Broadwell or Skylake system that you’ve bought in the past couple of years you might not have the upgrade itch, but if you haven’t updated your PC in 3+ years, the number of reasons to upgrade are most certainly adding up. Greg Zeng Good to see than some technologists believe that we can stop global warming by using new technologies. In the Linux world, I have so many enemies who claim that it is better to restore old technology with Linux, instead of using energy-efficient technologies. turnipweed Well,,, if you’re a few generations behind, such a small boost in speed and graphics technology is useful. If you’re an early adopter, this may be a little disappointing. Jason Kane TLDNR. Short version…3 to 5 % performance boost over Skylake. Move along, nothing of interest here.

Intel Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs are starting to come out now. Intel A labeled Kaby Lake die shot. Intel The Y-series CPU package is the same as Skylake—the CPU/GPU die is on the left, and the chipset die is on the right. Intel The larger U-series package. Chipset on the left, CPU/GPU die on the right. Both chips can be dropped into existing Skylake designs. Intel Low-voltage mobile parts are coming out now, and more powerful CPUs will follow in January. Intel Increases in clock speed and some other tweaks will deliver Intel's standard 10-15 percent year-over-year performance gains in most cases. Intel Intel says Kaby Lake chips can ramp their clock speed up slightly faster than Skylake could. Intel The 14nm process has been optimized somewhat, though it's still not as big a deal as the move to 10nm would be. Intel The GPU is only changing a little, and those changes are confined mostly to 4K-related media encoding and decoding. Intel Kaby will encode and decode 10-bit HEVC video, and it can decode 8-bit VP9 video. Intel Doing so dramatically reduces the amount of CPU power needed to play this video, which some of the lower-end Skylake chips couldn't play at all. Intel More media playback details. Intel Details on the specific kinds of 4K streams Kaby Lake can handle. Intel’s tick-tock model may be dead, but the PC industry still demands new hardware every year. Many PC models are refreshed once a year or so, and that means that the PC makers need new stuff to put into those computers whether or not the laws of physics want to comply. Enter “Kaby Lake,” the first of Intel’s post-tick-tock processor architectures. Kaby (rhymes with baby, named for a lake in Canada) first appeared on Intel’s public roadmaps in mid-2015 when the company realized that Cannonlake and its attendant 10nm manufacturing process wouldn’t be ready in time. No major architecture has changed, and Intel is still using a tweaked version of its 14nm manufacturing process, so most changes are relatively minor and built to serve a particular market niche.

Today, we’re getting dual-core low-voltage processors, the kind you’d find in thin-and-light consumer laptops. The first Kaby systems are slated to ship in September, and you’ll see lots of new laptops at IFA next week. Desktop CPUs and other higher-performance chips, including those with Intel Iris GPUs, will be announced in January around CES. A tiny tiny “tick” In 2014, when Intel’s 14nm process delays were holding up the Broadwell architecture, the company released a lineup of “Haswell refresh” processors that used small clock speed increases to outrun 2013’s original Haswell chips. Kaby Lake, despite a handful of changes and improvements, is only a slightly bigger deal. First off, none of these mobile CPUs will include new chipsets, which means you’ll get the same connectivity options as before. The 100-series chipsets should still be more than adequate for most people, but they’re missing things like 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen 2, to say nothing of Thunderbolt. On the plus side, the lack of huge changes means that Kaby Lake chips can easily be dropped into existing Skylake designs, something that will help PC makers get Kaby Lake systems on the shelves in a hurry. Kaby’s biggest advertised feature is improved support for 4K. All Kaby Lake integrated GPUs will support hardware-accelerated decoding and encoding of 10-bit HEVC/H.265 video streams and decoding of 8-bit VP9 streams. If you don’t already know, supporting hardware acceleration for certain codecs means that the GPU (usually via a dedicated media block) handles all the processing instead of the CPU. Not only does this use a fraction of the power that a CPU uses to accomplish the same task, but it frees the CPU cores up to do other things. HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 are also supported, which (respectively) enable 4K output at 60Hz over an HDMI cable and provide the DRM required to carry an encrypted 4K signal from the thing that’s playing it to the screen that will show it. The maximum supported DisplayPort version remains 1.2, however, dashing the hopes of anyone who wants to drive a 5K display at 60Hz over a single cable using DisplayPort 1.3. The biggest improvement from an architectural/manufacturing standpoint is something Intel is calling “14nm+,” an optimized version of the same process node used for both Broadwell and Skylake. The company isn’t sharing many details—Intel says that 14nm+ has an “improved fin profile” and “improved transistor channel strain,” for what that’s worth. But the changes are said to improve the performance of the transistors by about 12 percent. As Intel’s manufacturing processes stick around for longer, it makes sense that the company would spend more time optimizing them rather than just moving on to the next process as it has historically done. Foundries have been known to use multiple versions of a given process, so it’s not entirely unheard of. CPU and GPU speed improvements come mostly from clock speed increases rather than architectural improvements, as they did in the Haswell refresh. Intel promises 12- to 19-percent better CPU performance over Skylake chips sold at the same price, which is commensurate with the speeds and prices laid out below. Intel claims “double-digit” GPU performance improvements in the Y-series parts and 8- to 10-percent improvements in the U-series parts. Small launch, simple lineup (for now) Today’s launch includes just six chips, three each from the Y- and U-series. As Intel adds vPro and Iris CPUs and other faster and slower options, its lineup will inevitably become more complicated. That’s what always happens. But right now Intel’s CPU lineup is refreshingly simple to explain, so let’s enjoy it while it lasts! Intel The three Y-series chips. Intel The three Y-series chips. Intel The three U-series chips. Intel The chipsets come with both Y- and U-series chips. They're still solid, but they're also identical to the Skylake chipsets. For the third time in as many years, Intel is changing how it refers to its 4.5W Y-series chips. Broadwell changed the name from Core i3, i5, and i7 to simply “Core M.” Skylake split the Core M lineup into Core m3, m5, and m7 families. And Kaby Lake keeps m3 but changes m5 back to i5 and m7 back to i7. Regardless of branding changes, Y-series Kaby processors are all easily identified by their model number and their 4.5W TDP (configurable up to 7W for systems with the heat dissipation to handle it and down to 3.5W for smaller, thinner devices with less headroom). The kinds of devices where you find Core M chips today—fanless laptops, convertible tablets, and Compute Sticks—won’t change. The U-series are still run-of-the-mill mainstream dual-core parts and will likely remain the most widely used parts in mainstream $500-and-up laptops and boutique Ultrabooks like Dell’s XPS 13 or HP’s Spectre 13. The U-series chips are still i3, i5, and i7, and Intel’s processor badges for both Y- and U-series CPUs will all pick up a “7th gen” label to distinguish them from models with older parts. All the CPUs have model numbers in the 7000 series, compared to 6000 for Skylake, 5000 for Broadwell, and so on. The GPUs for the Y- and U-series are now called the Intel HD 615 and 620, respectively. With the model numbers and CPU speeds in hand, we can compare the new Kaby Lake parts to their Skylake counterparts to see what kind of clock speed increases we can expect. Year-over-year improvements Skylake m3-6Y30 (900MHz, 2.2GHz Turbo) m5-6Y54 (1.1GHz, 2.7GHz Turbo) m7-6Y75 (1.2GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) i3-6100U (2.3GHz) i5-6200U (2.3GHz, 2.8GHz Turbo) i7-6500U (2.5GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) Kaby Lake m3-7Y30 (1.0GHz, 2.6GHz Turbo) i5-7Y74 (1.2GHz, 3.2GHz Turbo) i7-7Y75 (1.3GHz, 3.6GHz Turbo) i3-7100U (2.4GHz) i5-7200U (2.5GHz, 3.1GHz Turbo) i7-7500U (2.7GHz, 3.5GHz Turbo) Base increase 100MHz (11%) 100MHz (9%) 100MHz (8.33%) 100MHz (4.33%) 200MHz (8.7%) 200MHz (8%) Turbo increase 400MHz (18%) 500MHz (18.5%) 500MHz (16%) N/A 300MHz (10.7%) 400MHz (13%) Given that nearly all of Kaby Lake's improvements are going to come from clock speed boosts, these numbers actually look pretty good. Even when Intel changes architectures and processes these days you normally only get 10 to 15 percent more CPU performance year-over-year, and Kaby Lake delivers that most of the time. That said, the biggest increases are reserved for the Turbo Boost speeds, and those can be hard to rely on in the real world. Intel's CPUs are only designed to operate in Turbo Boost mode for short bursts of time, falling back to slower speeds when the PC they're in can no longer dissipate enough heat. Especially in thin-and-light Y-series laptops with no fans, processors will probably not maintain their top speeds for long. In short, Kaby Lake CPUs may still be significantly faster than equivalent Skylake chips, but how fast depends more heavily than usual on your workload and the design of the laptop. Once we begin testing actual Kaby Lake systems, we should get a better idea of how things play out in practice. Coming soon(ish): High performance and newer chipsets The Kaby Lake lineup will be made whole in early 2017 when quad-core desktop and mobile parts hit the market. Those processors will include new chipsets, though socketed Kaby processors should be able to fit into existing 100-series motherboards after a BIOS update. As Intel’s first “optimization” release in its new product development cycle, Kaby Lake is a bit underwhelming. Chip design takes time—Intel tells us that some of Skylake’s features were in development for five years—and Kaby Lake is obviously something Intel had to come up with on short notice once the company knew just how long the 14nm and 10nm transitions were going to take. In future “optimization” years—when we get chips that have the same amount of lead time as the “process” and “architecture” designs—I expect the improvements to be more significant. If you’re thinking of buying a new PC soon but don’t need one today, Kaby Lake includes enough improvements that you might as well wait for it to roll out. But if you just bought a Skylake system or need a new PC today and you don’t have very specific 4K-related needs, you don’t have much to gain by going with Kaby Lake.

Kaby Lake processors explained, 4K media focus Mike Lowe30 August 2016Laptops Intel Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Year on year Intel is committed to updating its Intel Core processors, with the latest seventh-generation chip even bearing a "7th Gen" badge its visual marketing and on-shelf positioning. Perhaps that's no surprise when you hear people talking about the product's Kaby Lake codename - preceding was Skylake in 2015, Broadwell in 2014 - and wondering "what the heck?". So what's Intel Core 7th Gen Kaby Lake all about, which processor arrangement is right for you, and is it that much better than last year's Skylake chipset? Intel Core 7th Gen: Speed gains The goal of new processors is, typically, to go one faster than the previous generation. Kaby Lake is built on the same 14-nanometre (nm) architecture as Skylake, so the performance gains are only marginal this time around: with a 300-400mHz gain anticipated by the company increasing the range of several frequencies. It won't be until the next push in architecture, with the 10nm Cannonlake, that we'll see additional performance increases. Intel Core 7th Gen: 4K media handling What is really new about Kaby Lake is the addition of a dedicated media engine. This is a new aspect to the processor, designed for power-efficiency and additional performance, is targeted particularly at better experiences with 4K content. Intel says it will deliver "improved media experiences with HEVC 10-bit and VP9" - both of which are the codecs that handle 4K content. Intel Core 7th Gen: Battery life Intel cites "adaptive performance" as a key function of 7th Gen, the ability to take read inputs from simple factors - say, ambient temperature, or orientation to acknowledge when a device is in a docked position - to determine how long it can sustain Turbo Boost (faster speed), to improve overall performance. That's not a brand new feature, but it's a wider implementation, says Intel. Battery life for 7th Gen is said to be "similar" to 6th Gen, but should show considerable improvements for 4K consumption: stream YouTube 4K for 7-hours rather than 4-hours, for a 1.75x improvement, is Intel's claim. Intel Core 7th Gen: What of Core M? Intel's fanless (and thus silent) Intel Core M is designed for low-power mobile use. Until now it's been available in M3, M5 and M7 configurations - the higher the number the greater the performance - but the top-end M7 is getting axed for 2016's 7th Gen run. Instead we'll see a fanless 4.5W Core i7 Y in its place. Intel Core 7th Gen: Which processor is right for you? Key to 7th Gen is that it's a "scalable and adaptable" architecture. There are multiple aspects to consider here: clock speed performance, which increases up the range of i3, i5 and i7 processors; cores, with single-core, dual-core, quad-core (and potentially more paired for higher-performance arrangements - but Intel is saying nothing more just yet); and the letter-based market segmentation - Y, U, H, S and X - which defines a product's positioning and form factor (often a balance of performance to heat output to power consumption, as suited). Y targets 2-in-1s, tablets for mobile-based use (low-consumption 4.5W), with 7th Gen available from September 2016; U targets ultra-slim laptops and portables; H is a more powerful step-up again, typically with additional cores; S, is designed for desktop iterations (hence its 65W draw); and Extreme Edition (X), which is the premium, gaming-targeted super-processor, available from 2017. Intel Core 7th Gen: Wrap-up In summary, then, Intel Core 7th Gen processors are Intel's bid for 4K media consumption. As Kaby Lake architecture is the same 14nm as the previous-gen Skylake, however, don't expect huge speed improvements this time around. Instead it's a focus on media and gains in efficiency. Hopefully it'll be the end of choppy, stuttery 4K playback, making a better world for all. And come 2017 we'll get to see the gains made in top-end setups too.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Meet Intel 7th Gen Core, the 4K, VR-ready “Kaby Lake” processors Chris Davies - Aug 30, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If we’re post-PC, nobody told Intel: the chip company has higher hopes than ever for the computer – albeit in a range of form-factors – running its new 7th Gen “Kaby Lake” Core processors, officially announced today. With headline 7th Gen vs 6th Gen improvements including swifter, less power-intensive media playback and processing, the ability to do serious gaming on the move, and broader support for next-generation interconnects like Thunderbolt and USB-C plus security features like Windows Hello, Intel sees Kaby Lake as more than just a speed bump. “At its core the PC is the consummate Darwinian machine,” Navin Shenoy, general manager of the client computing group at Intel, argues. “It’s constantly adapting to the changes around us.” Just as we’re not entirely sure about the path of animal evolution, mind, neither is the future of the PC quite clear. Intel is betting on its vision of a 4K-obsessed, frequently gaming-on-the-go future, and as with previous chip launches it’s the mobile version of that which is getting fresh silicon first. Mobile processors spanning the 4.5W to 15W range and targeting 2-in-1s and ultrathin notebooks for both consumers and businesses will arrive first; in fact, the chips are in mass production now, Intel says, and will be made available to manufacturing partners in September. There are already “hundreds” of designs based on Kaby Lake expected to launch in Q4 2016, according to Chris Walker, general manage row mobile client platforms at Intel. Come January 2017, meanwhile, there’ll be performance gaming and VR mobile chips, in addition to desktop processors for both consumer and enterprise use, including models supporting vPro. That should open the door for another 350 expected designs to come to market, Intel predicts, across multiple form factors. On paper, you might question exactly what has changed. Like the 6th Gen chips they’re built on 14nm processes, and indeed the 7th Generation uses the same Skylake architecture, albeit “with enhancements,” Intel says. It’s those enhancements which will make the difference. There’ll only be a roughly 300-400 MHz clock speed increase, and battery life for mobile products based on the 7th Gen processors will be roughly the same, but Intel claims the overall system is far more efficient. In fact, there’s a double-digit performance gain in mobile compared to last year, going by Intel’s benchmarks. Year on year, comparing the 6th Gen i7-6500U to the 7th Gen i7-7500U, the company’s tests show a 12-percent improvement in productivity apps and 19-percent in everyday tasks such as browsing, photo editing, and email. That’s down to things like improved interconnect performance, and a claimed 12-percent improvement in efficiency at the transistor level. Year on year upgraders aren’t where Intel sees the greatest number of customers coming from, however. As before, it’s pulling out research suggesting that most people who’ll be considering a 7th Gen based machine will in fact be upgrading from a five year old PC There, unsurprisingly, the gains are even more significant. Compared to that five year old PC, a new model with a comparable tier chip should be 1.7x faster at those work tasks, and an incredible 8.6x faster at creating, editing, and sharing 4K UHD and 360 videos. Looking at a new Core i5-7200U based laptop versus a Core i5-2467M from half a decade ago, the 7th Gen model is 15x faster at creating 4K video highlights. In fact, Intel says, the new chips can do it in nearly real time – figure on around 37 seconds for a 30 second clip, software depending – while converting an hour-long 4K video takes approximately twelve minutes in contrast to 85+ minutes on the old system. It’s partly down to the new media engine, which Intel built on the Gen9 graphics architecture. There’s a dedicated media engine for video decoding, designed both for power efficiency and supporting parallel engines for greater performance throughput. Everyday users should see the impact in 10-bit HEVC and VP9 video, not to mention power consumption during playback; indeed, Intel predicts around 75-percent better battery life when playing VP9 footage compared to the old chips. Even how turbo state use is managed will get smarter. Intel will use a broader range of sensor input – including from the accelerometer and thermometers – to figure out the ambient thermal temperature; if you still have headroom for comfortable, safe use, you’ll be able to stay in the turbo state for longer. There’ll be branding changes, too. For a start, Intel will be labeling the chip badges with “7th Gen”, and there’ll no longer be Core m7 or m5 models: instead, they’ll just be known as Core i5 or Core i7, because Intel argues they don’t sacrifice performance. Initially, the range will include Core m3, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 chips. NOW READ: Intel bets on cordless VR with Project Alloy headset Meanwhile, Intel expects to see twice the number of designs as before offering Thunderbolt connectivity – 120+ at initial count – and 100+ with Windows Hello support. 50+ of the systems on the roadmap will have 4K UHD displays, and 25+ will support pen input. Figure on less of a hit in your bag, too, with convertibles as thin as 10mm and clamshells under 10mm. Intel even teased fanless detachables under 7mm thick, and we’ll start to see the first models using Kaby Lake from September and ramping up toward the 2016 holidays.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs revealed The first fruits of a new product cycle by Jeff Kampman  8:01 AM on August 30, 2016 Moore's Law may not be dead, but it is changing. In March of this year, Intel revealed that it would be adding a third stage to its traditional tick-tock model of technical advancement. That new model, "process-architecture-optimize," began its latest swing back in August 2014 with the Broadwell architecture, Intel's first time out with its 14-nm tri-gate process. A little over a year ago, we got our first taste of the Skylake "tock,"  which ditched the fully-integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) of Haswell and Broadwell chips and introduced Intel's Gen9 integrated graphics to the world, among other refinements. The Kaby Lake die, helpfully labeled. Source: Intel Now it's time for the "optimize" part of the 14-nm show. Today, Intel is raising the curtain on its Kaby Lake (or "seventh-generation Core") CPUs. We got a clearer picture of just what this third step in the new Intel architecture life cycle means at IDF a couple weeks back, so let's dive in. Getting the most out of the 14-nm process To improve Kaby Lake's performance, Intel says it's optimized its 14-nm tri-gate process so that it can lay down taller fins with a wider gate pitch. Intel calls this improved process "14-nm plus." Those improvements result in faster-switching transistors that are good for what Intel describes as "four or five speed bins" of extra clock speed, or about 400 to 500 MHz higher Turbo frequencies at the top end of a CPU's range. Kaby Lake CPUs will also be able to hit those peak speeds faster than before, thanks to an improved version of the SpeedShift technology that first appeared in Skylake. Where a Skylake Core i7-6500U might have needed over 20 ms to hit its peak Turbo speeds, a Kaby Lake Core i7-7500U might hit its Turbo peak in under 20 ms. When Intel talks about the "responsiveness gains" of Kaby, they're referring to these SpeedShift improvements. More efficient cat-video handling Along with the process improvements, the biggest change in Kaby Lake is to the integrated GPU's media encoding block. 4K video streaming, wider color gamuts, and HDR content are all in the pipe, and Intel wants to make sure its chips are ready to handle those demands efficiently. The company notes that for a lot of younger people, the 15" screen on their notebooks is the big screen they have ready access to, and it wants to offer mobile users the opportunity to watch 4K content without draining their batteries unduly. In addition to the 1080p HEVC (also known as H.265) encode and decode capabilities of Skylake, Kaby gets 4K HEVC 10-bit encode and decode support, as well as hardware decode support for YouTube's competing VP9 format. The Multi-Format Codec block in Kaby offers better support for wireless displays and an improved quality feature for the QuickSync Video Fixed-Function mode. In practice, these improved video functions let Kaby Lake CPUs play back 4K HEVC video much more efficiently than they would be able to if they had to rely on CPU power alone, as demonstrated by the local playback graph above. The Kaby CPU only needs to consume 0.5W to do its thing, compared to the 10.2W of the Core i7-6500U. For YouTube playback with VP9, the hardware decode capability in Kaby delivers similar improvements. The seventh-gen Core CPU only needs to consume 0.8W, compared to 5.8W with the CPU alone. What isn't changing We would normally perform a deep-dive on what else has changed under the hood of these Kaby Lake CPUs here, but aside from the enhanced video decode block and the benefits of the 14-nm "Plus" process, Intel was surprisingly frank about how little generation-to-generation differences there are between the sixth-gen and seventh-gen Core processors. Kaby Lake will use the same basic execution pipeline as Skylake before it, and the guts of its Gen9 integrated graphics processor are also basically identical to what arrived with Skylake. In conversations with Intel, I confirmed we're not getting any kind of FreeSync or VESA Adaptive-Sync support with this generation of chips, either. At least from a gamer's perspective, it's hard not to be disappointed by that fact. FreeSync monitors are becoming more and more widely available, and Intel is clearly thinking about the low-end gaming market to some degree. The company devoted a considerable portion of its demo time to showing off how well a thin-and-light Kaby Lake machine could play Overwatch, and I'd be willing to bet the gameplay experience would be even better with a variable-refresh display hooked up. Sadly, that's not to be with Kaby. We'll just have to wait another year to see whether Adaptive-Sync will land in Intel CPUs, it seems. The first Kaby Lake products Intel is revealing six Kaby Lake products today: three 4.5W "Y" CPUs and three 15W "U" CPUs. Instead of trying to explain the dizzying array of features inside each of these chips, I'm just going to post Intel's full accounting of what's inside. First off, let's look at the 4.5W family of seventh-gen Core products. These are all dual-core parts with Hyper-Threading enabled. As we might expect from Intel's description of its process improvements, the highest-end 4.5W Core i7-7Y75—seriously, take the naming responsibilities for these things away from the engineers, folks—can Turbo up to 3.6GHz, compared to 3.1GHz for the Skylake Core m7-6Y75. That's an impressive improvement, especially if Intel's Adaptive Performance environmental-monitoring tech lets the chip hang out at those higher clock speeds longer. You'll also note that Intel is using the Core i5 and Core i7 designators on its higher-end 4.5W CPUs now, instead of the Core m5 and Core m7 branding. Intel says it'll be reserving the Core m brand for low-end CPUs in the Kaby family, but it otherwise seems like we'll be seeing Core i branding from top to bottom in Intel's product range. My sense is that this move might make it harder to figure out which systems have which CPUs in the already arcane notebook market, but we'll just have to pay close attention from here on out.  The 15W seventh-generation Core parts all tell a similar story. The highest-end Core i7-7500U runs 200MHz faster than the Core i7-6500U at its base speed and 400MHz faster under Turbo-friendly workloads. The Core i5-7200U gets a 200-MHz base clock boost and a 300-MHz Turbo bump over the Core i5-6200U, and the Core i3-7100U makes do with a paltry 100-MHz bump over the Core i3-6100U. This cheapest 15W Kaby part doesn't do Turbo Boost. All told, these are nice improvements across the board for these meat-and-potatoes CPUs in Intel's lineup. Along with the improved media encode and decode features in Kaby, the bumped clock speeds should give Ultrabook-class mobile PCs a little more all-around muscle for the things that regular folks do with their PCs. Expect to see Kaby-equipped notebooks roll out beginning next month. What's next The six Kaby parts we're seeing today should cover a broad swath of mainstream PC needs, but there's more in store. Intel says to expect mobile CPUs with its higher-end Iris graphics and vPro management support to arrive in January 2017. We'll also need to wait until the New Year to see desktop parts benefiting from the move to Intel's 14-nm "Plus" process, as well. Intel remained mum about the chipsets and CPUs we can expect for the desktop at IDF, although we've seen hints of the 200-series chipsets as far back as Computex. It'll be interesting to see how Intel's 14-nm process improvements translate to the higher TDPs where enthusiast processors roam. If we can peer into our crystal balls for a moment, today's Kaby news might be most disappointing for Apple fans. The company's highest-end MacBook Pros rely on dual- and quad-core CPUs with eDRAM and Iris graphics on board, and those products are nowhere to be found in this first round of Kaby releases. Some MacBook Pros already feature Broadwell parts, but the highest-end quad-core MBPs still rely on Haswell Crystal Well CPUs. Unless Apple is intending to take the MacBook Pro in a more mainstream direction, we wouldn't expect to see updated versions of the company's highest-end laptop until next year, at the earliest. If that's the case, we'll have an exciting January to look forward to. 159 comments Email the author(s): Jeff Kampman Sign up to receive notices when we publish new articles Or go back to TR's front page Related Articles AMD crests Summit Ridge with Ryzen CPUs 365 AMD unwraps its seventh-generation desktop APUs and AM4 platform 81 AMD gives us our first real moment of Zen 411 Intel boosts the high-end desktop with its Broadwell-E CPUs 221 Intel's Core i7-6700K 'Skylake' processor reviewed 489 AMD's Carrizo brings power savings to mainstream laptops 83 Intel's Broadwell goes broad with new desktop, mobile, server variants 167 The TR Podcast bonus video: AMD, Zen, Fiji, and more 54 Tags: CPUs 159 comments View full site Copyright ©1999-2017 The Tech Report.

This latest platform is built via an improved 14nm manufacturing; it’s also the third architecture based on this 14nm process. What is Kaby Lake? Meet Intel’s new baby, Kaby Lake. Note the size of the GPU section Kaby Lake is a third generation chip made on the 14nm manufacturing process and probably the last. It’s also the seventh generation chip in Intel’s Core i series of CPUs. Intel has been following a tick-tock upgrade cycle for a while now, but with the 14nm process, they shifted to a PAO (Process Architecture Optimisation) system. Tick-tock essentially introduced a new manufacturing process in the tick, then optimised it by the tock. The second, fourth and sixth generation Intel CPUs comprise the ‘tock’. With PAO, Intel adds another step, where they further optimise and enhance the results of a ‘tock’ cycle. A representation of the Intel U series Kaby Lake chip While Intel didn’t reveal a whole lot about their entire line-up, it did share a great deal about its Y and U series mobile platform. Intel sums it up best when they say that the focus of Kaby Lake is the “immersive web.” All you performance junkies and overclockers can stop reading right now though. Intel made no mention of their K series SKUs and Kaby Lake’s desktop variants. The only thing you really need to know is that the CPUs are socket compatible with the previous generation. Details of an Intel i7 7700K were leaked some time ago, but performance figures are lacking. The immersive web Source: Intel Intel’s entire pitch for Kaby Lake revolves around the fact that the future’s the internet and the future of the internet is video. They expect to see an increasing amount of 4K content and even 4K 360-degree video. If everyone’s going to be watching video, one might as well optimise for video. Source: Intel While Skylake, the previous generation architecture, was perfectly comfortable dealing with FHD video content, its power consumption for 4K decoding is very high. Kaby Lake incorporates dedicated hardware channels for HEVC 10-bit and VP9 video codecs, making for extremely efficient 4K rendering and editing. Source: Intel Intel claims that Kaby Lake will be capable of rendering multiple 4K video streams while still allowing you to work or browse the web. They also add that the impact to battery life will be minimal. In fact, they claim up to 2.6 times the battery life when playing back 4K video, as compared to Skylake. If the data they provided is correct, we’ve no reason to doubt them, Kaby Lake uses barely 0.5W on average to decode a 4K video, while Skylake would require 10W of power. Performance boost Source: Intel Compared to Skylake, Intel claims that Kaby Lake will offer a 12 percent bump in productivity and a 19 percent bump in web browsing tasks. Source: Intel The boost in web browsing is notable because Intel says that Kabe Lake uses an improved version of Speed Shift, which is more efficient at boosting performance for very short periods, a performance burst if you will, which is extremely useful in web browsing scenarios. Source: Intel Intel states that part of this bump is down to the higher clock-speeds that they’re able to extract from the new manufacturing process. The rest can be attributed to overall platform improvements (such as HEVC and VP9 support). Most of these comparisons were between an Intel i5 6500U and an Intel 7500U. When compared to Sandy Bridge, a 5-year old architecture, Intel claims a performance bump of 70 percent and a 3.5x improvement in graphics performance. Features Along with the usual Intel bells and whistles, Kaby Lake will support PCIe Gen 3.0, which offers higher bandwidth when compared to the previous iteration (8GT/s vs 5GT/s). PCIe-based SSDs should benefit the most from this. All Intel Core m series, Y series and U series chipsets will be dual-core CPUs with support for 4 threads via hyperthreading. The rest of the architecture remains very similar to Skylake. Source: Intel Judging by what Intel has told us so far, it’s clear that Kaby Lake will greatly benefit mobile devices (laptops, 2-in-1s, etc.). Since 4K content is still sparse, the average user will probably not notice much of an improvement in performance, especially if they’re on Broadwell or Skylake. For the high-end desktop user though, the performance rewards will also be less tangible, especially since battery life is not an issue. Obviously, if you’re still on an older generation platform like Sandy-Bridge, it’s high time you upgraded.

The App Manager in the Device Portal, managing Windows 10 IoT Core on Raspberry Pi 30 Aug 2016 at 09:33, Tim Anderson Hands on Microsoft has released Windows 10 Anniversary for IoT Core, a version of Windows which runs on Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, Dragonboard or Minnowboard. The company has also announced support for Intel Joule, an Internet of Things (IoT) compute module launched at the August 2016 Intel Developer Forum, though Windows software for this is not yet publicly available. As I type, I am watching Windows 10 IoT Core apply a system update on a Raspberry Pi 3. It is taking ages, whereas when I have done Linux updates on a Pi it is generally quicker and does not require a reboot. I also experienced a number of annoyances in a brief hands-on, with failure dialogue boxes from the browser-based dashboard and oddities such as a refusal to set the keyboard layout to other than “English (United States)”; I selected a different keyboard, the screen went grey, then came back without changing it. Oddly, this worked fine when done later in a remote session. This is Windows, then, but there are some attractions. In particular, you can build applications in Visual Studio using C#, C++ or a variety of other languages; you can enrol IoT Core devices for management with System Center Configuration Manager; and you can easily connect IoT Core with Azure services for processing data. The way Microsoft presents IoT Core is puzzling. It seems to have two goals in mind; one is to support the hobbyist “Maker” community in order to attract developers to its platform, and the other is to provide large businesses with an end-to-end IoT solution. It is the latter which has most business potential, but go to Microsoft’s Windows 10 IoT Core developer site and you see sample applications with a hobbyist feel, such as an Air Hockey Robot and a connected clock radio. In essence, Windows 10 IoT Core is a cut-down version of Windows designed either to run headless with long-running applications that talk to sensors or other devices and send the data for processing, or to run a Windows UWP (Universal Windows Platform) application with a graphical interface. Only one UWP application can be in the foreground. On IoT Core, it is also possible to run a special kind of UMP “Background app”, without a GUI, for long-running tasks. You can configure an app to run at startup, and in fact the home screen is itself a UWP App, called IoT Core Default App, for which you can download the code from GitHub and perhaps fix the keyboard configuration bug I ran into. Microsoft has evolved the platform considerably since I last looked at it, over a year ago. There is now an IoT Dashboard application which is meant to simplify getting started. Provided you have an SD card reader, the application will download the operating system and write it to the card, configuring it with your choice of device name and administrator password. You can also automatically provision an Azure connection using the IoT Hub, for managing and communicating with multiple devices. Remote Desktop to a Pi running Windows 10 IoT Core Another new piece is the Windows IoT Remote Client, which runs on any Windows 10 PC, tablet or phone. As the name implies, this is a remote desktop to your device. In practice, a remote PowerShell session is generally more useful, unless you write an application with a graphical user interface. I had a few hassles with both PowerShell and the Remote Client. In order to get PowerShell remoting working, you have to follow a few steps to start the WinRM service and add the Pi to TrustedHosts, before you can run the magic Enter-PsSession command. You will probably need to do this if you want to try the Remote Client, because the Remote Client requires the Remote Server to be running on the Pi. Although you should be able to enable this via the browser-based dashboard (called the Device Portal), it gave me an error when I tried, and this seems to be common. The solution is to add a scheduled task to run the NanoRDP task on boot, using PowerShell. I did this but it does not quite work, and I have to manually run the task in PowerShell before the Remote Client will connect, and even then it does not always work. There is also now a command prompt built into the default app, though to enable this you need to type some PowerShell to add a registry key, otherwise it comes up with “Access Denied” when you try to run cmd.exe. Once done, this makes an interactive logon considerably more useful than before. Microsoft has also added Store integration, though it is not what you are used to on desktop Windows 10. Installing an application from the Store is a multi-step process involving the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer, creating a package, and then copying it to a special folder on the device before rebooting. You can also pre-install compatible Store apps when creating the initial OS image. The real advantage is that Store apps get automatic updates, simplifying maintenance once deployed. Microsoft describes another new feature as “multiple foreground app support”. This means you can write launcher applications, such as a Start screen. There is also now support for an IoTivity AllJoyn Device System Bridge. Both AllJoyn and IoTivity are frameworks for connecting and controlling devices. Windows supports AllJoyn, but the bridge enables interaction with IoTivity devices. Windows IoT Core running on a Raspberry Pi is a neat platform and it is easy to see its potential, especially for businesses with .NET development skills and Azure accounts. It is not an alternative to Linux if you want a full-features OS on a Pi, but could be used for all sorts of home automation, robotics or multimedia projects. Considering the importance of stability and low maintenance overhead for an IoT platform, it is a shame I ran into so many annoyances in the initial setup, leading to an impression that it is not yet ready for business. That said, it may be fine once you have got your application working and deployed. Visual Studio integration works well. One last thought: with Microsoft’s efforts to get .NET Core working on Linux, it is reasonable to wonder whether that alternative route to bringing IoT on devices, such as the Pi, into the Windows and .NET ecosystem may, in the end, be more productive. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 88 Comments More from The Register Dyn Dyn Dyn – we have a buyer: Oracle gobbles Internet of Things DDoS victim Scoops up Twitter with A-list DNS customer list 19 Comments Microsoft drops OMI for Linux to GitHub Management for Penguin-powered things, phones, and other skinny stuff 4 Comments Bluetooth 5.0 emerges, ready to chew on the internet of things Gentlemen, we can rebuild it.

Featuring the v6 designation the Xeon E3-1200 v6 lineup boasts the Kaby Lake architecture and improved clock rates over their former Skylake based counterparts – they will remain however, for the time being, quad core processors. Xeon E3 1200 v6 Kaby Lake SKU lineup leaked – landing soon The Xeon E3-1200 v6 series lineup is being led by the Xeon E3-1280 v6 which boasts a clock speed of up to 3.9 Ghz – this is an increase of almost 200 Mhz over its predecessor, which when coupled with the architectural gains involved here (which should be less than 5%) will mean significant speedups in enterprise scenarios. The TDP is set at 74W and a cache of 8MB is shared between the 4 cores. It is also worth noting here that we do not know for sure what chipset the processors will support. Usually, with every release of a E3 1200 iteration, support for the previous chipset is discontinued. It remains to be seen whether this is the case here as well. Then come the Xeon E3-1270 v6, Xeon E3-1240 v6 and Xeon E3-1230 v6. The clock speeds of these processors are 3.8 Ghz, 3.7 Ghz and 3.5 Ghz respectively. Just like the 1280 v6 this is a significant speed up from their predecessors with clock upgrades of 200 Mhz, 200 Mhz and 100 Mhz respectively. The cache for the entire lineup remains at 8 MB shared and the TDP remains fixed at 74W. It is worth adding here that the TDP itself is also an architectural upgrade over Skylake – which featured a fixed TDP of 80W. Advertisement And while this may not seem like much to the laymen you are actually looking at a performance/watt increase of 13-15% which can make a huge difference in enterprise scenarios. Lastly, we have the Xeon E3-1220  v6 processor which does not have hyper threading enabled so you are looking at 4 cores and 4 threads. The clock speed remains 3.0 Ghz just like its predecessor while the TDP has gone down to 74W. Lastly we have the special edition Xeon chips which end in the “5” digit – including the Xeon E3-1275 v6, Xeon E3-1245 v6 and Xeon E3This indicates that the chip has an integrated iGPU and in the case of Skylake this was the Intel HD graphics P530.

Here's what you need to know. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Aug 29, 2016 at 9:23PM Image source: Getty Images. In many ways, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) are natural rivals. ARM collects royalties on billions of mobile device sales, since its technologies are at the heart of nearly every smartphone and tablet. Intel chips power the big-iron systems inside every data center. Both sides have tried to make inroads into the other's core markets, but not with much success. It's the type of epic rivalry that fuels impassioned investor inquests. Which business model is the better long-term investment, and which stock should you buy today? However, these questions have boiled down to a very simple answer recently. You should sell your ARM Holdings holdings and invest in Intel. It's really that simple. Game over, man. Game over! You see, ARM is not really an option anymore. In mid-July, the company accepted a buyout offer from Japanese wireless network operator SoftBank (NASDAQOTH:SFTBF), which effectively took ARM shares off the market. Intel, on the other hand, remains a viable stand-alone business and a solid investment for the long term. So there's the quick and easy answer -- sell whatever ARM shares you might own in order to collect your profits, and take another look at the very investable Intel stock instead. More nuance, please Okay, so there are still a few special situations to consider. SoftBank doesn't own ARM quite yet. ARM shareholders must still approve of the merger, and the deal has to pass the usual battery of regulatory tests in the U.K. and Japan. If you expect any of these speed bumps to derail the merger process, you might want to sell ARM shares short. Anything less than a simple completion of this acquisition would undoubtedly crush ARM's share prices. However, there's little reason to make that negative bet. SoftBank does not compete with ARM in any way, shape, or form. Adding a chip technology business to a mobile network operator should raise very few antitrust concerns, paving the way toward a smooth closing. As for shareholder approval, ARM went out on a high note. The ARM buyout bid lifted ARM shares to a fresh all-time high, soaring more than 40% overnight. It's hard to ask for a better exit deal than this, and I'd be shocked if ARM shareholders gave the deal a thumbs-down. So, ARM shares are dead in the water. The only reasonable bet to make here is a negative one, and even that option looks weak. What about Intel? Of course, Intel is a better option only if you believe that the chip giant will create value on its own. Otherwise, you might as well just park your cash in the nearly immovable ARM stock (or a simple savings account) while you watch Intel shares plunge. As an Intel shareholder myself, I would disagree with that conclusion. The company has weathered some massive market storms in recent years, coming out even further ahead in the crucial data center market. Meanwhile, Intel shares are trading at very reasonable valuations such as 14.7 times trailing free cash flow and 15.4 times adjusted earnings. There's no such thing as a guaranteed winner, but Intel's risk-reward balance is positive enough to keep its place in my own real-world portfolio. If you'd still prefer to take ARM's side in this debate, you would have to consider the pros and cons of SoftBank's wireless business and global ambitions. That's a worthy line of investigation, but beyond the scope of this article. And if you don't want to pick sides at all, consider that Intel recently became an ARM partner with hopes of manufacturing ARM-based chips for other companies. From that point of view, an Intel investment is a bet on both of these tickers. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

It was in October, and the company referred it as the ultimate laptop. (check: LeEco Le 2S Pro Specifications.) It has a detachable screen, Surface Pen, Intel ‘Skylake’ dual core processors, and Windows 10 Professional on the OS front in the lower model. By shelling out some extra money, the tech giant offers Nvidia based discrete GPU for about $1499. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Despite a lot of good hardware specs, it had a few hiccups. There were complaints regarding the Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge which induced a space when closed. Lower battery life to its competitors and steep pricing for higher end specifications were some other complaints which surrounded it. Keeping the previous gadget to its place, let’s move on to the upcoming product. Surface Book 2 release date As of now, Microsoft hasn’t officially announced the launch date as it has been only a year since the launch of its original product. However, it’s definitely clear that the successor is in progress. It is anticipated that it will be released along with Surface Pro 5, Surface Phone, and a Surface all-in-one PC. The above tech products are expected by the firm as the Microsoft’s second Redstone update (RS2). It will come out on the anniversary of this summer. It would be more beneficial to users if the company releases the upcoming device with the all new Intel’s next generation Kaby Lake processors. This 14-nanometer microprocessor architecture is expected to go for high volume production at the end of 2016. The processors will offer USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 support along with the regular four cores’ configuration and improved CPU / GPU performance. Microsoft recently unveiled its Play Anywhere program and it’s still not clear if the company will be including it with the hardware of upcoming Surface Book. The year 2017 makes it a perfect time to launch an additional gaming focused configuration with a GeForce 980M. Stay tuned for latest updates regarding it. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors Expectations Leave it to Microsoft what it gives with the all new 2-in-1 laptop. There will always be improvements which can be done. And it will even if the company gives their best. Below are some of the ideas from us and some readers to make a better Windows 10 laptop Take a look and if you want to add yours, let’s know via comments. Better Screen Latest Intel Kaby Lake processors will be required to power the next HD screen for the SB 2. The previous model has a 13.5-inch display screen with a 3,000 x 2,000 resolution pixels with 267 PPI. Moreover, there is an integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. The new model should offer a 4K screen. The upcoming Kaby Lake architecture of Microsoft processor will improve the playback of 4K video and 3D graphics. Along with it, the company should focus on providing a better with which the screen can be detached from the keyboard. There are a lot of complaints regarding the hinge mechanism in the original SurfaceBook. As of now, it both requires electricity and mechanical process to detach it. It’s both software and hardware based process. So, there can be an unforeseen glitch in the system. There must be a better way for it. It should get detached irrespective of the system is ON or OFF. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors More Battery Life If Microsoft includes new Kaby Lake architecture, then the device will definitely need more power as the screen resolution will increase. With this, we meant to say that there should be enough battery to power the device with improved performance. With tests and normal usage, original Surface Book has a 4-hour battery in the Clipboard and an 8-hour battery in the base. To watch 4K content, users will require more of the battery backup. It won’t be possible with the current specs. The built-in recharge dock for the Surface Pen will need an improved battery. As of now, the device has a standard AAA battery. However, a patent has made it clear that Microsoft is working on a stylus with a built-in rechargeable battery. This is, however, an old patent. But it can be possible if the company provides a rechargeable Surface Pen for SB2. As of now, Microsoft’s focus is on providing a better stylus in Windows 10. The new pen should have a LED indicator light and a power button. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors The updated GPU will need more power. The current device can include a Nvidia GeForce graphics chip with Maxwell architecture which has a thermal envelope of up to 75W. If Microsoft comes up to give Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 graphics chip, then it will need to support power requirements of up to 145 W. Its alternate is to use slower GeForce GTX 980M with 100W and it will still support DirectX 12 in Windows 10. But it will still need more juice. It would be great if it comes out VR-ready. For it, the laptop will need to have two USB 3.0 ports, a mini Display Port, and an SD card reader. With it, it should have an HDMI 1.3 port to support 297 MHz clock by a ‘direct output architecture.’ It means that the external video output pumped through the HDMI port can’t be locked to the performance of the laptop. Storage It should have 128gb to 1TB internal storage. Price It should cost from $1500 to $3500 depending upon the specifications. Updates: 29th August 2016: Microsoft posted an image on Instagram to tease, it wasn’t a teaser at all. It was a cropped photo of original Surface Book. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors Will It Beat Its Rivals? Despite talking what should it have and when it releases, there have several rumors that it will be released this Summer with Surface Pro 5 and Anniversary update. It is still not in the market to beat Apple MacBook Air 2016 and MacBook Pro 2016. The devices of Microsoft are still young, and the follow-up models will take time. This is all for now. Let’s see if there are any easter eggs in the Windows 10 Insider Preview builds regarding hardware. It seems that the company has bigger plans for Redstone 2. Most of the people are still hoping for an early 2017 release for SurfaceBook2. Let’s wait and watch what happens next as 2016 comes to an end.

On today's edition of NFC East Intel, we look at the Eagles releasing two wide receivers, Victor Cruz making his long-awaited return to the field for the Giants and the Cowboys' quarterback situation with an injured Tony Romo. PHILADELPHIA EAGLES Headline: Eagles Release Rueben Randle, Chris Givens As cuts begin to be made, the Eagles on Sunday parted ways with two veteran receivers: Rueben Randle and Chris Givens. Randle, 25, was signed by the Eagles earlier in the offseason after spending four seasons with the Giants. He is coming off a season in which he hauled in 797 yards and a career-high eight touchdowns, but reports coming out of Philadelphia was that he was far too inconsistent to grab a roster spot. Givens, 26, was also acquired in free agency this offseason after he split the first four years of his NFL career between the St. Louis Rams and Baltimore Ravens. He had worked some with the first-team offense (including a 19-yard reception to begin the Eagles’ most recent preseason game), but the Eagles decided to move on without him. The moves leave the Eagles with eight wide receivers: Jordan Matthews, Nelson Agholor, Dorial Green-Beckham, Josh Huff, Paul Turner, Marcus Johnson, Cayleb Jones and David Watford. What this means for the Redskins: Philadelphia’s passing game appears to be a work in progress, even if Sam Bradford is the starting quarterback and Matthews and Agholor are returning. The Redskins and Eagles first meet in Week 6 of the regular season. NEW YORK GIANTS Headline: Victor Cruz Plays In First Game Since The 2014 Season For the first time since tearing his patellar tendon in October 2014, followed by a calf injury that wiped away his 2015 season, Cruz was back at MetLife Stadium on Saturday evening, recording one reception for four yards. It was his first catch in 685 days. "It felt good to put that jersey on again and go out there with my teammates, from the warmup, the pregame, and then during the game to be in the position to make a play and be out there running routes against an opponent, it felt good," Cruz said via NBCNewYork.com. While Cruz recorded just one reception, he said it was “definitely good to get one in.” "That ball felt like it was forever in the air before it got to my hands, but it was good to kind of catch that ball and get a little contact, get a little hit out of bounds, and hopefully I can build on that," Cruz said. What this means for the Redskins: The Giants are hoping that Cruz can come back healthy and bolster a passing attack that has heavily relied on Odell Beckham Jr. If the 29-year-old stays on the field, rookie Kendall Fuller or Dashaun Phillips could be tasked with stopping him in the slot. DALLAS COWBOYS Headline: Tony Romo Suffers Fractured Bone In His Back The Cowboys likely won’t be with Romo to start the regular season, as Dallas head coach Jason Garrett announced on Saturday that the veteran quarterback suffered a fractured bone in his back from a hit taken in last Thursday’s preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. “We’re going to monitor his condition day by day and we’ll see how he feels going forward,” Garrett said via DallasCowboys.com. “There’s no timeframe when he’s going to return.” While Garrett wouldn’t specify Romo’s status moving forward, most reports that have surfaced have said the Eastern Illinois product will likely be out six to 10 weeks. That could potentially see him miss the first half of the season. With Romo hurt, the Cowboys currently move forward with 2016 fourth-round pick Dak Prescott as the starter and Jameill Showers as the primary backup. Fourth-year Boise State product Kellen Moore broke his ankle on Aug. 3 during a training camp practice. Even though Prescott has shined in the preseason (he’s thrown five touchdowns and ran for two more in three games), ESPN’s Bill Barnwell thinks Cowboys fans should be worried. “I would be lying if I didn't say the numbers look better than Prescott on tape,” Barnwell writes. “He has made some excellent throws, and I'm not a scout, but watching with impartial eyes, Prescott has been inconsistent. He underthrew a fair number of his passes, including the touchdown pass to Dez Bryant against the Dolphins and the score to Jason Witten against the Seahawks, the latter of which was nearly intercepted. Miami also dropped a would-be pick. Prescott has had a clean pocket for many of his throws, and when teams have pressured him, his throws have suffered." What this means for the Redskins: The Redskins and Cowboys face off early this season, as their first matchup comes in Week 2 at FedExField. If Romo is unable to go (and all signs point to in that direction), then it will mark the third straight game that the Redskins have faced a Cowboys quarterback other than Romo. The Cowboys face the Giants in Week 1 in a Sunday afternoon game.  Trending Now Redskins' Path To A Potential Playoff Bid Clears Up Entering Week 17 Redskins-Giants Game Flexed To 4:25 p.m. Redskins' Opponents For The 2017 Season Confirmed Redskins Sign Josh Evans, Place Donte Whitner Sr. On Injured Reserve More News » CSN Videos More Video Recent Articles Redskins Sign Nine To Reserve/Future Contracts Five Takeaways: Jay Gruden's End Of Season Presser Snap Counts: Redskins-Giants (2016 Regular Season, Week 17) PHOTOS: Redskins Wrap Up 2016 Season Redskins-Giants Monday Stats Pack Redskins' Opponents For The 2017 Season Confirmed PHOTOS: Redskins-Giants Highlights The Best Of #SkinsRightCombo, Week 17 Papa John's Redskins Touchdown Special Redskins Process The Sting To The End Of Their Season Subscribe More Headlines » Featured Galleries Redskins Clean Out Their Lockers The Washington Redskins players officially wrapped up the 2016 season on Monday, Jan. 2, 2017, cleaning out their lockers and speaking to the media before beginning their offseasons.

As we have predicted more than two years back, the industry is bifurcating, and just a few products pursue scaling to 7nm while the majority of designs stay on 28nm or older nodes. Our 2014 blog 28nm — The Last Node of Moore's Law has now been confirmed. At the time we wrote: “After the 28nm node, we can continue to make transistors smaller, but not cheaper.” It is illustrated in the following slide, presented by Samsung at the recent Semicon West 2016. Click here for larger image Intel did announce that going forward, the time between nodes will increase but it still claims it can keep reducing transistors cost. Yet Intel’s underwhelming successes as a foundry suggest otherwise. We have discussed it in a blog titled Intel — The Litmus Test, and it was essentially repeated in Apple will NEVER use Intel Custom Foundry! “Yes, Intel will argue that their 10nm and 7nm are better than the foundries (TSMC and Samsung) but that will have to be proven at the chip level which is based on PPAC (power, performance, area, AND cost). The foundries have beaten Intel at every node based on SoC PPAC and I do not expect that to change at 10nm or 7nm.” This discussion seems academic now, as the actual engineering costs of devices in advanced nodes have shown themselves to be too expensive for much of the industry. Consequently, and as predicted, the industry is bifurcating, and few products pursue scaling to 7nm while the majority of designs use 28nm or older nodes. The following chart  derived from TSMC quarterly earnings reports was published last week by Ed Sperling in the blog Stepping Back From Scaling: Click here for larger image Yes, the 50-year march of Moore’s’ Law has ended, and the industry is now facing a new reality. Similar industry dynamic has also been shown in a blog by Mentor Established Technology Nodes: The Most Popular Kid at the Dance. Key quote: “designs at 65 nm and larger still account for approximately 43% of all wafer production and 48% of wafer fab capacity. Even more significant, nodes 65nm and larger account for approximately 85% of all design starts (see charts below, source: VLSI Research). Clearly, established nodes are not fading away any time soon.” Click here for larger image This is good news for innovation, as a diversity of choices helps support new ideas and new technologies such as 3D NAND, FDSOI, MEMS and others. These technologies will enable new products for the emerging market of IoT. A good conference to learn more about these new scaling technologies is the IEEE S3S ’16, held in the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, October 10th thru 13th, 2016. CEA Leti is scheduled to give an update on their CoolCube program, Qualcomm will present some of their work on monolithic 3D, and three leading researchers from imec, MIT, and Korea universities collaboration will present their work on advanced monolithic 3D integration technologies, and many other authors will discuss their work on monolithic 3DIC and its ecosystem, in addition to tracks focused on SOI, sub-VT and dedicated sessions on IoT. —Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of MonolithIC 3D Inc..

The numbers support it and it has been predicted for a good time. The tech leaders are already experiencing a dramatic spend increase for developing  each node, and it is taking longer, especially when one includes the time for ramp to yield. Also, we can't split the atom (see Intel's talk). On the other side of the split, many product companies, not just the IoT/preIoT/postIoT/IoTofIoT.... folks, have plenty of processing power and memory at fully depreciated costs for human interfaced products. As well, the spectre of true3D is now here, taking advantage of older nodes and stacking monolithically...see 3D NAND. The world has changed. Dennard scaling has mostly been replaced. The economic Moore's Law has morphed. It had too...we have all gotten used to its benefits.

To meet it 14nm should had been cheaper in 2016. 2. In 50 years of efective Moore's Law the industry move quickly to the new node and closed down, end-of-life, fabs of older nodes. Now the industry is bifurcating, very few design move forward while most of the design are being design into older nodes. And foundries invest and develop enhancements to older node. 3. This bifurcating will soon dry up the funding required to develop new nodes as already been seen with Intel formally announcing slowing down to three years between nodes. 4. Accordingly there is far more diversication these days as better product utilize technologies other than brute force scaling - see 3D-NAND.

Miguel Salonga29 August, 2016 (Microsoft Official website)The Microsoft Surface Book Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today According to the latest rumors, Microsoft is already gearing up for the release of Surface Book 2. The rumors are rife that the public may not have to wait longer for the release of the new Surface Book iteration, as the hybrid device is expected to arrive during the last quarter of the year.  According to a report from Bench Life, a leaked plan by Intel reveals the release schedule of the new generation Kaby Lake processors. According to the recent reports about the Surface Book 2's main features, the device may be sporting the latest Intel processing chip, and the new Surface Book's release will depend on the Kaby Lake's availability. If the leaked details from the website are to be believed, the Kaby Lake chipsets will be ready this September. In this case, the Surface Book 2 might be developed by October. Moreover, Wccf Tech reported that the Kaby Lake will boast 15W TDP or thermal design power, something that will further enhance the Surface Book's performance. The online publication also stated that with the latest developments with the Intel Kaby Lake, the Surface Book 2 will be ready during this year's last quarter, or possibly in October. On the other hand, the official Microsoft Surface Instagram account was reported to post the first look of the Surface Book 2. As reported by MS Power User, the appearance of the device on the photo is different from the original Surface Book, particularly on its hinge. The device posted on Instagram does not look to have a hinge gap. The website's unnamed sources claim that Microsoft is indeed starting to tease the public regarding the Surface Book 2, as the recently posted photo was that of the highly anticipated device. The Surface Book 2 is expected to boast many upgrades from the first Surface Book iteration released last year. The current Surface Book is boasting the sixth generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor with NVIDIA GeForce GPU, with 1GB GDDR5 memory. It has 128GB, 256GB, 512 GB and 1 TB SSD storage variants. It is also sporting a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with 3000 x 2000 maximum screen resolution.

However, increasing the CPU frequency beyond the official specification is not the only way to extract more performance from a computing system. Memory-bound workloads can benefit from memory hierarchies with increased bandwidth and/or lower latencies. The memory controller in the Intel U-series processors (on which most, if not all, high performance SFF systems are based) is rated for operation only according to the standard JEDEC guidelines (1600 MHz for DDR3 and 2133 MHz for DDR4). However, the Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK) can support DDR4 SODIMMs operating at 2133 MHz+. In this article, we explore the effects of varying DDR4 frequencies and latencies on the NUC6i7KYK. Background Intel's Skylake platform brought DDR4 DRAM into the mainstream market. DDR4 brings a host of improvements over DDR3, particularly in terms of operating at lower voltage and higher frequencies. Another important advantage is the maximum capacity per DIMM (moving from the usual 8GB in DDR3 to 16GB in DDR4). On standard non-overclocked systems, the DDR4 memory can operate at up to 2133 MHz. DDR4 DIMMs operating as high as 3733 MHz are available for desktop systems with full-sized memory slots. On the SODIMM side, we have seen various vendors introduce kits operating at more than 2133 MHz. However, there are very few systems utilizing DDR4 SODIMMs that also support for memory overclocking (a term I will use in this article to indicate DDR4 operation at more than 2133 MHz). SODIMMs are used in notebooks and SFF PCs. The memory in most notebooks is rarely upgraded, and many high-performance notebooks are now opting to go with soldered DRAM instead of SODIMM slots. That leaves SFF PCs as the only viable option to explore the benefits of these new wave of DDR4 SODIMMs. Skylake-U is not an effective option because its memory controller is rated to operate at only 2133 MHz. However, the Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK), which combines a Skylake-H CPU (Core i7-6770HQ) with the H170 chipset, is a completely different platform. The BIOS includes XMP support, resulting in the appropriate SODIMM kits operating at speeds higher than 2133 MHz automatically. One of the advantages of DDR4 SODIMMs is that we can get up to 16GB on a single SODIMM. On systems like the NUC6i7KYK with two SODIMM slots, we can have up to 32GB of DRAM. To that end, for today's article we have procured 2x16GB DDR4 SODIMM kits rated for operation at more than 2133 MHz from Corsair, Crucial, G.Skill, Kingston and Patriot Memory to study the impact of memory overclocking on the performance of Skull Canyon. The Core i7-6770HQ Memory Controller and Hierarchy Our Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK) review analyzed the platform and BIOS in great detail. The block diagram shows two channels of DDR4 memory operating at 1.2V for a 128b memory interface. When both memory slots are occupied, the two memory channels operate in dual-channel symmetric mode (also known as interleaved mode) and provide the best performance for real-world applications. Addresses are ping-ponged between the channels after each cache line boundary (64 bytes). In the case that only one slot is occupied, the operation is in single-channel asymmetric mode. The memory controller does support ECC RAM (since it is used in the Xeon E3-1500 v5 lineup also), but the feature is disabled in the Core i7-6770HQ. Intel recommends that the SODIMMs used in the NUC6i7KYK support the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) data structure. This allows the BIOS to read the SPD data and program the chipset to accurately configure memory settings for optimum performance. If non-SPD memory is installed, the BIOS will attempt to correctly configure the memory settings, but performance and reliability may be impacted or the SO-DIMMs may not function under the determined frequency. The other interesting aspect of the Core i7-6770HQ that bears relevance to the performance of the NUC6i7KYK is the internal memory hierarchy. The processor is one of the Skylake-H members to come with a 128MB On-Package Cache (eDRAM). The processor also features a 6MB L3 (LLC) cache, which is smarted among all 4 CPU cores. Each core also has a dedicated 256KB L2 cache (making for a total of 1MB L2 in the Core i7-6770HQ). Skylake's core architecture (32KB of I-cache and 32KB of D-cache) is well-known and has been analyzed before. The LLC in the Core i7-6770HQ is only 6MB (1.5MB/core), while other members of the Skylake-H family with Iris Pro Graphics (same 128MB eDRAM configuration) have 2MB of LLC per core (total of 8MB). The most important aspect here is that the eDRAM is not available only to the GPU, but also to the other clients of the memory controller. The BIOS of the NUC6i7KYK supports the Extreme Memory Profile (XMP), an Intel-developed JEDEC SPD extension for memory kits to indicate support for high-performance timings that are beyond the standard JEDEC standard. This allows 'overclocked' memory kits to be plug-and-play. The BIOS can read the extra SPD information at boot time and automatically set the memory timings to the overclocked configuration. Evaluating Memory Frequency Scaling on the NUC6i7KYK The rest of this review deals with the quantitative measurement of the effectiveness of different types of DRAM in the Skull Canyon NUC. In order to do this, we processed various benchmarks while keeping everything other than the DRAM SODIMMs constant. Each configuration was booted to BIOS multiple times to ensure that the SPD information was properly parsed and the optimal frequency / timing parameters chosen. Once the OS was booted, we also checked with multiple hardware monitoring tools that the parameters indicated by the BIOS for the DRAM SODIMMs were indeed what the OS was also seeing.

Altering the 'Automatic' DRAM timings to 'Manual' and 'user-defining' the various timing parameters as printed on the SODIMM label (16-18-18-43) enabled higher frequency operation." I'm not surprised. My G.Skill RAM (DDR3) also didn't perform as advertised in a plug and play fashion, and when I emailed to complain, they acted as if it was normal for manual entry to be required. So much for XMP compliance. Reply Ian Cutress - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link The system BIOS automatically loads the SPD profile of the memory kit unless the XMP option is enabled. In most systems, XMP is disabled as the default option because kits without XMP (most of the base ones) don't exist. Also, the SPD profile is typically left as the base JEDEC settings to ensure full compatibility. If you want true plug and play of high speed memory kits, one of two things need to happen: 1) XMP is enabled by default (but not all memory will work) 2) Base SPD profiles on the memory should be the high-speed option (means the memory won't work in systems not geared for high performance) There are a number of Kingston modules, typically DDR4-2400/2666, that will use option number (2). Some high-end motherboards have an onboard switch for (1). For everything else, it requires manually adjusting a setting in the BIOS. The problem, as always, is maintaining wide compatibility. Just in case someone buys a high-end memory kit but wants to run it at base JEDEC specifications, because the hardware they are moving the kit into doesn't support the high frequency.

You'd figure that a big iGPU would need more bandwidth with newer games. Perhaps current iGPUs just are not powerful enough. Maybe AMD will fix that with zen APUs next year. Reply Ian Cutress - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link It's a function of the embedded DRAM. You would expect DRAM speed to affect the iGPU less when eDRAM is present because it provides a large 50GB/s bidirectional DRAM buffer. Without eDRAM, I would expect the differences in gaming results to be more. Will have to do testing to find out - this piece was focusing primarily on the Skull Canyon environment which lists high speed memory support as a benefit. Reply Samus - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link I haven't seen a memory frequency roundup like this since Sandy Bridge, which did show a slight benefit (more than Skylake for sure) moving from DDR3 1066 through 1333, 1600 and so on. Haswell I'm sure is a similar story. I had noticeable performance improvements on AM3+ platforms going from 1600 to 2400 especially in regard to the embedded GPU. With sky lake it seems you are just wasting your money to run potentially less reliable, more expensive memory out of specification. But I wonder if CPUs without the eDRAM have the same flat scale?

NEWS August 29, 2016 From more than 120 entries from Post Primary schools all over the country, Crana College, Buncrana has been selected as only one of two schools in Donegal and 22 schools nationally for a new Junior Cycle Coding pilot initiative. Teachers from Crana College will be among the first in the country to teach the new Junior Cycle short course in Coding. The Information Technology (IT) sector continues to grow in Ireland and offers students excellent career opportunities. IT is an integral component of the curriculum in Crana College, and as it’s teachers seek to equip students with the skills they will need to meet the challenges of the 21st century Coding will play an important role in doing this. Intel has also made a donation of 900 Galileo Gen 2 Boards and teacher kits to the 22 Post Primary schools. The training and donation are part of a collaboration initiative between Intel Ireland, Lero ­ The Irish Software Research Centre and Department of Education’s Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) professional development service. Crana College teachers Thomas Boyle and Annmarie Walsh are among 56 teachers to receive training as part of this pilot. The initiative is designed to support teachers in exploring the Coding short course now available under the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015. Students will engage in technology and design related activities with the use of state of the art resources. “This donation will support schools in this innovative and exciting Coding initiative, which we hope will produce Ireland’s innovators of the future.” said Paul Phelan, Public Affairs Operations Manager, Intel. “Intel Ireland are delighted to give students an insight into technology, and allow the development of both logical and digital skills in a fun, collaborative, and innovative learning environment”. “These digital skills are vital if Ireland, and indeed Europe, is to address the coding skills shortage which has led to in excess of 500,000 open job postings across the continent in 2015. Participating teachers enjoy specific training to support their exploration of this new learning area in their schools. Both Intel Ireland and Lero support JCT in this work. “A career in computing can be interesting and creative. This project will allow students to take the first steps in exploring this potential,“ said Clare McInerney, who is Education and Outreach Manager in Lero. “We are very happy to help build capacity in schools to provide inventive short courses like Coding to their students.” “I am very excited about the introduction of Coding to our timetable”, Kevin Cooley, Principal of Crana College. “We were not included in the initial list of 19 schools in Ireland eligible to offer the Exploring Coding pilot in the College in 2016. However, we made a strong case to the Dept of Education and Science highlighting the need to offer young people in the Northwest opportunities to explore Coding as a possible career option”.

Skip to content Purism High-quality laptops that protect your freedom and privacy Search for: Menu Why Purism? Products PureOS News & Events Support My Account Global Shipping Status FAQ Forums Contact With recent chipsets, Intel offers a mechanism called Active Management Technology (Intel AMT, part of the “vPro”* featureset, specifically the Intel Management Engine) which, Intel says,“allows IT or managed service providers to better discover, repair, and protect their networked computing assets”. This means somebody can control devices remotely, even when powered off—what is officially called out-of-band system access. What?! Remote access even when powered off? Yes. This is the case with recent hardware (post 2008) from mainstream computer manufacturers. It was created, not as some conspiracy of remote access to all hardware, but as a specific request from businesses and their technology departments to be able to remotely control large swaths of systems that they own, at a lower level than the operating system. In practice, it is essentially a “backdoor”. You can imagine how that represents a serious security and privacy problem for everyone else. The good news is: AMT remote access is not possible on Purism hardware. How does Purism avoid Intel’s AMT? Intel AMT requires three parts to work. The presence of these three parts is required to enable out-of-band remote access: an Intel CPU that supports the vPro feature set; an Intel networking card; the corporate version of the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) binary. Our solution turns out to be pretty simple: We do not use an Intel CPU that has vPro (nor AMT). We do not use an Intel networking card. We do not use the “corporate” version of the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) binary. Note that we do use the “consumer” (smaller) version of the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) binary, which we released a petition for, and continue to work with Intel to free it entirely (what Intel is calling a “ME-less” design). So, there is no hardware level remote access to Purism hardware? No, none that we are aware of, nor have put-in. As it relates specifically to Intel AMT, we neutralize the threat by avoiding Intel CPUs that have the hardware chip allowing it, we do not use Intel networking cards, and we use a version of the Intel ME that Intel claims does not have these capabilities (yes, we know that “Intel claims…” means we don’t have visibility into the source code, and yes, we know that is a concern, and yes, we are working on solving this). You’re still working on freeing the “consumer” Intel ME version used on Purism hardware. Why? It is still an issue of concern because even the consumer Intel ME binary is still, fundamentally, “mystery” non-free code that executes on the CPU. That said, this is an order of magnitude less worrysome than the enormous security hole that a complete Intel AMT system (with all three “puzzle pieces” put together) represents—a system vulnerable to all-encompassing remote access even when powered off. Conclusion Purism is proud to select CPUs that do not have vPro or AMT chips on them, we are proud to use non-Intel wireless cards to avoid any potential conflict, and are happy to know we use a smaller consumer version of the Intel ME that Intel says cannot work to offer out-of-band remote access. Therefore, Purism actively avoids Intel Active Management Technology and is working hard to improve the situation, with the aim of completely removing and neutralizing the threat of the proprietary Intel ME. *Note: vPro is an umbrella term to include a lot of features, one of those features being Intel AMT. You get AMT only with vPro chips, even though vPro chips also offer other features.

Shrinks the Tower PC Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store Intel’s 7th Generation Processor and Why You Don’t Know It’s Needed Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 30 Aug, 2016          |         |     Share We live in a very strange technology age. I say very strange because we tend to get excited about new technologies long before they are ready. Then some, like 3D, that were supposed to take over the world, never do (or at least haven’t yet). Others that are so deeply imbedded we’ll call obsolete on a whim; remember that mainframes were declared dead in the 1980s, yet decades later are still one of the most profitable segments in technology. Currently, we are still living under the “PC is dead” mentality, which is this decade’s craziness, particularly given that you are likely reading this on your PC. The tablets that were the supposed cause of this premature death are actually dying off more quickly. Yet one thing I’ve learned is that once the market has decided something is toast, it virtually never changes its mind. And given that everything eventually dies, eventually the market will be right. This is a tad surreal for me because these things become self-fulfilling prophecies: Who wants to invest in dead segments? As a result, marketing is pulled back, and much like it would happen if you decided you were dead and stopped eating and drinking, the prophesized result occurs. So Intel’s 7th generation Core processor just arrived and it is a sharp improvement over the 6th generation. Given that most folks replace their PCs after about five years now, it is a massive improvement over what we had in market five years ago. Let’s talk not about why you likely need this part, but about why you don’t know you need this part. The Cloud Has Issues It is kind of funny that we bounce back and forth between concepts in technology. Initially, computing power was in things like calculators and they sat on the desktop, then we moved to mainframe computers and dumb terminals and everything was centralized. We got tired of having to pray to IT (MIS then) to get things done, and we moved to PCs for much of our work, but that led to a lack of control and scale problems, so we tried to blend concepts in client/server computing, which took a decade to get right. Most recently, we’ve tossed everything to complete strangers who provide cheap though somewhat unreliable and often unsecure services in the cloud. We somehow got the idea that the problem with terminals and mainframes was that they weren’t portable enough and played with the idea that cloud-connected tablets were the future. When that didn’t work, we failed back to PCs, largely connected to these same cloud services. The reason was that not only was this tablet/cloud solution relatively unsecure, the hardware itself wasn’t that compelling as a productivity tool, and the most successful offering, surprising Apple in particular, was Microsoft’s Surface tablets. These were basically PCs in tablet clothing, and Apple is trying to counter with an oversized iPad Pro with mixed results. The reason the results are mixed, I think, is because Apple isn’t strong on cloud services and Apple partners Cisco and IBM tend to be light on desktop support. So x86 remains king, at least for now. 7th Generation Processor While some engineers and professional gamers may replace their high-end machines every year, most of the rest of us are on five-year cycles for laptops and haven’t replaced a desktop computer this decade yet. That means performance advantages should be tied to what we are coming off of, not last year’s products. In general, based on Intel’s specifications for the 7th generation processor, you’ll see a 70 percent jump in productivity apps and a 3.5x jump in graphics over a machine that is five or more years old. And the new hardware and software that comes with this processor will be more resistant to hacking and viruses, have far faster memory and storage, and largely be far more robust than what you currently are using. One example is that fingerprint readers are vastly improved; mostly gone are the old and painfully inaccurate swipe types, now replaced by the more iPhone-like touch technologies, which are both faster and easier to use. For those who work with pictures and video, current generation technology allows you to edit far faster, and mid-range to high-end builds allow editing of 4K videos, though 4K displays are still relatively infrequent and remain expensive (they are dropping rapidly in price, though). You should start seeing new hardware based on this in late September and October, with some really interesting high-end designs showing up toward the end of the year. It is interesting to note that, unless you are a power user, you’ll typically not notice any change between a 6th and 7th generation part; performance improvements are just below the 20 percent threshold. But over a 5th generation or older, the performance bump is very noticeable. (I’m currently using a 6th generation part.) Wrapping Up: Upgrades Getting Easier We used to live for technology updates like this because the applications we had were always limited by the processing power of the machines. As we moved to the cloud, many think this has changed, but because of cloud and network loading, we often still rely heavily on what actually runs on our desktops and laptops. The bad news is that if you are coming from an old OS, the upgrade process is still pretty ugly, but once you are on a current OS like Windows 10, going forward, it’ll be far simpler. Benefits are less on performance and more on reliability, security, and carrying something that doesn’t look like it came in with the Mayflower. Once up on your new PC, particularly for those swapping out machines five years old or older, you’ll see a huge difference and you’ll likely wonder why you waited so long. Kind of makes you wonder what you’ll see five years from now. One thing is for sure, in five years, you’ll see a far easier upgrade process. So you’ll probably not realize you needed a new PC until after you get it into service and, if you are like me, you’ll wonder why you didn’t do this earlier.

Quoting a “military source,” the IS news agency Amaq said “Sheikh Abu Mohamed al-Adnani, the spokesman of the Islamic State, was martyred while surveying operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo.” The agency said Adnani died after a “long voyage crowned by sacrifice” and vowed “revenge” at the hands of a “new generation born unto the Islamic State.” It did not provide any further details on when or how he died. A US defense official said a short time later that coalition forces conducted an air strike Tuesday in Syria targeting a “senior leader” from the Islamic State group. This undated image provided by SITE Intel Group shows Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the Islamic State number 2 who was ‘martyred’ in northern Syria, the jihadist group said on Aug. 30, 2016. (SITE Intel Group via AP) “Coalition forces conducted an air strike in Al-Bab, Syria, targeting a senior [IS] leader,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We are still assessing the results of the operation at this time.” Al-Bab is in Aleppo, a province that is the current focal point of the Syrian civil war, and where IS, Syrian Kurdish forces, Turkey-backed rebels and President Bashar Assad’s forces are vying for control. The province is frequently struck by US-led coalition airstrikes as well as Russian air raids. Born Taha Subhi Falaha in the northern province of Idlib in the late 1970s, Adnani was one of the first foreign fighters to battle against coalition forces in Iraq, according to the State Department. He crossed the border into Iraq and joined al-Qaeda, a precursor to IS, after the 2003 US-led invasion. In late June 2014, he formally declared the establishment of a caliphate, or Islamic state, stretching across parts of Syria and Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and demanded allegiance from Muslims worldwide. A powerful orator, he went on to become the voice of IS. He released numerous, lengthy audio files online in which he delivered fiery sermons urging followers to kill civilians in nations that supported the US-led coalition against the group. “If you can kill a disbelieving American or European — especially the spiteful and filthy French — or an Australian, or a Canadian, or any other disbeliever from the disbelievers waging war, including the citizens of the countries that joined a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be,” Adnani said in 2014.

(AFP PHOTO/AMEER ALHALBI) In other speeches he referred to US President Barack Obama as “an idiot” and Secretary of State John Kerry as an “uncircumcised old geezer.” In May 2015, the US State Department announced a reward of up to $5 million for information that could lead to Adnani’s capture. Earlier this year, Adnani called for massive attacks during Ramadan — a call that translated into the bloodiest Muslim holy month in recent memory. Followers of IS carried out attacks on several continents, including the Orlando shooting, the Nice truck attack in France and a massive suicide bombing in downtown Baghdad. Adnani also disparaged Saudi Arabia and its influential clerics for failing to rally behind the rebels that the monarchy supports in Syria like they did decades ago in Afghanistan. Amaq vowed revenge against the “filthy cowards in the sect of disbelief.” It said a generation raised in IS-held territory would avenge Adnani’s death.

(AP Photo/Halit Onur Sandal) The Islamic State group has suffered a string of defeats in recent weeks, including in Aleppo province, where Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels drove IS out of the border town of Jarablus last week. In Iraq, the group has lost its strongholds in Fallujah and Ramadi, in the western Anbar province. It still controls Mosul, but Iraqi forces are gearing up for a long-awaited operation to retake the country’s second largest city. It has also lost some of its most senior commanders and founding members over the past year, including its “minister of war” Omar al-Shishani, feared Iraqi militant Shaker Wuhayeb, also known as Abu Wahib, as well as a top finance official known by several names, including Abu Ali Al-Anbari.

AP hide caption toggle caption AP Abu Muhammed al-Adnani, spokesman for the Islamic State, has been killed in northern Syria, according to the IS semi-official news agency Amaq. He's shown here in an undated image provided by SITE Intel Group. AP One of the Islamic State's top commanders and the man in charge of disseminating its propaganda was killed in Aleppo, Syria, the group's semi-official Amaq news service announced. Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the news service said, was "martyred while surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo." The report did not list a cause of death. The Islamic State has erroneously claimed its operatives are dead in the past, and the Pentagon has not confirmed his death. Law enforcement sources tell NPR's Dina Temple-Raston that they believe the announcement is genuine. Responding to questions about Adnani, a senior defense official told NPR's Tom Bowman that the U.S. targeted a senior ISIS leader with an airstrike today in al-Bab, Syria, which is about 27 miles outside Aleppo. "We are still assessing the results of the operation at this time," the defense official said. Adnani, whose real name was Taha Sobhi Falaha, was born in Syria, according to the U.S. State Department. He was one of the first foreign fighters to oppose the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and is responsible for publicizing — and voicing — the Islamic State's claim to forming a so-called Islamic Caliphate. Article continues after sponsorship The State Department was offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest. Earlier this month, The New York Times' Rukmini Callimachi told NPR that Adnani should be as well-known as Osama bin Laden. "He is the spokesman of the group. He's the head of their propaganda," Callimachi said. "But more importantly, he is the head of the Emni, which is the body that is responsible for exporting terror abroad." In other words, Callimachi said, Adnani has been directly linked to the attacks abroad, like the one in Paris.

With a new set of gaming chips just on the horizon, Intel stock seems to be in a good place right now. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr But as the PC market continues to shrink, friction between INTC and companies like International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is heating up fast — which is why some investors are concerned that Intel’s stranglehold on the computer space is loosening. Not unlike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), INTC is the kind of company with investment logic that is geared less toward aggressive market disruption and more toward its ability to maintain its lofty position. That’s why it’s actually a dividend play now, generating a reliable income stream for its investors. For years, the bull case for Intel stock has been defensive: how well can Intel, as the dominant player, keep all of its rivals from evolving into serious competitive threats? So when INTC reaches down to pay $350 to $400 million for what amounts to a pre-revenue start-up, its goal isn’t to disrupt the status quo, but to harden it, locking the real disruptors out. 7 Rare Value Stocks in This Overpriced Market Intel already owns 90% of the market share when it comes to CPUs and is a factor in 91% of the top high-performance computing deployments worldwide. Basically, if it’s bigger than Microsoft Corporation‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, INTC owns the space and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD and IBM are effectively tourists. The Primary Advantage of INTC Stock Unfortunately for INTC, its dominance stops at that point. It got crowded off the Xbox a decade ago and was never implemented into Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) or Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) consoles, where specialized AMD graphics rendering rules. It has also withdrawn from mobile CPUs. So its real competitive advantage remains in high-performance computing. That space is growing fastest at the top at 10% to 11% per year, but that isn’t enough to move the needle on its own for a giant like INTC. The strategic key for every company in this space is to supply a bigger piece of every high-end machine. While Intel is already in nine out of 10 of these supercomputers, it’s only capturing a fraction of the revenue because these computers tend to be hybrid best-of-breed designs. When you’re building a supercomputer, you typically start with an INTC processor, and then maybe add another IBM processor or an NVDA graphics accelerator for the truly demanding work. NVDA graphics cards are wildly popular and growing fast enough that it could eventually start nudging into Intel’s space. Still, Intel stock looks like it’s going to remain solid over the long-term. Its valuation is a bit rich right now, but given its 3% yield and 7% to 9% annual growth, it’s still a better play than Microsoft or Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), for example. We may even see its current strategy — doubling down on high-performance computers — unlock some real innovation again, in which case growth ramps up and INTC stock investors cheer.

Close Latest Administration John EllenbyGRiD Compass Laptop John Ellenby, developer of the world's first laptop computer, dies at 75 Jeff Spry Tue, Aug 30, 2016 1:31pm If you're passively tapping away on your Macbook Pro this afternoon, you should stop and take a moment to pay your respects to John Ellenby, the man who helped invented and market what evolved into the digital-age laptop. Ellenby passed away earlier this month at the age of 75. With partial funding from Intel back in 1979, Ellenby and his team developed what would become the world's first portable laptop computer in the early '80s, called the GRiD.  Clumsy and sturdy, this pioneering portable weighed in at a hefty 10 pounds and, from the looks of it, appears to be able to withstand a thermonuclear blast.  Marketed mainly to billionaire business executives, military special forces, NASA astronauts and oil tycoons, the GRiD laid the foundation for the future refinement of the indispensable electronic appliance we are so enamored of today. The grandfather of the modern laptop was employed at Xerox during the early '70s, where he was instrumental in the advancement of the Alto computer, widely considered the first "desktop" computer created from the ground up to support an operating system based on a matched graphical user interface (GUI). The legendary Xerox Alto was a major influence for Steve Jobs on the prototype Apple Lisa and Macintosh computers and the development of Microsoft Windows. After Xerox, Ellenby struck out on his own to found GRiD Systems, with the Mountain View, California company's lower case ‘i’ being a salute to Intel for assisting with the firm's formation (Translation = major cashola).  Working with a talented crew including industrial designer Bill Moggridge, Ellenby spawned the GRiD Compass 1101 in 1982, the first mass-marketed portable computer to use the familiar clamshell design with a fold-down lid collapsing onto the keyboard for convenient storage and transport.  The burly black die-cast case was made from a unique milled magnesium-alloy.  With a pricetag of $8,150, they were far beyond the reaches of most middle-class consumer households but perfect for elite designer Christmas gifts or unrestrained governmental procurement.   Rumor has it that special superspy models were installed with a "seek and destroy" red dot for snipers to target to save classified intelligence information in emergency situations.  Its notoriety as a nearly indestructible piece of technology was well-earned as one of Ellenby and Moggridge's GRiD laptops actually survived the Challenger space shuttle disaster in 1986.  Following the recovery efforts, the GRiD was found to still be fully operational!  The computer was rudimentary by today's standards of course and featured an Intel 8086 processor (8MHz) with 8087 math coprocessor, 256KB DRAM, a 6-inch 320×240-pixel electroluminescent monochrome display and a 384K internal magnetic bubble memory.  In 1988 Ellenby sold GRiD Systems to the Tandy Corporation (Radio Shack) and founded Agilis, a producer of hand-held tablet computers, and then started GeoVector with his son, Thomas, pioneering navigational and augmented-reality applications. Here's a great documentary from the Computer History Museum featuring the work of Ellenby and the evolution of the GRiD Compass portable computer: Video of Pioneering the Laptop: Engineering the GRiD compass (Via Gizmodo)   More from around the web Latest News Blog View Close Latest InterviewbeyondAdam NussdorfDavid EickFreeform 1 Beyond executive producers promise a smart sci-fi series you can binge with the family Tara Bennett SherlockSteven Moffat 1 Sherlock showrunner Steven Moffat on that Season 4 premiere shocker Nathalie Caron Best of 2016Star WarsMarvelCaptain America: Civil WarArrivalRogue Onedoctor strange 4 Our Top 10 Movies of 2016 Blastr Staff Rogue One: A Star Wars StoryStar WarsDarth Vader 1 Rogue One designer on the backstory for Vader's awesome castle Matthew Jackson Futuramafan filmfan-o-rama 2 That live action Futurama fan film has arrived, and it's as terrifyingly great as you’d imagine Trent Moore ColonyUSA 0 Check out the latest trailers for USA's alien occupation series Colony Nathalie Caron MechtechrobotPacific Rimscience 2 Watch this 13-foot tall, piloted, real-life mech take its first steps Trent Moore full metal alchemistanime 1 Images of the day: First pics from live action Fullmetal Alchemist film Trent Moore The ExpanseSyfy 1 The Expanse heads to Mars in first look at Season 2 premiere Trent Moore Ridley ScottBatman v Superman: Dawn of JusticeSuperheroesBlade Runner 6 Here’s what Ridley Scott really thinks of superhero movies and why he won’t make one Nathalie Caron TV This WeekbeyondGrimm 0 TV THIS WEEK: Beyond and Emerald City premiere, Grimm returns, new Sherlock, and more Trent Moore DC ComicsGeoff Johns 7 DC to announce another new TV series soon, but what will it be?

"Administrations in the last six months, historically, are loathe to impose costs," former US National Security Council Director for Asian Affairs Michael Green said, addressing the possibility of a US response to alleged Chinese and Russian cyberattacks. Green explained that presidents are not likely to levy new costs in foreign policy at the end of their term that might "risk creating a crisis" for their successor, or that could "ruin [their] legacy" if the affected nation retaliates. Next week, Obama is expected to meet individually with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Xinping on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Beijing. It is likely that Obama will raise ongoing US concerns over alleged Chinese cyber espionage and recent attacks on US institutions, informally attributed to Russia at those meetings. "I certainly hope President Obama raises the cyber question," former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Eurasian Affairs Heather Conley said. © AP Photo/ Gerald Herbert Obama Fears China, Russia Approaching US Cyber CapabilitiesConley warned that the longer the United States debates the issue of imposing costs for malicious cyber activity, "our lack of resolve then messages to those using these tools… there is really not that cost imposition." Russian officials have denounced as "absurd" US accusations that it is using cyber activity to meddle in the US presidential election. US officials have yet to issue firm attribution for recent attacks on the Democratic National Committee, local voter registration databases, and think tanks. In 2015, Obama issued an executive order enabling the use of economic sanctions in response to malicious cyber actors. ...

The seventh-generation new Intel Core enhanced 14-nanometer-plus processor, called Kaby Lake, is its “strongest and fastest ever,” Intel said in a statement, and aims to meet the demands of increased connectedness and internet use, and growing consumption of high-quality video, ultra-high-definition (UHD) premium and user-generated content, 360-degree video formats, Virtual Reality and digital sports content. It will power ultra-thin notebooks and two-in-one laptop-tablet hybrids. Built on the foundation of the Skylake processors, which Intel launched last year and were also led from Israel, the Kaby Lake processors are more than 70 percent faster than a 5-year-old PC and 3.5 times better in 3D graphics performance, the company said in a statement. The new processors will have a longer-lasting battery — 9.5 hours of 4K video playback — and better security, and will enable more natural and intuitive interactions of users with their PCs, Intel said. “The seventh-generation processors push our performance forward,” Ran Senderovitz, general manager at Intel Israel Development Centers, said in a phone briefing with reporters. The Israeli team, with its colleagues worldwide, has pushed the boundaries of “global technology to new places,” he said. “We are talking about amazing technologies, technologies of 14nm. So it is like taking a hair and dividing it by 8,000.” Intel’s team in Haifa (Courtesy Mor Mazor) The new processors increase productivity with an up to 12 percent faster speed for application processes compared to the previous, sixth-generation, Intel processors, and an up to 19% faster speed for internet use, Senderovitz said. “To present year after year a double-digit performance improvement requires a lot of innovation and determination,” he said. The challenge of the Israeli team, which led the efforts and worked in collaboration with Intel’s other global developers, was to make these processors faster and more energy-efficient and also support high-quality video and virtual reality, as required by users today. “Today computers are at the center of our creativeness,” Senderovitz said, used for everything from editing music to viewing and creating UHD video content and gaming. Israel has traditionally been an important development center for Intel, with local teams coming up with some of the company’s most important products – among them the Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors, and last year’s Skylake, which are in many of the computers currently in use. Ran Senderovitz, general manager at Intel Israel Development Centers. (Courtesy) Kaby Lake will allow computers to dispense with a fan and have a small battery, making them light and thin, some of them just 7 millimeters thick and weighing 1.3 kilograms. “We are getting closer to a level in which computers are becoming as thin as smartphones,” Senderovitz said. The first computers with the new processors are expected to hit the market in September and will be aimed initially at private customers and small and medium businesses. Intel expects to see over 100 computer designs using the Kaby Lake in the fourth quarter of the year. Additional products, targeted at enterprises, workstations and enthusiasts’ notebooks and desktops, are expected in January, Intel said. The processors will be included in a variety of designs and price ranges, which may also include features like hassle-free facial recognition and Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 technology, a single-wire USB Type C connection that supports up to 40 Gpbs transfer speeds. The processors will also allow some PCs to offer users touch, voice and stylus interaction, Intel said. Intel has been operating in Israel since 1974 and directly employs around 10,000 workers in its Kiryat Gat production center and in four development centers, in Haifa, Yakum, Jerusalem and Petah Tikva. The Haifa center is Intel’s largest outside the US.

The family provides the first indication of what more modest product advances may look like as Intel stretches Moore’s law to cover with one process node multiple generations of chips. Kaby Lake processors gain a 12% improvement from enhancements to Intel’s 14nm process. They also include a modestly updated media engine with hardware support for decoding VP9 video and encoding and decoding 4K 10-bit HEVC video. Otherwise, the chips use the same architecture as the previous Skylake generation, including the existing Skylake x86 pipeline. The new generation is the first to break Intel’s tick-tock cadence of alternating between a new process node and a new microarchitecture every year. With the increasing complexity and costs of pursuing Moore’s Law and a slowing PC market, Intel decided to stretch one process generation across three years and three families of chips. The 14+nm process delivers transistor-level enhancements such as taller fins and improved gate pitch, interconnect speed and aspect ratio to deliver 12% better performance. At its Intel Developer Forum earlier this month, the company said it plans to make product families in three generations of its emerging 10nm process. At the systems level, Kaby Lake should enable 19% faster browsing and photo editing. Systems should deliver 4K resolutions for games running at 35 frames/second and support 4K movie playback for up to 9.5 hours. Intel updated two blocks on the Skylake media engine focused on video acceleration. (Image: Intel) Mobile Kaby Lake processors running at 4.5W-15W are shipping now with systems using them expected this fall. Higher-end notebooks and desktops with up to 65W processors will follow early next year. Many of the systems will sport innovations not directly related to the new processors. For example, as many as 120 designs are expected to use the Thunderbolt 3, a 40 Gbit/second link using the USB Type C connector. More than 50 systems are expected to adopt 4K panels and fanless notebooks such as the Asus Transformer 3 are expected to measure less than 7mm in thickness. Intel said the new systems will deliver “more than 70 percent faster mobile productivity than a 5-year-old PC and 3.5x better 3D graphics performance than a 5 year old PC.” The comparisons deflect attention from the lower performance numbers compared to last year’s 14nm Skylake chips. They also hope to encourage upgrades from users holding on to their systems longer than in the past.

Reply MFK - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link I haven't seen any articles by Anandtech on the fact that Intel is opening up it's fabs to other people which could lead to Arm chips being fabbed there. Am I misunderstanding the event? Almost every other tech site reported on this as a major event but i did not see any commentary from Anandtech. Did I miss something?

Not So Fast Tech Innovation Slump? Not So Fast By Tim Bajarin August 29, 2016 10 Comments Here's why I think we're about to enter a strong growth cycle in the tech industry. Silicon Valley's biggest tech firms are bursting at the seams. Apple's spaceship campus is nearing completion, but it recently purchased property in San Jose and is reportedly eyeing more property north of its newest campus in Cupertino. Google and Facebook are also looking to expand, and every week I hear of a company that needs more space to house a growing tech staff. So one has to wonder if they know something we don't. Are we about to enter a strong growth cycle? At Creative Strategies, we have spent a lot of time researching this question, and I believe we've identified several indicators that the tech industry is poised for a major upswing in the next five to 10 years. The biggest thing I see coming is 5G. Every major telecom company, as well as chip makers like Qualcomm and Intel are betting their futures on 5G networks and the devices that take advantage of it. The amount of money being spent on this buildout will be staggering, and it means more tech jobs and growth not only in Silicon Valley but all over the world. Once a mesh of broadband wireless networks becomes available, the Internet of Things will really take hold. A recent Business Insider report estimated that IoT investment will hit $6 trillion over the next five years, with 24 billion IoT devices installed by 2020. Close to $3 trillion will be spent on application development, device hardware, system integration, data storage, security and connectivity between now and 2020. If true, you can see why Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Qualcomm, and many other tech companies are prepping for explosive growth. But the IoT is not just for the home; cars and city infrastructure stand to benefit, too. We are already seeing major moves to put sensors and wireless cameras in light poles, streets, and buildings. While these will be important for city management and services, they will also be critical for use by autonomous vehicles. These costly infrastructure buildouts will take time and demand the help of many engineers and specialty personnel. A fourth growth area will be data centers, from data mining to data analytic skills and data-specific engineers. Right now, almost every company is in need of more staff to deal with these disciplines, especially data analysis. Each day, these companies collect terabytes or petabytes of data that needs to be searched, analyzed, and used to enhance the ability to create products and services. All these connected devices, however, will need to be secure. In years past, my career advice has been to become an IT professional or engineer. Now my answer is to become a security expert. This area will only grow as hackers and rogue nations try to steal identifies, state secrets, or intellectual property. Related Apple VR? Don't Hold Your Breath Apple VR? Don't Hold Your Breath Don't forget about virtual and augmented reality, or more likely a mix of the two. There is no doubt that VR and AR will revolutionize the computing experience and offer new ways to interact with technology. It's still early days, but this sector will bring new jobs and new levels of innovation. Finally, keep an eye on the digitization of the health market and how trackers and smartwatches will link patients to health professionals. At every level of the healthcare system, digital technology will be an important tool for diagnoses, records, and disease prevention. As one who has tracked the tech market for the last 35 years, I am excited about what's to come. Clearly, the country's top tech firms are getting ready for the next great era in technology.

An anonymous user recently uploaded some benchmarks for Intel’s upcoming 7th Generation Core Processors, codename Kaby Lake, to the SiSoft benchmark database. The benchmarks that were uploaded come from an Intel Core i7-7700K processor running on an ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 motherboard. Interestingly enough, it also reports that the CPU was paired with “2x 4GB Fujitsu TEAMGROUP-D4-3866 DIMM DDR3 PC3-34100” which is plausible as Kaby Lake, just like Skylake will support both DDR3 and DDR4 memory. The two benchmarks that were uploaded include SiSoft Sandra’s Processor Arithmetic Benchmark and Processor Multi-Media Benchmark. In the benchmarks, the Intel Core i7-7700K scored 151.94GOPS in the Processor Arithmetic Benchmark and 379.08Mpix/s in the Processor Multi-Media Benchmark. Here’s a look at a comparison between the leaked Intel Core i7-7700K benchmarks and benchmarks uploaded from the Intel Core i7-6700K. In both benchmarks, we can see that the Intel Core i7-7700K crushes the Intel Core i7-6700K. The Intel Core i7-7700K saw performance gains of ~10% in the Processor Arithmetic Benchmark and a whopping ~33% in the Processor Multi-Media Benchmark. Of course, it’s important to keep in mind that we’re comparing one benchmark run of an unreleased Intel Core i7-7700K against the average performance of the Intel Core i7-6700K so I wouldn’t put much faith in the accuracy of these results. However, if these numbers do end up being close to the actual performance, Kaby Lake could be rocking a huge improvement in performance that we typically don’t see too often between processors that utilize the same manufacturing process. Additionally, if this benchmark is in fact leaked from an actual Intel Core i7-7700K, we also have a few more concrete details about its specs as well. Here it shows that there’s 4 cores, 8 threads as expected and a core clock of 4.20GHz, which is likely the maximum turbo boost frequency. There’s also 4x 256kB L2 cache and a 8MB shared L3 similar to what we have in current generation Skylake processors. Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processors are expected to launch sometime in 4Q2016.   Source: SiSoftware Share this: Reddit Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Related Posted In CPU, Intel, News Tags CPU, Intel, Kaby Lake, Rumors CPU, Intel, Kaby Lake, Rumors About The Author Sam Chen Hardware and Technology Enthusiast. SSD Evangelist. Editor-in-Chief. You can find Sam's full biography here Matt Black It’s will likely be about %10 better performance same as always, the problem here is still 4 cores. If zen gets even within a stone’s throw performance but is offering 8 cores for the same price, it’s going to be such a better deal. Come on intel, workloads are threaded now, they have been threaded for a long time, christ you can get 8 core phones. I hate to say it but I might go AMD this round, which is something I haven’t said in a long time. Freeman4096 Everytime you add another core, you sacrifice a bit on singlecore performance. Intel simply believes that current consumer usage need 20 percent better Single core perf. Over double the core count. They are not wrong until dx11 finally dies.

There are sources saying that this year's MacBook Pro will be announced as early as September, during Apple's annual fall event, with the launching in November. However, Bloomberg believes that the MacBook Pro will not be introduced at the event. Other reports also say that it will be announced sometime in October or November. Right now, consumers will have to wait and see. The rumors indicate that Apple will not push back the launch date for the MacBook Pro and wait for Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processing chip. The MacBook Pro 2016 will likely run on a sixth-generation Skylake processor instead. According to AppleInsider, high-end 15-inch versions of the laptop will come equipped with a new AMD Polaris graphics processing unit (GPU), while the lower-end versions will use Intel's integrated graphics processor. The 13-inch model will also be using Intel's integrated graphics. There are also speculations saying that the new MacBook Pro will likely support 5K displays with a resolution of 5120 x 2880 pixels. The new MacBook Pro will allegedly come with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display touch bar instead of the physical function keys. The new macOS Sierra used in the laptop will feature a biometric touch ID functionality. It will also have the capabilities to support augmented reality features and applications. The new MacBook Pro will be shipped with a second-generation USB 3.1 with transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second. Siri will also be available in the new macOS Sierra. The various versions of the new MacBook Pro will probably cost anywhere between $1,299 and $1,499. Apple has yet to confirm the existence of the MacBook Pro 2016, so the release dates and specs mentioned are all speculations and rumors as of this moment.

MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, Specs And Features (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) MacBook fans, rejoice! The MacBook Pro 2016 release date is upcoming, presumably not later than November 2016, but the refresh is likely to skip Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake chip, according to a slew of latest reports doing rounds online. Powering the purported Mac notebook instead is Skylake with the GPU muscle furnished by AMD and Intel. Although rumor mills have not ceased swirling speculations around the MacBook Pro 2016 release date hinting that Apple has pushed back the scheduled 2016 arrival of the much-awaited MacBook Pros due to Kaby Lake, Apple Insider claims that the laptops will be unveiled in the next few months, and will be running on Skylake. In other words, the impending MacBook Pro refresh will pack the seventh generation of the Intel Core-series processor in it. The report further claims that AMD Polaris 11 GPU will be used with exclusive models of the MacBook Pro 2016, especially the 15-inch premium editions. Industry watchers believe that Apple will debut the MacBook Pro 2016s in 13-inch and 15-inch form factors featuring lighter and thinner build than ever, and the latter will exclusively pack AMD's latest mobile graphics card. Citing the state of the GPU market, continued use of AMD GPUs seems inevitable with the Polaris"-series chip seemingly obvious for the imminent MacBook Pro. As far as the comparatively affordable 15-inch models and 13-inch builds are concerned, they are likely to be powered by the combination of Intel Skylake and the chipset's integrated graphics. Apple reportedly opted for Skylake as Kaby Lake is unlikely to be ready for the MacBook Pro specifications in near future. And Apple is understandably unwilling to further postpone the already delayed upgrades for the MacBook Pro. When it comes to choosing integrated graphics for most of the MacBook Pro 2016 models, the Cupertino-based tech giant seem to head towards the right direction. Integrated graphics chipsets are more advanced, and pack higher performance than ever. Moreover, benefits in power consumption for leaving out a dedicated GPU are undeniable. If rumors doing rounds proved to be true, Apple might just roll out the MacBook Pro 2016 along with the iPhone 7 in September, however MacWorld claims such a scenario is highly unlikely. The impending MBPs are rumored to pack an array of awe-inspiring upgrades including renamed MacOS Sierra, ultra-slim build and design, Touch ID-enabled power button, OLED touch bar, Apple Pencil support and Siri for Mac. MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to be unveiled by late September or sometime in October with the actual release date happening no later than November.

Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Australia’s fledgling corporate Kangaroo-bond market is bouncing into life. For years, big businesses have discarded the Australian debt market as too small and obscure, leaving it to a tight group of supranational borrowers and investment banks. That has changed recently, however, as a sharp drop in funding costs has helped catapult the country on to the radar of several high-profile US companies, including Apple, Intel and Coca-Cola Company. Many of these companies have recently turned to Australia for the first time to raise debt denominated in the local currency through Kangaroo bonds. It is part of a wider strategy to tap new investor groups at a time when bond issuance at home has reached record highs. Eager to diversify their funding, US issuers are increasingly venturing into offbeat markets and using foreign currencies to take on debt. Coca-Cola this year raised €8.5 billion ($12.5bn) through the sale of euro-denominated bonds, while Apple has tapped lenders in Taiwan, Switzerland and Japan. Foreign-currency bond deals completed by US companies have risen to 365 this year so far, raising a combined $US77.4bn ($102bn), according to Dealogic. That’s 20 per cent more than the same period last year and more than twice as much as two years ago. The trend has been a boon for Australia’s corporate bond market. Apple’s first foray into the market last year, selling Kangaroo bonds worth $2.25bn, sparked a flurry of activity. Intel made a debut in November, followed by the financial services arm of Ford and a $1bn offering by Coca-Cola. In June, Apple returned with a second large issue. Almost $3bn of corporate Kangaroo bonds have been issued in the seven months to the end of July, according to Commonwealth Bank. It is the market’s most successful year so far, considering foreign non-financial corporate borrowers were absent for much of the past decade. They now account for 15 per cent of all Kangaroo deals, which raised a combined $32.2bn last year. Analysts and investors say another spurt is likely in coming weeks, as the cross-currency basis swap rate — a key metric for US borrowers wishing to raise debt in Australia — rose to a one-year high this month. Companies watch this figure because it defines how expensive it is for them to convert debt raised in a foreign currency back into US dollars. The current rate means they can do this at the lowest cost in a year. Adding to the appeal of raising debt in Australia is a favourable exchange rate. The Australian dollar continues to hover around levels last seen in April, boosting gains for US firms repatriating money from Down Under. “Foreign corporates can effectively get a funding advantage in Australia over Europe or the US right now,” said Martin Whetton, a senior rates strategist at ANZ, which helped manage the most recent Apple and Coca-Cola deals. Of course, the Australian dollar could weaken and exchange-rate gains fade if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates soon. But overall funding costs should remain attractive, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The reason: Australia’s four major banks have begun to heavily borrow abroad to prop up regulatory capital buffers and their funding needs are expected to remain large. Their US dollar-denominated bond sales this year alone amount to $US33bn, double last year’s volume in the same period, according to Dealogic. This flood of debt has helped push the cross-currency basis swap to recent highs. Rod Everitt, who heads Deutsche Bank’s debt-syndication business in Sydney, says overseas borrowers are attracted by the country’s $US1.5 trillion pension market, the world’s fifth largest, which provides a strong source of investor demand. But it wasn’t until Apple turned to Kangaroo bonds that others took notice. “Initially there was some scepticism,” said Mr Everitt, a manager on all three recent US bond issues. “The fact (Apple) would look at Australian dollars highlighted the market to other borrowers.” Still, investors can be choosy. Mihkel Kase, a Sydney-based fund manager at Schroders, bought Apple’s and Intel’s recent Kangaroo bonds to diversify his portfolio. But he only did so, he said, after he and his team spent hours speaking to the firms’ executives and vetting the offerings.

His book, The Alliance, helped the company crystallize its need for an alumni focus. (Photo: STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images) Tech companies put a lot of effort into talent acquisition and retention. Team strength obsesses emerging firms, and of course every CEO touts his staff as the best of the best. It’s an attitude perhaps best captured by an ad campaign that Intel ran back in 2009:   If a little startup grows into a going concern, that makes for good evidence that it attracted the very best (or at least really good) talent. At that point, it may also realize that the folks who once worked for them prove to be an asset. That’s why large innovation companies work to maintain a relationship with their alumni. When Tony Audino left Microsoft in 1995, the company wasn’t putting any effort into maintaining an alumni network. Audino wanted to maintain a connection with co-workers, so he started a Microsoft alumni group. Now, Audino runs Conenza, a company that facilitates the same work for many companies, such as HP, Nielsen and the Gates Foundation.“The interest in maintaining relationships has gone up pretty dramatically over the last 10 years,” Audino continued.  The question is, at what point does it start to make sense for a company to begin investing in an alumni network? “If you get to 1,000, people start to get interested,” Audino told the Observer in a phone call. “Above 5,000, definitely interested.” There are exceptions, Audino said. For example, the Gates Foundation is a small organization that still has an alumni network. It makes sense, however, because it really is able to attract people at the very top of their fields. Like a top 10 university, a part of the appeal of going there is establishing relationships with the others that have. LinkedIn, which has roughly 10,000 employees, runs an in-house alumni program. According to Rachelle Diamond, a manager who runs it, the network was started informally in 2008 by ex-employees, by creating a group on their old employer’s site (naturally). But two-and-a-half years ago, the company decided it wanted to get serious about maintaining relationships with its former employees, so it asked the moderators of that community to take it over. For anyone who has ever run a decently large online forum, it should come as no surprise that there was no objection. Microsoft’s and Intel’s still operate independently, however (neither alumni network responded to a request for comment from the Observer). Audino’s customers see the return on investment falling into three buckets: brand ambassadors, recruitment or re-hires (employees that return to a former employer are called “boomerangs”) and business development (your former operations chief could be in charge of IT procurement at her next gig, after all). Diamond confirmed all these points from LinkedIn’s perspective. Lots of ex-employees have told the company in one way or another that they are happy to recommend working there to others, and the company wants to maintain that goodwill. LinkedIn also sees a value in gleaning business intelligence. Staying in touch with former employees helps the company know what potential partners might want.   If a company wants an alumni network to work, at the bare minimum, Audino said, they really need to do two things: build an online platform (this can start with a Facebook or LinkedIn group—though Conenza’s company also offers a white-labelled platform) and someone on the company’s current staff needs to take responsibility for the program. Audino described how different companies do different things to go beyond the basics. Some hold events. Some put a lot of effort in online communities. Dell has a leadership network, where alumni come back and get matched up with younger employees, in a sort of mentorship role. Microsoft lets alums keep their employee discount. The Observer reached out directly to several different tech giants, but most of them (including Google, Twitter and Facebook) didn’t respond. Yahoo confirmed it doesn’t have a formal alumni effort. Diamond has put a lot of work in the last two years into learning what alums would like, and she’s finding there’s a lot of nostalgia, made more acute by an upcoming move to a new HQ in Sunnyvale, California. The company, which was recently acquired by Microsoft, has invited alums in for one of three days of lunches at the old Mountain View office this week. The cafe was always the place where employees made connections and hung out, so she said the former staff are excited to see it one last time before the company relocates. “We thought it was a good opportunity to invite people back and reminisce,” Diamond said. “They want to connect. It doesn’t have to be a fancy event.” In fact, it probably means more to come back to a familiar place than a strange, formal one.  The company has 30 offices in 19 different countries. If the lunches are a success, they will duplicate the model across all their locations. Linked also has a newsletter, which features a profile of a monthly boomerang hire (among other recurring features). Maybe home won’t have you back, but—these days—your old boss probably will.

Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, a senior leader within the Islamist militant group, died in the Syrian city, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks potential jihadist activity on the internet. SITE said the news was reported by Amaq Agency, a news operation set up by ISIS in 2014. According to SITE, ISIS announced his death in Arabic and English Tuesday on its channels on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app. More from SITE: In comm on #ISIS spox 'Adnani's death, ISIS threatened revenge with a generation born in ISIS territory & that "loves death more than life" — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 30, 2016 Al-Adnani’s death has not been independently confirmed. The nature of his death is not yet clear. It was Al-Adnani who announced the establishment of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in an audio recording in June 2014. He was considered one of ISIS’s most senior members, and believed to have planned the group’s operations outside of the two countries. He led the terrorist organization’s intelligence unit known as Emni. Rukmini Callimachi, The New York Times reporter known for her coverage of ISIS and terrorism, described Al-Adnani’s role on Twitter after news of his death: 10. But for me, the most detailed confirmation came from the jailhouse interview I was able to do with German member of ISIS Harry Sarfo — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) August 30, 2016 (Read about that interview in Callimachi's story from earlier this month here.) 11. It's Harry who spelled it out for me: Adnani, he said, is head of the Emni, ISIS' secret service. He is also the head of propaganda — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) August 30, 2016 12. He described how Adnani chaired a monthly meeting where ISIS reviewed all the gory videos they had shot and decided which to promote — Rukmini Callimachi (@rcallimachi) August 30, 2016 Al-Adnani was born in Syria in 1977, according to the U.S. State Department. The U.S. government has offered a $5 million reward for his capture.

Twitter previousWilly Wonka, Technology CriticnextDid Facebook Defame Megyn Kelly? Most Popular Presented by Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Marc Burckhardt The Unbelievable Tale of Jesus’s Wife Ariel Sabar A hotly contested, supposedly ancient manuscript suggests Christ was married. But believing its origin story—a real-life Da Vinci Code, involving a Harvard professor, a onetime Florida pornographer, and an escape from East Germany—requires a big leap of faith. On a humid afternoon this past November, I pulled off Interstate 75 into a stretch of Florida pine forest tangled with runaway vines. My GPS was homing in on the house of a man I thought might hold the master key to one of the strangest scholarly mysteries in recent decades: a 1,300-year-old scrap of papyrus that bore the phrase “Jesus said to them, My wife.” The fragment, written in the ancient language of Coptic, had set off shock waves when an eminent Harvard historian of early Christianity, Karen L. King, presented it in September 2012 at a conference in Rome. Never before had an ancient manuscript alluded to Jesus’s being married. The papyrus’s lines were incomplete, but they seemed to describe a dialogue between Jesus and the apostles over whether his “wife”—possibly Mary Magdalene—was “worthy” of discipleship. Its main point, King argued, was that “women who are wives and mothers can be Jesus’s disciples.” She thought the passage likely figured into ancient debates over whether “marriage or celibacy [was] the ideal mode of Christian life” and, ultimately, whether a person could be both sexual and holy. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro The War on Stupid People David H. Freedman American society increasingly mistakes intelligence for human worth. As recently as the 1950s, possessing only middling intelligence was not likely to severely limit your life’s trajectory. IQ wasn’t a big factor in whom you married, where you lived, or what others thought of you. The qualifications for a good job, whether on an assembly line or behind a desk, mostly revolved around integrity, work ethic, and a knack for getting along—bosses didn’t routinely expect college degrees, much less ask to see SAT scores. As one account of the era put it, hiring decisions were “based on a candidate having a critical skill or two and on soft factors such as eagerness, appearance, family background, and physical characteristics.” The 2010s, in contrast, are a terrible time to not be brainy. Those who consider themselves bright openly mock others for being less so. Even in this age of rampant concern over microaggressions and victimization, we maintain open season on the nonsmart. People who’d swerve off a cliff rather than use a pejorative for race, religion, physical appearance, or disability are all too happy to drop the s‑bomb: Indeed, degrading others for being “stupid” has become nearly automatic in all forms of disagreement. Continue Reading NBC Seth Meyers Proves He's the Anti-Fallon David Sims The Late Night host ripped into Donald Trump’s history with the birther movement, just days after his NBC colleague’s softball interview with the candidate. When Jimmy Fallon talked to Donald Trump on The Tonight Show last week, he ruffled the presidential candidate’s hair. Seth Meyers, the host of Fallon’s former show Late Night, had a slightly different message for the Republican presidential candidate last night. “Obama was born in the United States, period?” he asked mockingly, repeating Trump’s recent specious assertion that he was no longer a believer in the “birther” movement. “Fuck you, exclamation point!” Sadly, Meyers couldn’t say this to Trump’s face—in fact, until last week, the late-night host had jokingly banned the candidate from appearing on the show as a response to Trump’s ban of The Washington Post from his press events. He recently lifted that ban after Trump did the same, but joked to The Huffington Post that Late Night was “pretty booked up” on guests from now through November. But even if he were invited, it’s hard to imagine Trump appearing on Meyers’s show, which has become an appreciable counterbalance to the much more light-hearted antics of his hair-ruffling network partner. Continue Reading Olaf Blecker The Binge Breaker Bianca Bosker Tristan Harris believes Silicon Valley is addicting us to our phones. He’s determined to make it stop. On a recent evening in San Francisco, Tristan Harris, a former product philosopher at Google, took a name tag from a man in pajamas called “Honey Bear” and wrote down his pseudonym for the night: “Presence.” Harris had just arrived at Unplug SF, a “digital detox experiment” held in honor of the National Day of Unplugging, and the organizers had banned real names. Also outlawed: clocks, “w-talk” (work talk), and “WMDs” (the planners’ loaded shorthand for wireless mobile devices). Harris, a slight 32-year-old with copper hair and a tidy beard, surrendered his iPhone, a device he considers so addictive that he’s called it “a slot machine in my pocket.” He keeps the background set to an image of Scrabble tiles spelling out the words face down, a reminder of the device’s optimal position. Continue Reading Sara Wong / The Atlantic No Spanking, No Time-Out, No Problems Olga Khazan A child psychologist argues punishment is a waste of time when trying to eliminate problem behavior. Try this instead. Say you have a problem child. If it’s a toddler, maybe he smacks his siblings. Or she refuses to put on her shoes as the clock ticks down to your morning meeting at work. If it’s a teenager, maybe he peppers you with obscenities during your all-too-frequent arguments. The answer is to punish them, right? Not so, says Alan Kazdin, director of the Yale Parenting Center. Punishment might make you feel better, but it won’t change the kid’s behavior. Instead, he advocates for a radical technique in which parents positively reinforce the behavior they do want to see until the negative behavior eventually goes away. As I was reporting my recent series about child abuse, I came to realize that parents fall roughly into three categories. There’s a small number who seem intuitively to do everything perfectly: Moms and dads with chore charts that actually work and snack-sized bags of organic baby carrots at the ready. There’s an even smaller number who are horrifically abusive to their kids. But the biggest chunk by far are parents in the middle. They’re far from abusive, but they aren’t super-parents, either. They’re busy and stressed, so they’re too lenient one day and too harsh the next. They have outdated or no knowledge of child psychology, and they’re scrambling to figure it all out. Continue Reading Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP What Americans Don’t Get About Nordic Countries Anu Partanen When U.S. politicians talk about Scandinavian-style social welfare, they fail to explain the most important aspect of such policies: selfishness. Bernie Sanders is hanging on, still pushing his vision of a Nordic-like socialist utopia for America, and his supporters love him for it. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is chalking up victories by sounding more sensible. “We are not Denmark,” she said in the first Democratic debate, pointing instead to America’s strengths as a land of freedom for entrepreneurs and businesses. Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Sanders’s Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they’d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That’s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too. A Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I’m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I’m told, because they are small, homogeneous “nanny states” where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family. This, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don’t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I’m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good. What this is mostly taken to mean is that Americans will never, ever agree to pay higher taxes to provide universal social services, as the Nordics do. Thus Bernie Sanders, and anyone else in the U.S. who brings up Nordic countries as an example for America, is living in la-la land. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Democrats Have a Religion Problem Emma Green A conversation with Michael Wear, a former Obama White House staffer, about the party’s illiteracy on and hostility toward white evangelicals. There aren’t many people like Michael Wear in today’s Democratic Party. The former director of Barack Obama’s 2012 faith-outreach efforts is a theologically conservative evangelical Christian. He is opposed to both abortion and same-sex marriage, although he would argue that those are primarily theological positions, and other issues, including poverty and immigration, are also important to his faith. During his time working for Obama, Wear was often alone in many of his views, he writes in his new book, Reclaiming Hope. He helped with faith-outreach strategies for Obama’s 2008 campaign, but was surprised when some state-level officials decided not to pursue this kind of engagement: “Sometimes—as I came to understand the more I worked in politics—a person’s reaction to religious ideas is not ideological at all, but personal,” he writes. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters 'He Was the Nationalist Candidate' Emma Green The editor of First Things on Donald Trump and the limits of multi-cultural democracy As Donald Trump prepares to take office, R.R. Reno of First Things is feeling “guardedly optimistic.” The editor of the conservative, religious magazine cautiously supported the Republican’s candidacy. Reno does not believe Trump will fix what he sees as America’s frayed social contract. But he does think the incoming president will disrupt the current political system, which he considers deeply flawed. I spoke with Reno about his outlook for the coming administration. We discussed Reno’s reasons for supporting Trump (“I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for [Trump’s] policies,” he said); the alt-right (a kind of performance art, he argues); and how Christian principles should influence policy (“Americans are uniquely tempted to imagine that we are a church … This is one of the reasons why we’re such a dangerous country,” he said). At its center, though, our conversation was about the possibilities and limits of multi-cultural democracy—what makes a nation, and what’s happening to visions of a global, open-borders world. Continue Reading Mitch Dumke / Reuters The Dangerous Myth That Hillary Clinton Ignored the Working Class Derek Thompson To many white Trump voters, the problem wasn’t her economic stance, but the larger vision—a multi-ethnic social democracy—that it was a part of. Perhaps the clearest takeaway from the November election for many liberals is that Hillary Clinton lost because she ignored the working class. In the days after her shocking loss, Democrats complained that Clinton had no jobs agenda. A widely shared essay in The Nation blamed Clinton's "neoliberalism" for abandoning the voters who swung the election. “I come from the white working class,” Bernie Sanders said on CBS This Morning, “and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to where I came from.” But here is the troubling reality for civically minded liberals looking to justify their preferred strategies: Hillary Clinton talked about the working class, middle class jobs, and the dignity of work constantly. And she still lost. Continue Reading How to Turn Anxiety Into Excitement Jeremy Raff and Olga Khazan It takes three words.

Submit   Land Rover in Japan has started to take bookings for the 2017 Discovery Sport, and the new model will cost between 5,100,000 Yen (Rs 33.42 lakh) and 7,230,000 Yen (Rs 47.37 lakh). Land Rover begins taking orders for the 2017 Discovery Sport in Japan The 2017 Discovery Sport will sport ‘InControl Touch Pro’, an infotainment system that uses a high end Intel quad-core chip, graphics processor and a quick Solid State Drive (SSD). It is connected to a 10.2-inch screen that pinches, zooms and swipes.

No Matter your age, investing experience, investing temperament or income level, there are a number of investment options that are right for you. I recently wrote a piece discussing a few of my favorite Exchange Traded Funds geared for all investors. Most investors should buy a few of the ETF's I mentioned in the piece or ETF's similar in nature and be set. But, after writing that piece, I began to think about how different age groups have different interests and different goals with their money and may want to further diversify their holdings based on their personal preferences. So with that in mind, today we will be talking about three ETF's that investors in their 20's would be interested in. But before we get any further, everyone should remember the ETF's mentioned in the previous piece should still make-up a portion of your investment able assets, simply due to their stability and diversity. Unlike any generation before them, anyone in their 20's has literally grown up with technology being a huge part of their lives. With that in mind, the first ETF I propose is the Vanguard Information Technology Index ETF (PACF:VGT). The VGT tracks a market cap-weight index of different technology companies. Currently, 99.91% of VGT's assets are in U.S. based technology companies. VGT has over 47% of its assets in Software and IT Services stocks, 16% in Computers, Phones and Hardware stocks, 12% in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment stocks, and another 11% in communications and networking stocks. The funds top five largest holdings follows; Apple (AAPL) at 12.48%, Alphabet (GOOG) at 9.97%, Microsoft (MSFT) at 9.02%, Facebook (FB) at 6.15%, and Intel (INTC) at 3.63%. But, despite the large concentration in its top ten holdings (representing 56% of the fund's assets), VGT still holds 377 tech stocks, giving investors exposure to a very wide range of stocks, including tons of small and micro-cap plays. VGT is also very large with over $9.41 billion in assets under management, a very low expense ratio of 0.10%, a dividend yield of 1.86%, and easily tradable with a three-month average trading volume of 348,000 shares per day. Lastly, VGT has shown strong performance with its year-to-date return of 8.6%, one-year return of 18.8%, the five-year return of more than 107% and the ten-year return of 138%. Sticking to what the 20 somethings know, the next ETF built for them focuses on an industry they probably know better than any other age group, social media. The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of social media companies. SOCL is currently the only ETF that strictly invests in social media stocks. The ETF only consists of 30 stocks, with the top five consisting of, LinkedIn (LNKD), Tencent Holdings, Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), and NetEase (NTES) and the top ten making up 69% of the portfolio. SOCL has only been in existence since November of 2011, but since that time it has performed very well. Year-to-date it is up more than 18.7%, the one-year return is nearly 38%, and since inception, it is up more than 85.5%. SOCL's expense ratio is a bit high at 0.65% and has a current price to earnings ratio of more than 180, making it a little too risky for most age groups. But, with the long time horizon 20-year-olds have to invest, they can take on more risk than say a 60-year-old. Plus if we take the advice of Peter Lynch and invest in what you know, this seems like the perfect play for anyone in their 20's and is even slightly like their peers and is addicted to social media. Lastly, with the world growing smaller day-by-day, 20-year-olds need some exposure to international companies, but just not any international market. While Brazil and India may be great investment locations in another few years, China currently offers the best risk-reward option. Furthermore, sticking to the technology revolution currently taking place the Guggenheim China Technology ETF (PACF:CQQQ) is my last pick. The CQQQ tracks a broad array of Chinese technology companies consisting of 69 stocks. The bulk of CQQQ's assets currently sit in the Software and IT Services sector but has exposure to the computers, phones, and hardware sector as well as other electronics, renewable energy, semiconductors, and communications and networking to name a few. CQQQ's top holdings consist of Tencent Holdings, Alibaba (BABA), NetEase, Qihoo 360 (QIHU), AAC Technologies, and Lenovo. CQQQ has been around since December 2009 and has another high expense ratio of 0.7%, but since the fund invests in international stocks, the price is reasonable. CQQQ also pays a dividend yield of 1.82% which makes up for the higher expense ratio and has performed well over the last few years; up 9.2% year-to-date, 39% over the last 12 months, and 63% over the last five years. No matter what anyone tells you or how little extra cash you have lying around, now is the time for 20-year-olds to start investing. Buying any of the ETF's mentioned above or just a regular S&P 500 index fund is an easy, cost-effective way to get your feet wet in the market while keeping your research to a minimum. Not in your 20's and want to know which ETF's fit your age group? Check back soon as I continue to go through the wide array of ETF's and pick three that make sense for each age group.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google holds Project Tango Workshop for more devs, creative people By Rei Padla - August 30, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So much has been said about Project Tango since the concept was introduced more than two years ago as an experimental smartphone with 3D mapping. As early as 2014, we’ve seen working videos and a teardown by iFixit. Developer units soon started shipping and we were told it was moving closer to reality. We’ve been waiting for the commercial launch last 2015. So far, we know Project Tango Tablet Development Kits were opened to all, hoping more developers would join the bandwagon. The same dev kits arrived in Canada and South Korea almost a year ago but we haven’t really seen a commercial-ready version. We’ve featured a few already but the closest is the Lenovo PHAB2 Pro and that one from Intel. We have a lot more to learn about the Tango and we’re actually looking forward to more augmented reality experience with it. In an effort to further introduce the technology and program, the Tango team held a 3-day developer workshop for those who want to learn more. The devs were able to impart how others can use the technology to tell more stories with their mobile devices. The event were widely participated not only by developers but also by producers, indie filmmakers, and creatives. The many results of the workshop include new app prototypes that have the potential to become big and really useful. Google developers noted some of the more significant projects from Google’s Mobile Vision Team, Line, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. Line worked on bringing 3D characters to life while the Google team brought music to life by allowing people point their devices at different objects for visualization of vibrations. The Wall Street Journal worked on a prototype app called ViewPoint while The New York Times made 3D models of areas were certain events took place. These are only samples. We’re looking forward to more similar apps that will fully take advantage of augmented reality.

Donald Trump finally fundraises in Silicon Valley Posted Aug 30, 2016 by Kate Conger (@kateconger) 0 SHARES Next Story Velocity raises $22.5M Series B to build ‘Uber for Experiences’ Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump had a slow fundraising start in Silicon Valley. In the June lead-up to the final state primaries, Trump had raised very few dollars in the region that’s typically lucrative for political contenders. A TechCrunch analysis of Federal Election Commission data found that Trump had only raised a paltry $30,556 from donors in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and even Peter Thiel, one of Trump’s most vocal supporters in tech, has declined to financially back his campaign. But the tide is turning for Trump as the general election draws near. Last night, private equity CEO Saul Fox of Fox, Paine & Co. hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his home in Woodside, a wealthy neighborhood near the headquarters of Google, Facebook and other major companies. It’s not quite a sign that Trump has finally cracked the seal on Silicon Valley — private equity investors aren’t as involved in the tech scene as their venture capital counterparts — but the $25,000-per-person dinner is Trump’s first successful fundraising effort in the Bay Area. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich planned a fundraiser for Trump in May, but cancelled the event after facing backlash. (Krzanich is known for his efforts to diversify the tech workforce, a position widely perceived to be at odds with Trump’s stance on immigration.) Fox, a frequent donor to conservative candidates and causes, began donating to Trump’s campaign recently when it became apparent that Trump would become the Republican Party’s nominee. During the primary season, Fox backed Trump opponents Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. He also made donations to Lawrence Lessig, the Creative Commons founder and internet pioneer who ran a short-lived presidential campaign last fall. But on June 7, the day of the California presidential primary, Fox’s loyalties appear to have shifted: He gave $25,000 to the Trump campaign and an additional $19,600 to the Republican National Committee, according to FEC data. RNC spokesperson Lindsey Walters confirmed that last night’s Fox fundraiser would benefit Trump’s campaign and the RNC in a statement to Politico, which first reported on the fundraiser. Although Fox is an active donor, he seems to have drifted away from investing over the last decade. His company, Fox Paine & Co., raised its last fund in 2001 and its portfolio lists primarily exits, not new investments. TechCrunch contacted Fox for comment on the fundraiser and will update if he responds. Trump’s fundraiser follows several weeks of fundraising in the area by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has had more success pulling donations from Silicon Valley. Clinton’s most recent trip to California may have earned her campaign as much as $18 million, according to Politico.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Missy Ryan and Greg Miller August 30, 2016 Follow @missy_ryan Follow @gregpmiller The Islamic State said one of its longest-serving and most prominent leaders, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, has been killed in Syria. (Reuters) The Islamic State reported the death of its chief spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, on Tuesday, potentially signaling the loss of a senior militant who has steered the group’s campaign to bring violent operations to the West. The Pentagon said that Adnani, a Syrian national among the militant group’s most experienced and well-connected figures, had been the target of an airstrike near the Syrian city of al-Bab, but officials said it was too early to be certain he had been killed. If confirmed, Adnani’s death would damage the Islamic State in two areas that have made the terrorist organization particularly dangerous: its sophisticated use of social media to reach a global audience and its willingness to employ the crudest forms of violence in scattered plots outside Iraq and Syria. It would be a significant loss at a time when the group is already fending off attacks from Western-backed forces on the ground and a two-year air campaign that has deprived it of territory and resources. In a tweet, the Amaq news agency, the Islamic State’s media arm, said Adnani was killed while inspecting troops in Aleppo, Syria. It did not say exactly when, where or how Adnani died. Aleppo is the name of the northern Syrian city that has been the site of years of fierce battles, and also of the province surrounding it. BREAKING: #ISIS 'Amaq reported that ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-'Adnani was killed in #Aleppo pic.twitter.com/br7YslGPPL — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 30, 2016 Hours later, the Pentagon confirmed that it had launched a “precision strike” against Adnani in northern Aleppo province. “We are still assessing the results of the strike, but Al-Adnani’s removal from the battlefield would mark another significant blow” to the Islamic State, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement. Adnani’s death has been rumored several times before. Even after announcing Adnani’s death, Amaq boasted of the group’s resilience. “The blood of the sheikhs will only make it more firm on the path of jihad and determination to take revenge and assault,” the agency said in a statement on Telegram, according to a statement from the SITE Intelligence Group. Born Taha Sobhi Falaha, Adnani was among a core group of Islamic State operatives who could claim direct ties to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian extremist who launched the organization then known as al-Qaeda in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003. An image taken in 2013 from a video uploaded on YouTube in 2012 of Abu Muhammad al-Adnani. (AFP/YouTube/AFP/Getty Images) “He was their most prolific and public spokesman,” said Will McCants, a former State Department official and expert on the Islamic State. “The war of words between al-Qaeda and ISIS, the justification for war on the West — that was all Adnani’s doing.” While little is known about the structure and organization of the Islamic State’s cell responsible for plotting external attacks, U.S. officials and counterterrorism experts said that Adnani played an important role in identifying recruits from Europe and elsewhere who could be groomed and sent back to carry out attacks. He was also responsible for essentially rescinding the call for foreign recruits as the Islamic State began to lose territory in Syria and Iraq amid a barrage of U.S. and allied airstrikes. Like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, Adnani is believed to have been held in U.S. military custody in Iraq roughly a decade ago, only to be released. He then helped the organization survive near-extinction to reemerge later as the Islamic State. Because of his Syrian nationality, Adnani was relied on by al-Qaeda to help the organization establish a foothold in Syria as the country fell into civil war. But Adnani later helped orchestrate the Iraq-based affiliate’s split from al-Qaeda, a rupture that led to the formation of the Islamic State and its rapid emergence as a terrorist group with more followers and violent capacity than its parent organization had amassed in years. In statements announcing Adnani’s death, the Islamic State described him as a descendant of the tribe and family of the prophet Muhammad, a clue that Adnani was possibly being groomed as a replacement for Baghdadi if the ISIS leader were to be killed, McCants said. In a steady stream of audio messages, Adnani both set and articulated the organization’s violent agenda, repeatedly emphasizing the priority of targeting the West. During the recent Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a recording attributed to Adnani called for a “month of conquest and jihad. Get prepared, be ready … to make it a month of calamity everywhere for the non-believers … especially for the fighters and supporters of the caliphate in Europe and America.” Adnani was a vocal presence in calling for sympathizers to carry out terrorist attacks around the world. In an article in Dabiq, the Islamic State’s English-language magazine, he specifically urged lone-wolf attacks against Western targets using any means available. “If you are not able to find a bomb or a bullet, then smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,” he wrote. It’s not clear exactly what effect those exhortations had on supporters outside Iraq and Syria or whether they had a role in recent terrorist attacks such as the truck assault in Nice, France, in mid-July. If Adnani has been killed, it was not immediately clear what operational impact his death might have on the Islamic State. The U.S. military claims to have killed 45,000 militants, including a number of senior leaders, in air and long-range rocket attacks since its campaign began in 2014. But the group continues to control two of the largest cities in Iraq and Syria and has vowed to resort to guerrilla attacks. He was also a principal architect of a vast propaganda apparatus that produced thousands of videos — ranging from gruesome recordings of beheadings to the tourism-bureau-style depictions of bustling markets — that helped draw thousands of foreign fighters to the Islamic State’s ranks in Iraq and Syria. Because of his influential role in promoting the group’s vision, Adnani was a target of U.S. and allied military operations. He is believed to have been targeted in an American airstrike last year but survived.

To commemorate this achievement, Microsoft has released some new details about this game which include a special something from the Halo franchise as well as the Forza Horizon 3 PC system requirements. Recommended Forza Horizon 3 PC system requirements include a 3.6GHz Intel Core i7 3820 processor with 12GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 970 or Nvidia GTX 1060, AMD R9 290X or AMD RX 480 graphics card, 55GB of hard drive space, Windows Anniversary Edition 64-bit 14393.101 and DirectX 12. PC players will have access to a tremendous amount of adjustment options to fine-tune their experience. Basic options include full screen, vertical sync, and resolution while advanced options include quality settings for motion blur, mirrors, reflection, static and dynamic geometry. Microsoft has also released the full list of Forza Horizon 3 achievements on its website. There’s a ton to do in this game so players will have plenty of fun trying to bag all of these trophies while playing the game. The special something from the Halo franchise happens to be the Warthog vehicle that is playable in Forza Horizon 3. However, the Warthog won’t be open to all players, there’s a catch you need to understand before you are able to take it for a spin in Forza Horizon 3. Forza Horizon 3 is due to be released for Xbox One and PC on September 27th. It’s compatible with Xbox Play Anywhere which means that if you buy it on Xbox One you can play it on PC as well for free.

Shrinking technology nodes at lower product costs plus the rise of compute-intensive IOT applications help Menta’s e-FPGA outlook. By John Blyler, IP Systems   The following are edited portions of my video interview the Design Automation Conference (DAC) 2016 with Menta’s business development director, Yoan Dupret. – JB John Blyler's interview with Yoan Dupret from Menta Blyler: You’re technology enables designers to include an FPGA almost anywhere on a System-on-Chip (SOC). How is your approach unique from others that purport to do the same thing? Dupret: Our technology enables placement of an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) onto a silicon ASIC, which is why we call it an embedded FPGA (e-FPGA). How are we different from others? First, let me explain why others have failed in the past while we are succeeding now. In the past, the time just wasn’t right. Further, the cost of developing the SOC was still too high. Today, all of those challenges are changing. This has been confirmed by our customers and from GSA studies that explain the importance of having some programmable logic inside an ASIC. Now, the time is right. We have spent the last few years focusing on research and development (R&D) to strengthen our tools, architectures and to build out competencies. Toolwise, we have a more robust and easier to use GUI and our architecture has gone through several changes from the first generation. Our approach uses standard cell-based ASICs so we are not disruptive to the EDA too flow of our customers. Our hard IP just plugs into the regular chip design flow using all of the classical techniques for CMOS design. Naturally, we support testing with standard scan chain tests and impressive test coverage. We believe our FPGA performance is better than the competitions in terms of numbers of lookup tables per of area, of frequencies, and low power consumption. Blyler:  Are you targeting a specific area for these embedded FPGAs, e.g., IOT? Dupret: IOT is one of the markets we are looking at but it is not the only one. Why? That’s because the embedded FPGA fabric can actually go anywhere you have RTL, which is intensively parallel programming based (see Figure 1). For example, we are working on a cryptographic algorithms inside the e-FPGA for IOT applications. We have tractions on the filters for digital radios (IIR and FLIR filters), which is another IOT application. Further, we have customers in the industrial and automotive audio and image processing space Figure 1: SOC architecture with e-FPGA core, which is programmed after the tape-out. (Courtesy of Menta) Do you remember when Intel bought Altera, a large FPGA company? This acquisition was, in part, for Intel’s High Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Now they have several big FPGAs from Altera just next to very high frequency processing cores. But there is another way to do achieve this level of HPC. For example, a design could consists of a very big parallel intensive HPC architecture with a lot of lower frequency CPUs and next to each of these CPUs you could have an e-FPGa. Blyler: At DAC this year, there are a number of companies from France. Is there something going on there? Will it become the next Silicon Valley? Dupret: Yes, that is true. There are quite some companies doing EDA. Others are doing IP, some of which are well known. For example, Dolphin, is based in Grenoble and it is also part of the ecosystem there. Blyler: That’s great to see. Thank you, Yoan.

BROUGHT TO YOU BY Winners Announced for the SAP HANA Innovation Award Watch this video recap of the SAP HANA Innovation Award Ceremony. Winners include Mercy, Lenovo, Vodafone, and Stanford Medical School. Get ready to share your #HANAStory in 2017. By Christine Donato for ÜberTech | August 30, 2016 -- 15:31 GMT (08:31 PDT) | Topic: SAP Were you at SAPPHIRE NOW 2016? I was there live at the SAP HANA Innovation Award Ceremony to speak with the judges, finalists, and winners. The event, sponsored by Intel, was larger than ever this year with almost all 12 finalists and 15 honorable mentions in attendance. As judge John Applebee told me, "There were over 130 entries. It's massive." Massive indeed. This year, 130 different SAP HANA customers shared their fascinating examples of the power that lies within real time in-memory computing. Analytics Wizard: Mercy Mercy Hospital analyzed supplies to save $13 million dollars across multiple procedures. The organization improved operating room block utilization (the case minutes as a proportion of total blocked minutes assigned to a surgeon) by 12%. Additionally, the organization eliminated an auto-transfusion device from a number of cases, saving unnecessary process and cost without negatively impacting the procedure's outcome. The biggest long-term value of the applications they developed is the ability to use evidence-based medicine to create personalized care paths and predictive models to strengthen preventative medicine. Digital Trailblazer: Vodafone Leveraging the SAP Margin Assurance solution powered by SAP HANA has enabled Vodafone to obtain a granular view of customer profitability and provide fast detailed analytical capabilities in order to deliver significant value to the business. Vodafone is now able to identify tens of millions of previously unidentified revenue leakage points. Process Simplifier: Lenovo Lenovo contracted with SAP to help complete the IBM X86 server acquisition and replace the legacy IBM supply chain networks. In so doing, they initiated a project to enable X86 manufacturing capability and built an E2E supply chain IT platform in Lenovo's existing PC plants in the US, Mexico, and China. Next Generation Application: Stanford Medical School Stanford Medical School is combining clinical, wearable, and genomics data to create the medical record of the future. The organization is enabling a greater understanding of the gene/variant connection to disease. Stanford is using clinical data from EMRs as a filter to prioritize genetic variants in the patient. Stanford is also making it easy for clinicians to consume and navigate genomic data to provide decision support for diagnosis and treatment. Keep an eye out for the 2017 Awards.

It wont be long until the SSD is close to the platter drive in pricing. 2 Agree coolcolors MyCE Resident Posted on: 31 Aug 16 05:00 Now and wait and see game.... 1 Agree tmc8080 MyCE Resident Posted on: 03 Sep 16 16:27 Wow, a whole 2 terabytes for about the price of an ENTIRE PC... With 2tb hdd's in the $60 price range that still doesn't bring prices much below the 10:1 ratio we've seen before. For some big news to happen, let's see it drop to $250 first. 0 Agree vroom Administrator and Reviewer Posted on: 04 Sep 16 06:20 $550 is an excellent price for a 2TB SSD, prices have gone down. OK you want probably replacing all the spinning drives that hold or your movies, but yuo can have more than enough space at a very reasonable drive, and way better performance that any spinning drive. Prices will eventually drop to 250, but for now you can get an 1TB SSD for 250, so there should not be any reason not to go with an SSD, unless you really need +2TB of storage. 0 Agree coolcolors MyCE Resident Posted on: 04 Sep 16 14:04 Quote: Originally Posted by vroom $550 is an excellent price for a 2TB SSD, prices have gone down.

This is a fallacy to think they can't at this point in time can make more to lower the prices. SSD has been out for some time now and say they can't make more to as tech moves at lightning speed is being unrepresentative to MILK all the money they can before they lower the prices. That is how I am seeing it now-the tech is there it's just to MILK and MILK then when 2018 rolls around say now there is enough supply we can lessen the prices. SSD it replaceing HDD 2.5/3.5 that is the trend to think they don't know that is more or less MILKING the price to fill their coffers. 0 Agree vroom Administrator and Reviewer Posted on: 04 Sep 16 17:03 I dont say that they technology isn't there, I am saying that at this point the prices are very good. You are not wrong on the "milking" part, and as much as I dont like it, its a fact that most of the time, if not all the time, all manufacturer will ask you for more money and give you a little extra, a fine example on this is Intel. Over that last couple of years there wasn't any serious update (for me)to go from z77 to z87 up until now with the Z170 chipset, this is how all manufacturers work and i dont think that any of them is willing to change this practice in the near future. So giving us fast and large drives at very low prices is something that will take some time, and 99% sure that it will be a very slow process. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

Keep an eye on Berlin. While IFA isn't the show it used to be, the annual gathering is still the biggest industry event in the ‘run-up’ to Christmas. ADVERTISEMENT Here’s WIRED’s guide to what will be making headlines (in alphabetical order). Apple won’t be in Berlin. It never is. But Apple is holding its own press event in San Francisco on September 7. Proceedings kick off at 1700 GMT. The iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 could both be unveiled. Read more Hands-on with Hasselblad's True Zoom Moto Mod camera Hands-on with Hasselblad's True Zoom Moto Mod camera By James Temperton Asus is preparing for a "Zenvolution", which will likely see it launch a new Zen-branded smartwatch and/or an Intel-powered Zen-branded phone. HTC, having just launched the latest HTC 10 phones, is unlikely to announce anything new and the company hasn’t scheduled a press conference. Huawei is holding a press conference on September 1 at which it will announce a new smartphone. No details, but the press blurb says it will “defy expectations” LG, helpfully, has already announced what it will be announcing at IFA: 21:9 aspect monitors.. Motorola is now owned by Lenovo. Both companies will announce a range of laptops, tablets and phones at a press conference on August 31. Samsung has a press conference on 31 August (you may have noticed a trend), although the South Korean firm has already shown the majority of its hand: both the new Gear VR and Note 7 were announced earlier in August. The Samsung Gear S3 is the best bet for Berlin. ADVERTISEMENT Sony has just launched the Xperia X (the successor to the Xperia Z5) so it isn’t clear what the big news will be at the company’s IFA press conference in September. A high-end smartphone has been rumoured, but Sony has previously used IFA to announce everything from a new Walkman to a short-throw 4K projector. This year’s invite sent to press features pictures of pretty much everything Sony makes. Expect lots of smaller announcements. It isn’t all about big new smartphones. The joy of IFA is the unexpected and smaller announcements. WIRED will be traipsing the crowded halls of Messe Berlin this week to find the real gems and must-have tech.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Tata Consultancy Services today announced that it has developed an innovative digital solution along with General Electric to revolutionise gas turbine manufacturing which could save significant time and costs in the manufacturing process. The digital solution will analyse temperature at various points on the metal turbine parts as they are assembled and cooled, allowing operators to know when the next operation can be performed, reducing wait time between operations and improving quality monitoring. The pilot application was built and deployed for GE Power's gas turbine manufacturing plant in Greenville, South Carolina. During the turbine manufacturing process, rotor stacking is a key process and needs extremely high levels of precision. If the rotor wheels are stacked incorrectly due to differences in the surface temperature, it will require reassembly, incurring heavy additional costs and two to three weeks of shipment delays. TCS' new digital solution provides automatic data collection of ambient room and rotor surface temperatures, measuring for unacceptable variations, notifying workers when the next operation may proceed, and alerting workers to any non-uniformity. This application is built on the intelligent LED platform by GE and Intel that can reduce costs and energy consumption and provide data collection and analytics capabilities. This platform is integrated with sensors that monitor temperature, humidity and any physical object presence, transmitting the data to an Intel Atom-based gateway where the information is streamed to the Predix cloud. "The TCS solution will enable significant cost and time savings in the rotor stacking process ' and is one example of what can be built on the Predix platform," said Denzil Samuels, Head of Global Channels and Alliances, GE Digital. Anupam Singhal, Vice President, Tata Consultancy Services said, "TCS teaming up with GE and Intel on this innovative solution will deliver the benefits of Industrial IoT in bringing certainty in complex manufacturing operations. This will also be a valuable addition to TCS Digital Store and GE's Predix ecosystem.

Technavio's research study segments the global semiconductor packaging equipment market into the following regions: Segmentation by region 2020 (% share) APAC 72.07% North America 22.36% Europe 5.57% Source: Technavio APAC: largest semiconductor packaging equipment market APAC dominates the global semiconductor packaging equipment market due to the presence of numerous major foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, United Microelectronics, Samsung, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International. It is also home to major OSATs such as ASE and STATS ChipPAC. These manufacturers are investing heavily to revamp their production lines, which is creating demand for production equipment in the market. The utilization of semiconductor devices is the largest in APAC due to the presence of leading consumer electronics manufacturers such as Samsung, Sony, LG, Toshiba, and Panasonic. Moreover, major global companies such as Apple and HP also have their production facilities in the region. The consumer electronic device market is likely to grow significantly during the forecast period, propelling the growth of the global semiconductor market. This will trigger the demand for semiconductor manufacturing and processing equipment such as semiconductor packaging equipment in APAC. Ask for a sample of this report: http://goo.gl/7ZKuaE Semiconductor packaging equipment market in North America The US is the base for a couple of major semiconductor manufacturers such as GlobalFoundries and Intel. This is expected to drive the demand for packaging equipment in the region. For instance, Intel is constructing a new fab facility in the US, creating demand for manufacturing equipment. Moreover, a few major car and flat-panel display manufacturers present in the region will create demand for semiconductor devices. Further, the high adoption rate of communication devices such as smartphones and phablets will boost the production of semiconductor devices, creating the need for semiconductor packaging systems in the region. Semiconductor packaging equipment market in Europe The semiconductor packaging equipment market in Europe was valued at USD 64.09 million in 2015. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.69% during the forecast period to generate revenue of USD 88.61 million by 2020. The growth rate of the market in Europe is low compared to other regional segments, due to the presence of a lower number of semiconductor foundries and semiconductor IC manufacturers. Further, the low concentration of electronic device manufacturers in the region reduces the need for semiconductor devices, and consequently for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Moreover, the Brexit crisis in the EU will force many manufacturers to shift their foundries to APAC or outsource their packaging facilities to APAC-based OSATs, due to the availability of cheaper resources. The top vendors in the global semiconductor packaging equipment market highlighted in the report are: Applied Materials ASM Pacific Technology Kulicke Soffa Industries Tokyo Electron TOKYO SEIMITSU Browse Related Reports: Global 3D Semiconductor Packaging Market 2016-2020 Global Semiconductor Packaging Materials Market 2016-2020 Global Packaging Robots Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

Aug 30, 2016, 10:25 ET Share this article NEW YORK and MUMBAI, India, Aug. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), (BSE: 532540, NSE: TCS) a leading global IT services, consulting and business solutions organization, today announced that it has developed an innovative digital solution to connect Intelligent LEDs, to GE's Predix operating system for the Industrial Internet through Intel® Atom™-based gateways, providing critical analytics to save significant time and costs in the manufacturing process. The digital solution will analyze temperature at various points on the metal turbine parts as they are assembled and cooled, allowing operators to know when the next operation can be performed, reducing wait time between operations and improving quality monitoring. The pilot application was built and deployed for GE Power's gas turbine manufacturing plant in Greenville, South Carolina. During the turbine manufacturing process, rotor stacking is a key process and needs extremely high levels of precision. If the rotor wheels are stacked incorrectly due to differences in the surface temperature, it will require reassembly, incurring heavy additional costs and two to three weeks of shipment delays. TCS' new digital solution provides automatic data collection of ambient room and rotor surface temperatures, measuring for unacceptable variations, notifying workers when the next operation may proceed, and alerting workers to any non-uniformity. This application is built on the intelligent LED platform by GE and Intel that can reduce costs and energy consumption and provide data collection and analytics capabilities. This platform is composed of smart LED fixtures from Current, powered by GE, integrated with sensors that monitor temperature, humidity and any physical object presence, transmitting the data to an Intel® Atom™-based gateway where the information is streamed to the Predix cloud. "The TCS solution will enable significant cost and time savings in the rotor stacking process – and is one example of what can be built on the Predix platform," said Denzil Samuels, Head of Global Channels and Alliances, GE Digital. "This demonstrates the power of three industry leaders leveraging their respective best-in-class capabilities to transform the manufacturing industry." "TCS teaming up with GE and Intel on this innovative solution will deliver the benefits of Industrial IoT in bringing certainty in complex manufacturing operations. This will also be a valuable addition to TCS Digital Store and GE's Predix ecosystem," said Anupam Singhal, Vice President, Tata Consultancy Services. As part of the GE Digital Alliance Program, TCS has made significant investments in scaling its Predix practice, having more than 550 of a planned 1,000 consultants already trained with hands-on execution experience across designing, architecting and conceptualizing solutions on the Predix platform. Predix helps industrial businesses with their digital transformation using software, apps and analytics that enable them to operate faster, smarter and more efficiently.

Intel’s offices in Petah Tikva: Intel Israel accounts for a fifth of the country’s high-tech exports.. (photo credit:REUTERS) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Intel on Tuesday debuted the 7th generation of its core processor chips, which will be included in millions of laptops, tablets, desktop computers and other tech products, and were developed largely in the company’s R&D center in Haifa. “The Israeli team did it again,” said Intel Israel’s head of R&D Ran Senderovitz. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. “I think this is one of the great points of pride for Israeli technology,” he added, noting that the chip will be sold to millions of users around the world. Rather than settling for efficiency increases of 3 percent to 4%, Senderovitz said, the team at Intel Israel redesigned the entire architecture of the Core i3, i5 and i7 chips, which resulted in a 12% increase in productivity performance. The newest chips still will be produced at the 14-nanometer scale – the equivalent of cutting a human hair in half 18 times, said Senderovitz. Intel is building an upgraded facility in Kiryat Gat that is widely believed to be a 10- nanometer manufacturing facility. The chips, he added, would boost graphic processing in an age where virtual reality, 360-degree video and high-quality ultra-HD video are increasingly common. They would allow people to, more smoothly, take virtual tours, participate in multi-person video games and video calls, and process 4K resolution videos. They also would increase regular web browsing speeds 19% over the previous generation of chip. Lower power usage also means better performance for 2-in-1 computers, tablets and mobile devices. The new chips, which will be marked with labels identifying them as 7th generation, are expected to be included in products beginning in September. Relevant to your professional network?

According to Chipzilla, the first wave of the new Cores will appear in 10mm-thick notebooks and two-in-one convertible tablets aimed at small businesses and normal folk. The CPUs will consume 4.5W to 15W, depending on the model, and go on sale in more than 100 laptop designs by the end-of-year shopping rush. They'll include Intel's usual integrated HD Graphics chipset. Come January, enterprise PCs, workstations and beefier notebooks and desktop systems will ship with the chips, some with Intel's Iris graphics chipset. Presumably that's when you'll be able to get your hands on individual processors to build you own rigs by hand. The processors are powered by the 14nm Kaby Lake microarchitecture. This is the Skylake microarchitecture – as used in 2015's 14nm sixth-generation Core family – with some tweaks and optimizations. Intel inserted Kaby Lake into its lineup after its tick-tock product cycle missed a beat. Usually, Intel shrinks a microarchitecture to a new process size and ships it (that's the tick), and later rolls out a new microarchitecture using that process size (that's the tock). There's a 12 to 18-month gap between the ticks and tocks. The latest tock was the introduction of Skylake on 14nm. The next tick was going to be Cannonlake, aka Skylake on 10nm, but that was delayed to 2017 because Intel couldn't perfect the shrink in time. So in the meantime, we've been lumped with Kaby Lake, an optimized Skylake redux on 14nm. (Intel has now given up on the tick-tock approach, for what it's worth.) What do we mean by optimized? Well, for one thing, better physical manufacturing techniques. Intel says it has improved the fin design and the channel strain in its FinFETs. The shape of the fin has a massive effect on the operation of the transistor, potentially reducing the leakage current significantly. Increasing the strain in the channel increases performance and lowers power consumption by cutting the atomic forces that interfere with electron flow. Intel's seventh-generation dual-core die with builtin GPU ... Click to enlarge any pics According to Intel, these fabrication improvements from Skylake to Kaby Lake, plus some CPU enhancements, give seventh-generation Cores up to a 12 per cent performance boost over the sixth-generation – well, when running the SYSmark benchmark on a seventh-gen 15W 3.5GHz Core i7 7500U versus a sixth-gen 15W 3.1GHz Core i7 6500U. When running the WebXPRT benchmark on the same chips, the performance boost from Skylake to Kaby Lake can reach up to 19 per cent, we're told. Generation debate ... How 2015 and 2016's Cores compare (Source: Intel) So in other words, changing up from a 2015 Core i7 to the equivalent 2016 part can speed up web browsing by up to a fifth, in theory. Chipzilla also says its seventh-generation Cores are more power friendly when streaming vids: the new Core i7 7500U can play 4K VP9 video for seven hours on a 66Whr battery that a sixth-gen Core i7 6500U chomps through in just four hours when streaming the same material. That's generation on generation, though. These figures are only of use to snarks like us who want to see what Intel engineers have achieved in the past year, and for geeks who upgrade their machines every 12 months. Intel really hopes Kaby Lake prizes punters off their 2011-era PCs; anyone tempted to replace their computer will be blown away by the improvements in the past five years and crack out their credit card. At least, that's the dream. "Most people who are going to buy a new PC are not buying to replace last year's – well, maybe we wish they were but they are not, they are replacing devices that are five or more years old," said Intel spokeswoman Karen Regis. "There are 400 million users who are using PCs that are five or more years old." Intel reckons today's seventh-gen Core i5 7200U is 70 per cent faster than its five-year-old Core i5 2467M equivalent in SYSmark benchmarks, can convert a 4K video to 1080p H.264 6.8 times faster, and score three times better in the 3Dmark gaming benchmark. More information on the individual chips, and their speeds and feeds, will appear, as always, on Intel's ARK closer to launch. Finally, there's an addition to Kaby Lake: a new media-processing engine. This performs VP9 and 10-bit HEVC/H.265 decoding in hardware, as well as the usual 1080p HEVC, to reduce power usage even when viewing high-res video – meaning more internet streaming before your battery runs out. Intel calls this "All Day 4K" where "all day" means "nine and a half hours." Highly technical ... Basic outline of the new media engine Kaby Lake chips are able to decode up to eight 4Kp30 AVC and HEVC streams at a time – useful for signs and surveillance gear – and decode 4Kp60 HEVC at up to 120Mbps, which is handy for watching high-quality films and TV on the internet. This video engine also enforces anti-piracy DRM protections as required by the major studios. Hollywood bosses didn't want to stream 4K ultra high-def content from online clouds without mechanisms in place to thwart casual rippers, and so Intel gave the entertainment giants what they wanted. "There are hardware-based protection mechanisms to make the studios comfortable with sharing high-quality content to PCs for the first time," said Regis. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 48 Comments More from The Register Not two, not four, but 10 cores in Intel's new PC powerhouse Perfect for the gamer with money to burn 27 Comments Intel keeps droning on, as PC sales continue to tumble Plans later, but for now here’s $60m, Yuneec 13 Comments Fujitsu seeks PC exit, finds willing buyer in Lenovo But can they fund the deal? 13 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

And there’s a real life study to prove it. Not just an imaginary study I did in my head and told my boss about. In his new book ‘Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations’, best-selling author Dan Ariely explains how he carried out an exercise in motivation with employees at an Intel factory in Israel.  This is why you should always order the largest pizza Over the space of a week, every morning workers received one of three emails, promising a different reward if they completed their workload for the day (they assembled computer chips so their output could be easily measured). The three different rewards offered: A small cash bonus (approx £22) A thank you from the big boss A voucher for free pizza A fourth group, the ‘control’ group, didn’t receive any email with an offer of a reward. On the first day of the study, pizza proved to be the biggest motivator, with productivity levels 6.7% higher than those in the control group, while the promise of a compliment increased productivity by 6.6%. The cash bonus increased productivity by 4.9%. Over the week, however, compliments proved to be the biggest overall motivator, while the cash bonus actually made workers 6.5% less productive than the control group. Ariely’s findings back up previous studies that have suggested that, while financial incentives are always welcome and remuneration is key when accepting a position, staff are more motivated by a simple ‘thanks’, day-to-day. For example, in 2011, the London School of Economics published a review of more than 50 studies about workplace motivation, which concluded that people worked harder when they felt their efforts were being appreciated by their colleagues and bosses. The report also found ‘overwhelming evidence’ that the offer of financial incentives ‘may reduce an employee’s natural inclination to complete a task and derive pleasure from doing so.’ Adam Grant, a professor of psychology who has spent years studying motivation in the workplace, agrees. ‘A sense of appreciation is the single most sustainable motivator at work,’ he says. The second, of course, being free pizza. *Accidentally forwards to all managers*.

Women account for 55 percent of the undergraduate student population, nearly 51 percent of the workforce, and are still making around 79 percent of what their male counterparts’ earn. Gender equality, particularly when it comes to pay parity, has been an ongoing struggle in the U.S., and now, companies in one key sector have signed on to tackle this issue head on. Recently, 29 more companies joined the White House’s Equal Pay Pledge, promising to do their part to close the gender pay gap. Among these companies were big names like Apple, Facebook, Dropbox, IBM, Intel, LinkedIn, MailChimp, and Microsoft. These companies join the first 28 companies that signed the pledge back in June when President Obama first launched the initiative — included in the first round were other tech heavy hitters, like Airbnb, Amazon, Cisco, Jet.com, Pinterest, and Spotify. As part of the pledge, participating companies have agreed to conduct an annual company-wide gender pay analysis, review hiring and promotion processes to reduce unconscious bias and barriers, include equal pay efforts into other equity initiatives, and identify and promote best practices to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. Related: Women of NASA minifigures reaches milestone of 10,000 supporters And given that the tech sector still suffers from a distinct lack of women in its workforce (despite a number of internal initiatives to boost these numbers), this pledge comes at quite a strategic time. “Equal work deserves equal pay,” Apple said in a statement alongside its pledge. “This past year, Apple looked at the total compensation for U.S. employees and closed the gaps we found.” Facebook echoed these sentiments in a statement of its own, noting, “At Facebook we value those who bring varying perspectives, for many reasons including background, community, culture, race, ethnicity — and gender. We call this cognitive diversity, and we want more of it. It propels our mission: to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Shall Have Exhilarating Features to Make it a Cut Above the Rest, Latest Rumors Say! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: August 31, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» After the huge success of the Surface Pro 4 following its launch in October last year, the Redmondian company is said to be in the thick of development of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Rumors have it that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall have exhilarating features to make it a cut above the rest in the increasingly competitive hybrid laptop-tablet market although the American tech company has yet to confirm any of the speculations about the device. One of the most prominent rumored features of the Surface Pro 5 is that the device shall come out in two display variants – a 4K resolution ultra-high definition (UHD) display and a 2K resolution screen. In addition, the device shall have a better Surface Pen to go with it. These features are already improvements over its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4. Another very interesting rumored feature of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is that it shall have a 16GB of RAM, which is quite generous and groundbreaking in its class, and 1TB of internal storage, with an option to further expand via a microSD card slot. It shall also have the USB Type-C port which has become a standard in most modern gadgets today. There are also reports saying that the device shall have Intel’s new processor under its hood called the Kaby Lake. The combination laptop and tablet from Microsoft shall also be running on Windows 10 Professional Redstone 2, the American company’s upcoming desktop operating system, and that the device shall make it to the market in the spring of next year, details the University Herald. Leaving no stones unturned According to sources privy to the goings on in Microsoft, the American tech company is reportedly leaving no stones unturned in ensuring that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall be better than its competitors when it comes out next year. Microsoft is reportedly positioning the device to go up against the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro, which is rumored to be released by the American tech giant next month along with the latest iPhones. The Redmondian company is also looking at the Apple iPad Pro as a major competitor in the segment which has certainly given its Surface Pro 4 a run for the consumer’s money when both devices hit the market in the fourth quarter of 2015. Incidentally, the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall feature an Intel’s sixth generation Skylake processor under the hood, which is reported to double the efficiency of the device as well as improve the performance and battery life, details the Science World Report. The new Apple laptop shall reportedly come out already running on the MacOS Sierra desktop operating system. In terms of resolution, the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall apparently have the advantage over the upcoming Microsoft Surface Pro 5 as it shall come out with a 5K display and a superb 5120 x 2880 screen resolution. Other excellent features As a hybrid laptop and tablet, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall also feature a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera and an 8-megapixel front camera. It shall also have a Thunderbolt 3 hardware. The device is expected to house either an AMD or NVIDIA Pascal GPU to support its processor, which is another best-in-class feature for the device. In terms of pricing, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is reported to have a retail price of $899 for its base model and can go as high as $1,599 for its high-end variant. Comparatively, the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro is speculated to come out soon with a price tag of anywhere from $1,299 to $1,499 which make the average price of the two devices pretty even. While Microsoft could have launched the Surface Pro 5 in October this year, marking the one-year market cycle of the Surface Pro 4, the American tech company apparently wanted to clear any issues concerning the device’s performance.

The Core i7-7700K looks like it might feature 8MB of L3 cache, and of course - HyperThreading technology.   We can expect a refreshed Z270 chipset that will co-exist with the current Z170 platform, meaning that LGA1151-based boards might support the new Kaby Lake processors with a simple BIOS update.   As for the performance of the Core i7-7700K, we're looking at just under 10% more performance over the older Skylake-based Core i7-6700K. The Core i7-7700K scores 151.94 FOPS in SiSoft SANDRA's "Processor Arithmetic" performance, while the older Core i7-6700K scores 140.88 GOPS. Comparing its "Processor Multimedia" score, the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K is capable of 379.8 Mpix/s, while the Core i7-6700K scores 353.8 Mpix/s.   Is the upgrade to the Core i7-7700K worth it for existing Core i7-6700K owners? Probably not, unless there are some changes that we don't know about in the upcoming Z270 chipset.

At the same time, it also seems that this is the smallest RC to date, the biggest new feature being a fix for an Intel Skylake power management bug. However, there are also the usual updated drivers, arch improvements, and some KVM changes. Now that we’re able to take the fourth Release Candidate build of the Linux 4.8 kernel for a test drive on our PCs, its development cycle will continue, and next week, we will get our hands on the RC5 milestone. After that, there should be only two RCs left, RC6 and RC7, until the final Linux kernel 4.8 release hits the streets, which should happen at the end of September.

Sam Mattera (TMFMattera) Aug 29, 2016 at 6:53PM Image source: Getty. It's been a great year to be an AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholder. The chipmaker's stock has risen nearly 170% year to date, strongly outperforming almost all of its peers and the broader market. With the year more than halfway over, let's take a quick look back at some of AMD's best moves to date. Aggressively pursuing the budget GPU market In June, AMD unveiled three new graphics processors: the RX 480, RX 470, and RX 460. All three are aimed at buyers on a budget, retailing for between $100 and $200. The flagship RX 480 is particularly notable, as it's able to power high-end virtual reality headsets, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Almost half of AMD's 2016 rally has come in the wake of these new GPUs. The market for virtual reality headsets is projected to surge in the years ahead. Research firm IDC believes that nearly 65 million VR headsets will ship in 2020, up from fewer than 10 million this year. AMD remains a secondary player in the market for GPUs, but along with rival NVIDIA, holds a duopoly over the space. Investors appear to like AMD's prospects, as the RX 480 could help it court consumers unwilling to pay for NVIDIA's more expensive silicon. Retaining its lead in game consoles About 60% of AMD's sales come from its enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment. The bulk of that revenue is directly attributable to AMD's video games business. AMD's chips power all current-generation video game consoles, including the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In the past, video game console-makers released new systems every five to six years. However, the industry appears to be in the midst of a major shift, with more incremental hardware releases occurring more often. That could benefit AMD's semi-custom business in the years ahead. Earlier this year, AMD confirmed that it had won the rights to three major new devices. One of those devices is Project Scorpio, an upgraded version of the Xbox One console set to ship in the fall of 2017. Another is likely the PlayStation 4 Neo, an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4 confirmed to exist, but not yet detailed. The PlayStation 4 Neo is likely to be formally unveiled next month. It will probably sport an AMD chip. Setting expectations for Zen In addition to GPUs and chips for video game consoles, AMD has a significant CPU business. Unfortunately, its CPUs haven't been particularly competitive in recent years. Rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) dominates the market, particularly at the high end -- if you purchase a PC that retails for more than $600, there's a good chance it will be powered by an Intel chip. But AMD could reemerge as a viable market participant as early as next year. AMD has been hyping its forthcoming "Zen" processor since 2015, but offered more concrete details this year. "I'm excited to report that, in addition to conducting the first public demonstration of our next generation Zen-based processor at Computex in June, priority server customer sampling began in the quarter, and dual socket server platforms are now running at both our labs and our customers' labs," said AMD CEO Lisa Su on the company's July earnings call. Earlier this month, AMD demonstrated its forthcoming Summit Ridge -- a processor aimed at high-performance desktop PCs and slated to arrive in the first quarter next year. Details remain scant, but Summit Ridge appears to offer performance on par with Intel's i7 6900K, one of the company's top desktop processors. For AMD, 2016 has been about the future AMD's business improved in 2016. Last quarter, AMD reported adjusted operating income, up from a loss in the same quarter last year. But the gain was slight, and AMD remains unprofitable under generally accepted accounting principles. At the same time, its sales have risen only modestly, up 9% on an annual basis last quarter. The bulk of AMD's share price appreciation appears to have been driven by investors' hopes for a brighter future. With Zen on the horizon and interest in VR heating up, AMD could see meaningfully improved financials in the years ahead, justifying its stock's rapid rise.

Privacy Policy Tech companies have been upping their efforts lately to boost the low numbers of women in their ranks. Massive grants aimed at high-tech scholarships for girls and students of color. Longer parental leave perks for new moms and dads. Even benefits that pay for women who want to delay childbearing to freeze their eggs. Now a growing number of both large and small tech companies are borrowing an idea from Wall Street banks: The "returnship," which brings in mid-career women (and men) who've taken time out of the workplace to care for family, offering them a path back to the office. On Tuesday, a nonprofit called Path Forward announced that six San Francisco-based tech companies, including domain registrar GoDaddy, customer service software maker Zendesk and grocery delivery outfit Instacart, will offer 18-week internships for about 20 mid-career professionals starting in October. While the program is open to men who have spent at least two years out of the workplace as a caregiver, it is expected to be filled largely by women. It is aimed at helping interns confront the stigma they face about time away. Also tech companies get a chance to improve their reputation as places that too many women leave. "If you're wanting more women at the senior level, this is a way to jump-start that," said Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward. Forman said there's been enough interest from other companies that she plans to start two to three more groups of these untraditional interns (who, yes, are paid) in several cities early next year, each with six to 10 tech companies. The nonprofit was spun out of the New York-based email software firm Return Path, which started its own mid-career internship program last year — Forman is a former marketing vice president there — and now helps bring that program, which includes training and networking opportunities for the group of interns to other tech companies. BSO hosts gun safety classes for kids county-wide On a Monday night in Tamarac, Sgt. Robert Chenoweth, a gun safety instructor with Broward Sheriff’s Office Special Operations Group, taught about a dozen kids, ages 6 the 4-steps to gun safety: stop, don’t touch, leave the area, and tell an adult. On a Monday night in Tamarac, Sgt. Robert Chenoweth, a gun safety instructor with Broward Sheriff’s Office Special Operations Group, taught about a dozen kids, ages 6 the 4-steps to gun safety: stop, don’t touch, leave the area, and tell an adult. See more videos Path Forward's announcement follows another recent effort by seven technology and engineering companies — including IBM, Intel and General Motors — to run internships designed for women who've taken time away. The programs at these companies began this year and are part of an effort launched by the Society for Women Engineers and iRelaunch, a "career reentry firm" that runs a conference on returning to work sponsored by finance companies that have similar programs, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The latter firm kicked off the trend back in 2008 and even trademarked the phrase "returnship." Carol Fishman Cohen, iReLaunch's CEO, said her conference acts as something of a recruiting hub for those existing programs, and "it occurred to us we should take the concept to another sector." She approached the Society of Women Engineers to establish a task force last year that would try and "replicate what we saw in financial services." In tech, she says, "there's a lack of women at every level of the organization and they're looking for more ways to hire more of them and fill that pipeline." Cohen said men are eligible to apply, but most applicants for the established programs have tended to be women in their 40s or even 50s who've left the workforce to be a caregiver. Some tech companies have long offered flexible leave policies or extended sabbaticals that help their own employees return after a break. But these newer mid-career internships, says Laura Sherbin, director of research for the think tank Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), offer certain advantages. For one, it exposes employers to outside talent. And in an industry like tech, where the pace of change is faster and more disruptive than in others, the low-risk bet on hiring an intern for 12 or 18 weeks can help erase the bias many managers have about people whose resumes have glaring holes on them. "There's a huge stigma to time off in the tech industry," Sherbin said. "There's a perception that tech passes us by even on a maternity leave, and if you've had time out of the workforce you're hugely behind. Tie that in with the bias you do see about tech workers who have a little bit of gray hair," and it's an industry particularly primed for managers who might look past candidates — even skilled ones — who have been out of the workforce. Steven Aldrich, chief product officer of GoDaddy, said that's one thing that attracted his company to the idea. "The company has a chance to try the employee, in a way, and see their fit with the company, and it's a win for the working parent coming back into the workforce to come in and get experience," he said. "Those things are really challenging [when someone] comes straight back in." The tech industry is also trying to plug an especially leaky pipeline. According to 2008 data from the CTI, 52 percent of women with experience in the science, engineering or tech fields chose to leave their fields over time. Another 2013 study, meanwhile, compared women in multiple professions and found that after the first 12 years of their careers, 50 percent of women in science, engineering and tech were working in other occupations, while only about 20 percent of the other women switched industries over their entire careers. Running internships for returning parents could also help send a message to younger workers. With these programs, Cohen says, "what companies are signaling to their youngest employees and the people in their 20s is that they understand that employees may take a career break — and we want to welcome you back." If hiring rates are any test, such "returnships" appear successful. At Goldman Sachs, almost half of the 150 people who have gone through its program since 2008 were hired for full-time jobs; Cohen says that hire rates tend to be between 50 and 90 percent in established programs, and at the high end of that range for the tech firms so far. A spokeswoman for PayPal, which ran a program for nine interns in the U.S. called "Recharge," with the help of Forman's group earlier this year, said that seven of the nine were offered jobs. And all six of the "Tech Re-Entry" interns working in analytics at IBM this spring, who had been out of the workforce for anywhere from two to 10 years, were recommended for full-time employment. Five have accepted jobs and the sixth is currently in final interviews at the technology giant. "We're increasingly looking for creative ways to bring women back to the workforce who we know are incredibly competitive," said Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, IBM's chief diversity officer. She said the company is looking to expand the program. Still, while success rates for participants tend to be high, the effect such programs will have on moving the needle — either for the number of mid-career women in tech or the number of parents wanting to get back to work after child-rearing — could be limited. For one, the programs tend to be relatively small. Several of the pilot programs included internships for just a handful of people — GoDaddy is hiring three interns, and there were nine in the first group at PayPal — and iRelaunch's Cohen says existing programs tend to number 20 or 30 interns a year. Meanwhile, the programs are largely limited to fields where job demand is already strong, such as tech and finance, and do little to help those trying to get back to work in struggling industries or those with an abundant supply of workers looking for jobs. Forman said she's heard of an effort to do a "returnship"-style program in the advertising field, but it didn't take off. "The problem with that industry and industries like it is there's 10 people lined up for every job," she said. And in those industries where they could help bring in a few more women, warns CTI's Sherbin, hiring them only goes so far. Even programs that hire every mid-career intern they bring in won't make much progress on diversity if they don't also work to improve "bro" cultures that are hostile or toxic to anyone who's different. "You may get them in," she says, "but they're going to be very very short hires. Diversity for the sake of having butts in seats doesn't do us all that much good."

NEW BEDFORD, Mass.—On the fifth floor of a former newspaper building in this old port city on Massachusetts' southern coast, Chris Rezendes and his colleagues are working hard to bring the benefits of the internet of things to smaller businesses. Rezendes (pictured) and the others at INEX Advisors' IoT Impact Labs are working with a growing group of sponsors—including, Dell, GE, Intel and Analog Devices—as well as state and federal agencies to bring together startups that are making sensors and other IoT devices and small and midsize businesses around Southeastern New England not only to improve operations at these sites but also to use them as proof points for other organizations around the world. INEX essentially works with both the supply and demand sides of the IoT equation. Rezendes and others sort through hundreds of pitches from tech startups with interesting technologies to determine which ones to embrace, helping to hone their business plans and technologies, while at the same time talking with various organizations in the region—from fisheries groups and city officials to agricultural, brewery and winery associations—to fuel interest in using sensors, wireless connectivity and other IoT technologies to capture, store and analyze data that can enable them to better run their operations. A key is getting into these sites and installing the instruments and technologies to make it all work, Rezendes said. There is a lot of talk about how technology—such as remote sensors in satellite images—can more easily get people closer to places to find out what's going on in huge swaths of land or in the vast oceans, but for the IoT to work for most businesses, they need "boots on the ground," he said. "You need to go out in the physical world." That's where he and others were during a recent tour of three sites in New Bedford and the neighboring town of Dartmouth that are among a number of pilot programs INEX is running in which IoT technologies are being used. Rezendes and Jason Shepherd, director of IoT strategy and partnerships at Dell, headed a tour of a winery, nursery and New Bedford Harbor to show journalists and analysts—as well as actor Adrian Grenier of "Entourage" fame who also is Dell's social good advocate—how these technologies are being used, and the benefits being drawn from them. The IoT is really all about the data, and the sensors and other technologies are there to help collect, store and analyze the data so that businesses can more easily digest it and quickly develop action plans from it. They can use the data to help drive down costs while increasing revenues and profits, Rezendes said. Instrumentation can lead to a lot of benefits, he said. In New Bedford Harbor, home to the country's top fishing port based on value of the catch, INEX has installed sensors and a Dell Edge Gateway 5000 outfitted with technology from partner V5 Systems at the Palmer's Island Lighthouse—near the opening of the hurricane barrier, through which the fishing fleet and other boats enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean—that send back video feeds to the New Bedford Harbor Development Commission. Rezendes and Shepherd also said there were plans in development to use sensors and the Dell Gateways in buildings where boats offload their catches, to detect chemical, biological, nuclear and other threats, and to be used on boats in place of humans who monitor the catches, which can costs companies as much as $850 a day per person. Rezendes noted that putting sensors and other technologies on fishing boats could collect huge amounts of data on everything from the health of the fishing stock to the temperatures of the oceans. "Every boat is essentially a data center," he said. At the 130-acre Salt Creek Vineyard in South Dartmouth, INEX has installed sensors from such companies as Davis Instruments and New Mountain at the top of poles in three fields that act as a weather station, measuring everything from wind speed and direction to sunlight, rainfall and humidity, all information that vineyard workers can use to determine their practices for growing grapes. A pH sensor in a water tank enabled growers to adjust their watering practices and save 10 to 15 percent of the crop. More sensors will be installed in the soil as well as in an old building that's being converted into a new winery at the site. All the sensors will feed the data into a Dell IoT gateway for collection, storage and analysis, with the information being available on client devices through software.   Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next »           LATEST NETWORKING ARTICLES   VMware Obtains Another SDN Option with PLUMgrid Buy Microsoft to Build 'World Graph' IoT Index With TomTom and HERE Google to Deploy Caching Servers in Cuba to Speed Service Delivery Brocade Rolls Out Automated Versions of SLX Switches Verizon to Sell 24 of Its Data Center Sites to Equinix                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Ecumenical News ecunews.com Home U.S. world Church Culture Belief Humanitarian Analysis Lifestyle Pope Francis Christmas message Korean Peninsula Fighting Fake News Middle East Christians Climate Change Jan 02, 2017, Updated at 21:44 PM EST Home Entertainment Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date updates: Device will have the best resolution among Surface Pro models Rachael Marifosque |Wednesday, August 31 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Reuters/Lucy Nicholson)The Surface Pro 5 will reportedly have the best display resolution of the whole Surface line. It has been almost a year since Microsoft released the formidable Surface Pro 4. Consumers are naturally wondering when the device's successor will arrive; and whether the Surface Pro 5 will be able to top it. Speculations about what features the Surface Pro 5 will carry and when it will be unveiled have been numerous. One persistent rumor involves the upcoming device's resolution and it seems consumers will be getting two options — a 2K display and a 4K Ultra HD display. If the rumor turns out to be true, then the Pro 5 will have the best resolution among the other models. The Surface Pro 5 will reportedly also have 16 GB of RAM, USB-C support, an improved Surface Pen, and is said to run on the Windows Redstone 2, which is expected to also be released in the spring of 2017, the same time frame given to the device. Another thing that the Surface Pro 5 will allegedly be getting is a new processor, the vaunted Intel Kaby Lake. Based on the processor's leaks that surfaced recently, the Kaby Lake will probably be 12 percent more efficient than the Skylake processors that the Surface Pro 4 is using. It will have Gen9 graphics and HDMI 2 support as well. This lends further credence to reports that the Pro 5 will be better all around. However, Microsoft hasn't released any statement regarding the Kaby Lake or whether the Surface Pro 5 will be carrying it. Various reports have pointed out that this doesn't bode well for the company as there are supposedly other hybrid devices set to launch this year that will be carrying Intel's new processor. One such device is Asus' Transformer Tablet 3. On a good note, a short delay in the release of the Surface Pro 5 with Kaby Lake would give the company time to really check whether the new processor is compatible with the laptop's software and avoid a fiasco similar to what happened when the Surface Pro 4 was released.

PC-Tablet News Rumors Updates Smartphones Apps Wearables Gaming Accessories Editorials Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date hints 4K Display, 16GB RAM and Intel Kaby Lake CPU By Alice Jane - August 29, 2016 Microsoft is yet to launch Surface Pro 5, but there are reports on the web about the rumors related to the device’s release date, specs, price, and features. The most recent news suggests that the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will bear same qualities with the recently released Asus Transformer 3 Pro. Since Microsoft has not yet announced the specs of Surface Pro 5, consumers are confused whether to wait until October to decide between Surface and Transformer Pro 5. Design On the design front, the upcoming Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will inherit the same qualities and appearance as its previous counterpart. There are rumors that the device will flaunt a tablet body with an optional keyboard, which can be detached from the device. According to unconfirmed reports, the keyboard will be bundled with the keyboard. On the specifications front, the Surface Pro 5 is expected to feature a high-resolution IPS Corning Gorilla Glass protected display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824. Even though the default Surface Pro 5 will include the same display size as the Pro 4, Microsoft is also planning to launch a bigger display variant with an advanced 4K Ultra HD screen with a 3840 x 2160 display resolution, most probably on a 14-inch display. Surface Pro 5 will have 4K Display According to rumors spreading on the web, the upcoming flagship will be released with a bigger display than the currently available Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro 5, meanwhile, will be powered by an Intel Core M processor, up to 16GB RAM, up to 512GB eMMC storage space, accompanied by a high capacity rear camera, most likely 16MP. There are unconfirmed reports that Microsoft could delay the launch of the Surface Pro 5 to wait for the upcoming next-generation AMD graphics processor codenamed Polaris, or NVIDIA’s Pascal. If the reports turn out to be true, then you can expect a dedicated graphics chip with the Surface Pro 5. Surface Pro 5 Specs: 16GB RAM, Intel Core Kaby Lake CPU, NVIDIA GPU? Based on reports, the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will make use of the Intel Kaby Lake to improve the device’s overall performance, since the new processor will take advantage of all the capabilities of Windows 10. In all probability, Microsoft will launch Surface Pro 5 in October. Hence, you can expect to work with the device after the launch of new iPads and MacBooks. As of this writing, we don’t have correct information about the availability and price of Surface Pro 5. We expect Microsoft to release of both the standard and premium variants with a price higher than the currently available Surface Pro 4. Therefore, expect it to set you back around $800 for the baseline model.

Suddenly, torrential rain pours down from dark and ominous clouds. The forest shudders under the deluge, as a group of people trek through the uninhabited mountainous area in silence. When night comes, they meditate, hold concerts or bonfire parties. These were the scenes that entertained tens of millions of viewers worldwide during the Power to Go 2016 live-stream event, which ran from August 16 to 23.  The non-profit Power to Go project aims to help participants find inner peace through trekking and other spirituality-building exercises according to Chen Kun, the project sponsor. Singer-turned-actor Chen started the endeavor in 2011 and now has more than 80 million followers on the microblogging platform Sina Weibo, China's counterpart to Twitter. Over the past five years, Chen and his team have worked their way through west China in areas such as Tibet, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan.  This year, folk musician He Guofeng and 20 volunteers from around the nation joined Chen—also a UNICEF Ambassador in China—to trek through uninhabited areas. The route they took through Sichuan and Tibet had an average altitude of 4,200 meters above sea level.  What set this trek apart from your run-of-the-mill hike in the woods was the use of LeCloud Computing Co. Ltd.'s visual technology on the trip to make the journey accessible to anyone around the world. LeCloud boasted about the event as being "the first ever live-stream from uninhabited areas in Internet history." The trip was filmed through four unique perspectives—from the trekkers' point of view, 360-degree virtual reality (VR) headsets, a bird's-eye view from drones, and live GPS tracking from an all-terrain vehicle. "I just love the live-stream. I really enjoyed viewing the world from different angles," wrote Chuancangyuwan, a Weibo user. "This is the first time I watch a live-stream. Wonderful!" echoed Huixuanran in another Weibo post. "VR should be in every household so that everyone can enjoy it," claimed Wu Yazhou, CEO of LeCloud, while broadcasting the company's real-time stream of the Power To Go trip at the company's annual product release event on August 18 in Beijing. Wearing a black T-shirt, blue jeans, and a pair of sports shoes, the 40-year-old proudly presented his team's cloud services and products to over 2,000 people.  Since 2015, LeCloud, the cloud computing platform of LeEco, has been in partnerships with Microsoft, Zenlayer and Intel to improve and commercialize visual technology including VR live-streaming from the cloud. Founded and headquartered in Beijing by Jia Yueting as LeTV in 2004, but now renamed as LeEco, the company has transformed from being China's counterpart to YouTube to a tech empire with a myriad of businesses. Its latest announcement of a $2-billion acquisition of Vizio, an American TV manufacturer, helped it gain a foothold in the U.S. market following its growing presence in India.  In an interview with Beijing Review, Wu talked about the company's investment in VR and its hopes for the future: "I think VR is a rosy industry with potentially high revenues. We'd like to let partners know that what we are offering now is totally free. We are trying our best to connect the dots and make the industry grow in an ecological way." Visitors play VR tank war at the China International VR Industry Show in Beijing on August 5 (CFP) Weighing in   Of course, LeEco is not the only company to try its hand at the nascent VR industry. The term VR did not attract widespread attention until March 2014 when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company's $2-billion acquisition of a startup pioneer Oculus. Nonetheless, the core concept of VR could be traced back to science fiction novels from the 1930s. Global anticipation for the VR industry has now begun to grow, and Chinese companies have jumped on the bandwagon.   Tencent, which offers instant messaging software QQ and social media app WeChat —amassing active monthly users of 899 million and 806 million respectively—became the first Chinese company to unveil its plan for VR on December 21, 2015. Tencent's strategy focuses on hardware infrastructure and platform building. Their ultimate goal is to integrate its key resources into gaming, video, social networking, live-streaming and maps to create a VR service platform which might be similar to the Android or iOS system for smartphones.   Tencent VR products similar to devices such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Sony PSVR and Samsung Gear VR would hit the market in three phases by 2017, according to the company's plan.    In fact, Tencent's ambitions became apparent through its two-round investment in the California-based AltspaceVR, a social platform for VR technology, in September 2014 and July 2015, respectively. It also showed its hand by forging a deal with ZANADU—dubbed as China's first VR travel studio—in December 2015.  "As a service provider and integrator, we hope we can help set up some criteria and examples for the industry, and make ordinary people have more hands-on VR experiences," said Pony Ma, founder and chairman of Tencent.   LeEco was fast on the heels of Tencent after unveiling its own VR roadmap only two days after the latter's announcement. "The second-generation VR headset, which has over 1,000 optimized programs designed for smartphones, has been shipped since August 9," said Chris Shen, Marketing Manager of LeVR, the VR division under LeEco. Shen told Beijing Review that an all-in-one hardware is scheduled for release in October. LeEco's latest team-up with Nokia demonstrates its confidence in the industry as it attempts to deploy the Finnish company's OZO—an eight-lens VR camera designed for professional content creators.  Since 2016, more Chinese companies including Xiaomi, Alibaba and Huawei have rushed in and stepped up their presence in the VR industry by setting up labs, releasing smartphone-based headsets as well as funding startups.    Baidu, the country's largest search engine, launched its online VR community in May, although founder Robin Li denied rumors that the company would release any VR products within the year.   JD.com, the largest competitor to e-commerce shopping giant Tmall.com, also unleashed a teaser at the first anniversary of its Perception Cognitive Lab press conference in July. Besides presenting its latest apps for facial recognition systems and image searching, the lab also announced that "JD VR is on the way," due to its dramatic 23,498.21-percent growth in VR headset sales during its June shopping festival.  A man tries to learn how to operate a VR system for safety production at the VR Experience Center in Fuzhou, southeast China's Fujian Province, on July 28 (CFP) Game on The global market of the VR industry is expected to hit nearly $6.7 billion this year while the Chinese market could reach 5.56 billion yuan ($855 million), up from 1.54 billion yuan ($237 million) in 2015. These statistics, from the White Paper on Virtual Reality Industry Development issued in April by the China Electronics Standardization Institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, denote a huge amount of potential. The Chinese market is projected to surpass 55 billion yuan ($8.46 billion) by 2020, almost a 10-fold increase from current figures.  However, a shared concern that VR professionals face worldwide is the absence of standardization protocols. In response, the Audio and Video Coding Standard Workgroup of China has initiated a standard-setting process in cooperation with top universities and tech companies, according to the white paper.  China has 656 million people who access the Internet via smartphones. About 74.7 percent of the country's users are aged between 10 and 39, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. It therefore comes as no surprise that targeting youths into casual gaming and 360-degree video is a compelling business strategy for the Chinese VR industry.    "I think that VR becomes more accessible to ordinary people through the mobile end," said Cui Haiqing, a business partner of Baofeng Mojing and producer of China's only VR social networking platform, the Paradise Kingdom.  Cui has a better understanding of China's VR landscape than anyone else. With his 16-year career in gaming, he started to research VR by launching a website named 87870.com in 2013. He posted news, exchanged views with developers, and also shared VR demo games. Unfortunately, few friends and investors supported his idea since VR was a little-known industry at the time.   "I thought the VR industry would boom and had much more room for creativity and development than robotics, so it was worth a try," Cui recalled. "The current situation is far better than it was three years ago. It feels like we are creating a new world rather than running a startup."   Given that all the existing social networking apps are based on Web 2.0 guidelines, a VR social networking platform could, in Cui's eyes, attract users as well as reshape people's lives through virtual experiences.  Cui's team has less than 20 staff members, half of whom have been in the gaming industry for more than 10 years. "Technological experience won't help here because we are all rookies in the VR industry. It is more important to gain experience from solving new problems," Cui asserted.    Their hard work may be paying off. The Paradise Kingdom VR platform was officially launched on October 24, 2015. Besides social networking, it also offers gaming, video and shopping in a VR world. Baofeng Mojing, the hardware that the Paradise Kingdom runs on, releases new products every four months. Today, the Paradise Kingdom has over 80,000 registered users, a number of which are aged between 16 and 20, and spend an average of 25 minutes per day on the site.  VR film is Baofeng Mojing's next goal. According to Cui, the company would fund projects in partnership with the Beijing Film Academy.  "Previously, we talked too much about technology designed to avoid nausea and motion sickness. What really matters to users is the experience. The VR industry itself is an innovation, and that's why developers and startups like us could seize opportunities," Cui stated.   Qiu Jiaqiu, Director of Caixin Video, could not agree more on this. "The spirit of VR technology is in line with the goal of documentary filming—to seek objectivity and truth," he said. "VR journalism needs to focus on the pitch itself—can it evoke interest and empathy among audiences?"   Qiu and his team shot China's first ever VR documentary titled Kindergarten in Mountain Villages in 2015 in partnership with the United Nations and the China Development Research Foundation. It explored relationships among left-behind children, their migrant worker parents and volunteer teachers, and also discussed the challenges faced by different groups during the urbanization process. So far, Qiu's team has produced some 40 VR works, covering topics such as environmental protection, e-commerce, and lifestyle.  "The storytelling approach is totally different from traditional video reporting. We are trying to present subjects that relate to China in an innovative way with VR technology. And technology aside, we are eager to produce more quality VR content in partnership with media counterparts around the world to have our voice heard," Qiu told Beijing Review.  Experience matters   Immersion and interaction are the two features that best describe what VR offers. But despite the technology's appeal, the price tag remains a large obstacle for widespread adoption. The lowest price, for instance, of an HTC Vive headset is set at 7,888 yuan ($1,195), targeting high-end consumers. In this regard, experience centers—analogous to Internet cafes—are widely considered as an ideal medium for mass VR adoption. Therefore, HTC has opened 50 experience centers across the country, with a focus on second-tier cities alongside metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai.   "To be honest, I shut my eyes the first time I used it because I was too scared to look around," Zeng Xiao, 20, a college student from Kramay, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, told Beijing Review after trying a roller-coaster VR game at the China Wantong VR Experience Center.  Opened in May this year, the center, dubbed as the country's largest VR experience center, covers an area of 3,000 square meters in the compound surrounding the Beijing National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest. It has 17 games spanning from skiing, shooting, car racing to aviation, skydiving and space walking. Each game costs 60 yuan ($9) to try, though a discount package is available for two or three games.   "I think it is fun to try VR games. But I don't think I would buy hardware such as a headset at a lower price. Experience and quality are my priorities," Zeng said.  Currently, there are more than 10 VR experience centers in Beijing alone. The figure could hit 3,000 to 4,000 nationwide by the end of this year.   Scan the QR Code for a video related to the article    Copyedited by Bryan Michael Galvan  Comments to chenran@bjreview.com Related: • Bubble or Bud? • LeCloud CEO on Virtual Reality in China • Virtual Reality on the Fast Track • The Internet Age About Us    |    Contact Us    |    Advertise with Us    |    Subscribe Partners: ChinAfrica   |   China.org.cn   |   China Today   |   China Pictorial   |   People's Daily Online   |   Women of China   |   Xinhua News Agency   |   China Daily CCTV   |   China Tibet Online   |   China Radio International   |   Beijing Today   |   gb times   |   China Job.com   |   Eastday   |   CCN Copyright Beijing Review All rights reserved 京ICP备08005356号 京公网安备110102005860号 SHARE Twitter Facebook Google+ WeChat Weibo Email Print Chinese Dictionary:

Raspberry Pi Zero Will Likely Be Supported On Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 29 August 2016 at 07:00 PM EDT. Add A Comment It's looking like the Raspberry Pi Zero might be playing fine out-of-the-box with the upcoming Linux 4.9 kernel cycle. Eric Anholt posted his weekly VC4 driver status/changes. In there the Intel-turned-Broadcom developer commented, "Finally, I landed Stefan Wahren's Raspberry Pi Zero devicetree for upstream. If nothing goes wrong, the Zero should be supported in 4.9." Thus right now the Pi Zero DeviceTree file is in place for supporting the board alongside the BCM2835 Raspberry Pi A+ / B. The DT for it isn't too remarkable but just a "minified version" of the Raspberry Pi Model A+ while not having a power LED and inverting the activity LED. Great to see the Raspberry Pi Zero finally approaching a happy state on the mainline Linux kernel... When it comes to the open-source VC4 graphics driver stack for the Pi devices, Eric Anholt made various fixes to the driver over the past week. Eric also sent in a drm-vc4-next pull request for Linux 4.9 with a reduction in CPU and memory overhead for 3D rendering along with interlaced vblank timing.

For almost two years, that sole motherboard has been the only integrated solution – since then, ASUS launched the Maximus VIII Assembly which comes with a single port add-in card, and we saw a micro-ATX C236 model with a single port from MSI at Computex. We also listed the X99-E-10G WS from ASUS, a new board set to come to the market and we had an early sample. We’re still testing the board, but ASUS is officially announcing it today. The X99-E-10G WS is built like a brick outhouse, with the focus on premium workstation parts and the latest set of features ASUS could put together while still under the X99 chipset banner, rather than a Xeon chipset. The board is designed for any Broadwell-E CPU, either consumer i7 or Xeon E5 v4, with extensive heatsink arrangements to carry both the Intel X550-AT2 controller (11W), the chipset, the upgraded power delivery and additional controllers. The main feature is obviously the 10GBase-T ports, which are RJ45 compatible with most home and SMB networks. The X550-T2 controller is a PCIe 3.0 x4 part, which is an upgrade over the older X540-T2 generation that needed PCIe 2.0 x8 (and even at PCIe 3.0, you still needed 8 lanes due to controller limitations). This controller has a list price on Intel’s ARK of $80 for batches of 1000, however it probably adds nearer $100-$150 to the motherboard cost paid for by the end user. Alongside the Ethernet ports are a pair of 10 Gbps USB 3.1 ports (one Type-C), four USB 3.0 ports and the audio. The board has full support for PCIe graphics, using dual PLX8747s as high-end PCIe switches. This allows support of x16/x16/x16/x16 slots (or x16/x8/x8/x8/x8/x8/x8) while also having enough bandwidth for the X550-T2 controller, a U.2 connector running at PCIe 3.0 x4 as well as an M.2 slot also at PCIe 3.0 x4. The PCIe slots have two additional features, with integrated guard rails in each of the slots to increase rigidity and reduce RMAs, but also the PCIe latches are translucent. When the system is turned on, the main PCIe slot connectors have a LED light that implements a slow breathing effect. Speaking with the motherboard product managers, it turns out that users do not often know which PCIe slots are suitable for maximum bandwidth, and this is designed to help. The ASUS X99-E-10G WS also comes with 10 SATA 6 Gbps ports, dual USB 3.0 onboard headers, Dr. Power, BIOS Flashback, EZ XMP and an upgraded audio solution. ASUS expects the board to land with an MSRP of $650 with select authorized resellers and distributors soon.

For whatever reason the manual wasn't available when I checked just now - it could be that I'm directed to the UK page and something isn't synchronizing right?

Reply zepi - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link I have one question in mind: How is that we've had 10Gbps Thunderbolt ports and 5Gbps USB3.0 ports using copper wiring for aoens in our cheap consumer grade battery powered tiny little Chinese built devices, but we don't get 10GbE ports even in relatively expensive mid-range motherboards? Is it really just the difficulty of driving the electric load (impedances / inducatances) of 100M cable at needed frequencies (250 / 500MHz frequencies) instead of 1-5meters that is reasonable spec for Thunderbolt 2.0 / USB3 cables? Because otherwise I don't really understand what is the problem in modulating voltage to 2-4 pins of RJ45 connector?

Reply ddriver - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link That's hardly a merit. If it was, then everyone outta have a sports car, or better off - a helicopter, because when you are in a hurry, a regular car is easily the bottleneck. 10 gibt network - that's already too slow, on the odd chances you copy "a file" (let's say data) from one pci-e ssd to another pci-e ssd. Or what if you wanted to copy data from ram to another system's ram? Big data transfers are a rarity in consumer usage, but are common in enterprise, which is the market which merits 10gbit and more. For 99.9% of what consumers do 99.9% of the time, 1gbit suffices. 10gbit internet?

This has some people up in arms, and it’s been a kerfuffle the likes we haven’t seen since, oh, Apple decided to delete the floppy drive from the iMac. It’s even bigger than the kerfuffle over Apple’s decision to remove the DVD drive from the laptops! Horrors! Or removable batteries in the laptops and phones. Horrors! And you can see just how wrong Apple was in both of those decisions… And that’s kind of my point. I could mention some more, such as, oh, the transition from PowerPC to Intel. Or the transition from ADB to USB. Or SCSI to Firewire. Or… Or… And each one has a similar set of reactions: initial outrage, a period of time (typically from about 6 months to 18 months) where there are pain points for us as we have to shift to the new technology bits and bobs, and then a realization that the new reality isn’t that bad. Except for the small but noisy group that will never get over it and wants everyone to know that. Although it’s been a while since I’ve heard anyone make that argument over the floppy drive; I expect they all died off of old age… But.. battery life! Yes, we can argue battery life endlessly, and yes, it can be a problem, but to me, it’s also a solved problem. If you need it, you can add a battery case to your phone. If you (I’m in this category) need it occasionally, buy a battery block and carry it in your bag or purse — I use this RAVpower and love it, and I hate the idea of adding weight to the phone to increase battery life unless I absolutely have to. People forget this is a physics problem: battery is heavy, and it’s clear Apple believes weight is a key feature (or problem) for the desirability of the device and so it makes the tradeoffs to keep the weight light. I for one am really happy with the result. And that’s really a forgotten aspect of Apple’s product design: It’s not about giving a product every capability to solve every problem, but to make sure it solves the problems most people have, and allowing for optional solutions for the outliers. Long battery life is an outlier for most iPhone users, so why force them to carry the weight or pay for the components they don’t need? Apple gets that. And for those that do need it, good options exist. How does Apple justify removing the port? One of the things I’ve been mulling over is how Apple is going to justify removing the port? Why is the phone better off without it? Jason’s article on this did a great job of covering why this matters and why Apple needs to explain why this change is happening, and I’ve got some thoughts about that… First, how many users use the port? Think about how usage breaks down: Users using the supplied earbuds Users using bluetooth headsets or speakers Users using the built-in speaker Users using headphones or speakers via the headphone jack What’s the mix of these? I couldn’t find concrete data, but we can make some intelligent guesses. You see Apple’s earbuds everywhere: a large percentage of users seem to be quite happy with them (I don’t know why, I find them incredibly uncomfortable, but they’re free). This implies that if/when Apple releases the new iPhone they’ll likely release it with earbuds that work without the headphone jack, and that will solve the problem for these people. What percentage of users is this? 30%? 40%? People who listen via the built-in speakers don’t care. People who listen via some bluetooth device also don’t care. How many of these are there? Marco Arment on one of his podcasts made a comment that his analytics show that as many as half of the listens going through Overcast are to bluetooth devices (or perhaps bluetooth/speaker; I couldn’t find it to verify). So I expect a major point from Apple will be that for most of us, the speaker jack is already unnecessary. What percentage is that? My guess is it’s around 70%, but it’s pretty clear that well over half of the audio emitted by an iPhone is already handled without using the jack, or will be with the new Earbuds in the box with the iPhone 7. But what’s the advantage to do this? One reason would be improved water resistance. Big steps were made with the iPhone 6s although Apple never formally acknowledged that, and removing this jack would be one more way to make the device water safe. Another advantage to removing the jack is that the jack is a huge percentage of phone failures: it’s a great way to mess up your phone so you need to replace it. So Apple can talk about reliability, and saving everyone (including Apple) money on reducing failures and replacements when the jack fails or gets junk wedged in it. Apple can use that space for improving other things, like adding improved speakers to the iPhone like it did for the iPad. I own a nice bluetooth speaker; unless I’m working in the garage, I almost never use it, because these days, I use the speakers in the iPad instead. They’re perfectly good for most of what I do. Improved speakers in the phone would push that further, because then places where I use the speaker for volume as I move around, I simply carry the speakers with me in my pocket. So that’s how I see Apple justifying this change: Most of you are already not using the jack, and that trend is accelerating. The jack is the biggest cause of failures of the phone after drops, so this will make it more reliable and less likely to fail and need replacement. I’m not sure if Apple will go for full “water safe” language, but at the very least, it’ll make it better in casual water contact situations. And they’ll have some suggestion for how removing it gives them the ability to add something else nice to the phone solving some other problem for you. Better speakers is my guess. Will that convince you? We can already guess that nothing will convince some people, and we can also know we’re going to hear from them. But I think in reality, for most iPhone users that upgrade this will be either a non-issue, or at worst be a minor hassle for a short time. I think it’s also clear that Apple is not so much forcing this change on users as it is recognizing a trend that’s already happening and at worst accelerating it along. And in a year, the dust will settle, we’ll all have gotten used to the change, and only a few percentage of the user base will still be complaining about it, just like you can still find a few people upset that they can’t swap batteries on their laptops. Most of us long since realized the advantages of the current design… (although to be honest, I’m really looking forward to moving my laptop to USB C because it’ll mean both a single combined charger for all my gear, and that I can upgrade to a battery block that will charge my phone and my laptop if needed… Yay progress!) Unintended consequences Lost in the noise about this debate are some of the unintended consequences of removing the jack — there are accessories and devices that depend on it. The big one is the Square Reader and this could create disruptions for businesses and vendors that depend on it. Is this a reason not to make the change? No, and I expect Square has a compatible replacement in the works, and if it doesn’t by now, it deserves what it’ll get in the backlash. Were you aware there’s this fun sub-culture of weird accessories that plug into the jack? Check out Etsy and you’ll see all sorts of stuff. Is this a reason not to do it? no, but these vendors will have to adapt somehow. There are medical devices that use that jack: glucose monitors for diabetics, Oximeters, blood pressure monitors and other devices. All of these devices now have versions that work via bluetooth, or occasionally wifi or the lightning port, so users have options — but it’s still a disruption. These users have to plan for the upgrade, and these vendors need to have new products moving forward, or find themselves operating in an Android-only world. So yeah, it’s gonna happen. So yeah, this is going to happen. Like it or not, our future is a bluetooth enabled one. In practice, for most of the user base, this change has already happened, or with a new pair of free earbuds, will happen seamlessly. From all indications that number is well past half, and it might be as big as three quarters. Of course, when you sell a billion devices 25% is also a huge number — and there are users of specific accessories like the Square Reader for which this might be a bigger headache — but to me it looks pretty clear Apple is following a trend here, not creating one, and that the transition for most of us will be painless or close to it. And we know from history that this won’t stop the noise and grumbling, and that a year from now, we’ll mostly have moved on, and two years from now, we’ll be surprised that people were making so much noise about something that simply seems normal now. Because that’s how it’s been every time we’ve hit one of these technology inflection points in the past… Share this: Tweet Email This entry was posted in About Chuq, Apple Inc. « Apple’s fall product event: September 7 Reprocessing old images… Two Examples » Subscribe (or else) I’m looking for my next job.

While not every sector is, the S&P 500 as a whole is, driven by huge premiums in utilities, telecoms and consumer staples. Premiums are generated by investors starved for yield and buying stocks in those sectors in lieu of bonds with historically low coupons. The key for investors is to find cheap stocks in sectors that are still reasonable. Consumer discretionary and technology are cheaper than their averages over the past 25 years, so we screened the Merrill Lynch research data base for stocks in those sectors, that were still cheap and rated Buy. We found four that look outstanding, and all have dividends that are higher than the current 30-year U.S. Treasury, which is currently yielding a paltry 2.25%. GameStop This top retailer looks to benefit from new releases. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) operates as an omnichannel video game retailer. It sells new and pre-owned video game hardware; physical and digital video game software; pre-owned and value video game products; video game accessories, such as controllers, gaming headsets, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software; and digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital and subscription cards and digitally downloadable software. The company also sells mobile and consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, headphones and accessories, as well as pre-owned smartphones; personal computer (PC) entertainment software in various genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation; and strategy guides, magazines and gaming-related toys. As of January 30, 2016, it operated approximately 7,117 stores in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe. GameStop primarily offers its products under the GameStop, EB Games and Micromania names. Leading Wall Street analysts feel that hardware updates and the holiday release slate this year should help the gaming segment. In addition, the second-half hardware refreshes and fourth-quarter high-quality product releases could help drive traffic to the stores. We recently covered its benefits from the recent Pokémon craze and also the company’s big expansion plans. GameStop investors receive a 5.15% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $35 and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $34.90. Shares traded down fractionally to $28.66 on Monday morning, after closing down over 10% on Friday after reporting a disappointing quarter. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations for the tech giant. But a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality and a consistent shift away from reliance on chips for personal computers keep the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.95% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $42 price target, and the consensus target is $37.58. The shares traded Monday morning at $35.46.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Asus updates X99-E WS with twin 10Gb Ethernet connections by Zak Killian  12:56 PM on August 29, 2016 Asus released the original X99-E WS motherboard back in 2014, and reviewers were fond of its generous expansion options. Given the success of that model, it's no surprise that Asus is updating it for Broadwell-E, with the appropriately-named X99-E-10G WS. New to this version of the board is an Intel X550AT2 10-gigabit Ethernet controller. That chip and its heatsink rest amidst the I/O cluster. This does take up quite a bit of back-panel port space, but it ensures maximum reliability when using the X99-E-10G's dual 10-gigabit Ethernet ports. In addition to four USB 3.0 and two USB 3.1 ports on the back panel, the board still has headers for four more USB 3.0 and four USB 2.0 ports. Besides the new high-speed network hardware, this board also drops its predecessor's unloved SATA Express connection for a U.2 jack. Of course, it also has an M.2 socket, with screws for 60mm and 80mm M.2 drives. Both U.2 and M.2 connections are equipped with four lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity. Ten SATA 6Gbps ports fill out the board's storage options. Aside from those changes, the X99-E-10G WS is pretty similar to the original X99-E WS. Like the previous model, the new board uses a multiplexer to spread 64 lanes of PCIe 3.0 across seven x16 slots. That allows the board to support four PCIe x16 connections, or a single x16 and six x8 connections. Asus reinforced all seven slots to prevent users who frequently remove and reinstall cards from damaging the board. Asus says the refreshed X99-E WS will be available "soon" for a suggested price of $650.

Credit: TACC More like this Intel's megachips will take on Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs Microsoft Azure networking is speeding up, thanks to custom hardware How Intel plans to change servers as it breaks away from PCs Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles For years, Microsoft has been delivering speedy and accurate Bing results with experimental servers called Project Catapult, which have now received an architectural upgrade. The Catapult servers use reprogrammable chips called FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are central to delivering better Bing results. FPGAs can quickly score, filter, rank and measure the relevancy of text and image queries on Bing. Microsoft has now redesigned the original Catapult server, which is used to investigate the role of FPGAs in speeding up servers. The proposed Catapult v2 design is more flexible in circumventing traditional data-center structures for machine learning and expands the role of FPGAs as accelerators. Microsoft presented the Catapult v2 design for the first time earlier this month at the Scaled Machine Learning conference in Stanford, Calif. Microsoft's data centers drive services like Cortana and Skype Translator, and the company is constantly looking to upgrade server performance. Microsoft is also working with Intel to implement silicon photonics, in which fiber optics will replace copper wires for faster communications between servers in data centers.  Catapult v2 expands the availability of FPGAs, allowing them to be hooked up to a larger number of computing resources. The FPGAs are connected to DRAM, the CPU, and network switches. The FPGAs can accelerate local applications, or be a processing resource in large-scale, deep-learning models. Much like with Bing, the FPGAs can be involved in scoring results and training of deep-learning models. The new model is a big improvement from the original Catapult model, in which FPGAs were limited to a smaller network within servers. The Catapult v2 design can be used for cloud-based image recognition, natural language processing and other tasks typically associated with machine learning. Catapult v2 could also provide a blueprint for using FPGAs in machine learning installations. Many machine learning models are driven by GPUs, but the role of FPGAs is less clear. Baidu has also used FPGAs in data centers for deep learning. FPGAs can quickly deliver deep-learning results, but they can be notoriously power hungry if not programmed correctly. They can be reprogrammed to execute specific tasks, but that also makes them one dimensional. GPUs are more flexible and can handle several calculations, but FPGAs can be faster at given tasks. Many large companies are showing interest in FPGAs. Intel earlier this year completed the $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, an FPGA vendor. Intel will put Altera FPGAs in cars, servers, robots, drones and other devices. Outside of Microsoft, a Catapult server, used for machine learning, is installed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas, Austin. The system is small, with 32 two-socket Intel Xeon servers, which are packed with 64GB of memory, and an Altera Stratix V D5 FPGA with its own 8GB DDR3 memory cache.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Under this pledge, the companies promise to do their part to close the gender pay gap. Among the companies were some major tech firms: Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Dropbox, and LinkedIn. Also taking the pledge were: Anheuser Busch, Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola, General Motors, and Nike. According to the White House, the pledge includes five main points, reported Engadget: –Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap. –Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations. –Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers. –Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. –Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. The companies also vow to “conduct an annual company-wide gender pay analysis and to review hiring and promotion practices to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers,” reported CNN. “The typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns,” said the White House statement. “While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all.” Trending on MadameNoire View Comments Comment Disclaimer: Comments that contain profane or derogatory language, video links or exceed 200 words will require approval by a moderator before appearing in the comment section.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Surface Pro 5 News and Release Date: Rumor Mill Boasts RAM, Display Upgrades; Specs and Price Details By Maverick Russel Flores Aug 29, 2016 | 6:58 AM The tremendous success of Microsoft's device line Surface Pro is undeniable. The latest release was Surface Pro 4, which celebrated its anniversary Sunday, prompting Microsoft pundits to ask: what's next? With legitimate specifications offered in a lightweight detachable tablet, the PC series can only raise the bar higher. Fortunately, details of a fifth edition are reaching the—pun intended—surface. Specs wishlist Updates on the Surface Pro 5's release date is still in the works, but PC fans are getting a glimpse of the much-awaited product through speculations and sporadic news. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit One such rumor suggests the tablet may now be armed with a Kaby Lake CPU from Intel. The chips had just been distributed to various manufacturers, which provides Microsoft an opportunity to grab hold of these powerful processors. Surface Pro had been riddled with battery issues, and the Kaby Lake CPU could be the solution to those woes. It strains the PC's battery less, in addition to rumors of it being a much faster processor than those used on today's devices. Despite the improvements on endurance the Kaby Lake can bring to the table, Microsoft is still expected to work more on this aspect. Battery life is essential for a device advertised for business, which notably cannot even last 10 hours. Besides getting a better battery model, people are suggesting tweaks in the operating system. Surface Pro 5 is reportedly set to run on Windows Redstone 2—which is charted to be released next year. Microsoft has the power to improve both their device and its operating system, therefore this is an issue that they should attend to. Furthermore, gamers who plan on buying the product are asking for a reprieve in terms of the Surface Pro's graphic card. There had been suggestions to bolster the device by adding attachments for top-tier NVIDIA graphics cards. Promising details Despite the current obscurity of important specifications, information on resolution, storage and other appendages of the device have been floating around. Surface Pro 5 may run on 16GB RAM, with 2K and 4K resolution displays. It is said to also include USB Type-C support. USB Type-C is not only backwards compatible with obsolete devices, it also boasts improved data transfer speeds and external charging support. Still, consumers are concerned about the price of the new model. Surface Pro 5 is projected to cost at least $900, with high-end variants reaching up to $1599. The price is considered a luxury compared to laptops such as Chromebooks, which can cost as low as $200. Details on the device's release are yet to come, but projections set it around next year.

Recently authorized by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), CBRS allows 150 MHz of 3.5GHz spectrum previously reserved for the US military to be used in commercial civilian applications for short-range broadband communications. The new CBRS Alliance, founded by Alphabet's Access, Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ruckus Wireless (now part of Brocade) aims to evangelize and foster development of LTE-based CBRS technology. "It started with a need for indoor coverage," Oren Binder, chair of the Alliance's marketing group and director service provider marketing at Ruckus Wireless, told EE Times in an interview. "Cellular signals from macro towers can get blocked by building materials, and downward-pointing cellular antennas provide less coverage for the upper floors of tall buildings such as hotels. So a lot of users have been having issues with indoor cellular service, issues that cell companies are unable to address." Small cells, Binder pointed out, turned out to not be viable. The problem, he noted, is that providing indoor coverage required small cells for each building. The cost as well as allocation of spectrum for numerous small cells was unmanageable. "Cell operators are not equipped to handle thousands of hotels," Binder added. Signals from cell towers have difficulty penetrating into buildings and are positioned to favor ground coverage. The solution the Alliance is promoting is to use CBRS spectrum to provide standard LTE cellular services in small areas where standard cellular service is inadequate. Such spaces could include hotels, office buildings, factories, subway stations, and other places where cellular coverage is an issue. By using standard LTE protocols, Binder noted, cellular users would be able to roam seamlessly from macro towers to the indoor CBRS systems. The frequency band has the added benefit of being relatively uncrowded, he added. But before such systems can become commonplace, Binder said, there are many hurdles to overcome. One is having a critical mass of cellular handsets become equipped with the necessary transceivers. "Thats where Alliance members like Qualcomm and Intel come in," he said. "They're already supporting this band in the new chipsets they are offering." Binder expects that the speed with which cellphones get updated will ensure an adequate supply of potential users in a few years' time." We could see deployment beginning by the end of 2017 and should see rapid adoption after that." The technologies for implementing CBRS LTE are all available, Binder said. Alliance members already have working access points and CBRS-equipped phones in early field trials, he said. Full field trials and tests of the dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) needed to ensure that adjacent installations do not interfere should be underway by the end of this year. "We've solved the technical issues," Binder said. "Now it's a matter of expanding the ecosystem and getting more companies involved." —Rich Quinnell covers industrial control for EE Times.

I just learned about an incredible piece of information with regards to Virtual SAN and some record breaking performance. This is something that current  and potential Virtual SAN customers should be able to love and appreciate. Intel continues to push the boundaries of Virtual SAN with their technologies and flash devices. Last year they delivered the World’s first all-flash 64 node cluster (The BigDaddy as I called it). This was an impressive configuration that reached a total of 6.7 million IOPS delivering about 100K IOPS per node. For VMworld, they decided to put together something nice and basically push things a bit more and showcase the very first all NVMe flash Virtual SAN 6.2 beast based on their new Intel SSD P3520 Series devices and the results are incredible. Below is cluster configuration: Eight Supermicro* SuperServer 2028U-TN24R4T servers with Dual Intel® Xeon® E5-2687Wv4 (12 Core @ 3.0 Ghz) 256 GB DDR4 RAM Boot Drive – 1x Intel® SSD DC S3710 Series (200 GB, 2.5”) Virtual SAN SSDs – 4 Disk Groups comprised of 4x Intel® SSD DC P3700 Series (800 GB, 2.5” SFF) 20x Intel® SSD DC P3520 Series (2 TB, 2.5” SFF) Intel® Ethernet Server Adapter X540-DA2 Read the entire article here, New Virtual SAN 6.2 Performance Record with Intel SSD P3520 Series via Rawlinson Rivera at Punching Clouds.

He succeeds Shayne Millington, who left the agency for McCann New York earlier this month.  DeAngelo joins StrawberryFrog from William Morris Endeavor, where he has been an executive creative director since last October, serving as part of the team leading creative for the company’s own properties and fee-based clients (including AB InBev). “We welcome Tyler as our new Executive Creative Director,” said founder and CEO Scott Goodson in a statement. “Tyler is an extraordinary thinker, innovator and creative leader who over the course of his career has produced amazing work for some impressive brands as diverse as Verizon, AB InBev, Sony PlayStation, Intel and Diageo.” Goodson added, “Beyond the work, he also has been an innovator in terms of agency models, most recently at William Morris Endeavor where he helped the agency expand its capabilities and scope of work. StrawberryFrog Co-Founder and COO Karin Drakenberg and I, along with the rest of the Frog team, are delighted to have Tyler on board.” Prior to joining WME, DeAngelo — who brings more than a decade of agency experience to the new gig — spent over two years as ECD at mcgarrybowen New York, working with brands including Intel and Verizon. That followed a little over a year in the same role with Havas Chicago, where he led campaigns for such brands as Michelob Ultra, Cracker Barrel and Sony Playstation. While with WME, DeAngelo didn’t just make ads. He also “led the rebranding of IMG’s Professional Bull Riders” and co-wrote the corresponding anthem “Hold On” for fellow WME client Steven Tyler … who later included the song on his latest solo album. DeAngelo’s work has received plaudits from the Cannes Lions, the One Show, the Webby’s and the Effies, among others. Regarding his new job, he said, “I’ve always admired Scott and this innovative agency. Like the StrawberryFrog team I believe in the power of creativity, tech and culture and the even higher degree of power all three have when seamlessly combined to support ground breaking ideas.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Samsung launched the Galaxy TabPro S some eight months ago and according to a new report, the company is now working on a successor to this tablet. The Galaxy TabPro S2 is expected to feature the latest processors from Intel and it’s likely that the tablet may also receive 4G LTE support. According to the report, four different models of the Galaxy TabPro S2 might be offered, processors and other internal components might be the differentiating factors between these different models. The company is expected to keep the Super AMOLED display size to 12 inches like the original tablet and the successor may even have the same metal body. The biggest changes will undoubtedly be made under the hood. Samsung’s new Windows 10-powered tablet may feature the latest 7th generation Intel Core M processors and upgraded RAM for a nice performance boost. Expect it to have detachable keyboard support like its predecessor. There’s no word as yet on pricing and availability. Samsung does have an event coming up as part of IFA 2016 in Berlin but it’s unclear at this point in time if the company is going to launch the Galaxy TabPro S2 at this event. Filed in Tablets..
