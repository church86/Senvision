This webinar will show you how to avoid pitfalls when replacing infrastructure, as well as how to create an effective migration plan. View Now! Just when PCs looked to be dying a slow, painful death, they became interesting again. As expected, this week's news coming from Computex in Taiwan is flush with new PCs and PC technologies, but is it enough to reinvigorate a market that has faced declining sales since 2011? The market peaked at just over 365 million units annually, and fell to 269 million units last year, according to Gartner. So, why all the excitement? The excitement is emerging from both the technology driving PCs and the applications leveraging the processing power of PCs. In terms of technology, the battle between AMD and Intel for processor supremacy has heated up again, along with a new core race. High-End Battle Impact AMD kicked off the new battle with its Ryzen processor, featuring up to eight CPU cores with 16 threads, the equivalent of 16 virtual cores. With significantly lower price points, AMD also lowered the starting price for a well-equipped gaming PC to less than $2,000. Intel has countered with a new line of Core i9 processors that will feature up to 18 cores and 36 threads -- but at a price tag that puts the price of the processor alone at around $2,000. In addition, the graphics processing unit soon will get a significant bump in performance, when AMD introduces new products on its Vega architecture and Nvidia launches products based on its Volta architecture. If that weren't enough, the I/O on PCs is being upgrading to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, and solid-state drives and memory are getting faster with larger capacities. While these extreme systems won't have much of an impact on average consumers in 2017, the impact of a performance battle at the high end of the market is that mainstream PCs will see new technologies and substantial bumps in performance at much lower price points starting in 2018. For people who want to be productive but are more focused on social media, entertainment and light gaming, Microsoft and Qualcomm are pushing the concept of an always-connected PC, leveraging the performance of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 mobile processor. Think of it as the Microsoft version of the Chromebook, but with the Windows 10 ecosystem and Windows Store, and similarly available from a variety of PC OEMs. VR and AR Ahead On the application side, gaming remains the application driving PC technology and market stability. In fact, gaming is the only area where PCs shipments actually have been growing. However, just on the horizon is a new generation of virtual reality and augmented reality head-mounted displays that hold the promise of improving the PC experience in just about every application -- from engineering and design to entertainment and gaming. This is the first new application well suited for the PC in a long time, because VR and AR require increasingly more processing, graphics and I/O capabilities than the industry can deliver today. More Power Users Despite all the activity around PCs, most industry forecasts still point to a down year in 2017. We haven't seen this much innovation in a tech segment in years, so why is the outlook for PCs still so negative? The answer lies in the dynamics of the market. The first thing to consider is the adoption rate of these new PCs. While gamers are anxious to be on the latest and greatest technology, other power users, like enterprises, have longer and planned upgrade cycles. This means that adoption cycles can take a year or two for new technologies. On the positive side, however, is that power users account for more than a third of the overall PC market, by some estimates, and the their ranks are growing. The shift to Windows 10 by consumers and enterprise users also bodes well for the overall PC segment next year. The second issue is the adoption of new applications and technologies. While VR and AR hold promise, the applications are still limited and evolving toward a must-have user experience. In addition, the cost of the high-end HMDs that provide that rich user experience currently are upwards of $800, well out of the price range of the average consumer. As the number of applications increases, the user experience improves, and as the technology evolves, prices will come down to a more reasonable $200-$300 price range, starting later this year. Finally, there is the competition from other platforms. While PCs are a great platform for VR and AR today, game consoles, mobile devices, and other platforms will offer viable alternatives in the future, especially as HMDs move to next generation high-speed WiFi and 5G wireless interfaces, starting later this decade. Keeping the Momentum Going The new surge in technology around the PC might abate the decrease in PC shipments and may even show an uptick in late 2017 and throughout 2018 as the new platforms are introduced and the technology is pushed down into more affordable price bands, in the view of Tirias Research. Products like the new Asus ROG Strix GL702ZC and the new Dell Inspiron gaming desktops announced at Computex, which are based on AMD technology, target lower price points than the traditional gaming platforms like Dell's Alienware products. The technology surge is a positive for the industry, as the same technology will be used for other platforms, ranging from medical systems to gaming consoles. However, the PC still needs to evolve in both form factor and usage models to sustain this brief surge in momentum. Jim McGregor is principal analyst at Tirias Research.

A major self-driving car trend from this year's CES was not how autonomous cars will work, but what passengers will do in them. A new study from Intel suggests not only how passengers will spend their time, but how much that time will be worth. Popular Searches General Motors Co GM ▲ 34.45 +0.02 +0.06% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 155.45 +2.27 +1.48% General Electric Co GE ▲ 27.88 +0.16 +0.58% Herbalife Ltd HLF ▼ 73.92 -0.19 -0.26% By 2050, the study says, self-driving vehicle services, including ride-hailing, cargo delivery and in-car entertainment, will be worth $7 trillion in what Intel calls the "passenger economy". Paying for a robo-taxi is just the tip of the iceberg in this major economic shift. The study, sponsored by Intel and written by research firm Strategy Analytics, proposes that passengers might use video conferencing for work or have a self-driving car go pick up lunch, making it ready for a meal on the road. The study's dollar figure takes into account advertising served to passengers, delivery services both heavy and light, and passenger time saved due to the fact that this technology allows for more efficient driving, with fewer traffic jams. The current transportation economy, including trucking and car services, is huge, but the need for human drivers means that people in vehicles usually must remain focused on the road. When reliable self-driving cars hit the market, currently projected for 2021, former drivers will be left with little to do. As the vehicles progress, automakers may even design cabins with more social seating, facing each other as opposed to looking forward. The Intel study predicts that all the time drivers currently spend during the daily commute will turn into free time. The largest chunk of the projected sum, about $3.7 trillion, will come from regular people using self-driving car services. Most of these people, representing about 50 percent of current drivers, will probably not own a personal car. Autonomous cargo delivery and other business services make up another $3 trillion slice of the pie, while new services, which could involve anything from a mobile manicure to meal-on-wheels accounts for another $200 billion. Journalist Greg Lindsay, brought in by Intel to comment on the study, said "self-driving cars will make as big of an impact on society as the advent of affordable cars did in the last century." He said that, as in-car time becomes more productive or enjoyable, people might opt for longer commutes and live further away from cities. Aside from the new passenger economy, the study notes that self-driving cars could save 535,000 lives between 2035 and 2045, due to their inherent safety, along with a savings of $234 billion over the same period in costs that would otherwise be caused by collisions. Intel entered the self-driving car fray earlier this year, opening its Autonomous Driving Garage in San Jose. It competes with other tech companies, such as Google and Nvidia, automotive equipment suppliers and automakers themselves.

Two people have appealed against the decision by Kildare county council. Emmet Stagg, a Labour Party TD, said he was disappointed that objections to Intel’s plans had been lodged with An Bord Pleanála. It is estimated that the project would create 3,000 jobs during the construction phase as well as 850 jobs at Intel’s base at Collinstown Industrial Park in Leixlip.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple’s fight with Qualcomm could hurt the iPhone 8 Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 1st, 2017 at 5:42 PM Share Tweet Apple has been locked in a bitter dispute with Qualcomm, a major chip manufacturer that has historically supplied the wireless modems for the iPhone. According to a new report, Apple’s legal dispute with Qualcomm is going to have an effect on iPhone 8 components, and Apple might have to substitute some Qualcomm chips with Intel components. Given the inferior quality of the Intel chips in last year’s iPhone 7, that’s not good news. Don't Miss: 10 best new movies and shows coming to Netflix in June According to a Digitimes report, Apple will shift supply of iPhone baseband modems away from Qualcomm and towards Intel, starting this year. The report says that 50% of the iPhone 8 modems could be supplied by Intel, with that number rising to 70% for the 2018 iPhone lineup. Intel’s modems have historically been cheaper but worse-performing than Qualcomm’s solution. A worse modem means less power efficiency but also a worse cell signal with lower speeds — all important things for Apple, especially considering new LTE technologies are being deployed this year, and wireless speed is set to take on a new level of importance. Qualcomm generally supplies the modem for every Android flagship worth talking about, and the iPhone’s reputation is all about reliability and speed. Apple could be forced to make a bad choice here: make an unpleasant legal settlement with Qualcomm, which would likely eat into Apple’s profit margins; or accept an inferior component in nearly half of its brand-new iPhone range. Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm is related to the licensing fees Qualcomm charges for its patents. Qualcomm’s intellectual property is used inside every single iPhone — which Apple acknowledges — but Apple contends that Qualcomm charges unreasonably high patent fees. Apple has sued Qualcomm over the issue in the past, and even instructed its manufacturing partners like Foxconn to stop royalty payments to Qualcomm. The chip manufacturer has countersued in the Southern District of California; if the case there fails, Qualcomm could even take the issue to the US International Trade Commission, and seek a ruling banning the import of iPhones into the US. Nothing’s yet indicated that Qualcomm is prepared to go that far. But the rumors about Apple shifting as much of supply as possible away from Qualcomm is telling. Apple’s bunkering down and preparing for a war with a vitally important component supplier; let’s just hope iPhone customers don’t get caught in the crossfire.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel shows how its Compute Card makes dumb appliances smart 06/01/2017 at 2:21 PM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Intel is starting to show what its upcoming Compute Card modules can do. The company has been stuffing PCs into smaller and smaller packages over the past few years, and that’s culminated in a device that’s not much larger than a credit card. First unveiled at CES earlier this year, Intel announced this week that the first Compute Stick devices are due to start shipping in August. And the company is providing the first real-world demonstrations of the platform for journalists at Computex in Taiwan. The Intel Compute Card isn’t designed to work as a standalone computer the same way that the company’s NUC or Compute Stick devices are. Instead, it’s a module that you can be used to turn a docking station into a PC, a dumb TV into a smart one, or a media player into an upgradeable device, among other things. It could also work as a computer module that you can carry with you throughout the day: slide it into a desktop dock at work or school, then take it home and put it in a laptop dock to access all your files, applications, and settings. Here are a few of the concepts/early designs Intel is showing off: LG, ECS, Sharp, and Dell are showing displays that become all-in-one Windows 10 desktops when you add a Compute Card. Smart Tech is showing a convertible laptop/tablet hybrid. Intel’s “Port Jefferson” dock adds all the ports you’d need to use the Compute Card as a desktop computer. There’s also a cash register prototype and a a rugged PC/router designed for use outdoors. Since each system relies on a removable card, it should be possible to upgrade hardware after you buy it. Or you could change operating systems or user environments by swapping out cards, allowing multiple people to use the same laptop, desktop, or display docking station with their own personal Compute Cards. You’ll most likely end up buying a Compute Card from the same company that makes a laptop/desktop/display dock for it rather than buying one from Intel. And it’s not entirely clear at this point if a module bought for a Dell device, for example, will work with an LG dock. While each Compute Card will have a standard interface, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some device makers try to lock down their system with DRM and/or a slot that only accepts cards with a specific shape. At launch Intel will offer Compute Modules with Celeron N3450, Pentium N4200, Core M3-7Y30, or Core i5-7Y57 chips. Each module supports 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2 and has 4GB of DDR3 RAM. The Celeron and Pentium models are based on Apollo Lake architecture and feature 64GB of eMMC storage. The Core/Kaby Lake-Y versions have 128GB of SSD storage. Prices are expected to range from about $140 to $450. MobileGeeks has a brief video showing some of the Compute Card-powered devices including a laptop, a convertible model, a tablet for use in medical environments, and a small desktop computer-style dock. Update: Roland Quandt has also posted a pretty great hands-on video that, among other things, shows what’s inside the case of a Compute Card: via Tom’s Guide, Engadget, The Inquirer, MobileGeeks, and PC Watch Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 6 Comments on "Intel shows how its Compute Card makes dumb appliances smart" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member zdanee Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I am less interested in the more mobile devices, given the current state of battery science. In mobile devices the trend is to non replaceable batteries, yet it is the battery that limits the device life. Perhaps this tech will reverse that trend!

I am sick of having so many perfectly good devices that just become too slow for daily use and have to be recycled..having one compute card for multiple devices would be sweet as well it could have a small battery that would let you put it into hibernate while moving the card to another device if this extends to phones that’d be nice too Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 day 4 hours ago Member toxic_computing Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Your next notebook will run for days thanks to… Your next notebook will run for days thanks to Qualcomm — not Intel By Mark Coppock — Updated June 1, 2017 12:25 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: For the longest time — as in, forever – most notebooks have run some version of Windows on an Intel processor. A few machines have run with AMD inside rather than Intel, and MacBooks have run MacOS instead of Windows. But in general, your choices were limited to machines that ran hot, didn’t last all that long away from a plug, took a long time to boot up, and were connected to the internet on a part-time basis. Smartphones have changed all that, however. They turn on instantly, last a long time on a single battery charge, and are always connected. And it’s the mobile ARM processor that’s made all that possible. Intel has chased the smartphone ever since, introducing features like Intel Rapid Start in a partially successful quest to make PCs feel as responsive as smartphones. Now, there’s a version of Windows 10 that runs on ARM processors, specifically on Qualcomm’s latest system-on-chip (SoC), the Snapdragon 835. The combination promises significantly longer battery life on machines that start up as fast as smartphones, and packs in a LTE modem that keeps it connected to the internet on a full-time basis. That’s a nice vision of the future of truly mobile computing, but is it real? We’ve been down this road before, with Microsoft’s Windows RT platform that showed up on its original Surface tablet, and was then promptly put to death. What makes us think that this time around, Microsoft’s initiative will make a difference in how we use our Windows 10 machines? Yes, things really are different this time around If we want to predict if Windows 10 on ARM has a chance of being successful, then we need to discuss exactly why Windows RT was such a failure. There are two main reasons why, and we’re already seeing Microsoft, Qualcomm, and PC makers doing some things differently that could make instant-on, long-lasting, and always-connected Windows 10 notebooks a reality. Windows 10 on ARM will run all 16 million of the Windows desktop applications that people have come to know and love. First, Windows 10 on ARM will run all 16 million of the Windows desktop applications that people have come to know and love. The full version of Office 2016, Adobe’s professional suite of creativity applications, and niche software like AutoCAD will run on the platform this time around. Windows RT was limited to only the paltry apps in the Windows Store, in addition to a ported version of Office 2013. That wasn’t good enough. Second, it’s not just Microsoft working on the project. Qualcomm is fully on board, and at least three influential PC makers are already slated to make ARM-based Windows 10 systems. This forms an interesting alliance. Qualcomm wants to sell more processors, and the PC makers want to sell budget computers without paying for expensive Intel hardware. Everyone involved has reason to make Windows 10 work on ARM, and work well. What will ARM-based notebooks look like? This time around, ARM-based Windows 10 machines will offer real benefits that you’re going to love, without major drawbacks. To begin with, ARM processors use less power than Intel processors, which makes sense. They were designed for smartphones, which are all about squeezing as much battery life as possible out of much smaller battery capacities, while still providing decent performance. According to Qualcomm, ARM-based Windows 10 notebooks will provide up to 50 percent more battery life, and will last for 20 hours on average. It will turn the PC into a device you don’t need charged every day. Next, devices running ARM processors are instant-on. People demand that their smartphones wake up instantly — push the button, and they’re ready to go. The iPad and Android tablets have done this forever. Intel, Microsoft, and PC builders have made some headway into building notebooks that respond quickly, but their efforts are most visible in high-end hardware. People who buy budget computers – in other words, most people – must wait. Better still, ARM-based systems use very little power when in standby mode. Again, Windows notebooks have improved here, but smartphones remain the king of standby power. While a good notebook can last a week or more in standby, the Google Pixel smartphone can last 19 days. This, too, will help make ARM-powered Windows PCs last for days on a charge. Finally, ARM-based systems run cooler. That will enable exclusively fanless designs that run completely silently and won’t require unsightly venting and won’t subject their users to blasts of hot air. Some Intel-based systems are fanless as well, but they typically need to throttle performance more aggressively to keep things cool, and most such devices are expensive. ARM-based notebooks running Windows 10 will be thin and sleek, and they won’t weigh much. Many of them will be 2-in-1 devices, and allow the screen to be used independently as a tablet. In other words, they’ll probably look a lot like iPads, Android tablets, and Chromebooks – but they’ll run Windows 10, instead. What about the performance penalty? Windows 10 on ARM won’t match the performance of Intel’s latest Core processors, or AMD’s Ryzen. Aside from the fact those companies build more powerful, more power-hungry chips than Qualcomm, the way software is written is also an issue. Windows is coded for the x86 instruction set, which is what Intel and AMD chips understand. To make Windows 10 work on ARM hardware, Microsoft has written a comprehensive emulation layer. That is certainly going to result in a performance penalty. The size of the penalty is the biggest unanswered question. No one’s going to want a Qualcomm-powered Windows notebook if it feels slow. The real impact will be on low-end Windows notebooks, where ARM’s advantages are more important. Also, some of the largest and most complex applications, like Adobe’s professional video editing application, Premiere, and AutoCAD, which is used for rendering 3D images, already demand high-end, quad-core Intel Core i7 processors, lots of RAM, and fast GPUs for any kind of performance. Today’s ARM processors aren’t yet capable of matching Intel’s performance running these kinds of apps. However, high-end PCs aren’t the target. The real impact will be on low-end Windows notebooks, where ARM’s advantages are more important. What this means for you is that you will finally be able to use all your favorite Windows productivity, media consumption, and communications apps on a machine that can really last a full day on a single charge. You won’t have to wait for it to boot up, and you won’t have to worry about finding a Wi-Fi connection. Windows 10 on ARM is a big deal So, does Windows 10 on ARM matter? Yes, we think it does. It solves some problems that have plagued Windows notebooks for a long time, and it will likely do so for hundreds less than similar Intel-powered notebooks. In the meantime, you’ll still have those powerful Intel-based Windows 10 machines to choose from if you need to do 3D rendering in AutoCAD or play the latest games in VR and at high frame rates. Companies like Nvidia will keep working on initiatives like GeForce GTX with Max-Q Design to bring increasing levels of gaming performance to even more mobile devices. Gaming may in fact be the greatest weakness of Windows 10 on ARM, as it’s doubtful that games will run well on Qualcomm hardware, particularly after translated through emulation. For most people, though, Windows 10 on ARM will make for a better, more affordable experience, and it leaves plenty of room for Intel and others at the higher ends of the market. Choice is a good thing, and that’s what makes this new platform so important. While the timing of production notebooks powered by Qualcomm is still an open question, they’ll seriously disrupt the PC arena whenever they arrive. Unlike Windows RT, which could only run the more limited Windows Store applications, Windows 10 on ARM looks like the real deal.

Amid this constant news cycle of deals and drama, the purpose of all of it can get lost — or at least a bit muddied. What exactly are these companies racing for? A $7 trillion annual revenue stream, according to a study released Thursday by Intel. The companies that don’t prepare for self-driving risk failure or extinction, Intel says. The report also finds that over half a million lives could be saved by self-driving over just one decade. The study, prepared by Strategy Analytics, predicts autonomous vehicles will create a massive economic opportunity that will scale from $800 billion in 2035 (the base year of the study) to $7 trillion by 2050. An estimated 585,000 lives could be saved due to autonomous vehicles between 2035 and 2045, the study predicts. By 2050, business use of mobility as a service will generate about $3 trillion in revenue This “passenger economy,” as Intel is calling it, includes the value of the products and services derived from fully autonomous vehicles as well as indirect savings such as time. This is hardly the first attempt to place value on autonomous vehicles, nor will it be the last. However, Intel’s study offers a few interesting predictions for autonomous vehicles and how a combination of mobile connectivity, population density in cities, traffic congestion and subsequent regulation, and the rise of on-demand ride-hailing and car-sharing services will be the catalysts in this new economic era. Of course, Intel has a vested interest in rosy predictions about the future of autonomous transportation. The chipmaker has promised to spend $250 million over the next two years to develop self-driving technology, and recently acquired Jerusalem-based auto vision company Mobileye for an eye-popping $15 billion. And Intel is working with BMW to put self-driving cars on the road later this year. So when Intel pays for a study that predicts self-driving cars will cause cash to rain from the sky, it should be seen as equal parts industry analysis and wishful thinking. Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries, the study predicts, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector. These autonomous vehicles will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors, says Strategy Analytics president Harvey Cohen, who co-authored the study. This will relieve driver shortages, a chronic problem in the industry, and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues. One of the bolder predictions is that public transportation as we know it today — trains, subways, light rails, and buses — will be supplanted, or at least radically changed, by the rise of on-demand autonomous vehicle fleets. People will flock to suburbs as population density rises in city The study argues that people will flock to suburbs as population density rises in city centers, pushing commute times higher and “outstripping the ability of public transport infrastructure to fully meet consumer mobility needs.” The pressures of mounting traffic congestion and the correlated emissions will drive regulators to include autonomous vehicles as a part of their larger public transportation plans. Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation, the study says. The bulk of the revenue generated in the new economy will be driven by this “mobility-as-a-service.” By 2050, business use of mobility as a service will generate about $3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use will account for $3.7 trillion, or 53 percent, the study predicts. The remaining $200 billion in revenue (of the $7 trillion total) will be generated by new applications and services as driverless vehicle services expand. A key opportunity will be how to capitalize on all of this saved time people will have once they no longer have to drive a car. Vehicles could become “experience pods” Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world, the study says. That’s a lot of time that could be filled with streaming video, news, and other content delivered to a captured audience. It could also change the way cars are used. Vehicles could become “experience pods,” places where people can have their hair styled and cut, conduct a meeting, or receive a health screening. Keep in mind, that this reimagined future doesn’t mean people will necessarily spend less time in cars. One of the great promises of self-driving cars is a reduction in congestion because these vehicles will be able share real-time traffic data and optimize tasks like finding parking. However, in a more densely populated world, where cities rely on shared autonomous vehicles for public transit, there will be more traffic than ever before. The question is: how do people want to spend their time?

The Compute Card comes packed with the full functionality of a standard computer, including an SoC, connectivity, storage, and memory in one slim device. The device slots into a range of devices from laptops, tablets, and AIOs to interactive refrigerators and IoT gateways. The devices can be ejected and replaced, thus decoupling compute from the device and allowing for easy upgrades as the card evolves into more powerful variants. That could also make for interesting new laptop platforms with longer shelf lives. Intel Compute Card SKUs   CD1IV128MK CD1M3128MK CD1P64GK CD1C64GK CPU Core i5-7Y57 Core m3-7Y30 Pentium N4200 Celeron N3450 Memory 4GB DDR3 Storage 128GB Intel SSD 64GB eMMC Connectivity Intel Wireless-AC 8265 (2×2 .11ac & Bluetooth 4.2) Intel Wireless-AC 7265 (2×2 .11ac & Bluetooth 4.2) The Compute Card family offers processors that span from Core to Celeron and come in four SKUs. Each respective product has varying compute, storage, and connectivity options, though the processor serves as the only differentiation between the two high-end options. Aside from listing the processors, Intel hasn't given us an indication of performance. Intel has signed on a bevy of partners to develop new products that leverage the device, including Contec, ECS, Foxconn, LG Display, MoBits Electronics, NexDock, Sharp, Seneca, SMART Technologies, Suzhou Lehui Display, and TabletKiosk. Many of these partners will have products on display at Computex 2017. Dell, HP, and Lenovo are also working on new products, but have yet to reveal any of the end devices. Intel also released its Compute Card Device Design Kit, which is a set of guides and reference designs that simplify and speed up the product development process. In many ways Intel's Compute Card signifies the company's continued push for product diversification as it delves into IoT, automated driving, and other lucrative climes. In this case, its efforts also further its objectives in the mobility space, as we can expect new laptops and AIOs to come to market with the new cards installed. The Compute Card will begin shipping in August 2017, but Intel hasn't revealed pricing info.

Reply ddriver - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Let's hear it for "modularity". Reply nathanddrews - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link So there's no actual useful IO on the device itself? It needs to always be plugged into a larger shell to be used? Seems like a really limited use case, but hey, at least it's interesting. https://i.imgflip.com/1q6ecr.jpg Reply bobbozzo - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link Hi, what interfaces are available on the card to the docks? PCIe or USB or ? Reply CharonPDX - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Per the original announcement: "The “flexible I/O” is not Thunderbolt (obviously, due to power consumption concerns), but it handles USB, PCIe, HDMI, DisplayPort connectivity and has some extra pins for future/proprietary use." The physical port consists of a standard USB type C port with an "extension" next to it that is about twice as wide as a type C port. They have not yet published (that I can find) the pinout of that extension. Presumably the type C port contains all standard type C functionality - power, USB, and display. I would guess that either the extension contains PCIe connectivity by itself, or that it's really a "not fully compliant" Thunderbolt 3 port plus an extension for added functionality. Reply Meteor2 - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link So you'd need a USB hub to go with this thing -- one which sends power back? Or just run it headless and wireless, though I can't imagine what you could use it for in that configuration. Reply skavi - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Why would power consumption be an issue? In my understanding, this would slot into a device that either was either power at the wall or was basically a chassis with nothing but battery. Reply cfenton - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link It would be pretty cool to be able to upgrade your laptop's CPU without replacing the whole thing. Though, at this performance level it would be a huge downgrade from my current laptop. Maybe someday. Reply smilingcrow - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link Upgrading the CPU on a laptop used to be possible on most prior to the move to Ultrabooks and other fetishistic portable computing devices. Reply Meteor2 - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Or as I like to call them, actually portable computers, not disguised concrete blocks. With the minimal increase in IPC since Sandy Bridge it's not like there's a particular reason to upgrade a laptop anyway.

By Tiernan Ray June 1, 2017 1:47 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Canaccord Genuity’s Matthew Ramsay today offers up his views on the announcements this week at the Computex computer conference in Taipei, Taiwan, from the Big Three: Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Ramsay, who has a Hold rating on Intel stock, and Buy ratings on Nvidia and AMD, nevertheless finds that all three made some impressive announcements this week. On the Intel side of things, he notes the company’s announcement of new “Core X” parts for "high-end” personal computers, writing that "Core X-series is an impressive lineup." Among its virtues, the Core X “hits all pricing tiers,” at $242 to $1,999, which is good, and it’s “the most capable high-end desktop platform from Intel to date." Still, he thinks AMD can take desktop share from Intel with the “Ryzen” parts it has put out this year: While we believe Intel will maintain dominant market share and a sustainable leading position in the CPU market in terms of software breadth and raw CPU performance (enhanced further by Optane SSD support in certain applications including gaming), we believe AMD's new 14nm Ryzen processor lineup offers both competitive performance metrics and aggressive pricing and could take incremental share from Intel starting in Q3/17. Things are improving for Intel, but it’s still a wait-and-see story for the company and its stock overall, as far as he’s concerned: Combined with the launch of certain 10nm notebook products and the new Skylake/Purley server platform, we anticipate stronger 2H/17 results for Intel overall. However, while we concede Intel shares generate a strong yield and remain inexpensive, we believe shares could remain range bound as overall gross margins stagnate and until investors see proof that new investments in 10/7nm, FPGAs, auto, IoT and memory are capable of generating strong returns within a reasonable horizon. For AMD, he was surprised that the company didn’t give more details on its “ThreadRipper” chip, first disclosed at its analyst day two weeks ago, which is the part that’s comparable to Intel’s Core X: In light of Intel's announcement during Computex of its Core X- series of high performance CPUs including its ultra high end i9 topping out at 18 cores and 36 threads (at a $1,999 ASP), we had hoped AMD's management would discuss pricing details for their ultra high end Threadripper processors. While no pricing details were discussed, we believe AMD will aggressively price Threadripper and believe the inclusion of 64 lanes of PCIe I/O will prove an important feature. He liked a presentation on the company’s forthcoming notebook part, Ryzen Mobile: EVP Jim Anderson from the C&G group demonstrated for the first time publicly Ryzen Mobile, the ultra-portable APU, with 4 cores, 8 threads and Vega architecture-based graphics in a sub-15mm thickness notebook. We believe the Ryzen Mobile adds strategic flexibility to the rapidly growing notebook gaming segment for AMD, but will face tougher competition versus Intel's 10nm designs in 2H/18. And he’s enthusiastic about AMD CEO Lisa Su’s discussion of OEM partnerships for Ryzen-based PCs: CEO Lisa Su announced partnerships with all of the top global PC OEMs (Acer, Asus, Dell, Lenovo and HP) to have Ryzen CPU-based designs in the market by the end of Q2'17, ranging from high end gaming towers to notebooks to all-in-ones, powered by both Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 desktop processors with many also featuring AMD GPUs. We believe these partnerships and channel strength further solidifies our conviction in the Zen core lineup as we look towards 2H'17 to deliver strong sales growth and margin expansion. Also, the release date of June 20th was announced for the “Epyc” server chip that was also introduced at the analyst day. "While we model under $100M in EPYC revenue this year,” writes Ramsay, "we believe the more important ramp will materialize in 2018 as OEM systems begin shipment and believe a $1B+ server business is achievable by 2020." For Nvidia, Ramsay notes the introduction of “HGX,” a “reference design” to help computer makers construct servers for artificial intelligence computing, which others have commented on. And there was also the debt of “Max-Q,” a set of designs for gaming laptop computers. "As competitor AMD begins to market integrated CPU/GPU single-chip gaming systems, we believe the Max-Q program will prove critical for NVIDIA to maintain leading market share in the emerging gaming notebook market." He likes both announcements: "While neither announcement changes our overall thesis or estimates, we do believe both announcements continue to broaden the NVIDIA ecosystem and increase the runway for Pascal and Volta adoption in gaming notebooks and in the datacenter."

Intel spent several billion dollars - the exact amount is a closely guarded secret - to build and equip a massive Hillsboro factory designed for new generations of computer microprocessors. The chipmaker hired Hoffman Construction in 2010 as the general contractor for the enormous project, called D1X, and court documents show it ordered the company to move rapidly. Work did proceed quickly, according to legal filings. Intel wrapped up the first phase in 2013 and is now developing its next generation of 10 nanometer computer chips there. Construction on a second phase called "Mod 2" began in 2012 and is largely complete, awaiting future iterations of computer technology. Together, the two phases constitute more than 2 million square feet of clean rooms to develop and produce computer chips, plus more than 1 million square feet in associated support buildings. It's the most advanced factory of its kind in the world and among the biggest. Somewhere along the line, though, something went wrong between Intel and Hoffman. The construction firm placed a $50.8 million lien on D1X in 2015, according to Washington County records. Nearly two years later, records show, the lien remains in place. Meanwhile, a complaint filed this year by another contractor indicates Intel and Hoffman are in private arbitration related to what Hoffman charged Intel for changes in construction plans. Details of that dispute are not public, and it's not clear whether that dispute led to the 2015 lien. Intel declined comment. Hoffman and attorneys for the companies did not respond to requests for comment. Attorneys say liens are common in construction disputes, sometimes merely to preserve the option of additional legal action later. And while the amount of the lien is large in this case, it's proportionate to the scale of the project. "In the construction environment, the proceedings tend to be a little more adversarial than in some other settings," said Darien Loiselle, a partner at the Portland law firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt, which does not represent any party in this case. "Liens are used to ensure that validly established claims are in fact paid because the liens attach to the real property if properly litigated," Loiselle said in a written statement. "These claims also allow for a statutory right to attorney fees and costs for the prevailing party, a right that may not otherwise exist under the contract between the parties. Parties asserting them also do so often as a bold statement about the merits of the claim being pursued. " Hoffman's lien on Intel's Ronler Acres campus does not contain details of its dispute with Intel, and the companies' arbitration proceedings are private. However, some issues are visible through a related case brought by another contractor, Harder Mechanical Contractors. The Hillsboro Tribune noted that case in May. In its complaint, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Harder alleges that Intel and Hoffman were sharing some of Harder's proprietary information during arbitration to settle a dispute. Harder's filing indicates that "change orders issued by Hoffman resulted in a dispute between Hoffman and Intel regarding the price Hoffman was charging Intel for Hoffman's work on the Mod 2 project." According to Harder's complaint, Intel and Hoffman disagreed on how to value labor costs and are seeking to resolve their dispute out of court, through the American Arbitration Association. It's not clear from Harder's filing whether the dispute over labor costs is what prompted Hoffman to file the $50 million lien against Intel, or the status of the dispute between the companies.

(CSCO) and eBay Inc (EBAY) The charts aren't favoring INTC or CSCO stock, but EBAY shares indicate a buying opportunity Jun 1, 2017, 12:45 pm EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group     View All   The technology sector has been one of the better groups to be trading this year, as the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 are outpacing the S&P 500 by more than double. While technology stocks have performed well as a group, some of the more notable names have been stuck in a bearish rut that has potential to worsen. Today’s three big stock charts look closely at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), as their charts indicate technical tests that may lead to more selling and in one case, an opportunity to “buy the dip.” Intel Corporation (INTC) The semiconductor sector has been on fire for the year, as the group has returned more than 15% year-to-date. Despite the sector performance, Intel has remained a relative strength laggard and it appears that the situation could get worse. After a mixed earnings results, INTC stock vacillated around $37 before the sellers stepped in to take shares to their current $36 and change. This is a critical technical test for Intel shares and their near-term outlook. Intel’s 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages all reside between the prices of $36.00 and $36.20, staging a technical test that will determine the next 5-10% move for INTC stock. A break below these technical trendlines will target $34 for Intel stock, as the sellers will react to the triple technical break, which should be able to provide enough support for this technology bellwether. The bull case, which is less likely, is that INTC stock finds support for a short period of time and rallies from the triple-barreled support. In this case, the stock should target a short trip to $37 and then reverse back to another critical test, which would be more likely to fail. Bottom line is that there are much better stocks to pick from within this sector other than the best-known name of Intel. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Another tech giant that is struggling to keep up with the market and its peers is Cisco Systems. The networking giant has spent years trying to nail down the direction of product line and services, but the small moving networking companies have been more nimble to adjust to the fast-moving market. Technically, CSCO stock took a beating after its latest earnings announcement, so badly that it moved almost instantly into a technically oversold condition. That has helped the stock from deepening its recent losses, but time is running out for the bulls. The move in Cisco took shares below their 200-day moving average. The move has also put the final touches on transitioning the 50-day moving average of the stock into an intermediate-term bearish trend. This will add to pressure if/when there is a short-term bounce. Traders will take their cue from CSCO stock’s ability to move back above the 200-day trendline within the next week or so. Currently, this moving average is sitting at $31.75 and starting to rollover itself, which would add more selling pressure to Cisco. As if it weren’t enough, CSCO shares are also bouncing on their 20-month moving average. A close below this trendline will mark its official entry into a long-term bear market trend.

You can get a brief overview of the highlights of ASRock's exhibition stand via its blog post overview article. In summary, ASRock is offering a new range of Intel X299 chipset motherboards, Mini-ITX AM4 motherboards, new Bitcoin mining specialist motherboards, a pair of SFF chassis, and its X10 IoT router. However, today I'm going to highlight ASRock's Mini-ITX motherboards for Intel Core-X based, and AMD Ryzen based-systems. The ASRock X299E - ITX/ac is claimed to be "the world's first and only mini-ITX X299 motherboard". It's a tiny size but this motherboard can accommodate a good selection of integrated components and expansion. For example it includes 4x SO-DIMM sockets, two Intel Gigabit LANs, dual band 2.4/5GHz 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, 6x SATA ports, plus triple M.2 sockets onboard. There's a single PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for your graphics accelerator of choice. As AnandTech observes, the board is rather tightly packed, and it reckons that the close integration of the LGA 2066 socket, four DIMM slots, and high-capacity VRMs is a "remarkable engineering achievement". A possible negative side effect could become apparent depending upon your go-to cooling solution, especially as the vertical slot-based USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and an M.2 slot could encroach on the vital space surrounding the CPU socket. Full specs are tabulated below, next to ASRock's Mini-ITX AM4 motherboard specs. ASRock is also pioneering Mini-ITX for AMD Ryzen users. The ASRock Fatal1ty X370 Gaming ITX/ac features the X370 chipset, if you had not guessed. It features all the essentials you might wish for in such a compact motherboard. ASRock is also launching the Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming-ITX/ac. Standard features of the two tiny AMD Ryzen motherboards include two (APU friendly) HDMI outputs, an 802.11ac Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2 solution, 7.1-channel sound with Realtek ALC 1220 codec, and custom heatsinks. Elsewhere on the X370 motherboard there are two DDR4 DIMM slots, two Intel Gigabit Ethernet ports, and USB connectivity via 5× USB 3.0 Type-A, 1 × USB 3.0 Type-C, and 5 × USB 2.0. As you can see in the Anandtech specs list above, the price is far keener than that of the Intel X299 board, possibly half the price, though it is noted retailers might gouge customers as such boards are currently rare and in demand.

That’s the conclusion of an analysis funded by computer-chip maker Intel Corp., which is heavily invested in the driverless car field. If the projections are accurate, the impact of those vehicles, once they become prevalent in coming decades, could touch on areas of life you haven’t considered yet. “Autonomous vehicles will reconfigure time and then space, to some extent, and will ultimately to changes in land use and services,” said Greg Lindsay, a senior fellow at the New Cities Foundation, a nonprofit promoting connected cities. “...Just as automobile ownership in the post-war era led first to a reconfiguring of peoples’ lives... then over decades led to a massive reconfiguring of the U.S. in the form of suburbia and malls.” Intel defines the passenger economy as “the economic and societal value,” including products and services “that will be generated by fully autonomous pilotless vehicles.” It will most likely lead to a sharp decrease in the ownership of personal vehicles as people begin to adopt the mentality of “mobility-as-a-service” in which they arrange for transportation on an as-needed basis. While it will take decades to reach full integration of driverless vehicles, the projected $7 trillion global value will come from three major areas: ■43 percent, or $3 trillion, is expected to come from business use of mobility-as-service. ■55 percent, or $3.7 trillion, would from consumer use of mobility as service. ■Another $203 billion would be generated by new pilotless vehicle services and features. “Ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, are pursuing pilotless fleets with the ultimate goal of (eliminating) the need for drivers and converting what is currently a taxi alternative into, in essence, a public transportation network of shared vehicles...,” the report reads. “Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation.” Automakers would be forced to shift their focus from sales to individual consumers to the ride-sharing and car-sharing economy. “Carmakers may ultimately vie to operate particular networks of vehicles for particular cities — not unlike cities in China today where local taxi franchises are assigned to particular carmakers (also partially owned by the cities,” the report reads. “What is clear is that carmakers will themselves become fleet operators. With electrification, new market participants may challenge existing incumbent car manufacturers for these franchises.” Companies will no longer be handcuffed by driver shortages, as pilotless fleets boost efforts for industries like package deliver and long-haul transportation. Of the $7 trillion impact predicted by Strategy Analytics, $3 trillion will be generated by businesses utilizing mobility-as-a-service. Apartment buildings, hotels and condominiums will likely provide driverless vehicles to tenants and guests as an amenity, and companies could do the same as a perk for employees. For those who want to hang on to their personal vehicles, there will be new opportunities to capitalize on all of that time when cars are not in use. One study estimates those vehicles sit idle 92 percent of the time, and Personal Vehicle Sharing Networks would allow owners to make their cars available for ride-sharing. With the ability of passengers in driverless cars to utilize their ride time more efficiently, the idea of longer commutes may not be so daunting. “Eventually, you’ll see changes in land use, where you start to see, perhaps, the rise of massive new exurban suburbs where people are willing to commute two or three hours a day each way because of how they are able to use their time,” Lindsay said. And those longer commute times, where passengers inside the vehicle are no longer required to have their eyes on the road, create all kinds of opportunities for on-board productivity or entertainment. “The enhanced safety offered by pilotless vehicles will enable the vehicle to finally become a media and entertainment hub,” the report reads. “The number of screens in vehicles will expand and the use of heads-up displays for rich media and other content presentation and viewing will grown steadily.” That sounds like good news to Jim Daniels, manager at WoW Electronics in Eastpointe. The company has been installing electronics in vehicles, old and new, for nearly a decade and a half. And the prospect of autonomous vehicles becoming a moveable entertainment center is intriguing. “I think that might be a boost for us with people having the ability to spend more time with the technology,” he said. “If the car is driving itself, you could have the whole family in the back seat watching movies or going on the internet.” jlynch@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2034 – CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2ruDFjz TOP VIDEOS Impressions of Wednesday's Mackinac Conference 6:41 Flyover of the Little Caesars Arena neighborhood 0:38 Spirit airlines unveils new maintenance hangar at DTW 1:24 Raw video: Taking a hot lap on Belle Isle 3:58 Little Caesars world headquarters hosts 'topping out' ceremony 1:33 Entrepreneur/actor Hill Harper an admirer of Detroit 2:55 Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Small businesses Editorial: Connectivity will drive state’s future The Detroit News Ford Foundation president stresses collaboration Neal Rubin Column: Trump tax cuts will put America back to work Stephen Moore Column: Winning the race in connected technology Wright Lassiter III WeWork, Quicken hand out $2.5M in business contest The Detroit News Grand Rapids loves the high-flying Griffins Ted Kulfan

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 12:58 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Asa Mathat for Vox Media Brian Krzanich at the 2017 Code Conference on June 1, 2017. "Powered by Intel" was a familiar tagline when personal computers ruled the Earth. With the PC market in a slow but stabilizing decline, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said consumers will start seeing the hearing the slogan with a new suite of products. Krzanich spoke on Thursday from the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The chipmaker and enterprise technology company has been investing in technologies like virtual and augmented reality headsets — tools that have cropped up in the sports industry, one of the content areas that really "brought people to the internet," Krzanich said. Intel announced a new deal on Thursday to provide live and on-demand virtual reality experiences for the next three years for Major League Baseball. The deal comes after Intel's high-profile Super Bowl promotion, which let viewers see the game through the eyes of the players. Intel has faced an uphill battle in its traditional arenas, with Qualcomm powering many popular Android phones, and Nvidia becoming increasingly powerful in high-end computers. Meanwhile, PC shipments posted a year-on-year decline of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. But Krzanich pushed back on the idea that Intel is lagging, noting that Intel is among the top companies when it comes to patents, and defends them when needed. (Rival Qualcomm is also near the top of the pack, according to IFI Claims data). Intel has been investing behind the scenes in technologies like cloud servers, drones and self-driving cars, working with regulators and ethics experts on privacy and safety issues.

The study says it's too soon to predict which companies are poised to grab the biggest pieces of the market. This self-driving market includes consumer mobility, business-to-business mobility and pilotless vehicle services. Phil LeBeau | @Lebeaucarnews Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 1:00 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The future of driverless cars    Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 1:15 PM ET | 00:59 Why are so many automakers, tech firms, components suppliers and ride-hailing companies pouring billions of dollars into developing self-driving cars and trucks? In part, it's because the payoff could eventually be worth $7 trillion. That's the estimate of a new study from the research firm Strategy Analytics and Intel, one of several tech giants investing heavily in autonomous-drive systems. "This technology is driving big changes," said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel's Automated Driving Group. "Time will be freed up by people not driving, there will be increased productivity and new goods and services to be consumed." The study predicts a global "passenger economy" will start to grow after the first fully autonomous-drive vehicles hit the market in the next four to five years. At first, there will not be many, and their use will be limited, but by 2035 Intel expects the passenger economy will climb to $800 billion worldwide. In 2050, Intel estimates, the global passenger economy will be worth $7 trillion. While it's too soon to know which companies will profit the most from the new world of transportation, Intel estimates the money will come in three primary areas. $3.7 trillion from consumer mobility-as-a-service Includes: Vehicle car-share and ride-share companies. $2.9 trillion from business/business-to-business mobility-as-a-service. Includes: Freight and self-driving delivery companies. $203 billion from pilotless vehicle services Includes: Consumer businesses like restaurants, health-care providers, entertainment companies. Initially, many of the autonomous vehicle services and benefits will be found in cities and suburban areas with large populations. However, analysts believe self-driving vehicles will also reach rural areas. "There are probably people in a rural area who have as much of a need for autonomous-drive vehicles as someone in a city," said Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility in the global automotive practice at Strategy Analytics. While the dollar impact of the coming passenger economy is huge, the other benefits of widespread adoption are enormous. For example, Intel estimates pilotless vehicles will save at least 585,000 lives between 2035 and 2050.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Intel predicts autonomous cars will spawn a ‘passenger economy’ Dean Takahashi@deantak June 1, 2017 10:00 AM Above: Intel is working with BMW to make self-driving cars a reality. Image Credit: Intel Intel and market researcher Strategy Analytics have applied their collective brainpower to the impact of self-driving cars, and they’re predicting that we’ll see a “Passenger Economy” emerge from all of the services targeted at people while they are no longer driving their cars. By 2050, Intel and Strategy Analytics made the astounding prediction that the passenger economy will have a $7 trillion economic impact. The companies estimated that the passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a car) would be more than twice the size of the sharing economy (based on companies such as Uber or Lyft that share resources across many people) by 2050. I have to remark how easy it is to ridicule this research. Economists have a hard enough time predicting economic change on a monthly basis. Intel paid Strategy Analytics to look at the economy 33 years from now, and it came up with a figure for the passenger economy being worth $7 trillion in 2050. Despite my light-hearted skepticism, Intel and the researchers are dead serious about the huge impact that self-driving will have. Above: Intel believes 5G wireless will bring lots of services to cars of the future. Image Credit: Intel Qualcomm recently looked into the same thing, starting with some very different assumptions. Qualcomm paid for a research paper created by David Teece, professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and market researcher IHS Markit to assess the impact of 5G mobile technology — which Qualcomm is playing a big hand in bringing about — on the economy. That report said 5G would create 22 million jobs and $12.3 trillion in impact on goods and services by 2035. These predictions are surely going to be wildly off the mark, but I won’t be around to check — unless of course there are some real breakthroughs in biotechnology that will keep my brain intact. My prediction is that, thanks to Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the climate change accord, that the headquarters of both Intel and Qualcomm will be underwater by 2050. That said, I find the discussion that these reports trigger to be very interesting. When I think back to debates about the mobile Internet, I recall a lot of fears that Europe and Japan were going to jump ahead of the U.S. because they set aside the proper amount of bandwidth early for it. And in fact, these fears came to pass. Europe and Asia are far ahead in some respects, with faster wireless broadband and better services on top of those networks. Indeed, maybe companies such as WeChat, Kakao, Supercell, and NCSoft would be based in the U.S. if policy makers had moved faster and planted the seeds for a mobile economy. Qualcomm’s study found that 91 percent of those surveyed expect 5G to create new products and services that have yet to be invented. The report assumes that it may take something like a decade for autonomous cars to become mainstream and make a real impact on society. By 2035, the passenger economy will only be about $800 billion. The real growth comes from 2035 to 2050, which is about the same time period when we’ll need to have flying or floating cars because of climate change. Above: Intel and self-driving cars. Image Credit: Intel Greg Lindsay, urbanist, mobility futurist, and coauthor of Aerotropolis: The Way We’ll Live Next, said in a press call about the Intel report that the $7 trillion figure might be really conservative because self-driving cars could be the biggest change in transportation since the creation of the “horseless carriage.” The idea of “mobility as a service” will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations, and usage. Indeed, if I’m not going to drive my car, maybe I don’t need to own it. And if I don’t own it, I won’t take it to Jiffy Lube, and Jiffy Lube will have to serve some giant self-driving car rental agency instead. Mobility as a service is expected to be a $3 trillion industry by 2050, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Above: The breakdown of a $7 trillion passenger economy by 2050. Image Credit: Intel Consumer use of mobility as a service is expected to be about $3.7 trillion of the passenger economy, or 55 percent of the total. And another $200 billion is expected to come from consumer use of innovative applications and services. From 2035 to 2045, the report estimates 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving cars. Collectively, autonomous cars could save us more than 250 million hours of commuting time a year. Reductions in public safety costs could amount to more than $234 billion of the passenger economy from 2035 to 2045. Hmm. Maybe that means there won’t be so many highway patrol jobs? On the other hand, Lindsay said that if it is no longer such a chore to drive, people might not mind traveling to work over a longer period of time, like maybe two hours, because being a passenger isn’t so taxing as driving. Intel envisions onboard beauty salons, touchscreen tablets for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile health care clinics, and treatment pods. And who needs to use valuable real estate to park cars anymore? In fact, it might make a lot of sense for an apartment landlord to offer an autonomous car service as a part of the rent for an apartment. Above: An artist’s illustration was part of the “When Cars Can Talk: Readying the Network for 5G and the Autonomous Driving Era” presentation at Intel’s one-day autonomous driving workshop. Image Credit: Intel Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics and a coauthor of the report, said that we could actually cram more vehicles onto the road because they will be so good at avoiding collisions. That could help us deal with all of the trucks that Amazon puts on the road because it has wiped out stores. And I’m sure that advertisers will find ways to blast us with location-based advertising. Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s automated driving solutions division, said in a call that Intel thinks the history of technology is worth remembering here. We’ve seen massive societal transformations as digital business models were ushered in by personal computing, the Internet, ubiquitous connectivity, and smartphones. She believes autonomous driving will do the same. It’s like looking back at the space race and seeing the unpredictable things — like the semiconductor chips that Intel itself makes — that came from it, Lindsay said. “We started thinking about other evolving economies,” Winter said. “Why do we care about this passenger economy? As more of us understand the future, the more we can plan and adapt. This massive new economy is driving big changes in the way we do things.” In short, I find it fascinating to think about the changes that will come in society as technology advances. But I still have a hard time thinking about these reports as scientific. By the way, I asked if that $7 trillion estimate had a big margin of error. “Based on studies looking on similar market sizings like the adoption of 5G, many come out in a similar vicinity,” said Lanctot said. “There is enough to suggest an acceptable margin of error.” VB Recommendations Why shortcuts for Google Home are a total waste of time Are chatbots just another fad?

The Democratic nominee in last year’s bitterly fought White House race addressed a technology conference in California, speaking at length about what she termed a Moscow-led campaign of “disinformation” against her that influenced the vote. “The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the Intel and counter-intel people I’ve talked to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided,” Clinton told the Recode conference, referring to an avalanche of false information, social media bots and hacks of Clinton campaign emails. Some of those people helping the Russians, she said, had access to “polling and data information.” Asked by a moderator who those individuals might be, Clinton said: “We’re getting more information about all of the contacts between Trump campaign officials and Trump associates with Russians before, during and after the election. So I hope that we’ll get enough information to be able to answer that question.” “I’m leaning Trump,” she said of the connections. “I think it’s pretty hard not to.” The Republican president struck back in a tweet late Wednesday, criticising Clinton for failing to take responsibility for her loss. “Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC,” he said. He was referring to Clinton’s assertions during her talk that fake news about her was spread on Facebook, and that the Democratic Party, unlike the well-funded Republicans, did not have a sophisticated data system. Clinton snapped back at the president in a brief message on Twitter. “People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” she wrote. Trump used the non-existent word in an incomplete sentence tweeted just after midnight Tuesday. The tweet remained online for some 5.5 hours, sparking worldwide ridicule. The message was finally deleted early Wednesday, and Trump joked about it in a subsequent tweet. When White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked about the cryptic word he told incredulous reporters that Trump “and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.” He gave no further explanation. Several US congressional committees have launched investigations into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election and its possible coordination with Trump campaign aides or associates. The Department of Justice has appointed a former FBI director as a special counsel to head a separate, independent investigation. Clinton, who ruled out a new election bid, told Recode that the best example of such coordination took place in October. WikiLeaks released emails hacked from her campaign chief John Podesta within an hour of a 2005 video of Trump boasting about how he could get away with groping women was leaked to the press. “They had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that and they had to be given the go-ahead; ‘OK, this could be the end of the Trump campaign. Dump it now,’” she said. As she had done previously, Clinton also said that then-FBI director James Comey dealt her campaign “a tremendous hit” when he briefly reopened an investigation into her use of a private email account and server just days before the election. “He dumps that on me on October 28, and I immediately start falling,” she said. The presidential vote was November 8. While she said she takes “responsibility” for the loss, Clinton appeared reluctant to publicly discuss her own campaign mistakes. Despite losing the indirect but all-important state-by-state electoral college count, “I won three million more (popular) votes than the other guy,” she said.

Despite inferior performance, Intel has gone from supplying around 30% of iPhone 7 baseband chips in 2016 to 50% in 2017. And experts say it could be supplying over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018. Earlier this year, Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in a California district court for charging unfair prices to license its tech. Qualcomm has since countersued Apple, and withheld around $1 billion in royalty rebates from the iPhone-maker as retaliation for its participation in a Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation. Given the nature of this feud, don’t be surprised to see Apple work to dramatically reduce its reliance on Qualcomm over the next several months. The company recently hired Esin Terzioglu, Qualcomm’s VP of Engineering, to head up a new chip project. It’s believed they are developing their own, in-house baseband modems.

Shareholders Have Something to Worry About The chipmaker’s future relies heavily on its rivals dropping the ball. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jun 1, 2017 at 11:00AM AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which rallied nearly 140% over the past 12 months, is a highly divisive stock among tech investors. The bulls believe that AMD's new x86 Ryzen CPUs and upcoming Vega GPUs can strike critical blows against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their respective markets. The bears meanwhile note that AMD repeatedly failed to beat both bigger chipmakers in the past, and that too much of its future relies on the Ryzen and Vega's success. While I'm not bearish on AMD, I believe that investors should still worry about several major headwinds facing the company. Image source: AMD. The ongoing battle with NVIDIA AMD stole the spotlight from NVIDIA last June by launching the RX 480, which was the cheapest "VR ready" card on the market at $200. But over the next few months, NVIDIA struck back across the low-end market with the GTX 1050 ($109), GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the GT 1030 ($80). The GTX 1050 Ti was approved by Oculus last October, making it the cheapest VR ready card on the market. AMD responded by lowering the price of its VR-ready RX 470 from $179 to $169, but that low-end card still remained pricier than the GTX 1050 Ti. AMD's next big push against NVIDIA will be the launch of its next-gen Vega cards this summer, which could overtake NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards in terms of raw graphical horsepower. However, it's unclear how long that lead will last, since NVIDIA will likely launch its next-gen Volta GPUs for mainstream consumers in early 2018. This upcoming clash could follow the same cycle as the low-end GPU battle last year, with AMD winning the initial benchmarks but provoking a fierce retaliation from NVIDIA. Other potential pain points... The two major gaming consoles -- the PS4 and Xbox One -- are both powered by AMD SoCs. The revenue from those consoles is the core pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit. However, NVIDIA's Tegra chip now powers the Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch, which has been stealing the spotlight from the PS4 and Xbox One with its hybrid design and well-received launch titles. The Switch's success shows that NVIDIA's Tegra has the graphical muscle for hybrid devices, which bodes well for its future in other smaller devices -- like AR/VR headsets, set-top boxes, gaming tablets, or other handheld devices. Image source: Nintendo. When NVIDIA's graphics licensing deal with Intel expired earlier this year, NVIDIA stopped receiving $66 million in "free" revenue per quarter. Earlier this month, rumors suggested that Intel would sign a graphics deal with AMD to replace that deal and give AMD a much-needed injection of "free" revenue. However, Intel later claimed that report was false. The upcoming battle with Intel AMD's new Ryzen chip recently impressed investors when initial benchmarks showed that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches Intel's 8-core Core i7-6900K in single-threaded performance, and beats it in multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. But here's the catch -- the 14nm Ryzen is considered a next-gen chip for AMD, while the Core i7 in the comparison is Intel's current-gen 14nm Kaby Lake chip. AMD also plans to loosen Intel's iron grip on the data center market with Naples, a high-end Zen processor that has more cores than Intel's current-gen Skylake-based Purley CPU. But once again, this is technically a next-gen to current-gen comparison. Intel isn't sitting idly by and letting itself get overtaken by AMD. On the PC front, it plans to launch its newer Coffee Lake (14nm) and next-gen Cannonlake (10nm) chips near the end of 2017. On the server front, Intell could soon release an updated version of Purley which boasts just as many cores (32) as Naples. Why AMD remains a speculative stock The problem with AMD is that it needs its next-gen chips to gain enough traction against NVIDIA and Intel before those bigger rivals strike back with potentially faster chips. If you're a PC owner who wants to upgrade an aging desktop PC, you're likely wondering if you should buy AMD's Ryzen and Vega chips this year, or wait and buy Intel's Cannonlake CPUs and NVIDIA's Volta GPUs instead. Big companies will likely want to see comparisons between Naples and the new Purley chips before authorizing any sweeping upgrades. I'm not saying that AMD is a bad buy at current levels -- it's actually fairly cheap at 2.2 times sales (relative to the industry average of 4 for semiconductor makers). But investors would be foolish not to worry, since AMD's future depends heavily on NVIDIA and Intel's new chips falling short of market expectations.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News politics Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air SENATE Senate panels dueling for witnesses in Russia Investigation By Brooke Singman Published June 01, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print   Two powerful Senate committees are probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election - and possible collusion with the Trump campaign,  but only one panel has managed to line up key witnesses. Both the Senate’s Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are leading separate investigations, but the two panels are dueling for information—and the Senate Intel Committee is winning. Fox News has confirmed that former FBI director James Comey will testify before the Senate intelligence committee on June 8. On May 19, the fired FBI chief declined Judiciary’s request to testify—but this wasn’t Judiciary’s first disappointment. “The Judiciary Committee has primary responsibility for FBI oversight,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who sits on the Judiciary Committee said when Comey declined the panel’s request. “If former Director Comey testifies, he should do so before both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.” Days after Comey’s May 9 ouster, the Intelligence Committee heard testimony from Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. On that same day, Intel committee members met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who penned a letter to the president recommending Comey’s firing. The day after, the Judiciary Committee followed Intel’s lead, and requested the same committee briefing with Rosenstein on May 12, and invited McCabe for one as well, but the committee received no response. Judiciary also requested the Comey memos which reflected conversations he had with President Trump regarding the investigation, and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who reportedly will hand over subpoenaed personal and business records to the Intelligence Committee.  “The FBI said it is still reviewing the request to provide Comey memos following the announcement of special counsel,” a Judiciary committee spokesperson told Fox News in an email on Wednesday. “We’ve not heard back on our requests for briefings from McCabe and/or Rosenstein.” But the Department of Justice downplayed the Judiciary Committee’s concern with a lack of response from Rosenstein, noting he briefed the full Senate May 18. “This request came in before the Deputy Attorney General appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel and before he had briefed all 100 members of the U.S. Senate,” DOJ Director of Public Affairs Sarah Flores told Fox News. “Since that appointment, briefings related to that ongoing investigation from the Department would now be coordinated with Special Counsel Mueller’s office.” When asked about a possible McCabe appearance or response to the Judiciary Committee’s request, an FBI spokesperson told Fox News that the bureau works with “all of our oversight committees on their requests.” But former FBI special agent and former bureau national spokesman John Iannarelli told Fox News that it makes “perfect sense” for top witnesses to choose to provide testimony before Intelligence, rather than Judiciary. “Choosing the Intelligence Committee over Judiciary makes perfect sense because this is for intelligence purposes—has the president or his staff compromised intelligence?” Iannarelli said. “This is an intelligence-based inquiry, anyway.” Iannarelli added: “This could also be further indication that nothing is here that actually compromised sensitive intelligence, especially because Comey agreed to testify in an open setting.” But the Judiciary Committee isn’t giving up. On May 20, Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-IA, took to Twitter and said the Committee would continue. JudiciaryCom must continue FBI oversight even w SpecCounsel Can't wait months for Mueller report Judiciary needs to know so we can act&clear— ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) May 20, 2017 “JudiciaryCom must continue FBI oversight even w SpecCounsel Can’t wait months for Mueller report Judiciary needs to know so we can act&clear,” Grassley tweeted. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sits on both committees, and will have her opportunity to press Comey when he testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office told Fox News they would not comment. Despite media reports that Comey has been cleared by Special Counsel Mueller to testify in public next week, a Mueller spokesperson told Fox News that he had no information on Comey’s potential testimony, or whether Mueller cleared him for public testimony. Congress is currently out of session, and will resume business next Tuesday. Comey will testify before the Intelligence Committee on Thursday, June 8, in an open session, followed by a closed session.  Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Intel’s camera pods will help provide VR streams to fans this season. Photos via Intel. You can now watch MLB games in virtual reality. Starting June 6, MLB will launch a VR livestream of one out-of-market game each Tuesday in June. It’s part of a new 3-year deal with Intel, which is helping power the experience via its Intel True VR app and 4K-resolution camera pods set up at various stadiums around the league. The feed, which is free to access and available on Samsung Gear VR headsets, will let viewers select from five camera angles — home plate, first base, third base, center field, and a special pitcher-batter view — that offer 360-degree views of the live action. Or, they can choose a “sit back” mode that is a fully-produced VR broadcast experience. There are also real-time statistics and exclusive in-app commentary available on the stream. After the game, highlights and on-demand replays of each game will be made available in VR. Here are the four games: Cleveland Indians vs. Colorado Rockies on June 6 at 5:40 p.m. PT / 8:40 p.m. ET Kansas City Royals vs. San Francisco Giants on June 13 at 7:15 p.m. PT / 10:15 p.m. ET Detroit Tigers vs. Seattle Mariners on June 20 at 7:10 p.m. PT / 10:10 p.m. ET St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on June 27 at 6:40 p.m. PT / 9:40 p.m. ET You can download the Intel True VR app here via the Oculus store. David Aufhauser, managing director of strategy and product for Intel Sports Group, told GeekWire that “there will be opportunities for advertisers and sponsorships to be apart of this,” but didn’t offer more details.  This is separate from the VR-ish offering that is going live on MLB’s At-Bat app today. Those feeds, streamed for each game, don’t provide a 360-degree view but instead a two-dimensional format with the normal broadcast view. It’s available for Google’s Daydream View headset. Intel, which partnered with MLB last year during the All-Star Game, continues to push forward in the sports industry. In March, Intel livestreamed the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in virtual reality via a partnership with the NCAA and Turner. It also aired a virtual reality feed from the Players’ Championship last month. This past fall, the company established its Intel Sports Group, right around the time it acquired virtual reality startup Voke. Much of the Intel True VR experience is powered by technology that Voke helped develop — you can hear from Voke co-founder Dr. Uma Jayaram at our upcoming GeekWire Sports Tech Summit. Intel continues to build products and services with wearable computing, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports industry. MLB, meanwhile, isn’t the only league testing virtual reality. The NBA offered its own VR streams this season in partnership with NextVR; NASCAR did something similar last year. MLB announced a live streaming deal with Facebook last month.

Google Cloud has updated its Compute Engine with virtual machine instances, making it the first cloud provider to offer Intel’s Skylake. Google Cloud has become the first major cloud provider to offer Virtual machine instances using Intel’s Skylake processors. The Skylake Xeon processors, which are now generally available, include up to 64 vCPUs and 455GB of RAM supporting a range of compute-intensive workloads, data analytics and engineering simulations. Google Cloud revealed that the customer demand for Intel’s Skylake has increased and since its launch for the Compute Engine in February, customers have run several hours of compute Skylake VMs. According to Google, the new general availability release enables customers to create new VMs with Skylake across all the VM instance types in Compute Engine. This includes standard, highmen, highcpu, Custom Machine types and Preemptible VMs. Read more: Google Cloud boosts machine learning portfolio with Nvidia GPUs The decision to begin offering virtual machine instances using Intel’s processors is a smart move made by Google to compete against its rival cloud providers such as AWS, which announced a set of Skylake-powered C5 instances for its Elastic Compute Cloud in 2016 but are still yet to launch. The Google Cloud Platform also released several updates to its Compute Engine to allow developers to easily select their preferred CPU platform for VMs within a particular Google Cloud region, whilst also being able to choose the suited CPU features. Developers were previously restricted with the amount of RAM space per vCPU they were entitled to, but Google has now extended the memory and removed the restrictions to up memory space to a maximum of 455GB per VM instance. This helps Google offer a wider memory space to user applications that may benefit from flexible memory configurations for better performance. Google Cloud has made Skylake available in three of its regions, Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific with general availability across every region at no extra cost for a limited time.     Tags Google Cloud Platform Intel Processors Previous Article5G – A building block for the smarter city Next ArticleOneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Most read Bluewolf taps Einstein & Watson to bring AI to telecoms Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 UK General Election hacked – 80% think it could happen Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 Cisco Enterprise Agreement revolutionises software licensing James Nunns 31st May 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Editor’s Pick OneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 Red Hat CEO on being an open source zealot James Nunns 31st May 2017 IBM, Cisco team up to fight cyber crime across networks and cloud Ellie Burns 31st May 2017 Related News Using Data Gravity to Accelerate your Business Ellie Burns 2nd June 2017 Adobe Document Cloud adds Scan & Sign James Nunns 2nd June 2017 The Great OpenStack Delusion – how open source cloud infrastructure can overcome a crisis James Nunns 2nd June 2017 Latest in 4th Revolution 4th Revolution Qualcomm patent issued for ‘The Internet of Shoes’ Joe Clark 19th May 2017 4th Revolution Report: Automation boosts revenues 15% and creates, not steals, jobs Ellie Burns 10th May 2017 4th Revolution Self driving car push by Intel sees BMW tie-up and Autonomous Driving Garage Joe Clark 4th May 2017 Latest in Analysis The CEO’s Guide to Data Security – Protect your data through innovation Ellie Burns 3rd May 2017 Why a 3D David Attenborough points to a Planet Earth driven by virtual customer experience Ellie Burns 20th April 2017 Exploring Antarctica with Eugene Kaspersky: From art and penguins, to the Glaciator robot Ellie Burns 18th April 2017 What Is About Us Editorial Team Advertise With Us Contact Us Help Privacy Policy RSS Feeds Site Map White Papers © 2016 COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW.

In the market for a virtual reality headset? You might want to wait. That seemed to be the consensus of industry insiders who gathered at the Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara, Calif., this week. The first mainstream consumer VR headsets, among them the HTC Vive and Sony PlayStation VR, just hit the market last year, and a new crop will likely be ready for shopping carts before the 2017 holiday season. But the quality of the experiences they'll offer isn't quite what many in the industry are striving for. Deficiencies persist in the hardware that powers the headsets as well as the games and other apps that are designed to run on them, experts say. One of the most egregious in terms of how it affects the health of the headset wearer is latency, or the amount of time it takes a nod of the head or other movement to be recognized by the headset's motion processors and displayed on the screen. For Achin Bhowmik, Intel's general manager of perceptual computing, the latency of the first crop of VR devices is better than that of the last, but still leaves a lot to be desired. "I think that we are on this verge of something exciting about to happen, and yet virtual reality has been there before, where it didn't live up to its promises," Bhowmik said at the Expo on Wednesday. "There's a lot of work for us to do." Intel expects the first headsets based on its Project Alloy reference design to hit the market this year. Like other companies, it is striving to get latency below 20 milliseconds, but even that isn't good enough, according to Bhowmik. "I can guarantee that [20 milisecond latency] will not be enough" to eradicate vestibular mismatch, or the feeling of losing your balance, he said. Of course, whether or not you'll get motion sickness in VR depends a lot on the app, too, and Bhowmik implored game developers not to include scenes of, say, a character flying above the Earth at jet-like speeds. But if you are interested in VR because of the potential to experience flight or something else that's impossible in real life, you'll also likely be disappointed with your current options, since programming those experiences requires a different mindset than what is needed for a conventional video game. "In the virtual world, there are no tricks, there are no shortcuts," explained Zvi Greenstein, General Manager at Nvidia's GeForce team. "All the objects must be collidable." In other words, chain-link fences must rattle when you shake them and you should not only see the movement but hear the rattle, too. That's something that you don't often find even among the most heavily-produced first person shooters today. Greenstein is hoping for a VR headset that can power extremely realistic apps. While Nvidia isn't known for software, the company has taken to writing code for things like its recently-unveiled HoloDeck as a way of demonstrating its vision. HoloDeck is a collaboration platform that allows multiple people to examine and manipulate an object—a car, for instance—in virtual reality. It's a good first step, but it's far from perfect, according to Greenstein. Related The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 "We're nowhere near the limits of human perception," he said of the VR industry. Still, there is reason to be excited for the future, even if it means holding off on a planned headset purchase. The next crop of devices will be completely wireless and have better eye tracking, according to HTC Vice President Rikard Steiber. "This is the year where PC-powered VR will go wireless," he said at the Expo. Such incremental hardware improvements may seem minor, but they're worth waiting for because they could prepare the VR industry for its iPhone moment. If that happens, Steiber said, "it's not just a different computing platform, it's an evolution of how we interact with computers."

Callaghan is a 30 year veteran in the high-tech industry. His career of 21 years with Intel Corporation (INTC) included roles as an investor for Intel venture capital arm Intel Capital as well as Business Development roles in the company’s Internet of Things business.   Sensum is a software company whose technology enables businesses to understand and react to how and why people emotionally respond to brands, products, services and experiences. Using emotion AI algorithms, Sensum can show a deeper, contextually aware understanding of the emotional digital self. The Sensum emotional response platform consolidates and interprets multimodal biometric data from wearable-tech, facial coding and eye tracking. The platform also utilises contextual data from surveys, implicit tests and emoji analytics to acquire conscious and unconscious responses, providing a full 360° emotional understanding. In a discussion about Sensum’s future, Damien said  „The next paradigm shift in the development of the digital self is ‚How do I feel?’ – Sensum delivers on this.  Entrepreneurs created the digital platforms to express ‚Who am I?’ via companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn, ‚What am I doing?’ via companies such as Twitter and Instagram and ‚Where am I?’ via companies such as Foursquare and now ‚How do I feel?’ with Sensum.  The application of Artificial Intelligence to emotions to digitally express how one feels is a hugely exciting opportunity.  Sensum have developed algorithms to enable industries to monetize this opportunity.” Commenting on Callaghan’s appointment, Gawain Morrison, CEO & Co-founder of Sensum said, „We are growing fast and building our team and business capabilities to achieve the vision of becoming number one in the field of multimodal emotions AI. It is fantastic that Damien Callaghan has joined us as Chairman to help us accelerate our growth.” Sensum has worked with the likes of Unilever, Red Bull Media House, Jaguar, BBC and many more brands to help them understand the emotions and biometric responses for products, advertising and unique PR events. Their creativity and innovation has featured in New Scientist, The Telegraph, CNBC, Marketing and Impact magazine. Showcased at SXSW, Channel 4’s Fuel4 events, Channel 5’s Gadget Show, the Nordic Games Conference, Nesta, Mobile World Congress, Future Foundation, ESOMAR and AdWeek Europe.

Tech Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic Data Sheet Data Sheet—Thursday, June 1, 2017 Aaron Pressman,Adam Lashinsky Jun 01, 2017 Happy Thursday. Aaron standing in today for Adam, who is traveling to Canada. With the Computex trade show going on in Taiwan this week, we're certainly being treated to a flood of announcements from the formerly forlorn state known as the personal computer market. I got a chance to speak with Gregory Bryant ahead of the show. He's the 25-year Intel veteran who was thrust to the top of the chip giant's PC business just a few weeks ago. The head of Intel's server chip unit, Diane Bryant, had to take a lengthy leave of absence and the company tapped Navin Shenoy, who had only been running PC chips for a year, to fill in for her, creating the opening. Bryant is so bullish on PCs in 2017 you might never know that the industry sold only 260 million units last year, down 26% since 2011. He's also very bullish on Intel, telling me they are "really the only company that can power every segment of this emerging smart connected world all the way from the cloud through the network to the edge devices and kind of everything in between." The 1.5 billion smartphone buyers last year (triple the number from 2011) would probably beg to differ. Aaron Pressman @ampressman aaron.pressman@fortune.com NEWSWORTHY Taking stock. In earnings land, Wednesday was a day for reports from some of the tech companies oriented towards the corporate market. Box said revenue grew 30% to $117 million, more than Wall Street expected. Same story at security expert Palo Alto Networks, where revenue rose 25%. Not so for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which saw revenue decline 22% to $9.9 billion. Moving in the right direction. Results also came on Wednesday for a very large but not yet public company: Uber. The Wall Street Journal reported that first quarter revenue of $3.4 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and its net loss declined 29% to $708 million. Oh, and head of finance Gautam Gupta is leaving. The future of TV. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings repeated his analysis that traditional cable TV "is all going to move to the Internet-it’s all going to be on-demand." But maybe some people in cable land were finally listening. Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav said his industry needs to develop an $8 Internet TV bundle to compete with Hastings. David Marchese at New York magazine has a deeper read about how show creators are handling the changes. John Podesta needs a time machine. Google announced it would better protect Gmail users from hackers with new anti-phishing security checks. Lots of loot. Rumors have been flying about what new hardware Apple might introduce at its upcoming developer conference, WWDC. According to Mac Rumors, the haul could include new MacBook and MacBook Pro models along with a refreshed iPad Pro. MOAR data. Don't have time to review all 355 slides in Mary Meeker's annual state of the Internet report? Fortune's Leena Rao has pulled some highlights, including that global Internet advertising is finally expected to pass TV spending in the next six months and 20% of mobile searches were made using a voice query in 2016. The full report is also online at Kleiner Perkins web site. Look, up in the sky. Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group, had a vision to combine his OneWeb satellite Internet startup with longtime player Intelsat SA. But Intelsat's bondholders wouldn't go along. FOOD FOR THOUGHT Andy Rubin got lots of attention this week, including from Data Sheet, for his new smartphone. But Eric Limer at Popular Mechanics tried to cut through Rubin's rhetoric and analyze just how essential the Essential Phone might be. His conclusion? Not very. What is maybe more noteworthy is the ways it is like other phones out there: It's a $700 rectangular screen with a camera that (probably) runs vanilla Android. In fact, it's quite an awful lot like Google's Pixel, though prettier and without the headphone jack. The things that make it 'special' are unproven at best, meaningless at worst.

For Intel, the pact will serve largely as a branding opportunity to get in front of early tech adopters. According to Intel, there’s demand for baseball in VR. The company commissioned a survey of 500 MLB fans ages 18-64, conducted by Turnkey Intelligence, which found that 71% would be interested in watching an MLB game in VR that they are unable to attend. It isn’t clear, however, whether those consumers would be willing to pay a premium for the VR experience. The “Intel True VR Game of the Week” will let viewers control their vantage point by selecting from up to four camera angles per game; alternatively, they can opt to watch a produced VR broadcast experience. In addition, the Intel VR baseball experience will provide live player and team stats throughout the games plus exclusive commentary. “As a VR partner of MLB, Intel is delivering a truly immersive virtual reality live-stream where fans can experience the excitement of being at the ballpark every week,” said James Carwana, GM of Intel Sports Group. Separately, on Thursday MLB’s At Bat app is scheduled to launch a VR mode, initially for Google’s Daydream headset and Android smartphones. The new VR option will let users access live stats and scores while watching games in HD video, and includes a 3D strike-zone cube as well as a collection of 360-degree on-demand videos. But to watch games in VR video, fans will have to turn to Intel’s VR app for the Samsung Gear. Here’s the lineup of MLB games for the Intel True VR experience in June: Cleveland Indians vs. Colorado Rockies on June 6 at 8:40 p.m. ET Kansas City Royals vs. San Francisco Giants on June 13 at 10:15 p.m. ET Detroit Tigers vs. Seattle Mariners on June 20 at 10:10 p.m. ET St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on June 27 at 9:40 p.m. ET Updates on the Intel True VR Game of the Week are available at intel.com/truevr.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mobileye Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results JERUSALEM, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Total revenue of $124.7 million, an increase of 66% over the same quarter last year GAAP Net Income of $33.5 million; Non-GAAP Net Income of $60.0 million – an increase of 53% and 73% over the same quarter last year, respectively GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.14; Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.25 Generated GAAP net cash from operating activities of $56.6 million; Non-GAAP free cash flow of $41.2 million (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V., the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems („ADAS”) and autonomous driving technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. „Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate,” said Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Mobileye.  „Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM™) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers.” „The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders,”  Mr. Aviram noted.    First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue:  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $124.7 million, compared to $75.2 million in the prior-year period, representing a 66% increase.  Within total revenue, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue was $94.5 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior-year period representing a 54% increase.  EyeQ chip volume increased to 2,032 thousand EyeQ units, compared to 1,322 thousand units in the prior-year period.  EyeQ Average Selling Price (ASP) per unit for the first quarter of 2017 was $45.1, up from $44.2 during the same period last year.  The increase in OEM revenues is the result of new launches and the roll-out of Mobileye technology to more models within existing programs compared to the same quarter last year.  After market (AM) revenue contributed the remaining $30.2 million of total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.8 million in the prior-year period representing a 188% increase. The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017.

The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What Is Windows 10 on ARM, and How is It Different From Windows RT? By Chris Hoffman on June 1st, 2017 Microsoft is working on a version of Windows 10 that will run on ARM hardware. Unlike Windows RT, the version of Windows 8 that powered the original Surface and Surface 2, this will be a full version of Windows 10 with an emulation layer that allows it to run traditional desktop apps from outside the Windows Store. Why Is Microsoft Putting Windows 10 on ARM? RELATED ARTICLE ARM vs. Intel: What It Means for Windows, Chromebook, and Android Software Compatibility ARM PCs have some advantages over x86 ones. They have built-in LTE cellular connectivity, often offer better battery life than Intel and AMD CPUs, and the hardware is less expensive for manufacturers. Future ARM CPUs could pull even more ahead of Intel and AMD CPUs and offer much more battery life, for example. Microsoft would like Windows 10 to run on ARM hardware so it can reap those benefits. Sure, you probably won’t use an ARM desktop any time soon, but ARM could be a great choice for tablets, 2-in-1 convertibles, and even smaller laptops. Rather than creating a more limited version of Windows for this platform, Microsoft has decided to release a full version of Windows 10 for ARM hardware, one that can even run traditional Windows desktop applications. Microsoft first announced a partnership with Qualcomm to create Windows on ARM at WinHEC in December, 2016. It Can Run x86 Desktop Programs This isn’t just Windows RT all over again. Windows RT didn’t allow you to run traditional desktop software. It even blocked developers from compiling their desktop applications for ARM processors and offering them to users. Windows RT only allowed apps from the Windows 8 Store. Windows 10 on ARM is completely different. This is the full Windows desktop experience. Microsoft has created a special emulator layer that allows traditional 32-bit desktop applications to run on ARM processors, so everything should “just work”. Microsoft even showed off a version of Windows 10 Professional on ARM, and said it supports all the usual advanced features you’d find on Windows 10 Professional. The emulation works completely transparently to both users and the programs they run. It uses the same WOW (Windows on Windows) technology that Windows uses to run 32-bit applications on 64-bit versions of Windows today. However, the x86-to-ARM emulation happens entirely in software. That software emulation could be an issue, however. While Microsoft demonstrated Windows 10 on ARM running the desktop version of Photoshop and said it “runs perfectly” on the Qualcomm processor, there’s almost certain to be some slowdown in demanding desktop applications compared to running the same apps without software emulation on an Intel or AMD system. We’ll have to wait to see performance benchmarks when Windows 10 on ARM is released. Don’t get distracted by the emulator, however. This isn’t just an emulated Windows 10 operating system. The Windows kernel, hardware drivers, and all programs included with Windows are native ARM code. Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the Windows Store are also native ARM programs. The emulator is only used when running traditional x86 Windows desktop software. Much of this information comes from a video Microsoft released during BUILD 2017. Support for Older Hardware Devices May Be a Problem While Windows 10 on ARM can emulate traditional desktop applications, it won’t be able to install hardware drivers written for traditional x86 or x64 Windows operating systems. It will need ARM versions of those hardware drivers to support different hardware devices. Microsoft promises that Windows 10 on ARM “will have great device support for USB peripherals using the in-box class drivers”. That’s great for modern USB peripherals. But read between the lines: Devices that aren’t supported by the built-in drivers won’t work. Printer utilities and other hardware driver utilities may not work, either. This could be an issue for older or more obscure hardware peripherals. Windows 10 S Is the New Windows RT It doesn’t matter which type of CPU Windows is running on. You get a full Windows desktop experience with Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Professional, even if you’re using Windows 10 on ARM. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Windows 10 S, and How Is It Different? However, Microsoft did just announce Windows 10 S, a more limited edition of Windows 10 that can only run software from the Windows Store—just like Windows RT did. This has nothing to do with Windows 10 on ARM. In fact, the Windows 10 S devices Microsoft announced all run on standard Intel or AMD processors. Microsoft hasn’t mentioned Windows 10 on ARM and Windows 10 S together yet, presumably to avoid any confusion. However, even if Microsoft does ship Windows 10 S on ARM PCs, you’d be able to pay to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and get the ability to install desktop apps, just as you can with Windows 10 S on Intel and AMD PCs. In other words, with Windows 10, ARM is just another hardware platform that’s treated the same—it just needs an emulation layer to make that possible. Windows 10 S is a limited version of Windows that can run on any hardware platform. When Will It Be Released? Microsoft said devices will be released “later this year” in 2017. Qualcomm also told investors that the first Windows on on ARM laptop would be released sometime in the fourth quarter of 2017. It will pair Windows 10 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (17 REPLIES) Got Feedback?

JERUSALEM, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Total revenue of $124.7 million, an increase of 66% over the same quarter last year GAAP Net Income of $33.5 million; Non-GAAP Net Income of $60.0 million - an increase of 53% and 73% over the same quarter last year, respectively GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.14; Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.25 Generated GAAP net cash from operating activities of $56.6 million; Non-GAAP free cash flow of $41.2 million (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V., the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ("ADAS") and autonomous driving technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. "Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate," said Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Mobileye.  "Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM™) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers." "The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders,"  Mr. Aviram noted.    First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue:  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $124.7 million, compared to $75.2 million in the prior-year period, representing a 66% increase.  Within total revenue, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue was $94.5 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior-year period representing a 54% increase.  EyeQ chip volume increased to 2,032 thousand EyeQ units, compared to 1,322 thousand units in the prior-year period.  EyeQ Average Selling Price (ASP) per unit for the first quarter of 2017 was $45.1, up from $44.2 during the same period last year.  The increase in OEM revenues is the result of new launches and the roll-out of Mobileye technology to more models within existing programs compared to the same quarter last year.  After market (AM) revenue contributed the remaining $30.2 million of total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.8 million in the prior-year period representing a 188% increase. The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the "Mobileye Campus") that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon ("Kisalon") formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation ("Intel") and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the "Purchaser") pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the "Offer"), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company's Notice of Annual General Meeting ("AGM").  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as "believes," "intends," "expects," "projects," "anticipates," and "future" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company's current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Batsmen Will Use Smart Bats During Current Champions Trophy Aadil Shadman 3 days ago Cricket is all about technique and for viewers, it’s all about real-time information and statistics. To add more excitement to the game of cricket, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has partnered with popular chip maker, Intel. Together, they plan to introduce smart bats during the upcoming Champions Trophy 2017 in England. These smart bats will actually use chips, dubbed BatSense, that allow them to sense the bat swings. Batsensing Bats Three players from all international teams will have a Bat Sensor installed on top of their bats. The chip will generate data on each swing of the bat. In a statement, ICC said “The new bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays.” The statement adds, “With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed, and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast.” Impact of BatSense The sensors are developed by Intel and sports startup Specular. Useful insights like the back-lift angle, bat speed, impact momentum and follow-through will be measured using the sensors. These figures will be transmitted back to coaches for immediate analysis while broadcasters will be able to use the info to bring exciting content to the viewers. Following Hawk-Eye, which changed the whole cricketing scenario thanks to the use of high speed cameras and ball tracking technology, the new sensors can revolutionize the batting aspect of cricket. Studio pundits will be able to explain a player’s performance or weaknesses and how certain players can improve their gameplay or technique. Coaches and players will benefit the most and will be able to fine-tune training sessions. Players Who Will Use BatSense While it is almost confirmed that three players from each team will have BatSense-installed bats, the names of these players are yet to be announced. For now, we know of Indian and English players who will have the chips on their bats. England: Ben Stokes, Alex Hales, Jason Roy India: Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin More in Tow ICC plans to modernize the game by bringing upcoming technologies to the cricketing field. While similar bat-sensing tech has already been used in baseball bats, tennis racquets and golf clubs, it’s a first for cricket. Now, ICC is ready to incorporate VR and pitch reading drones. Everything is explained in the video below: What About Us? Specular has revealed that a consumer version of BatSense will be released later this year. People will no longer need expensive trainers or months of trial and error to improve their skills. If anyone wants to bat like AB de Villiers or Chris Gayle, they will be able to use VR technology and the bat sensors along with a digital trainers. Cricket fans, expect great times ahead with new ways of improving your game.

Vinod Yalburgi   June 1, 2017 15:56 IST ICC to bring advanced technology for analysing pitch and player's bat-swing stats at ICC Champions Trophy 2017Intel Newsroom The use of technology in sports has become a norm these days as tech gadgets have often proved invaluable in analysing a player's strengths and weaknesses. International Cricket Council has now revealed that it has been working with American tech giant Intel to bring pitch analysis tech, bat sensor and new virtual reality (VR) experience to the audience at the Champions Trophy 2017. The Champions Trophy kicked off on Thursday, June 1, with England taking on Bangladesh at The Oval, London, and avid cricket fans can get the best cricketing experience with the advent of new technology into the game. According to ICC, we will be seeing a new drone technology for handling advanced pitch analysis and a new VR experience for fans at the stadium. Team data analysts and coaches could now get busy with the new bat sensor technology from Intel, which enables accurate analysis of bat speed, the batsman's back-lift angle, and time to impact with the bat after the ball is released by the bowler. The new bat sensor is powered by Intel's Curie technology and can be attached to any cricket bat to collect stats on the player's bat-swing. Thereby players and coaches can monitor the batsman's strokes and help him correct his bat swing for improving his overall game. Here are a few excerpts from Intel's official post: With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich storytelling during broadcasts. Virtual reality (VR) experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston will allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skills against a virtual bowler. Avid cricket fans can now entertain themselves in an immersive world of virtual reality at select matches, wherein they will be allowed to test their batting skills while facing deliveries from a virtual bowler, using a head-mounted display (HMD). Apart from England and Bangladesh, six more nations including India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka and England will take part in the ICC Championship Trophy 2017.

Elmor, a processor performance enthusiast overclocked Intel Core i9-7900X. This deca-processor has a base clocking of 3.3 GHz. It clocks to a staggering 4.3 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 and to 4.5 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. However, Elmor overclocked i9-7900x to an unbelievable 5.7 GHz using Liquid Nitrogen cooling setup. This high end desktop platform scored 3181 points setting up a Cinebench world record. Also Read: How Intel's Compute Card Can Shape Up the IoT Market in The Year 2017 The feat was achieved on the following setup, ASUS Rampage V1 Apex X299 motherboard with G.Skill DDR4 memory and an ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Strix Gaming graphics card. Elmor had previously overclocked the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X at 5.8 GHz which scored 2454 on Cinebench. The competition will certainly heat up once Intel starts shipping its latest line of processors later this year. AMD's more than successful Ryzen series is about to face a tough competition from its arch rival. The 10 core, 20 threaded i9-7900X has been priced at $999 (approx Rs.) which is half the price consumers will pay for i9-7980XE. There are also series of 16, 14 and 12 core processors from Intel ready to be shipped. Everything said and done, the overclocking tests are interesting to watch however the practical implication of the Liquid Nitrogen cooled setup is still a possibility awaiting exploration.

Tech Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic Intel Intel’s New Head of PC Chips Faces Revived Competition Aaron Pressman Jun 01, 2017 Gregory Bryant, Intel's new head of desktop and laptop processors, picked a good time to take over the volatile and long-challenged business unit. Personal computer shipments industrywide showed small signs of growth in the first quarter—rising 0.6% according to market tracker International Data Corp. But no matter the size of the uptick, it was the first growth in five years. Intel's own PC chip unit saw revenue shoot up 6%, as sales of higher-priced CPUs aimed at gamers and content creators more than made up for slipping sales at the low end. And after years of delays and disappointments, Intel's CPU roadmap for 2017 and 2018 looks strong and on schedule. "I can say that we're kind of in a little bit of a renaissance," Bryant tells Fortune in his first interview since taking the new post a few weeks ago, formally the head of Intel's $33 billion client computing group, or CCG. Bryant reports to group president Murthy Renduchintala, the former Qualcomm (qcom) executive brought in at the end of 2015 to stabilize Intel's PC and mobile businesses. Promoted from running strategy and product development for the connected home products unit at Intel (intc), Bryant points to the rash of new applications requiring higher performance computing, from virtual reality to e-sports video gaming, that have lately been driving sales higher and enticing new manufacturers, like Chinese phone giants Xiaomi and Huawei, to make PCs for the first time. "There's just a lot of kinds of new innovation that's happening in the industry and then we're even seeing some new entrants," the 25-year Intel veteran says. "It's a good indication of some of the return to innovation and health in the business." Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Intel offered a host of its own innovations at the Computex trade show in Taiwan this week. Bryant unveiled the chip giant's newest line of CPUs, dubbed the Core X series, led by a monster chip called the Core i9 Extreme Edition, which will have 18 cores and cost about $2,000. The high-end processor, suited for 4K video editing or rendering complex virtual reality game environments, can hit a performance benchmark once reserved for supercomputers: the teraflop, or one million million floating point operations per second. "It's hard to get your head around if you’ve been in the industry for a long time like I have," Bryant says. "But just imagining that in terms of raw compute that we essentially have a teraflop CPU in a desktop PC form factor is kind of amazing." Intel famously built the first supercomputer capable of a teraflop. Known as ASCI Red, the behemoth was made for the U.S. government to simulate the decline of weapons in the country's nuclear arsenal after the end of live explosive tests. Put into operation almost exactly 20 years ago, ASCI Red was the fastest supercomputer in the world for three years running and wasn't retired until 2006. If it's humility that you're expecting, Bryant isn't offering any. Intel completely missed the smartphone revolution and has zero market share in phone processors, which have been dominated by chips based on ARM Holdings designs and made by Apple (aapl), Samsung and Qualcomm. In corporate and cloud data centers, Intel is doing well but has no graphics chip-based products, a rapidly growing niche dominated by rival Nvidia (nvda). But there don't seem to be any holes in Intel's product line according to Bryant. "We really believe we're a leading company and really the only company that can power every segment of this emerging smart connected world all the way from the cloud through the network to the edge devices and kind of everything in between," he says. Despite the confidence and the improving market conditions, Bryant and Intel face a renewed competitive threat in 2017 from Advanced Micro Devices (amd), the only other chipmaker compatible with Intel's own x86 architecture. AMD's new Ryzen line includes CPUs that can match the performance of much more expensive Intel chips. And AMD announced its own monster chip, perhaps anticipating the Core i9 announcement, dubbed the Ryzen Threadripper and including 16 cores. At the Computex show, AMD disclosed that the Threadripper chip will have considerably more bandwidth to connect to graphics cards, disk storage and other peripherals than any of Intel's newest chips. It likely will be months before reviewers and analysts can benchmark real world systems pitting the two monster chips against each other, however. Towards the end of the year, Intel will counter again, introducing systems with its 8th generation CPU design. Bryant wouldn't say much, except to note that the new chips are performing much better than Intel initially expected. The chipmaker had said it was expecting a 15% gain from the new line compared to the current 7th generation Kaby Lake line. But Bryant now says that the gain looks to be about 30%. That will come in handy as AMD pushes its Ryzen architecture further and faster over the next few years as well. "We really recognized the opportunity in the enthusiast space and we really stepped on the gas, we really stepped on the accelerator in this space, a while back," Bryant says. "And I think you're seeing that play through now." Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Intel just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. Intel's new X299 platform and accompanying Core X-Series processors raise the bar for CPU and memory performance with up to 18 cores and 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. And they add bandwidth for multiple graphics cards and NVMe SSDs with up to 44 PCIe lanes through the CPU and even more from the chipset. It's an incredibly potent platform we've used to create the Prime, TUF, and ROG X299 families.     Based on Intel's X299 chipset, the ROG, Prime and TUF series feature state-of-the-art connectivity and control options designed for gamers, power users and prosumers   ROG has three models expertly tailored for different priorities: the Rampage VI Extreme lives up to its name for drool-worthy dream machines with custom liquid cooling and ultra-fast networking, the Rampage VI Apex unabashedly targets peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking, and the Strix X299-E provides gamers the powerful tuning, cooling, and personalization options they need to get the most from their rigs. ROG does more than just offer checkbox features-we take the time to ensure each one is empowering for enthusiasts and accessible for beginners.   The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same.   Shared innovations define the ROG X299 family All three boards share the same DNA - essential features that enthusiasts in the Republic of Gamers demand. That starts with critically acclaimed overclocking and cooling controls for liquid and air. There are dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in-one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for optimal efficiency and quiet acoustics. Sensor grouping lets your cooling react to a mix of workloads, including GPU-heavy gaming via direct temperature monitoring for select graphics cards. Tuning your gaming PC is easy whether you want to perfect your setup with manual tweaking or automatically configure and overclock the whole thing with a single click using our 5-Way Optimization utility.   Gaming PCs provide unprecedented options to express your style, including through personalized lighting. The RGB LEDs embedded on our boards are augmented by headers for multiple RGB LED strips to illuminate your entire chassis. All of the lighting is part of our Aura Sync ecosystem, which synchronizes harmoniously across compatible ROG graphics cards, peripherals, and monitors, along with other components from our partners.   Equipped with the latest generation of SupremeFX integrated audio, ROG's new X299 motherboards boast enhanced recording quality for streamers who want their voice to come through clearly. Graphics cards plug into reinforced SafeSlots that protect against damage from heavy GPU coolers and rough handling.   Intel's VROC technology combines with our optional add-in card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. You can hit ludicrous speeds with enough capacity for overflowing game libraries. You get all the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports and internal headers pushing speeds up to 10Gbps. Onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking are standard equipment, and you can add Intel's new Optane memory as a high-speed cache.   Imagine your dream machine with the Rampage VI Extreme The flagship of this new family is the Rampage VI Extreme, which balances power and design to elevate showcase PCs. It's made specifically for machines with custom liquid cooling. Along with all of the usual fan and pump headers, we added dual flow headers that let you monitor the coolant coursing through your loop. There's also a special connector that lets water blocks designed for the Extreme provide flow, temperature, and leakage data.   Almost every aspect of the Rampage VI Extreme has been enhanced to give you more. The Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller is bolstered by an onboard 10Gbps chip capable of increasing networking throughput by an order of magnitude. We've also upgraded the Wi-Fi to the latest 802.11ad standard, increasing wireless bandwidth up to 4.6Gbps.   To help avoid unsightly wiring, three M.2 SSDs can be added to the board without using the VROC card. One slots under the Extreme's outer skin, while the other two ride our DIMM.2 module next to the memory slots. The onboard Thunderbolt header lets you extend high-speed connectivity to external devices with our optional add-in card.   New for X299, the Rampage VI Extreme integrates a LiveDash OLED screen that lets you monitor system temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds right on the board. The dashboard also displays custom messages and graphics to add a little extra flair to your build. It's complemented by enough onboard LEDs and strip headers to put on a show.   Set performance records and game with the Rampage VI Apex ROG's commitment to pursuing the highest overclocks and top performance manifests in the Rampage VI Apex. This model is purpose-built for setting records at sub-zero temperatures - not just with LN2, but also with exotic liquid helium. Our overclocking experts have already used the Apex to take 8 world records and 20 global records with the Core X-processor reaching 7.560GHz, and we're just getting started. Expect more records to fall as we cement ROG's legacy as the absolute performance leader.   Less is more on the ragged edge. The Apex has only one DIMM slot per channel, which allows optimized trace routing that can improve stability with the fastest memory kits. You can load the board with 64GB of DDR4 memory running at blistering speeds and extremely low latencies. Memory is flanked by dual DIMM.2 slots that take up to four M.2 SSDs between them.   The Rampage VI Apex proudly wears its attitude on its sleeve - or rather PCB. The distinctive shape visually sets the Apex apart from the competition, while the customizable name plate provides space to add a personal touch. You also get the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports, onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking plus SupremeFX audio technology for those times when you want to game instead of setting records.   Game in style with the Strix X299-E Where the Rampage VI Extreme and Apex are highly specialized, the ROG Strix X299-E takes a more straightforward approach. It represents an affordable entry point into the Republic of Gamers without sacrificing the looks and features that define the number one gaming brand.   Like its Rampage siblings, the Strix wears a monochrome motif that won't clash with other components or your lighting choices. Featuring standard ATX dimensions, the Strix still comes with all of the slots, ports, and headers you expect from ROG. This includes dual M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs, Intel Gigabit networking, onboard Wi-FI, USB 3.1 Gen 2, SupremeFX audio technology with Sonic Studio III and class leading RGB options featuring Aura Sync.   Ready for liquid cooling and RGB lighting, the Strix X299-E has headers for dual pumps and both standard and addressable LED strips. We also include a couple of extension cables that make it much easier to get the look you want.   Prime time for X299   Built for power users and prosumers, the Prime series represents the culmination of decades of experience refining all aspects of motherboard technology. These boards mate state-of-the-art connectivity with accessible tuning options to provide a premium experience everyone can enjoy.   All of our X299 motherboards have extensive overclocking and cooling options available in both the UEFI and software. The Primes go one step further with 5-Way Optimization, which intelligently overclocks your system and tunes the cooling based on the individual characteristics of your components. Beginners can effortlessly optimize their entire PC with a single click, while experienced users can adjust tuning parameters to meet their needs.   Refinement extends to the styling, whose predominantly black-and-white theme lays the perfect foundation for understated builds-or much flashier ones with RGB lighting. Our Prime X299 boards feature multiple headers for LED strips that can light up your entire chassis. They're part of a rich ecosystem of Aura Sync products that can synchronize colors and effects across a complete system.   Intel's new Core X-Series processors demand serious cooling, which is why all of our new X299 motherboards have dedicated headers for all-in-one liquid coolers and stand-alone pumps. Our Prime X299 series also support up to three-way graphics configurations, and their x16 slots incorporate structural reinforcements with our SafeSlot technology to prevent damage and protect your investment.   PCIe lanes left unused by graphics can be devoted to storage with VROC, which combines multiple M.2 SSDs in a bootable RAID array connected directly to the CPU. An insane number of drives can run in parallel across multiple VROC cards to deliver staggering throughput and warp fast access for system drives. Intel's Optane Memory technology is supported, which provides a solid state cache to accelerate other storage devices.   This new Prime series receives our latest on-board audio enhancements, including a Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier and premium components that produce immersive and crystal clear sound which rivals some dedicated sound cards.   The Prime X299-Deluxe has everything Our Deluxe motherboards set the template for high-end builders who want it all, and the new Prime X299-Deluxe continues that proud tradition. It adds pretty much everything you could want on a high-end motherboard, from ultra-fast I/O to cutting-edge aesthetic enhancements.   After setting the bar for RGB lighting with Aura Sync, we're raising it with new customization features that take personalization to the next level. Chief among them is support for addressable lighting strips that offer independent control over each LED on the line, setting the stage for considerably more advanced effects. The Deluxe has headers for addressable and conventional RGB LED strips, plus dual onboard light bars that run down the I/O shield and chipset heat sink.   The chipset heat sink also houses the all-new LiveDash, an integrated OLED screen capable of displaying valuable system information and custom graphics. You can see vital stats like temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds without alt-tabbing away from games and other full-screen tasks. LiveDash can also display text messages and graphical animations to set your rig apart from the rest.   Ultra-high-speed storage is available in multiple form factors, and the Deluxe supports them all. In addition to offering a U.2 port for enterprise-grade SSDs, it comes with dual M.2 slots for gumstick-sized NVMe drives. Both M.2s are situated with thermals in mind; the main slot sits under the chipset heat sink, which reduces drive temperatures, while the secondary one mounts drives vertically near the DIMM slots, where they can be exposed to airflow generated by system fans.   Networking gets a boost from next-gen Wi-Fi with an integrated 802.11ad module. The dual-band solution can push wireless rates up to 4.6Gbps-several times the speed of most wired connections. And the Deluxe has you covered on the wired front, too, with dual Intel Gigabit Ethernet controllers delivering fast and reliable connectivity.   There's only so much we can squeeze onto a motherboard without exceeding standard ATX dimensions, so the Prime X299-Deluxe comes with a couple of sidekicks. Our ThunderboltEX 3 card is included, providing 40Gbps of bandwidth to external peripherals. We also bundle our Fan Extension card, which expands the board's already generous assortment of fan headers and temperature sensors. If you want one board with everything, the Deluxe is it.   Distill the essentials with the Prime X299-A Although the Prime X299-A features many of the same technologies as the Deluxe, it eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics. The combination of core Prime features with the latest Intel platform produces an enticing board.   Like its big brother, the X299-A supports up to three-way graphics configurations across a trio of x16 slots. You can add VROC arrays via our add-in card, if the two onboard M.2 slots are not enough. Essential I/O is fully covered, including an USB 3.1 Gen 2 internal header for chassis' that support the new 10Gbps standard, plus Type-A and reversible Type-C ports at the rear.   With a more sedate design than its sibling, the Prime X299-A can still light up your PC with RGB effects. The board has dual headers for off-the-shelf LED strips, each of which supports up to two meters of lighting at optimal brightness. The colors, effects, and tastefulness of the resulting glow is entirely up to you.   The Prime X299-A shows that affordable Core X-Series motherboards need not skimp on the features you crave. It has everything needed for an entry-level build, plus room to grow into something much more formidable.   TUF enough to endure Our Prime X299 motherboards are balanced by entries from the TUF family. These models march to a different beat that prioritizes reliability and durability for PCs built to go the distance. They use tougher components than conventional counterparts, and they're subjected to more stringent testing.   Shifting focus requires a new outlook, and TUF answers with distinctive designs that meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine. Stealthy by nature, the new boards minimize RGB lighting to concentrate on different priorities.   Arm yourself with the TUF X299 Mark 1 A new coat of reinforced armor makes the TUF X299 Mark 1 stand out from its predecessors. The protective cover streamlines airflow over the board and prevents dust from accumulating in nooks and crannies. Airflow beneath the surface is generated by a dedicated fan that also directs cool air toward the primary M.2 slot that further improves thermals.   Managing thermals is critical to maintaining stability when systems are pushed to the limit, especially on a high-end desktop platform. The TUF X299 Mark 1 is laced with additional temperature sensors to monitor different zones on the motherboard and in your system as a whole. Sensor data is fed into Thermal Radar 3 software that intelligently manages your cooling to keep temperatures and acoustics low.   The updated armor is our strongest yet, but the Mark 1's real strength comes from its Fortifier backplate. This rear reinforcement uses a carefully shaped and folded metal plate to stiffen the board against warping that now includes a removable GPU Holder that supports the weight of sagging graphics cards. And, as an added bonus, it helps dissipate thermal energy from multiple hot spots on the back of the PCB.   TUF Detective reprises its role as smartphone-powered troubleshooter and monitoring utility. Unlike previous iterations, which require a wired USB connection, the latest version performs diagnostics wirelessly over Bluetooth using the included USB adapter.   As the flagship of the TUF family, the Mark 1 also adds several perks. The glowing logo at the center of the board changes based on the load to show how hard the system is working. There are dual Intel Gigabit LAN controllers plus all the flavors in the USB 3.1 Gen2 rainbow: old-school Type-A, reversible Type-C, and internal header.   Welcome the X299 Mark 2 into the TUF family TUF strips down to the essentials with the X299 Mark 2. Like the Prime X299-A, the board delivers all the features of the new Intel platform, plus must-have ASUS innovations like advanced overclocking, cooling and tuning options. It removes the armor and backplate in favor of a naked PCB with a darker motif that blends into the shadows. The Mark 2 makes TUF more accessible for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula.   AVAILABILITY & PRICING   ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June with the Strix series arriving first. ASUS Prime X299-Deluxe, Prime X299-A and TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June.

The Alphabet subsidiary says that Skylake Xeons are now generally available and that it is “the first and only public cloud to deliver Intel’s next-generation Xeon server processor”. That's the kind of thing server-makers used to trumpet in the hope those with a need for speed would shop with a perhaps-unfamiliar supplier to get their hands on more clock cycles. The arrangement with Google looks similar: The Register understands that Intel cut a custom Xeon for the Alphabet subsidiary to use in the knowledge it would shout long and loud about the new Xeon's many fine qualities. Google's not, however, sharing a lot. It is saying that Skylake-Xeon-powered instances have clock speed of 2.0 GHz and let you build virtual machines with up to 64 vCPUS and 455 GB of RAM. We still don't know exactly what's inside Skylake Xeons, which is no surprise given that Intel's only revealed branding for the CPUs and plans to reveal specifics about their their innards in coming days ahead of their mainstream launch. For now we have Google's assurance that the CPUs are well-suited to demanding applications, but that they're nonetheless ready to roll inside its standard instances, as well as the gruntier highmem, highcpu, Custom Machine Types and Preemptible VMs. For now they're only offered in Google's Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific regions, but the company says “we have more capacity arriving every day, and support for additional regions and zones coming in the near future.” Google's also added a new “Minimum CPU Platform” feature that lets you specify the worst CPU you're willing to use in its cloud. The company has admitted it has a fleet mixing Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell silicon. The new feature means if you specify Haswell, you'll never run on the older Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Google Intel Cloud Skylake Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Supermicro sockets it to Skylake rivals Comment Word to your motherboard 7 Comments Supermicro boasts of secret super server Silicon Valley win 30,000+ into a single 'valley data centre - but whose is it? 9 Comments SuperMicro, IBM hook up Adding POWER servers yo its Xeon Ultra line Fancy a wee quasi-DRAM?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Cricket: England trio to pioneer bat sensors in Champions Trophy Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. — AFP Relaxnews England trio Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes will be among the players from around the world pioneering new bat sensors during the upcoming Champions Trophy, it was announced Tuesday.  Technology giant Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. The aim is to both provide more information to television audiences and, longer term, develop a coaching aid. Former England captain turned cricket broadcaster Nasser Hussain told a news conference at The Oval: "How many times have we spoken about people having 'fast hands' or 'great bat speed'? "But what does that mean? We've never quantified it." Hussain, speaking ahead of the Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday, said he would have benefitted had this technology been available in his career. "When I first played for England, I had never really seen myself on television. I remember playing in Jamaica, getting out and walking through the hotel lobby and Geoffrey Boycott shouting at me 'Hussain, you'll never get any runs with that open bat face'. "Something like this can show you the exact angle of your bat." Hussain said Roy, going through a run drought that has yielded four single figure scores in his last five one-day international innings, might gain from the new system. "Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say 'is everything I'm doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?' and if you know it was, you know that's not the issue." Hussain added: "There will be traditionalists thinking 'is this relevant?'. "But if it gives you that one percent to improve the game, someone will be using it." Other innovations at the Champions Trophy include the use of high-technology drones to provide more in-depth pitch analysis and a virtual reality system that allows fans to experience what it's like to face the world's best bowlers. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, speaking alongside Hussain, welcomed the developments by saying: "If the technology is available to enhance and amplify the cricket experience, over the years we've shown a real willingness to trial and support it. "Our long-term vision is to make cricket the world's favourite sport and really there's only one way to achieve this – to keep the fans engaged and interested in the game." The former South Africa wicket-keeper added:  "That's all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology." — AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested Waze unveils carpool app Cost vs convenience: is it worth having your own printer?

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

This particular motherboard is "designed for gamers and PC enthusiasts who love performance," and features high-end tools for overclockers including a 10 phase DigitALL power design with Loadline Calibration and MSI's Turbo Socket.     The X299 GAMING M7 ACK also features M.2 Shield FROZR to cool M.2 SSDs, Audio Boost 4 PRO, which allows users to use two headphones and speakers at the same time, as well as a three-way conjunction of Killer networking hardware to ensure optimum online gaming. MSI's premium X299 mobo also features Mystic Light RGB along the board's heat sinks and covers, offering 16.8 million colors combos and 17 LED effects.     Next up is the MSI Performance Series, which includes the X299 GAMING PRO CARBON AC and X299 GAMING PRO CARBON motherboards. Let's start with the first one: the Gaming Pro Carbon AC is touted as "a modder's dream" and is the world's first motherboard to allow users to change-out the stock heat sink covers and X-Mount accessories with custom 3D-printed and modded covers, but MSI provides three color options: black, silver, and gold.     The board also comes with Mystic Light RGB LEDs and many of the premium M.2 cooling, audio boost, game boost, and Killer LAN networking features as the other models.   The X299 Gaming Pro Carbon is essentially the same as the X299 Gaming Pro Carbon AC besides the swappable custom covers.     Last but not least we have MSI's Aresnal Gaming series, which is comprised of the X299 Tomohawk and X299 SLI Plus.     The X299 Tomohawk's main selling point is its solid reinforced design. The motherboard features stainless steel heat sinks and a "Steel Armor" design that's built with Military Class 5 components, making it "unbreakable in any gaming session."   The X299 Tomohawk also features front-facing USB Type-C for a myriad of different devices, and rocks the premium features of MSI's motherboard series including VR boost and game boost, along with Audio Boost 4 with Nahimic 2 to deliver "next level sound quality".     The MSI X299 SLI Plus is "engineered to gratify even the most demanding professional" and features premium power phases and high-end military class components to ensure optimum reliability. In fact, MSI boasts that the X299 SLI Plus is the "strongest SLI PLUS we've ever built."   "The X299 SLI PLUS adopts premium Dual Intel® LAN, optimized for maximum transfer speeds by reducing CPU overhead and offering exceptionally high TCP and UDP throughput. Featuring 15KV protection, the X299 SLI PLUS also shields your network from lightning strikes and static electricity.   "Combining MSI exclusive System Saver design, users will never have to worry about a system issue. Simply use one of the System Saver's options to guarantee a successful boot up. For maximum data transfer performance and latest generation SSD support, the X299 SLI PLUS adopts the latest Turbo U.2 and Twin Turbo M.2 with Steel Armor.   "For the best DDR4 memory compatibility and stability, DDR4 boost with Steel Armor is included. The X299 SLI PLUS motherboard will make anyone's professional life easier with super stable, reliable and long-lasting top performance.     MSI also notes that its full fleet of X299 motherboads are the first to feature the new ASMedia ASM3142 USB 3.1 controller to enable maximum high-speed performance. In fact, all the front-facing USB Type-C connectors featured on MSI's X299 motherboards have been upgraded from Gen1 to Gen2 for improved performance and transfers. >> NEXT STORY: Thermaltake announces tempered glass full-tower PC case << PREVIOUS STORY: GIGABYTE reveals new fleet of Aorus X299 motherboards Related Tags Computex 2017 Intel X299 X299 MSI MSI X299 Motherboards Motherboards Intel BitFenix Corsair Phanteks Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD Radeon RX series cards are hard to buy right now New iPhone 8 rumors leak from trusted source Huawei to unveil the Honor 9 on June 12 ASRock delivers with an X299 mITX motherboard GDDR6 arrives in early 2018, GDDR5X hits 16GbpsView More News Posts Forum Activity Z97 Extreme won't go past BIOS - dead mobo?? i have a very problem,help please ASRock C2550D41 Stuck Booting Up Amped Wireless Helios-EX AC2200 Range Extender Review z68x-ud3-b3 REVIVED?

Huawei P10, P10 Plus launch in South Africa Samsung Galaxy S8 review: a great phone, but not Galaxy S7 great Computers / Intel Core i9: six things worth knowing By Hadlee Simons on 31 May, 2017 Intel made a huge splash this week when it announced the Core i9 processor. Of course, 9 is higher than 7 (duh), so you’d expect it to be powerful (bigger duh). But what are the key things to know about the new chip? A lot of cores and threads The Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition has a monster 18 cores and 36 threads, clearly being designed for the one-percenter wanting to one-up their middle class friends. Otherwise, the company says the new chips are made with “advanced gaming, VR and content creation in mind”. It’s part of Intel’s new X-Series family Yep, the Core i9 isn’t the only new chip brought to market by Intel, as it’s actually part of a family of ultra high-end processors. Other chips include the standard Core i9 7900X (10 cores/20 threads), the Core i7 7820X (8 cores/16 threads), Core i7 7800X (6 cores/12 threads), the Core i7 7740X (4 cores/8 threads) and Core i5 7640X (4 cores/4 threads). Pricing? The Core i9 Extreme Edition won’t be cheap though, receiving a suggested price of US$1999. Sheesh. How about the Core i9 7900X? Well, you’re looking at a US$999 price tag. Able to pay more than US$999 but not willing to go to the US$2000 mark? Well, Intel is also readying 12, 14 and 16 core variants of the Core i9 chip, with suggested prices of US$1199, US$1399 and US$1699 respectively. Otherwise, the cheapest chip in the family (Core i5 7640X) has a US$242 price tag. About the socket Intel has confirmed that the X-Series family takes advantage of a new LGA 2066 socket. In other words, you’ll need to buy a new motherboard as well. Then again, if you’re buying the most expensive chip, it’s a small price to pay. How powerful is it? Intel claims that the family also includes their first teraflop CPU. But it’s not just due to sheer number of cores, apparently. Although that helps massively. The company’s new boost tech sees the two best cores being identified, with heavy lifting then being directed to them for a performance boost. Intel adds that you should be able to edit, transcode, animate and render simultaneously (presumably on the higher end chips). What about gaming? For starters, the company says it represents the best gaming performance in an Intel chip. Obviously. But Intel says you can game, stream, record and transcode simultaneously too (again, we presume you’ll want to try this on the higher end processors). Otherwise, the firm says the new chips have support for up to four graphics cards Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

ASRock displays its trove of funky motherboards at Computex by Zak Killian  8:00 AM on May 31, 2017 We've yet to look at the company's wares, but ASRock is in attendance at Computex, too. ASRock has a reputation for making some of the zanier products around, although it might prefer the word "innovative." This year, the company is showing off some unique motherboards for both Intel and AMD systems, along with what might be the coolest application of the Mini-STX form factor we've seen yet. ASRock has the usual array of high-end X299 boards on display. Although we don't have specific details on the models, the company is showing X299 motherboards bearing Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel's sobriquet as well as the name of champion overclocker Nick Shih. While the X299 Fatal1ty Professional Gaming i9 hails from the "does everything" school of motherboard design, the X299 OC Formula by Nick Shih is more stripped-down, with just four memory slots and a 14-phase voltage regulator. Perhaps more interesting to gerbils (given you folks' affection for PCs en miniature) is the X299E-ITX/ac. Yes, ASRock's engineers crammed an X299 motherboard into the Mini-ITX form factor. To support the LGA 2066 socket's quad-channel memory, the board uses a quartet of SODIMM slots. It also packs on six SATA ports, three M.2 sockets, dual Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet ports, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Intel's X299 platform isn't the only one getting the ITX treatment from ASRock. The Socket AM4 X370 Gaming-ITX/ac is exactly what it sounds like: a Mini-ITX motherboard for AMD's Ryzen CPUs. You only get two DIMM slots, but they're for full-sized sticks instead of SODIMMs. The board supports the Ryzen CPU's native USB 3.1 ports and has a pair of HDMI outputs, should you wish to stick an APU in it. ASRock also has a version of the board coming out with an AMD B350 chipset onboard. In case you haven't heard, cryptocurrency "mining" has come back into vogue lately because of newer "alt-coin" algorithms that can't easily be accelerated on custom hardware. Generally speaking, GPUs are once again the chosen platform, and since such work is primarily done in chunks that fit entirely on a graphics card and its local memory, the host system's performance is less relevant. Miners could spend a bundle on expensive X299 systems to host their hashing, or they could buy something like ASRock's H110 Pro BTC+. This stripped-down platter has twelve PCIe x1 slots and a single x16 slot. All those slots can be filled with enough graphics cards to power a heavy-duty mining rig. Finally (at least as far as PC parts go), ASRock will be showing off some mini-PCs at its Computex booth. We don't know much about the new boxes yet, but the company says it is launching a line of DeskMini RX and DeskMini GTX products based on products like its new Z270M-STX motherboard. Mini-STX is the proper name of the form factor formerly known as "5x5", since it's just five inches square. ASRock says the Z270M-STX mobo supports MXM graphics cards and a staggering three M.2 slots. Hopefully our guys on the ground will get a chance to stop by the ASRock booth to see this stuff in person. If not, you'll surely be hearing about some of these products in the coming months, so keep an eye out. Tags: Motherboards Systems Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Almost everyone has a smartphone or a tablet or notebook, and some people have all three. Customers want these devices to be light, thin and portable. But, looking at the venerable PC, it seems this same trend has not really caught on. PC enthusiasts are well aware of the Mini-ITX form factor, but the wider market still seems to think of the PC as the stereotypical ATX sized box that has been with us for decades. Most people are simply unaware that they can have a fully capable PC in the size of a paperback book (such as a NUC) or have a gaming capable PC, even capable of 4K gaming, in a package the size of a CD player or shoebox. We have gathered some popular PC components and we’ll be putting them into a Silverstone Fortress FTZ01 and see just what a mini PC is capable of. Let’s start off with our component choices. The Components The Case – Silverstone FTZ01 $185 SGD The case is obviously a key component when considering a mini build. Silverstone is a company that consistently release and refine small form factor products including power supplies and coolers, so it was really easy to choose Silverstone for the chassis and PSU. The Silverstone FTZ01 is among our very favorites. It’s one of the best-designed ITX cases available. It is surprisingly easy to work with,  especially with its GPU riser system that allows the use of large, high-powered video cards, all the while packing a slim, low profile chassis with a 14L capacity. At 14.8″ (W) x 4.21″ (H) x 13.82″ (D), it’s one of the smallest cases capable of holding a high end system without compromise. The FTZ01 is is a premium metal body case which offers the flexibility of being placed vertically or horizontally. It retains flexibility with regards to cooling, it will accept a 3.5″ HDD if needed and includes a slot for a DVD or Blu Ray player at its front. It’s size is about what you’d see from a typical Hi-Fi component. Naturally a small form factor case will come with some considerations, including the choice of cooler, but these are easily worked around with the knowledge of what you need. The Power Supply– Silverstone SX700-LPT 80Plus Platinum $248 SGD The Silverstone SX700-LPT  is a 700 watt power supply, meaning its capable of powering essentially any system including overclocked CPUs with high core counts and a single graphics card. It will also power many systems with dual GPUs too, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a small form factor build. The key reasons for choosing this unit are its small size and the fact that it is 80Plus Platinum rated. This means it has very good efficiency, which in turn means less heat output and a lower power bill. This is a key consideration for any small form factor build where cooling is usually not as efficient as a full sized build.   The Motherboard– MSI Z270I Gaming AC $329 SGD For our motherboard, we chose a MSI Z270i Gaming AC. This board has a raft of high end features, including quality audio, AC Wi-Fi, M.2 support, USB 3.1 and even full RGB lighting.   The CPU – Intel i7-7700 – $475 SGD The CPU was a tougher choice. While we could have gone with a 7700K, its TDP is significantly higher than our eventual choice of a i7-7700. The 7700 means we have a turbo frequency of up to 4.2Ghz while keeping TDP at an impressive 65w. This compares to 91w for a 7700K. So, with a 3.6Ghz base clock and 4.2 Ghz boost clock, the i7-7700 still provides 8 threads and will easily power the latest games and have enough grunt on hand for demanding tasks. it will also be easy for a modest CPU cooler to handle. The CPU Cooler – Cryorig C7 – $55 SGD The Cryorig C7 cooler is specifically designed for small form factor builds. It has the same footprint as a stock Intel cooler, which fit’s into the Intel socket area where no other components are allowed. This means it won’t interfere with tall memory heatsinks, chipset or PWM heatsinks. It’s still much better than the standard Intel cooler thanks to the addition of heatpipes, greater fin surface area and a more efficient fan. It is easily capable of keeping the 65w i7-7700 cool. The GPU – AMD Radeon RX480 8Gb $409 The choice of GPU for a small form factor build will depend on the users budget and usage scenario. The FTZ01 case can handle cards up to 13″ in length and supports dual slot cards. We chose a reference AMD RX480 with its exhaust blower configuration. This is key as all the heat is dumped outside the case. The card performs well at 1080p and offers a good range of technologies including HDMI 2.0b and Display Port 1.4 for driving high resolution displays. It also brings native HEVC Main 10 support making it a good choice for playback of 4k60p content on modern televisions. A GTX 1060 3Gb or 6Gb would be another good choice for the same reasons. We also have a GTX 1080 Ti reference card here that would be the ultimate choice, but its expense is something to consider. If you want to game on your sexy 4k TV or display though, its the only choice. Do you fancy gaming on a 4k OLED 65″ TV? Droooooool… Of course if you’re playing less demanding games such as DOTA or CS:GO, then you can save dollars and go with a cheaper card, though do be aware that a cheaper card might not be capable of pushing to the 120 or 144fps levels that many gamers prefer.   The Memory – G.Skill 2x8Gb DDR4-3200 $239 SGD G.Skill make the highest speed memory you can get, and high speed memory just so happens to run very well on dual slot motherboards. 2x8Gb of DDR4-3200 is a good sweet spot choice of speed, capacity and performance.   The Storage – Zotac 240Gb SSD $149 + Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD $499+ Seagate 2Tb HDD $115 These days, a 128-256Gb SSD simply runs out of space once you put a few programs on there. Think Grand Theft Auto 5 or similar which takes up the best part of 70Gb! For this reason we chose a smallish 240Gb Zotac Premium SSD for the OS, then a Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD for games and and a Seagate 2Tb SSD for media storage. You can omit the HDD of course if you have a NAS or external drive. This will make the system much quieter. Mechanical drives really do make an annoying whirring noise that is really noticeable when they spin up.   The Build Moving onto the build, as we see below, the Silverstone FTZ01 has a unique GPU cage/holder with PCIe extender which allows the card flat relative to a normal GPU/MB installation. This alone allows the case to be several centimeters thinner than would otherwise be possible. Here is the PCie Extender card itself. Inside the cylindrical hole is where you place the GPU into the slot. Here is the RX480 attached to the GPU mechanism. The little black plastic piece in the middle is designed to support the weight of the GPU. This a is a good idea since GPU sagging is become more of an issue as GPUs seemingly get ever heavier. Below is the system prior to installing the GPU cage. This gives an illustration of some of the options available with the FTZ01. If you don’t install the cage and use the IGP, you could install a dual radiator watercooler. Some users might wish to skip gaming altogether and this would allow you to run a heavily overclocked i7-7700K if you like, or even the likes of an ASRock X99ITX or one of the upcoming X299 or AM4 ITX motherboards. On the outside of the case, the fans have magnetized dust covers which seal up the system very nicely.   Here is the system in its complete state minus the WD 1Tb SSD and hard drive (which would be located just underneath the main power cables at the top right). The GPU is located below the SSD. The space to the bottom right is where an optical drive can be placed. Cable management is usually a bit of a nightmare in smaller form factor builds where space is the primary consideration, but in the Silverstone FTZ01 the cables can be routed quite well, which improves airflow and assists with cooling. The scale of the system is well illustrated here with the I/O of the motherboard and graphics card clearly visible. Below is a good comparison of the size if the unit vs a full sized Corsair 760T case. As you can see, it’s a lot smaller in every dimension!   But how does it perform? Here is the main spec of the system. 8 cores at 4Ghz+ at 65w.. Nice!   One of the supposed weaknesses of a compact system is the compromising on cooling. The FTZ01 has no problems with airflow, and the i7-7700 stayed under 80c, which is quite good for a Kaby Lake processor under 100% load. Obviously the Cryorig cooler isn’t as good as a top end air cooler, let alone a water cooler, but under 80c is perfectly worry free.   The beauty of 8 threads is you can do some serious work with them. As you can see below, a i7 7700 smashes an overclocked 2600K at video encoding. The 2600K is one of the best processors Intel ever made, but its starting to show its age now. the i7 -7700 is a good 25% faster without an overclock. We ran a few game benchmarks to see how we’d go. With the RX480, 1080p is the real sweet spot for high quality gaming. Once you go to 1440p, you’ll have to dial back the quality a bit to maintain 60fps. Rise of the Tomb Raider with Very High settings held at 70fps, Far Cry Primal 61fps and Ashes of The Singularity 47.5fps when set to Extreme with DX12 mode enabled. These are difficult games to run, but all are easy with a RX480. Of course you can add about 10% of performance if you go with a RX580. Don’t forget that games like CS:GO, Overwatch or DOTA can get by with a low end card, but to get the best experience in these games, high FPS is still desirable. If you’re running a 120hz+ monitor with freesync, you’ll need a decent card to get the best out your games.   Summing it up The Total for the system is $2700. Of course you’ll need a monitor and peripherals to go with it. This is certainly not cheap, but we think this is a good balanced system. You can easily put a top end graphics card in there and game happily at 4K, alternatively you could go for a cheaper CPU or skip the graphics card altogether. Even a Kaby Lake dual core will do the job for non compute intensive tasks. Another option might be to go for some generic memory, for example 2x8Gb of DDR4-2400. Why ITX? It’s just more convenient! You get the full power of a modern PC, whilst combining it into a small form factor. A smaller footprint adds a lot of flexibility when it comes to the uses of the system. A living room gaming PC? A portable LAN PC? Living in a university dorm room? Not everyone wants a huge snarling beast of a system decked out in Christmas RGB lights. Some people want their systems to be functional and blend in. The wolf in sheep’s clothing. Having experience in PC sales in a previous life, it’s amazing how many people automatically assume a small PC is a weak PC. It is not! The point here isn’t so much to build a top end system or a budget system, it’s to show what an ITX system is capable of. Other than really high end multi GPU systems, a well though out ITX build can do everything a full sized build can do. We all like Ultrabooks, slim phones & compact tablets. Why not apply the same thinking to your next PC? Bigger doesn’t always mean better!   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Dell Specials at The PC Show and the Consumer Electronic Exhibition!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Autonomous-Vehicle Stocks to Buy in 2017 The first autonomous cars will likely emerge from big-company partnerships. Here are three companies at the center of some of the most promising deals. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) May 31, 2017 at 6:06PM How should we approach investing in autonomous vehicles -- so-called "self-driving cars" -- here in 2017? Of course, no company is (yet!) producing a fully autonomous vehicle. In fact, one thing that's becoming clear as companies race to develop autonomous-vehicle technology is that no one company is likely to do it entirely on its own. Tech companies, automakers, and auto-industry suppliers are teaming up to share expertise, hoping to bring the best possible technology to market -- as soon as possible. How can that help investors? If we can identify the companies that have fingers in the most promising pies, we might be able to get an early read on which companies are most likely to profit handsomely, as vehicles that can drive themselves become commonplace. I've been watching this space closely as it has emerged over the last few years. Right now, I think these three companies each have an excellent chance to profit handsomely from the rise of autonomous vehicles: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH). Who's driving this Audi SUV? A prototype autonomous-vehicle system developed by two of the companies on our list drove it in a demonstration in Las Vegas earlier this year. Image source: Delphi Automotive. NVIDIA is an emerging automotive powerhouse It's only recently that NVIDIA has ramped up its efforts to push into the automotive space. Its automotive business is still small, accounting for just 7.2% ($140 million) of the $1.9 billion in revenue that it generated in the quarter ended April 30. But as the company sees it, the potential is enormous. Between chips and systems for digital "cockpit" displays, supercomputing processors for autonomous vehicles, and systems for "transport as a service" (ride-hailing and car-sharing), NVIDIA believes its potential market is between $6 billion and $10 billion. How will it access those markets? Its partnerships are a clue: Back in February, NVIDIA and giant auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH announced that they will collaborate on a hardware "brain" for autonomous vehicles. Bosch is a key supplier to many automakers, and has deep relationships with (among others) giant Volkswagen AG, VW subsidiary Audi AG, and Daimler AG -- all of which are investing heavily in autonomous-vehicle technology. The alliance gives NVIDIA a much broader path to market in the automotive space. It also gives NVIDIA a deeper relationship with companies that could be dominant in the early days of self-driving. Between its Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles and its huge heavy-truck business, Daimler, in particular, has the potential to be a powerhouse in this space. That's just one of what could be a long list of very profitable relationships for NVIDIA as autonomous vehicles become commonplace. Self-driving could be the key to Intel's future I know that a lot of investors are wary of Intel. Growth in the chip giant's core business is stalling, and its management team has arguably been flailing a bit, jumping from one idea to another in search of future growth. But I think it's very possible that Intel's search for a path to future growth ended in March, when it struck a huge ($15.3 billion) deal to buy an Israeli tech company, Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). Mobileye is a fairly small company, but when it comes to autonomous-vehicle technology, it's a very big deal. The various autonomous-vehicle systems under development use several different combinations of sensors, but nearly all of them use "passive visual" sensors -- cameras and systems that can intelligently process the images they capture. That's the space Mobileye dominates. It's already a key supplier of the chips and technology used in existing advanced driver-assist systems offered by nearly all of the world's automakers, and it's deeply respected by engineers and executives throughout the auto business. Mobileye's client list includes almost all of the automakers you've ever heard of, as well as a bunch of smaller ones that might emerge as heavyweights in the future. Intel doesn't plan to fold Mobileye into its existing business. Instead, it'll leave the Israeli company largely intact -- while essentially adding its own chips and systems to Mobileye's catalog. When the deal closes (expected by the end of the year), Intel will instantly have deep access to the world's automakers -- just as demand for processing power in vehicles is about to skyrocket. Intel already has its fingers in a few important pies with Mobileye. The two companies are working with Delphi on a "turnkey" autonomous-vehicle system that they'll make available to automakers by the end of 2019. In a separate (but related) effort, the three are working with German luxury-vehicle giant BMW AG on a series of autonomous-vehicle systems -- which the partners also intend to offer to other automakers, as well. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks the total addressable market for autonomous-vehicle systems and the data centers that will support them will be over $100 billion a year by 2030. Intel is now in a position to grab a very big piece of that, which could have a major impact on a company that generated just under $60 billion in revenue in 2016. Yes, Intel has issues. But its stock isn't expensive at about 12 times its expected 2017 earnings, and its 3% dividend yield provides some comfort. While the Mobileye deal looks very expensive now, the potential upside could make it -- and Intel's stock -- look very cheap in time. Delphi: An old-line auto supplier, retooled Delphi Automotive is to the Intel-Mobileye partnership what Bosch is to NVIDIA, more or less: It's the well-established auto-industry supplier that has deep relationships with most of the world's automakers -- and the expertise to integrate its partners' systems into its clients' vehicles. Like Bosch, Delphi has its fingers in multiple pies. It's a partner to Intel and Mobileye in both of the efforts I noted above, both of which have the potential to be very profitable. But there are two big things that distinguish Delphi from Bosch for our purposes. First, Delphi is a public company, and Bosch isn't. Second, and more importantly, Delphi is setting itself up to become a "pure play" in autonomous-vehicle technology and related fields. The company announced earlier this year that it will spin off its legacy internal-combustion engine components business to focus entirely on "electronic safety systems" -- autonomous-vehicle tech and its building blocks. That move will make Delphi the closest thing to a "pure-play" investment in autonomous-vehicle technology since -- well, since Mobileye. But Delphi's current valuation (around 20 times earnings) makes it much cheaper than Mobileye was before Intel scooped it up. It might seem counterintuitive to invest in an auto-industry stalwart just as the industry is about to be transformed, but that's arguably another reason why Delphi deserves a very close look.

One of the most interesting ideas was that of a Modular PC. This basically put the core guts of a laptop - chipset, processor, memory, and storage - into a box similar in size to a deck of cards. The company envisioned a set of accessories that ranged from a smartphone to a full-on desktop that would go with it, but the IBM CEO at the time killed the idea. A few years later, a little company called Antelope Technologies brought the thing to market using a Transmeta processor; it found a small niche but didn’t survive. Almost 20 years later, Intel is going to give it a run with something called the Intel Compute Card, which addresses almost all of the problems the old IBM Modular PC had. (By the way, this is Intel’s second shot at this and it is amazing that it’s following a similar path to the one IBM started so many years ago.) The Evolution of the Modular Computer The concept for the modular computer was initially founded to correct a serious consumer problem. Processors, storage and memory were very expensive and users were being forced to buy it two or three times for their smartphones (which were just starting to gain traction), laptop/Windows tablet, and/or desktop computer. If you could create a module that had these core elements, the user would only have to buy one set and then basically plug the module that contained this technology into a smartphone, tablet, laptop or dock to get the function of multiple devices without having to buy the redundant components. In addition, sync wasn’t available back then, wireless technology sucked, and we didn’t even know what “the cloud” was, so this also solved the problem of being able to get to your stuff while mobile. A lot of discussion surrounded whether the module should have a screen and some functionality or not, and it was decided not to include it because these aspects created problems for other applications like laptops, tablets, and even PCs, which had their own screens. The Problems That Killed Modular A number of problems killed the effort. First, prices for processors, memory and storage started to drop quickly, making redundancy less of a problem. The market developed syncing applications, and wireless got better, so keeping your stuff with you on a variety of devices got a ton easier. Intel’s technology wasn’t mobile enough back then, and Transmeta largely went out of business. Given the low runs for the core compute module and all of the accessories, the resulting cost was higher than buying a better-performing multi-device solution. Oh, and the size of the computing module was simply too big, resulting in tablets and smartphones that looked stupid. I was approached to be CEO of one of the efforts related to it back then. I turned down the opportunity because I was convinced the technology wasn’t ready and that it would take a company like Intel or Microsoft to create the core technology and the ecosystem that would make this work, not to mention fund the effort enough to get it to critical mass. Intel’s Compute Card Boy, what a difference a couple of decades make. Intel has aggressively made its technology more portable, resulting in a core module that is the size of a small stack of business cards. Prices have come down sharply, which should keep this module affordable, and it is thin enough to go into a laptop or tablet carrier without the resulting combination being too ugly. While sync and wireless connectivity are common, so are concerns surrounding wireless security, often making it safer to move the files physically rather than electronically for some industries. And finally, and most recently, concerns about laptops being turned into bombs have resulted in an effort to ban them on planes. Renting an approved laptop in an airport for the flight might be a possibility, but the security concerns would be daunting, plus you’d need a configuration that didn’t have a battery (and would be able to live off the power available at the seat). Renting a shell that would use your module would likely be far safer, for the airline and your data, resulting in a very timely alternative to carrying a laptop or tablet on a long flight. At some point, particularly in first class, the airline might provide a dock and a screen so the experience could become even more convenient. Wrapping Up:  The Improved Modular Idea The old IBM idea of a modular computer had a number of critical faults. Over time, one by one, those faults have been corrected and the Intel Compute Card is the impressive result. Still, to fully reach potential, it needs a unique mass market use (like being the only way to safely bring a laptop onto a plane), and an eco-system that fleshes out the offering (and Intel remains one of the few companies that can even do that). In the short term, this could be an ideal way to address some security needs, provide an imbedded computer with prices at scale across a variety of machines that need PC functionality, or have a home PC that can be easily moved from room to room (dock to dock). Not to mention that this might be a good solution for small kids on computers, where the module could be locked up during times when the little darlings aren’t supervised. In the end, I like that someone is still trying to make this work.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Old and Busted: Trump Doesn’t Get Daily Intel Briefs. New Hotness: Trump Spends Too Much Time on Intel Briefs. Posted at 3:30 pm on May 31, 2017 by streiff Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Let’s take a quick trip back to December. Trump had been president elect for about a month and a half and Politico and its fellow travelers were on a tear about Donald Trump not getting daily intelligence briefings. Take this from USA Today as a sampling: Donald Trump’s reluctance to receive daily intelligence briefings — and his blunt rejection of the CIA’s assessment of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election — suggest a rocky start to the president-elect’s relationship with intelligence agencies. Since the election, Trump has received the President’s Daily Briefing only four times, amid meetings with potential Cabinet secretaries and other transition business. And on Sunday, the president-elect suggested that the rate of briefings won’t change once he’s sworn in next month. As I pointed out at the time, there is no tradition of a president taking the Presidential Daily Briefing in person: Democrats Are Flip-Flopping Like A Landed Fish On Russia And Trump’s Intelligence Briefings. Now we are onto the newest criticism. President Trump consumes classified intelligence like he does most everything else in life: ravenously and impatiently, eager to ingest glinting nuggets but often indifferent to subtleties. Most mornings, often at 10:30, sometimes earlier, Trump sits behind the historic Resolute desk and, with a fresh Diet Coke fizzing and papers piled high, receives top-secret updates on the world’s hot spots. The president interrupts his briefers with questions but also with random asides. He asks that the top brass of the intelligence community be present, and he demands brevity. … Yet there are signs that the president may not be retaining all the intelligence he is presented, fully absorbing its nuance, or respecting the sensitivities of the information and how it was gathered. Of course he isn’t retaining it or absorbing its essence. He’s an idiot, right? As president, Trump now takes briefings nearly every day. In a White House with few steadying mechanisms — and one led by a Washington neophyte who bristles at structure and protocol — the daily intelligence briefing is the rare constant. The sessions often run past their scheduled time, stretching for 30 or 45 minutes, prompting Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to pop into the Oval Office to cut off the discussion: “Mr. President, we’ve got people backing up outside. … Still, Trump tells advisers that he values his daily briefings. Though career intelligence analysts often take the lead in delivering them, Trump likes his political appointees — Pompeo and Coats — to attend, along with national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Pompeo and Coats, whose offices are in McLean, Va., have had to redesign their daily routines so that they spend many mornings at the White House. Vice President Pence usually attends, while other administration principals join depending on the topic of the day, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Senior members of the West Wing staff sometimes float in and out of the Oval Office during the briefings.” I’m really sure Trump spending a lot of time on the Presidential Daily Brief, and taking regularly, and asking questions, and having his national security team sit in with him is just another sign that Trump has no interest in the job and is an incompetent boob. What other explanation could there be? In fact, the only thing worse than him taking the briefings and paying attention is him not taking the briefings and not paying attention.

And so far the signs are very promising indeed. We've been keenly following the crowdfunded, community-developed Eve V convertible tablet since the first specs and images emerged late last year, and now it's hands-on time! The Finnish company was present at the Microsoft booth at Computex 2017 today, showing off their creation alongside more established brands. (Microsoft, among Intel and others, is one of the company's backers.) Like a Surface Pro, but with more ports, a speccier base model and a disruptive price. To answer a few likely questions upfront: Yep, this thing looks and feels a lot like a Surface Pro. But it also has its own distinctive identity, with sturdy build quality, and a near perfect balance between size and weight. It hits all the important spec targets, as we've known for a while, and the addition of extra ports and features (compared to Microsoft's latest convertible) doesn't seem to have come with any unwanted side-effects. So if you're after a Surface-alike that's a little bit qurirky, with improved connectivity — USB-Type C, Thunderbolt 3, and a microSD reader — then look no further. The pricing of a maxed-out V hasn't been confirmed yet, but the base model starts at $799, for specs that outpace the Surface Pro, and the manufacturer seems enthusiastic about the halo effect of Surface comparisons. It's "flattering," that consumers might see the V and mistake it for Microsoft's tablet, CFO Tuukka Korhonen told me. Despite its associaton with big names like Microsoft and Intel, Eve still sees itself as a disruptor, and its focus on developing products with its community isn't unlike what OnePlus has tried to achieve in the Android phone world. (It's also a tactic that's been attempted by many less successful crowdfunding hopefuls.) Eve has already succeeded where many other crowdfunding hopefuls have fallen by the wayside. The tablet is built around a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD with 2736 x 1824 resolution, which looks gorgeous, and easily visible under the bright floodlights of the Microsoft booth. (We didn't get to try it under the bright Taipei sunshine, but a rated brightness of 450 nits bodes well for daylight visibility all the same.) There's just enough bezel to hold onto, without making the device appear clunky. The metal body has a subtle matte texture, and feels sturdy in the hand. And the angled side walls serve much the same purpose as the Sufrace Pro's, helping with grip and providing a home for all your ports. That includes the power key, with integrated one-touch fingerprint scanner for Windows Hello. Around the back, there's a Surface-like hinge, which was apparently a major focus of engineering effort throughout development, as Eve worked to get it feeling just right while avoiding any issues with wear and tear. From a layman's point of view, I can say that the hinge does its job, strikes a nice balance between stiffness and ease of motion whether the device is in laptop or tablet mode. The base model Eve V out-specs the Surface Pro at the same price point. Powering the whole assembly are seventh-generation Intel chips — Core M3, i5 or i7 — along with 8GB of 16GB of RAM, and 128, 256 and 512GB storage options. There's also an ample 48 Wh battery, which we're told is good for a full day of use. (The 10-12 hour rating naturally depends on what you're using it for.) Eve's branding is subtle, almost to a fault. You'd easily miss the "V" logo around the back (dark gray on black), and the front panel is completely featureless. The more playful additions can be found on the keyboard backlit, Alcantara-clad keyboard, which connects over Bluetooth and charges over pogo pin connectors. The V key is replaced with a V logo (pressing Fn + V will change your backlighting color, for what it's worth), and backspace becomes "Oops." Because why not? Backspace becomes 'Oops.' It all plays into V's brand image as a disruptive influence — a product developed, publicly, with the people who are going to be using it. And as such, Eve is free to drop in whimsical hardware quirks like this. The keyboard itself is somewhat thicker than the Surface Pro's, but it equally doesn't feel excessively bulky, and stays put just as well as any magnetically attached tablet cover. Other notables include stylus support with Windows Ink certification — the V has its own pen, but also works flawlessly with Microsoft Surface Pen and Surface Dial, CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis told me. And on the audio side, quad speakers (they get pretty loud, but these things are hard to judge in a trade show environment) are backed up by a 1-amp 3.5mm headphone jack. It's going to take longer than just a half-hour or so with the Eve V to judge its overall success, or otherwise. But the first impressions are very positive. The company appears to have the fundamentals down — everything works, looks good, and the only giveaway that this is the product of a crowdfunded startup are the splashes of branding about the place. There's no shortage of Surface clones right now, but the Eve V is one we're eager to see more of in the months ahead. Reader comments Eve V hands-on: Quirky crowd convertible 46 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating DeepHeet On driver support the Eve team chose only branded components from vendors with good driver support e.g. Intel SSD, Realtec audio. I'm a hyper early backer and really looking forward to getting my V in June. The devices have been through 3 rounds of prototype testing by 20+ community members to iron out as many bugs as possible. On performance while the V has a 7th Gen Core i Y series CPU performance tests by the community have shown comparable performance to the equivalent 6th Gen Core I U series due to less CPU throttling. Eve Tech are finalising the support model, but there will be coverage for warranty and repairs (possibly similar to the Surface send in model). Not to forget there is a passionate community behind Eve V who will likely provide better and faster support than most larger tech companies. Eve tech keep prices low by cutting out the middle men. Direct orders and shipping direct from the factory. This model might not work for everyone, particularly those who want to see the device before purchasing. Again here the community might provide the answer. There have already been several meet ups to show off prototypes to community members. With 2000+ baxxckers around the world you will probably find a community member near by who is happy to organise a meet up for interested parties. Just join the community and post. 1 4 days ago Reply Mr J Christie CNET says this device outperforms the new surface device in every aspect. Correction " SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMS", both the Surface Pro and all the rest and at a significant reduction in Price, which anyone loves. JC 1 4 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Literally the only area it doesn't is in the pen area. The Surface Pro is a few ms faster with pen input and has more pressure levels, neither of which i think will really affect me. Sounds like the V will be getting pen tilt support so that part is on even ground. 0 4 days ago Reply Justinian84 There is no way this outperforms the new Surface Pro in any way. Y-series processors, thicker/unknown weight, worse quality trackpad (that's Synaptics for you) and MUCH worse pen are the confirmed standout aspects. Other aspects I have doubts about include likely lower quality screen, lower quality build, lower quality hinge, lower quality keyboard and finish (seems to be quite a fingerprint magnet like the 1st gen Surfrace Pros). I think it's a wonderful product, and I fully support these guys, but comparing a startup's first device with the fruit of years of experience and resources of the Surface Team is a little unrealistic.   0 3 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes Weight is known (It's just over 100grams heavier than the SP4 due mainly to the bigger battery and the slightly heavier built keyboard), the trackpad is a Precision Touchpad, and the pen is the same as the SP4 but is more accurate on the V than the SP4 pen is. As well, the V should support the new tilt feature as well as the added pressure levels, leading to the end result that if all of this holds true, the V will be every bit as good as the Surface Pro in the pen department EXCEPT for the response time improvements on the SP, which mean different things for different people, personally, I didn't have an issue with the SP4 response times, and when you're running CPU intensive software, you won't be getting that low latency anyways. The screen is optically bonded Gorilla Glass 4 with a new anti-reflective coating not found on competing devices. Hinge is sourced from the same manufacturer who made SP4 hinge. Keyboard has color-customizable backlighting, can work over Bluetooth without being docked, and can support up to three Bluetooth devices with the press of a button. The Y-series processors will be TDP adjustable and the device works with eGPU due to the Thunderbolt 3 port. I'm not saying that the V is better than the Surface Pro in every way, but there is some attention to detail and uncompromising standards being shown here that mega-companies with set deadlines and huge profit margins to make simply cannot compete with. Keep in mind, too, that the review model is actually a DVT3 hand-assembled prototype, which is not completely representative of the final product, especially in build quality. Also, Eve has been at this for several years now, with their first device being the Eve T1 a couple of years ago. 0 3 days ago Reply digitaldd if there is an 8GB RAM/128GB storage version with an m5 or i5 for say $900 I'd be intrigued. 0 4 days ago Reply iKirin Hi DigitalDD! :) Our "smallest" configuration is featuring the Core M3/8GB/128GB SSD so that should hit the mark for you ;) 2 4 days ago Reply DavidinCT Something to watch out for....basic same design (look), better specs for the dollar ?  Sounds like a win to me 0 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina Running the rebranded m5/m7 is not better specs for the dollar.

Case in point, I've been running an AMD FX 4130 OC'd to 4.2 GHz on almost 24/7 runtime with an hour or two or more of hard gaming every day since mid 2014. Thing is, these processors are designed to handle heat and if they get too hot thermal limiting kicks in. It's a lot harder to burn out a CPU than it used to be. 0 4 days ago Reply ScubaDog No kidding.  My interest in this device over the latest Surface Pro really is gaining headway.  I just can't help the nagging feeling, though, that there's a gotcha waiting to be found.  It doesn't really bother me that this doesn't support the pen sensitivity that the new SP does--I currently have the SP3 and the pen is fine even now. One thing that does concern me is the fact that the keyboard is Bluetooth.  I know some would call this a plus, but it's one more thing that has a battery that can lose ability to hold a charge over time.  I guess if I never plan to have it separated from the tablet while I'm using the keyboard this won't matter, but.... Bottom line, I'm anxious to see more substantial reviews of it and am curious about when it will be available and through what avenues.  If I'm going to off on replacing my SP3 (which still works awesome, so no real hurry), I want to make sure I'm going with the best value. 3 4 days ago Reply Cyril Richard Well, for the keyboard, as you said yourself the Bluetooth is to be considered simply as an added benefit. If you want to use it plugged only, you can. And if from time to time you need to use it with the tablet a meter away (tablet on table and keyboard on your lap maybe?) or to use it with another device (your smartphone maybe?)...you can. And you're likely to have the keyboard with you often since it comes with the tablet. I'm currently seriously considering the Surface Pro but I clearly want to wait until reviews of both the Surface and Eve V are available. I also want to know the final price of the V + keyboard + pen. What drags me a bit to the Surface is all the comments that we can read that insist that any Surface device has that little "something" that makes you just want to use it. I've never owned a Surface device so I'm curious to check by myself. But if battery life of EVE is on par or better than Surface Pro and price is lower...I might go for it. 0 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina With a Y series (rebranded m) versus and actual U series iCore. 3 4 days ago Reply Cyril Richard True, but for my use which is pretty casual (with no gaming at all), I'm pretty sure an i5-Y is enough or more than enough. If I suddenly launch many tabs and/or many programs at the same time, the burst should provide enough power for that limited time. I'm mostly using the web browser, quite a lot of store apps, and a few x86 programs including office. 1 4 days ago Reply sporosarcina That's my point, Y series chips are perfect for that use, but TB3 is wasted in that scenario. A TB3 use scenario (I.e. EGPU) would stress a Y-series chip 2 4 days ago Reply Cyril Richard Good to know it's perfect for this use! Not that I was worried but a confirmation is always helpful 0 4 days ago Reply Zachary Wilmes For me, that little something is the same thing that attracted me to Eve. For example, a few weeks ago it was discovered during artificial aging tests that the V's screen could develop yellow spots over time. This is an issue that happens with Surface Pros, iPhones, you name it, all the "high end" big-name manufacturers have this issue on some devices. But Eve returned the screens to the supplier and went with a different screen supplier to eliminate the issue. We're still waiting to hear whether the new supplier has really fixed the issue. Another "little something", each V purchased as an "early bird" is going to have it's display individually professionally color-calibrated to IIRC 102% sRGB (or similar). I could go on and on, the ability to adjust the processor TDP up to a higher value (which doesn't throttle the device because of the custom engineered heatsink), the ability to connect the keyboard by Bluetooth to three separate devices with the push of a button, etc. These guys appear to be the real deal, which is why I've backed them since February 2016 and have an m3 model on preorder. So excited! 😃 2 4 days ago Reply atulk malhotra I remember Eve prices being an instant put off for many. 0 4 days ago Reply gerzhwin Will the keyboard be turned off when disconnected? 1 4 days ago Reply Paul Gorski The keyboard can be paired with other devices.  I believe it can be switched off. 0 4 days ago Reply BryanMahendra Last-time I checked on their forums, the Keyboard is pogo-pin Surface and has the Bluetooth 4.1 capabilities to pair to devices (w/ a small battery-inside).

Basically the Eve V is the "7th Core-M/Y Model of the SP4 that Microsoft won't bump the Storage/RAM above 128/4gb... with TB3 USB-C/2A ports and 48Wh battery.' I checked the Indiegogo pricing, the i5/256/8Gb is $1000-1100 & the max i7/512/16Gb is $ 1399-1500 (w/without tax-shipment).

The technology to enable true 4K has been around for years, but as is often the case, it takes a while for the tech to filter through and become more affordable. That's where we're at right now. Today, 4K TVs are common and so are 4K PC monitors, and we're getting more and more ultra HD (UHD) content to use with these displays. But a display isn't any use without something to actually push that 4K content to it. Thankfully, that doesn't require a high-end gaming PC. There's a pretty wide range of PCs that can push 4K video output, from the very big to the very small. And in the case of a mini PC, you're looking at a good option for a living-room-based Home Theater PC (HTPC). How can you tell if a mini PC supports 4K? It shouldn't be too difficult to figure out whether your mini PC is capable of outputting 4K video. From a processor perspective, Intel added support for it into much of its lineup of Core i chips, and now even the lower-powered Atom processors can support 4K. The best place to check many different aspects of specific processors is Intel's reference guide. Check out which processors support 4K video at Intel When it comes to Atom processors, as far back as 2015 with the Cherry Trail x7, Intel was talking about 4K video output at 30 frames per second (FPS) in the H.265 codec, or 60 FPS in H.264. The generations-old Surface 3 has a processor capable of outputting 4K video, for example. Even the less powerful x5 can do 4K video, albeit in a more limited way than the x7. Taking a $100 mini PC as an example, with Intel HD 400 graphics you should still get 4K output at 30 FPS. To look more specifically at Intel graphics and its capability, check out the link below. When you're looking at any product it should always have an accompanying spec on which version of Intel graphics you'll get. Intel graphics specifications Why does any of this matter? If you're not concerned about 4K, it doesn't. Here's the thing: The HTPC isn't a new concept, but in years past folks have had fairly large (read the size of a VCR, remember those?!) boxes beneath their TVs to house them. How to turn your mini PC into a monster media center But even without Windows Media Center, a Windows 10 PC is a great thing to use to control your home media. And even if you don't yet care about 4K content, you probably will in the future. Netflix already delivers 4K video through Microsoft Edge, and Amazon has UHD content available. This trend will only increase. Perhaps best of all is that for not a lot of money you can get yourself a little PC that can handle all of the 4K video. Make the right choice now, and you'll have a highly capable home entertainment center that'll last for years.

I am near-sighted as well but wear inexpensive contact lenses and use a 4K tv for my computer. Trust me, on a 50" screen 4K makes a difference even for near-sighted individuals. Picked up my 4K 50" Samsung for around $400 on Black Friday last fall. 1 4 days ago Reply phxchristian As a near-sighted guy myself, I think a 4k TV makes a great monitor.

Might be mistaken though 0 4 days ago Reply Michal Kovac Yes, you need Kaby lake and more, you also need to have HDCP 2.2 connection which typically means also to have HDMI 2.0 - and not on separate card, on the motherboard.

Anything smaller than that in a TV and you sit too far away from it to matter. That and it has to support HDR or it's pretty much useless. 0 4 days ago Reply phxchristian 49" is perfect if you're sitting 3' away from it.  I can't see a pixel.  But this all depends on your desk setup and your preferences. 0 3 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Along with the bat sensor, Intel has designed a Falcon 8 Drone, which will be equipped with HD and infrared cameras for advanced pitch analysis ahead of the matches. Former England skipper Naseer Hussain heaped praise for the invention and said that the batsmen like Jason Roy, who struggling with their current form with the bat, might gain from the new system. “Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say ‘Is everything I’m doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?’ and if you know it was, you know that’s not the issue,” Nasser said. Ahead of their match against the Mashrafe Mortaza-led Bangladesh side, it was confirmed that Alex Hales, all-rounder Ben Stokes and Roy will be among the players to use the newly invented technology. ICC CEO David Richardson believes the innovation Intel is bringing in will transform viewers experience. “We couldn’t be more excited to have Intel as our ‘Official Innovation Partner’ of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort. That’s all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology.” Richardson added in a statement. Sandra Lopez, the Vice-President of the Intel Sports Group, said that “Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports.” Meanwhile, the images caught by the drone will be offering rich visual data which will be used to generate pitch reports. It will also allow the fans to experience what it actually feels like to face the world’s best bowlers.

The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, is a member of a Turkish economic-relations board run by an appointee of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Flynn's firm was tasked with lobbying the US government to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup and, more generally, fomenting dissent inside Turkey. Alptekin paid the Flynn Intel Group over $500,000 to produce a documentary about the dangers of Gulen, which he had hoped would be "a small, '60 Minutes' kind of a thing, where these conclusions are brought to the public," he told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. "We thought that might have a good effect." The former Vice News correspondent who was hired to work on the documentary, David Enders, told the Journal that he had been instructed to conceal Flynn Intel Group's involvement in producing the film. "'We don’t want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this,'" Enders recalled the head of the firm, Bijan Kian, telling him at the time. He told the Journal that Kian asked him to hide the film equipment from the staff of the hotel they were doing interviews in. "It was very hush-hush," Enders told the Journal. "They were like Keystone Kops." Ultimately, the film was never finished. Neither Enders nor Kian responded to request for additional comment.  Flynn raised eyebrows when he wrote an op-ed article for The Hill, published November 8, alleging that Gulen helmed a "vast global network" that "has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network." Flynn's op-ed seemed out of place amid his work with the Trump campaign. His work for Inovo did not come to light until after he registered as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice in March — four months after his contract with Alptekin ended. In his FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) filing, Flynn acknowledged that his firm had conducted research for Inovo that "focused on" Gulen. But it may have gone further than that: Flynn met with Turkish government ministers in September, where he reportedly discussed removing Gulen from US soil, according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, who was at the meeting.  Price Floyd, a former spokesman for Flynn, strongly denied that such a discussion ever took place, telling Business Insider at the time that Flynn was contracted by Inovo, in part, "to gather information on Gulen and turn it over to legal authorities to take action." Alptekin did not respond to request for comment. But he told The Associated Press earlier this year that he did not agree with Flynn's decision to register as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice for his work with Inovo. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government," Alpetkin said.  Still, Flynn said in his filing with the DOJ that his work for Inovo "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey."  Join the conversation about this story » NOW WATCH: Watch as Democrats break out in song as the AHCA passes the House See Also: The Trump-Russia controversy may put 'wartime consigliere' Steve Bannon back in the spotlight 'Melania needs to get with the program’: Ian Bremmer explains the biggest takeaways from Trump’s first foreign trip The FBI just declined the House oversight committee's request for Comey's memos SEE ALSO: 'None of it makes much sense': Experts are baffled by Comey's use of a fake Russian document to skirt the DOJ Top Stories Smouldering Port Arthur silo ruptures, collapses Cat population multiplying fast in urban areas TX firefighters stand for fallen co-worker's son Mugshot: Felon flees BPD officers FDA: Tuna sold to local eatery could be tainted Community seeks answers, closure following principal's death SO: Drugs, guns and $13K seized from Nederland apartment BPD: Can you ID men that robbed clerk at gunpoint?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 3 Best PC Stocks to Buy in 2017 Contrary to predictions, the PC market is far from dead, which translates to opportunities for investors. Tim Brugger (timbrugger) May 31, 2017 at 1:00PM The negativity surrounding the PC market has been around for years now. With the advent of smartphones and other mobile devices, PCs were supposedly on their way to the junk pile. As it turns out, PCs are not only alive and well, but the market is growing. Bucking the anti-PC naysayers has opened the door to great opportunities for investors. The generally dour mood surrounding personal computers means stocks including HP (NYSE:HPQ), OS king Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and chip behemoth Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are all not only experiencing top- and bottom-line growth, they are significantly undervalued. HP's new OMEN computer. Image source: HP. Not your parents PC manufacturer According to IDC, for the first time in five years, PC sales actually climbed to kick off the year, albeit by a mere 0.6%. One of the primary drivers of the PC market turnaround was none other than HP. Given the last several quarters of growth, not surprisingly, HP took over the top spot as the world's No. 1 PC manufacturer, a designation long held by China-based Lenovo. HP shipped 13.1 million units in the first quarter, good for an astounding 13.1% jump year over year and a 21.8% share of the global marketplace. Personal Systems revenue, home to HP's PC sales, climbed 10% last quarter to $7.66 billion: Not bad for a "dying" market. What makes HP's sales results even more encouraging is how the company is executing its PC strategy. Targeting specific niche markets -- HP's OMEN virtual reality-ready PC is an ideal example -- helped drive a whopping 17% increase in notebook sales in the fiscal second quarter. Toss in a 2.8% dividend yield along with its strong PC and improving printing sales, and HP is an undervalued stock by almost any measure. Windows is still king There was some consternation among investors following Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings release on April 27. The "missed" expectations seemed to be the primary story, which is good news for investors in that its stock has remained a relative value despite the strength of its Windows operating system (OS) dominance, forays into the cloud, and market-leading productivity product lineup. Microsoft's Personal Computing division recorded a 7% decline in revenue, to $8.8 billion. But remove the 26% drop in Surface sales, and Microsoft's computing unit tells a different story. Largely thanks to Microsoft's 90%-plus OS market dominance and its industry-leading $15.2 billion annual cloud revenue run rate, Windows has helped boost virtually every PC-related offering in its arsenal. Last quarter, Windows revenue climbed 5%, which helped boost Microsoft's commercial Office 365 sales 45% and drove an astounding 81% increase in Dynamics 365 revenue: Most hosted on the Azure cloud platform, which soared 93% year over year. And like HP, Microsoft also pays shareholders a solid 2.25% dividend yield. What's not to love? Intel is another PC stock that suffers from the PC malaise still prevalent despite the market's strength. After reporting an 8% increase in revenue last quarter to a record-breaking $14.8 billion, Intel's stock declined 3.4% the following day. The problem? Intel's strong PC-related sales were viewed by some as more of an aberration than what it was: Yet another sign that there's a place in this world for computers. Much like HP and its push into the fast-growing 3D printing market and Microsoft's cloud leadership position, Intel is also expanding beyond PCs into data centers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and memory solutions. In addition to the 6% increase in computing revenue last quarter, to $8 billion, Intel's data center sales of $4.2 billion were a 6% improvement, IoT was up 11%, and memory solutions revenue skyrocketed 55% to $866 million. Also lost in the PC hoopla last quarter was the fact that even considering Intel's forays into markets beyond its core computing segment, its operating expenses declined, which, combined with its top-line growth, boosted per-share earnings 45% to $0.61. With its 3% dividend and a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of a meager 12.7, Intel also warrants a spot on a list of PC stocks to buy in 2017.

Michael Flynn previously declined the Senate intelligence committee’s subpoena and invoked his Fifth Amendment protection.  (CHRIS KLEPONIS / AFP / GETTY IMAGES)   By Chad Day And Jake PearsonThe Associated Press Wed., May 31, 2017 WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser Michael Flynn will provide documents to the Senate intelligence committee as part of its probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, The Associated Press has learned. Flynn’s decision Tuesday came as U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, rejected a House intelligence committee request for information, and former White House staffer Boris Epshteyn confirmed he has been contacted for information as part of the House investigation. Meanwhile, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sounded similar tones as they criticized the ongoing U.S. scrutiny of Russia’s attempts to sway the presidential election. Flynn’s co-operation was the first signal that he and the Senate panel have found common ground. Congressional investigators continue to press for key documents in the ongoing investigation, and the retired lieutenant general is trying to limit damaging disclosures that hostile Democratic lawmakers could use against him. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump Article Continued Below Flynn had previously invoked his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in declining an earlier subpoena from the committee, which sought a wide array of documents and information related to his contacts with Russia. Flynn’s attorneys had argued the request was too broad and would have required Flynn to turn over information that could have been used against him. U.S. President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn invoked the fifth amendment on May 22, rebuffing a subpoena in the investigation into Russia's election meddling. (The Associated Press) In response, the Senate panel narrowed the scope of its request. It also issued subpoenas seeking records from Flynn’s businesses. One of the businesses, Flynn Intel Group Inc., did consulting work for a Turkish businessman that required Flynn to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent earlier this year. The other, Flynn Intel Group LLC, was used to accept money from Flynn’s paid speeches. Among the payments was more than $44,500 Flynn received from RT, the Russian state-sponsored television network that U.S. intelligence officials have branded as a propaganda arm of the Kremlin.

Flynn plans to produce some of the documents by next week, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Flynn’s private interactions with the committee. While the Senate committee awaits documents from Flynn, Putin and Trump both dismissed the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic emails. In an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro, Putin reaffirmed his strong denial of Russian involvement in the hacking. The interview was recorded during Putin’s Monday trip to Paris and released Tuesday. Putin also said the allegations are “fiction” invented by the Democrats in order to explain their loss. Trump made a similar claim in a tweet early Tuesday: “Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.” Meanwhile, Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, told the AP that he turned down a request for information from the House intelligence committee looking into the Russian interference. “I declined the invitation to participate as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,” Cohen said. “I find it irresponsible and improper that the request sent to me was leaked by those working on the committee.” Earlier Tuesday, the AP reported, citing a congressional aide, that the House intelligence committee had subpoenaed Cohen. The aide later retracted the statement. Cohen said if he is subpoenaed, he will comply. Cohen, a longtime attorney for the Trump Organization, remains a personal lawyer for Trump. He served as a cable television surrogate for the Republican during the presidential campaign. Cohen told ABC News that he had been asked by both the House and Senate intelligence committees to provide information and testimony about contacts he had with Russian officials. Cohen’s ties with Russian interests came up in February when The New York Times reported that Cohen helped to broker a Ukraine peace plan that would call for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and a referendum to let Ukrainians decide whether the part of the country seized by Russia in 2014 should be leased to Moscow. The Russian government denied knowing anything about such a plan. The Times reported that the peace plan was the work of Felix Sater, a business associate who has helped Trump try to find business in Russia, and Cohen. Cohen was a fierce defender of Trump during the campaign, often haranguing probing reporters and famously challenging a CNN reporter live on-air to name the specific polls that showed then-candidate Trump behind his rival, Hillary Clinton. In the early 2000s, he formed his own firm working on a range of legal matters, including malpractice cases, business law and work on an ethanol business in Ukraine. Cohen also owned and operated a handful of taxi medallions, managing a fleet of cabs in New York. Cohen’s business associates in the taxi enterprise included a number of men from the former Soviet Union, including his Ukrainian-born father-in-law. Cohen has made his own unsuccessful attempts at public office, losing a city council race and briefly running for state assembly in New York. The House intelligence committee has also sought information from Epshteyn, a former staffer in the Trump White House. Epshteyn said in a statement that he has asked the committee questions to better understand what information it is seeking and will determine whether he can reasonably provide it. Epshteyn, who grew up in Moscow, worked a short time in the White House press office. He left in March and now works as a political analyst for right-leaning Sinclair Broadcasting.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman IT Innovation Drives Business Value Printer-friendly version Intel Issues Annual IT Performance Report Today, Intel published its 2016-2017 Intel IT Annual Performance Report, which showcases how innovative use of predictive analytics and machine learning is helping the company make better products faster, improve its supply chain, and make its marketing and sales efforts more effective. The case studies in this year’s report demonstrate Intel IT is leading the company’s digital transformation – the same transformation Intel technology makes possible for customers around the world. According to IDC, 70 percent of Global 2000 CEOs are building corporate strategies around digital transformation to manage unprecedented technological and economic disruption. Intel CIO Paula Tolliver explains that Intel is leading by example. “At Intel, IT not only contributes to the productivity and operational efficiency and effectiveness of the company, it also advances the corporate strategy,” said Tolliver. “Our annual report demonstrates that Intel IT continues to raise the bar in driving innovation, like machine learning and predictive analytics, that helps accelerate growth opportunities for Intel.” Here are some notable results: $656 million in business value derived by rolling out predictive analytics across Intel’s sales, supply chain, factory and manufacturing operations worldwide. Estimated $1 million per year in operational savings due to the rollout of 30,000 high-density disaggregated servers dedicated to product design, cutting refresh costs by as much as 65 percent. 39-week improvement in bringing Intel products to market via a machine-learning platform that uncovers potential bugs during the design phase of a product before it goes into development. 50,000 hours that employees saved by using the Intel® Unite™ solution to quickly start and connect to conference room meetings.

Timing Now, be aware that AMD’s part is expected in a few weeks, while Intel’s is due more towards the end of the year, making Intel’s launch more of a paper launch at the moment.  Still, this is designed to stall the market so that people wait to buy until they see Intel’s part tested.  However, the issue with the timing is that kids in school often have summers off and that is when they’d likely prefer to build a new computer or buy one and have it to play games.  AMD’s Threadripper, I love that name, should arrive late, but within the window, while Intel’s i9 will arrive later in the year.   You can’t expect people to wait for something better when they want to game now, particularly when you are talking about young adults who are known for thinking tactically and needing instant gratification.  Consuming Cores About a decade ago, Intel sent me an 8-core machine and, as I worked and played games, I would bring up the performance monitor to find that I rarely lit up 3 cores let alone anything over 6.  But apparently a lot has changed because I’m writing this on an 8 core i7 and all 8 cores are almost constantly lit up and running at about 30 percent to 50 percent capacity. Plus, when I play a current generation strategy game, I can often peg the cores, suggesting that now I can actually use more than 8 even in what I’m doing.  However, the folks that will really like this extra headroom are those that work with visual tools, such as photo editors, video editors, 3D creation, Computer Aided Design, engineering, or graphic arts.   You and I may like the cores but folks using those tools need them.   Core Wars AMD launched with 16, and Intel countered with 18, but AMD also launched a 32 Core processor (named Epyc) for enterprises, suggesting they have a ton more potential core headroom to match and possibly raise Intel by year end when the i9 actually ships. So, this fight is far from over and we are likely to see a return to something similar to the MHz wars of the 1990s, but this time with cores instead of clock speed. 3D-Xpoint Now, there is a technology that plays on the periphery of this, and it is 3D-Xpoint memory.  Currently Intel has it, branded Optane, and AMD doesn’t, though they could get access through Micron, which shares rights to this technology with Intel.  This is the wild card that could be a king maker, but currently it is being used mostly to speed up drives, not replace them.  When it moves to an SSD replacement, AMD should be able to use it as well as Intel does, making it an important, but potentially fleeting, advantage depending on how it plays out.  Optane, 3D-Xpoint is substantially faster than flash, performing closer to DRAM, and the visible performance improvement it has showcased is impressive (though I have yet to use it myself).   Wrapping Up:  More Excitement to Come The core war thing is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to battle royals in the PC space.  This initial fight is on desktop computers but it will quickly move to laptops, and overlaying this will be another Battle Royal between AMD and NVIDIA over graphics technology.  AMD is also launching a new line of graphics cards and NVIDIA has been pumping up their cards at an incredible pace.   In a fight like this, the only people that truly win are us because from gaming, to VR, to actually getting work done that pays the bills, our next computer is likely to be incredible regardless of whose technology is in it!   Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Governmental Entities Bringing Financial Cybersecurity to Center Stage By: Special Guest    6/2/2017 By now, it's no secret that cybercriminals have targeted, and continue to target, the financial services industry with advanced attacks that are desig… Read More How Too Much Data Could Spell Trouble for Consumers By: Larry Alton    6/1/2017 For most intents and purposes, data is a good thing.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 01/06/2017: Uber's head of finance Gautam Gapta is set to leave the ride-hailing company in July. At the same time, the company's first-quarter losses have narrowed substantially to $708 million. Uber has confirmed with IT Pro that Gapta will leave in July. Gapta is set to join another startup in San Francisco, leaving Uber to suffer another executive departure. Uber has experienced a number of high profile departures in the last few months and now the company will be looking for a new official CFO as well as a COO to partner with CEO Travis Kalanick. Reuters reported that Uber's first-quarter losses narrowed substantially from the previous quarter. Uber declared a net loss of $708 million, excluding employee stock compensation and other items, in Q1 2017, down from $991 million in Q4 2016. Furthermore, Uber's first-quarter revenue rose 18% to $3.4 billion. An Uber spokesperson said to Reuters: "The narrowing of our losses in the first quarter puts us on a good trajectory towards profitability". Since Uber is a private company, it does not report its financial results publicly but does confirm figures reported in the media. Yesterday, it came to light that Uber had fired Anthony Levandowski amid the legal battle with Waymo. Levandowski had refused to cooperate with the investigation in which Waymo claimed that the engineer had stolen thousands of documents from the company relating to self-driving vehicle technology. 31/05/2017: Uber has fired Anthony Levandowski after the engineer failed to cooperate in the ongoing lawsuit with Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Uber general counsel Salle Yoo outlined in Levandowski's termination letter, dated 26 May, that his failure to comply with a court order is the reason for his firing. In the letter Yoo also wrote that "your failure impeded Uber's internal investigation and defense of the lawsuit". A federal judge in the ongoing court case between Uber and Alphabet's self-driving car firm, Waymo, granted a preliminary injunction against Uber on 12 May that led the ride-hailing firm to remove Levandowski from any work on Lidar, and to return any stolen documents to Waymo. Levandowski is accused of downloading 14,000 confidential files before leaving Google's self-driving division in 2016. He went on to start his own self-driving truck company called Otto, which Uber bought in August 2016, six months after he had left his previous employer. Yoo goes on to underline that Uber required the engineer to have "destroyed all property and confidential information belonging to any prior employer" and by not complying with the court order it's a potential breach and warranty in the employment agreement and an "additional ground for termination". Levandowski invoked the fifth amendment in order to not to incriminate himself and refused to hand over documents or answer questions during a deposition. Uber has insisted its technology is different to Waymo's and there is no evidence it has the stolen files on its servers, although it did not check Lewandowski's computer in its search. 19/05/2017: Uber has reportedly threatened to fire Anthony Levandowski amidst a potentially damaging court case involving the possible theft of a rival's trade secrets. The ride-sharing firm is currently embroiled in a legal battle which centers around Levandowski's departure from Waymo, Google's autonomous vehicle division. Waymo claims that when he left the company, Levandowski also exfiltrated over 14,000 documents containing trade secrets which Uber subsequently benefitted from. Levandowski, while not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, has been barred by presiding Judge William Alsup from working on Lidar technology - the technology covered by the allegedly stolen documents. Waymo also wanted to block Uber's driverless car research altogether, but this request was not granted. Alsup has, however, referred the case to criminal prosecutors, which could spell trouble for the company. "Waymo has supplied a compelling record that Levandowski pilfered over 14,000 files from Waymo, and that Uber knew or should have known as much when it brought him on board," Alsup wrote. Throughout the case, Levandowski has made use of his fifth-amendment right to not incriminate himself, and has thus far refused to testify. Now, however, Uber's lawyers have handed him an ultimatum. According to Levandowski's lawyers, Uber's general counsel Salle Yoo told the executive in a letter that he was expected to either deny the charges, or to hand over the purloined files immediately. If he does not, the letter states, the company will take "adverse employment action" against him, which may result in his termination from the company. Referring to the Judge's order to do everything it can to compel Levandowski to produce the documents, Yoo's letter apparently read: "Uber takes its obligations under the Order very seriously, intends to comply fully, and expects you to do the same". Levandowksi's lawyers, however, are arguing that this is unconstitutional. They claim that the court is giving Uber no choice but to fire him unless he violates his fifth-amendment rights. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's legal team wrote in the court filings. "Nearly fifty years of Supreme Court precedent forbid the government from putting an individual to such an unconstitutionally coercive choice," it said. "The Hobson's Choice that Mr. Levandowski now faces is a direct product of government action." 15/05/2017:  Waymo and Lyft are coming together to work on self-driving cars, in a bid to challenge rival Uber. The Google-owned autonomous vehicle firm will be partnering with Uber's main business rival in a non-exclusive deal that aims to bring driverless taxis to market before Uber. According to a Reuters source, talks on the deal began last summer. Uber has notably clashed with both companies. It is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Waymo after being accused of poaching one of its executives, who allegedly brought 14,000 confidential documents with him. Lyft has predominantly been exploring autonomous technology through partnerships, such as a $500 million investment deal with General Motors that will see the two companies work together on similar tech. Lyft says that this new agreement will not affect its relationship with GM. 12/05/2017: A US judge has called for an immediate investigation into the allegations of stolen trade secrets, which have surfaced during a court battle between Uber and Google over self-driving car technology. Google initially filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app in February, which alleged that former engineer Anthony Levandowksi downloaded 14,000 files without authorisation while working on its self-driving car research. Levandowski is said to have then left Google's Waymo to found his own startup, Otto, which was then later purchased by Uber for $680 million. Google claims that the documents travelled with him, which Uber then used to fast track its own autonomous vehicle research. US District Judge William Alsup stated in a ruling that the case "contains ample evidence" to merit an investigation, and has forwarded a recommendation to the US attorney "based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation". "The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney," the order states. Alsup also partially granted Google's bid to force an injunction against Uber's self-driving car unit, which if successful could determine the future of the company's operations in the technology. This ruling, which could be decided as early as tomorrow, has been made under temporary seal, so the exact scope of the injunction is unclear. The case has been complicated somewhat by Levandowski, who has invoked his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refuses to testify, leaving the two companies to fight it out in court. A spokesperson for Uber said in an email to IT Pro: "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum". The company also said it would not be commenting on the case referral to the US Attorney, but stated that the result of the partial preliminary injunction, currently under seal, would most likely be "status quo". Uber initially argued that Waymo's trade secret allegations should be held in private arbitration, however because Levandowski is not a defendant, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the proceedings behind closed doors, and as such was rejected by the judge. Uber doesn't dispute the claim that Levandowski stole the documents in question, but argues that trade secrets never made their way into the company's research, and that Google needs to prove that Uber "derived its knowledge from Levandowski". 28/04/2017: Uber self-driving car boss steps down amid Waymo lawsuit Uber's self-driving car chief has left his position after allegations that he stole critical research from his former employers at Waymo, Alphabet's own driverless car unit. Anthony Levandowski will continue to work for Uber, according to an internal memo published by Business Insider, but will no longer head up the company's Advanced Technologies Group or manage its work on autonomous vehicles. "Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," Levandowski wrote in an email to staff. "This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change." "This organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Levandowski's departure comes amid allegations from his former employers, Waymo. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company claims that when he left to join Uber, Levandowski took vital technology and information on the company's research and development efforts with him. For Uber's part, it claims that its work is "fundamentally different" to Waymo's and that Levandowski's role was focused on management rather than engineering. As part of the ongoing case, the presiding judge has asked the company to provide details of Levandowski's role, which could result in an injunction stopping Lewandowski from working on Uber's autonomous vehicle programme altogether. Uber declined to comment, but referred IT Pro to the email published by Business Insider. 26/04/2017: Leading US carmakers have petitioned the state of California to revise its proposed regulations on autonomous vehicle testing, stating that authorities ignored their earlier concerns that the rules would become too restrictive. Self-driving car manufacturers raised their objections at a public hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, the recording of which was seen by Reuters, saying that the planned additional regulations should be dropped, and that oversight should be handed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead. In the consultation, hosted via a webcast, automaker groups including the Association of Global Automakers described the proposed regulations as going "too far". The group also opposes California's plans to introduce a permit system, which would be required by all automakers wishing to test self-driving cars in the state. Ride-hailing firm Uber was driven out of San Francisco last year after it refused to apply for a permit to test its autonomous vehicle fleet. Automakers now believe requiring a permit is no longer an effective approach to regulating tests, and object to the proposal that the state could revoke permissions even if a company adheres to federal requirements. If the proposals were to be accepted, the automakers would be liable for any crashes that occur during the tests, even if they were not to blame. General Motors official Paul Hemmersbaugh said that regulations like these could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars". It could also see the introduction of a scheme that would ask automakers to submit a voluntary assessment to the NHTSA, outlining specific details of their self-driving vehicle systems. However, according to lawyers representing Google, Ford, and Uber, this would effectively be a mandatory clause. Other self-driving manufacturers, including Alphabet's Waymo and Ford, asked California to relax current regulations that restrict the testing of vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, which would include rides with multiple passengers. However safety advocates believe harsher regulations would ensure the public is kept safe from potential accidents. Group president for the Consumers for Auto Reliability, Rosemary Shahan, said: "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards." Alphabet's Ron Medford urged the state to quickly issue definitive guidelines "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need", although it is clear that lawmakers are still unsure how best to regulate the emerging technology. 24/04/2017: UK tech firms today received funding to test self-driving cars on Britain's roads, reaping the benefits of a recent government pledge to back the development of emerging technologies. Two consortiums have already secured backing as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a government commitment announced on Friday set to invest almost £5 billion into research and development over the next four years. Streetwise, a group led by Cambridge-based AI startup firm FiveAI, is currently working on a trial that will allow commuters to order self-driving cars using a mobile app. This will include the development of new insurance and safety protocols governing the use of the technology. The trial, which is set to launch in 2019, has received £12.8 million in government support and will be developed with input from Direct Line, Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, and the University of Oxford. "It's about delivering to the consumer an autonomous Uber-type service in London," said FiveAI CEO Stan Boland, speaking to the Telegraph. "It's insane for people to buy a car and the leave it parked for 94% of the time and only have one user per car, in the future vehicles can be shared." Driverless shuttle tests are already underway in Greenwich Driven, an initiative led by Oxbotica that has received £8.6 million in government funding, aims to develop self-driving technology over the course of a 30-month programme that started in April, aimed at linking London and Oxford with an autonomous shuttle. Commuters are able to test the technology today on the streets of Greenwich. Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith said: "Today’s news is truly ground-breaking. No company, group or consortium of autonomy experts has ever attempted what DRIVEN is planning over the next 30-months.We are seeking to address some of the most fundamental challenges preventing the future commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. I have full confidence in Driven’s world-leading and internationally respected team of specialists to deliver this project." Telefonica, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's R&D lab Race, UK domain registry firm Nominet, Oxford Robotics Institute, and Oxfordshire Council, will join Oxbotica in the consortium, as well as the Transport Research Laboratory, which is also supporting FiveAI. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is the latest government initiative to foster development of some emerging technology innovations, and offer alternate ways for commuters to travel to and from the capital. Speaking alongside the announcement, business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: "As part of our Plan for Britain this government wants to create a modern Industrial Strategy to support the key sectors of our economy and spread jobs, prosperity and opportunity around the whole country." "The funding I am announcing today, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support to develop the next generation of technologies across a range of sectors, shows our determination and commitment to making sure the UK remains at the very forefront of research and innovation." Picture courtesy of The Gateway Project 19/04/2017: Baidu to open its autonomous driving platform Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced it's to provide an open software platform beginning in July for the automotive and autonomous driving industry to help develop autonomous driving systems. Baidu stated it wants to "build a collaborative ecosystem, utilising its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to work together with other companies to promote the development and popularisation of autonomous driving technology". The initiative has been named Project Apollo after the US' lunar landing programme, as the company believes autonomous driving has the same potential to change the world as its namesake did. Apollo will include a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services. The company is planning to open source obstacle perception code and capabilities, trajectory planning, vehicle control, and vehicle operating systems, as well as testing tools. Baidu President and CEO Qi Lu said: "AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles." The company is also going to set up  alliances with partners "who will provide the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components, to achieve broad participation and collaboration and to provide references and recommendations to participants of a rapidly expanding ecosystem enabled by Project Apollo". It hopes that this will make it easier and more efficient to research and develop self driving car technology. Baidu will restrictively open its technology in July and then open it fully towards the end of the year. It also plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. 05/04/2017: A recent disengagement report from Alphabet's Waymo shows that the company's driverless cars are some of the most reliable in the self-driving industry. According to the report, Waymo's autonomous vehicles drove 635,868 cumulative miles over the past year and had 124 disengagements, which are defined as instances where a human needed to take over driving. This means that these vehicles only experienced roughly one disengagement every 5,128 miles. When compared to the competition, results indicated that Waymo's vehicles are significantly more reliable at this point. While Ford only reported three disengagements over the past year, their autonomous vehicles only traveled 590 cumulative miles - a fraction what Waymo's vehicles have completed. BMW didn't fare much better, reporting one disengagement over 638 miles. Despite Waymo's proven reliability, the self-driving company doesn't stack up to the rest of the competition in terms of overall progress. Navigant Research's leaderboard report on autonomous driving suggests that Waymo is ranked seventh on a list of top 10 vendors. BMW and Ford, whose disengagement reports fared worse results, both top Waymo on the list, with Ford considered the number one vendor. The report rated these self-driving industry players in ten categories: vision, go-to market strategy, partners, production strategy, technology, product capability, product quality and reliability, product portfolio, staying power, and sales, marketing and distribution. While the rankings show that Waymo features the most advanced technology, the report found that the company has no production capacity or production deals. 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

And Intel has made the good old PC easy to carry around, without suffering from any withdrawal symptoms.  CNET Here's a disruption in the personal computing space -- the Intel Compute Card -- which also happens to be one of the tiniest computer you’ll ever see. The Intel Compute Card transforms your PC into something you can place in your pocket and take with you on the go. Don’t be fooled by its credit card size, the Compute Card packs in quite a bit of processing power -- it has notebook-class Core i5s inside, despite its diminutive look.  First revealed at CES earlier this year, the Intel Compute Card will support a range of configurations with up to 4GB of RAM, 128GB of flash storage, along with built-in Wi-Fi 802.11 AC and Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless connectivity. What’s more, at the ongoing Computex 2017 technology expo, Intel showcased the Compute Card Device Design Kit, which will be sort of a blueprint for PC manufacturers to replicate and deliver exciting modular, flexible computing products to fully explore the capabilities of the Intel Compute Card. The Intel Compute Card is 95 mm long and 55 mm wide -- just larger than a credit card Intel also put forward a reference design for a tiny desktop PC shell, which comes with USB ports, HDMI, DisplayPort and Ethernet connectivity. Pop in the Compute Card into one of these PC cabinets and it becomes a full-fledged computer. Interested? Well, get ready to buy one of these Intel Compute Cards from August 2017 onwards.

But it turns out AMD’s high-end chip will one-up Intel’s in another way. The Core i9 Extreme Edition has 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Ryzen Threadripper chip has 64. We’ll probably need to wait a little while to know which chip offers better all-around performance, but the additional PCIe 3.0 lanes gives you more options for connecting high-performance graphics cards, storage solutions, or other peripherals.   AMD is also hinting that there won’t just be a single Threadripper chip. Instead, there will be multiple options, including models with “up to” 16 cores and 32 threads. But every version will have the same 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 4-channel DDR4 memory support, and X399 chipset. AMD says ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI all plan to launch Threadripper-compatible motherboards this summer. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

At the top of the Intel Core i9 lineup is the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor -- the first consumer desktop CPU with 18 cores and 36 threads.    RELATED STORIES Review: "Lenovo Yoga Book" Robots star of Taiwan tech fair Father of Android Andy Rubin unveils bezel-less Essential PH-1 smartphone Review: "Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+" Google AI beats master in ancient game of Go The company will begin selling chips with as many as 18 processing cores under a new Core i9 brand aimed at gamers. The world’s largest chipmaker said it’s reaffirming its commitment to providing the fastest PC chips available. Intel’s only competition in PC processors, Advanced Micro Devices, has demonstrated its new Ryzen product outperforming Intel chips. AMD is trying to muscle in on one of the few attractive parts of the PC market with new products the company began offering in the first quarter. Intel estimates that video game enthusiasts and others who are willing to pay for the best computer performance represent a market that will grow as much as 20% a year. That’s amid a total PC market that has shed more than 100 million units since it peaked in 2011, declining each year since then. Underlining just how profitable the high-end processor market can be, the top of Intel’s new range -- called the i9-7980XE -- will go on sale for $1,999 per chip. That’s more than most people will pay for their entire computer. Intel has maintained more than 80% market share and higher average selling prices in PC chips by consistently providing processors that outperform rival offerings. Its strength forced out competitors leaving only AMD, a company that hasn’t turned a profit in five years. But there are those who are still trying to crack Intel’s stronghold. ARM Holdings Plc., announced recently a new design of chips that targets the PC and server markets dominated by Intel. Apple is said to be working on a processor devoted specifically to artificial intelligence-related tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Intel tries to squash rival AMD with new high-end PC chips Review: "Lenovo Yoga Book" Robots star of Taiwan tech fair Father of Android Andy Rubin unveils bezel-less Essential PH-1 smartphone Microsoft unveils new Surface Pro to reverse declining sales Review: "Review: Samsung Galaxy S8+" Google AI beats master in ancient game of Go Market for pet wearables growing in China Vivo V5s: a slight improvement from Vivo's best-selling flagship model Apple plans laptop upgrades as Microsoft enters market    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

The current standard Z270 motherboard chipset is a "consumer" product, and the new X-series processors have a different pin layout, and are designed for a slightly more demanding customer with deeper pockets. The X299 isn't a huge upgrade over the Z270, but it's a major leap past the X99 boards, which hosted the last generation of Intel's most extreme chips. X299 chipsets support up to 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, compared to the paltry eight PCIe 2.0 lanes on X99. Paired with the new processors, you're looking at an embarrassment of I/O — you can load a system up with multi-gigabit Ethernet, a few GPUs, and a couple of M.2 SSDs, and still have headroom to spare for your USB 3.1 daisy chain, Thunderbolt, and a handful of SATA devices. Unfortunately, the fact that Intel is giving two fairly different CPUs (Skylake and Kaby Lake) the X-series treatment means not all X299 motherboards will be created equally. Depending on which CPU you pick, you'll have different amounts of I/O support, and different compatible RAM configurations. That means, depending on your chosen pairing, you can conceivably buy a motherboard with a lot of "features" that you can't make use of, or a CPU that's held back by the motherboard's limits. It sounds as if the whole reason Intel is even offering the lower-end Skylake chips is to let people get a fancy new X299 motherboard now, and upgrade the CPU when budget allows. But if that's the case, anyone with a competent Z270 system on their desk right now won't probably have much of a reason to sidegrade. As Anandtech writes: "This is arguably a big mess." Anyway, let's look at these motherboards! Image: Gigabyte Gigabyte's Auros Gaming series motherboards highlight something most of these systems have in common: some sort of M.2 cooling or monitoring to make sure your fastest SSD drives don't throttle down due to heat concerns. All three models in the series support up to three M.2 drives, which is a nice upgrade over the one or two slots you can expect on most Z270 boards. Because this series is all about gaming, Gigabyte also packed in a bunch of RGB fluff. Image: Asus Asus has an absurd seven different X299 motherboards right out of the gate. The top-end ROG Rampage VI supports four-way SLI, has a 10Gb Ethernet chipset, and 802.11ad Wi-Fi. There's also a little OLED display for peeking your stats. Image: MSI MSI's Gaming M7 ACK has dual Killer E2500 Ethernet controllers and Killer 1535 Wi-Fi which can all be combined into a single connection. EVGA has an overclocking-focused board called the X299 Dark, which supports four-way SLI and also includes dedicated M.2 cooling. There's also triple BIOS support, which is amazing. EVGA also has a micro-ATX form factor board which supports two-way SLI. ASRock managed to make a mini-ITX form factor X299 board, which still includes four memory slots and three M.2 slots, but cuts the GPU opportunities down to one. ASRock's Gaming i9 board meanwhile has 10Gb Ethernet built in. I'm going to wait for some reviews (or at least price tags) to start rolling in before I try and choose a candidate for an X299 build. To be honest, most of the specs are probably overkill for my purposes — and I still haven't put together a Ryzen system! But it's exciting to see this much power and expandability available out of the gate for these long-awaited CPUs.

The Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 packs about everything that that is possible, including advanced VRMs, multiple PCIe slots, a Wi-Fi module, as well as a 10 GbE port. Despite being extremely feature-rich, the new product is not going to be too expensive. Since Intel’s new X299 platform supports a very diverse range of processors that cost from sub-$300 all the way to $1999, makers of motherboards are trying to address different setups with their products accordingly. Some X299 platforms can be considered as “entry-level” (of the ultra high-end) based on their moderate feature set, others may be considered as mid-range and the most advanced models fit into the “extreme” or “workstation-grade” category for prosumers who need every bit of performance they may get. The ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 belongs to the latter category and is thus aimed at systems without compromises that run processors with 10 or more cores, feature multiple graphics cards, up to a dozen of storage devices, and so on. One of the important features of the ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 is its 13-phase digital VRM that uses high endurance coils as well as solid-state capacitors and designed to ensure high overclocking potential. ASRock claims that this PWM can handle 720 A and deliver up to 1300 W of power, which is well above any CPU can consume (or survive). The motherboard carries eight DDR4 DIMM slots and the manufacturer supports memory overclocking up to DDR-4400 and beyond. Previous-gen Intel Core Extreme (Broadwell-E) processors could not run DDR4 at extreme data transfer rates in quad-channel mode and it isn't clear whether the new multi-core Skylake-X will handle DDR4 at 4000+ GT/s in quad-channel mode. However since the X299 platform also supports quad-core Kaby Lake-X CPUs with a dual-channel memory controller that can handle high memory frequencies, support for high DDR4 frequencies may prove especially important for Kaby Lake-X. Another key selling point of the ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 is the the Aquantia AQtion 10 Gb/s Ethernet controller (presumably the AQN-107) that also supports 2.5G and 5G operation. Installing this specific controller on a motherboard that is priced significantly below $500 makes a great deal of sense, as 10 GbE infrastructure (routers, switches) is still very expensive for most users (even those who buy Intel Core X-series CPUs), whereas 2.5G and 5G equipment promises to be a lot cheaper. Whether or not the owner of the X299 Professional Gaming i9 plans to invest in 10 GbE hardware, they will be ready for everything faster than GbE, and that adds value to the motherboard. In addition to the 10 GbE port, the mainboard also has two GbE headers enabled by controllers from Intel. For scenarios when wired connections are unavailable, the motherboard has a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller). Next up is expandability. The Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 has four PCIe 3.0 x16 slots (2 × x16, 2 × x8): three can be used for graphics cards running in AMD CrossFireX or NVIDIA SLI multi-GPU mode, the fourth can be used for an SSD or any other device. Besides, the board has 10 SATA 6 Gbps connectors for systems that need a huge number of SATA storage devices. ASRock's Fatal1ty X299 for Intel Core X-Series   Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 CPU Support Intel Core i9 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i5 CPUs in LGA2066 form-factor Graphics 4 × PCIe 3.0 x16 (2 × x16, 2 × x8) 3-way AMD CrossFireX and NVIDIA SLI supported Chipset Intel X299 Memory Eight DDR4 DIMM slots Ethernet 1 × Aquantia AQtion AQN-107 10 GbE 2 × Intel GbE controllers Storage 10 × SATA 6 Gbps 3 × M.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) Audio Realtek ALC1220 7.1 channel audio USB 8 × USB 3.0 Type-A 6 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 (Gen 2) Type-C 1 × USB 3.1 internal header ASMedia ASM3142 controller for USB 3.1 Other I/O Dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 Form-Factor ATX MSRP $350 When it comes to connectivity, the Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 has something to brag about even beyond its vast networking capabilities. The motherboard uses ASMedia’s latest ASM3142 controller that is backed by a PCIe 3.0 x2 connect (instead of x1 in case of the ASM1142) and thus offers higher bandwidth than its predecessor. In total, the board supports eight USB 3.0 Type-A ports, six USB 2.0 connectors, two USB 3.1 (Gen 2) receptacles (Type-A, Type-C) as well as one USB 3.1 (Gen 2) header for a USB-C port on the front of the PC that can deliver 36 W of power. Finally, the platform has a 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) with the Sound Blaster Cinema 3 software enhancements by Creative. The ASRock Fatal1ty X299 Professional Gaming i9 will be available in the coming months for about $350. For those, who don’t need a 10G Ethernet port, 36 W power delivery on the front USB-C port and some other minor things, ASRock will offer the X299 Taichi motherboard that uses the same PCB, but without the aforementioned features, at around $300.

Reply ckbryant - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link 720 Amps would surely be enough to fry most any component imaginable. I assume like the article reads this was a "extreme" scenario where they tested what it would fail at. Cause I've had vacuum cleaners at 25 Amps that the cord would get so hot, you'd have to unplug it. So 'moar cores' don't mean "moar amps" at least not that many lol Reply genekellyjr - Saturday, June 03, 2017 - link Remember that heat is from wattage, which is amps*voltage! These CPUs are rolling at 1.4V max while your vacuum cleaner was rocking 120VRMS so 25A*120VRMS = 3000WRMS (and the cord was possibly inadequately gauged for such a duty) while these CPUs would be drawing a mere 720A*1.4V = 1008W. These are heavily simplified numbers for complicated electronics but will be roughly in the ball park! But yeah that CPU'd be totes toast at that wattage Reply r3loaded - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link $350 is a lot less than I was expecting for a board with everything but the kitchen sink (the kitchen sink in question being Thunderbolt 3).

The Surface Pro looks like a 12-inch tablet, but it’s more than just another tablet. The hardware inside lets users install touch-friendly apps from Microsoft’s Windows Store and programs from the internet. The keyboards and built-in kickstands let buyers use them as laptops when they need to get work done. The Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3 account for most Surface sales, according to Microsoft. Together with the Surface Laptop, Surface Studio and Surface Book, the new Surface Pro finally gives Microsoft an up-to-date line-up for every kind of Windows user. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2017 Surface Pro release, including its new features and updated accessories. 2017 Surface Pro Features The 2017 Surface Pro is more than a processor upgrade and less than a complete redesign. It’s still a tablet with the internals of a laptop. The device’s magnesium body is one-third of an inch thick, making it just as thin as the Surface Pro 4. The 2736 x 1824 12.3-inch display isn’t any sharper or brighter than the Surface Pro 4’s. Most of the upgrades are for Surface Pen lovers. The 2017 Surface Pro has a display technology that can sense when users are tilting the new $99 Surface Pen while drawing or taking notes. It’s now capable of sensing 4,096 different levels of pressure from the accessory, too. Microsoft plans to deliver updated Office programs that include these new pen features. Kickstand upgrades let the 2017 Surface Pro achieve a 165-degree angle. Microsoft says that this new angle boosts comfort for users who draw and take notes. This new Windows 2-in-1 isn’t any thinner or lighter than its predecessor, but it is a better tablet and laptop. Using 7th Generation Intel Core processors and new cooling techniques allowed Microsoft to get rid of the fans on the Intel Core m3 and Intel Core i5 models. Nothing is more distracting than the hum the fans in older Surface devices make when you are watching a movie, reading a book or listening to music. The 2017 Surface Pro lasts for 13.5 hours of video playback, which is far more than the 9 hours the Surface Pro 4 is capable of. Loud 1.6-watt Dolby Premium Audio speakers let the tablet fill a room with sound while keeping down distortion. The 2017 Surface Pro will have LTE mobile data. That’s the same technology that lets iPads connect to the internet when there’s no Wi-Fi. The iPad and iPad Pro have had LTE for years, but Microsoft has never included it in a Surface Pro. Read: iPad Pro Review: Why I Returned the 2017 iPad 2017 Surface Pro Release Date & Pre-Orders The 2017 Surface Pro release date is June 15th. Past Surface Pro launches have happened in stages, but this launch is different. The 2017 Surface Pro will come to 26 countries on release day. Both Best Buy and the Microsoft Store have 2017 Surface Pro pre-orders available. More stores and websites than these two should offer pre-orders as we get closer to launch. 2017 Surface Pro Specs & Price Excluding the RAM, processor and storage, every 2017 Surface Pro has the same features. Each of them gets the 13.5 hours of video playback that Microsoft promises. They all have a 5-megapixel front-facing camera that lets users sign in with Windows Hello and a rear-facing 8-megapixel camera that supports autofocus. A microSDXC card reader, Surface Connect charging, headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort and a place to connect a Surface Type Cover come in each. The new Surface Pro starts at $799. This model has an Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB of solid-state storage and 4GB of RAM. It uses Intel HD Graphics 615, which can’t power demanding games, but handles photo editing just fine. The $799 2017 Surface Pro lacks a fan because the Core m3 processor doesn’t need one. The Intel Core i5 model has 128GB of solid state storage, 4GB of RAM and no fan for the processor. Intel HD Graphics 620 are inside, which slightly boosts its performance for really basic games. This model costs $999. There is just a single upgrade option for the new Surface with Core i5 processor. Shoppers can replace the model’s 128GB of storage with 256GB of storage and double its RAM to 8GB. These upgrades cost $1,299. The $1,599 model with Intel Core i7 has Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 for better performance in games, video editing and 3D modeling. This 2017 Surface Pro’s processor has a fan to expel heat. Two upgrades for the model with Intel Core i7 processor are available.  The $2,199 model adds 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. Shoppers can boost the Core i7 model’s storage to 1TB and add 16GB of RAM for a total cost of $2,699. 2017 Surface Pro Accessories & Accessory Compatibility The 2017 Surface Pro works with all existing Surface accessories. The Type Covers from Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3 dock to its connector just fine. It works with the older Surface Pen, but without the additional levels of pressure and tilt sensitivity for drawing. Docking though the Surface Connect port still works. The 2017 Surface Pro doesn’t come with a Surface Dial. That’s the $99 accessory that lets Surface users change settings in apps and programs. Buyers can place the Surface Dial on the 2017 Surface Pro’s screen to get options tailored to their apps. New 2017 Surface Pro accessories are coming. Unfortunately, Microsoft has stopped including the Surface Pen with the Surface Pro. The new Surface Pen costs $99 and comes in black, silver, burgundy and cobalt. It no longer has a clip for securing it to a shirt pocket or the cover. Instead, its magnets let it snap to the left side of the 2017 Surface Pro. Another generation of Surface Type Covers is on the way. These 2017 covers come in silver, burgundy and cobalt and are covered in Alcantara fabric. Microsoft says that Alcantara is softer than the fabric on the Surface Pro 4 covers. Each of these covers costs $159.99. 2017 Surface Pro Deals Best Buy has two 2017 Surface Pro deals. Shoppers that pre-order there can get $100 off their new device. The savings requires a College Student Deals membership, which is free but restricted to students. Best Buy will set up the Windows 2-in-1 and transfer any information that you have on your PC for free. 7 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Huawei MateBook - $399   1 / 7 The Huawei MateBook has an attractive price and two configurations for shoppers to pick from. This machine offers 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor for just $399. More expensive configurations add an Intel Core m5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of solid state storage. Buyers eager for a Windows 2-in-1 without lots of extra ports and distractions may like this device. Its metal frame has just a USB Type-C port, a headset jack and a connection for its add-on keyboard. The front is dominated by a 12-inch 2160 x 11440 display, putting what you're working on or watching at the forefront of your experience. Read: Huawei MateBook Review: If iPad and Surface Mated You’ll need to factor in the cost of the digital pen and the keyboard because neither of these comes with the Huawei MateBook. They, like the tablet itself, are cheaper than what Surface offers. The MatePen is just $49 from the Microsoft Store. The keyboard, which has a kickstand for propping the device up and backlit keys, costs $99. A Surface Type Cover costs $129.99. The Surface Pen sells for $59.99.

Intel is looking to transform how new features are delivered to connected devices with its new Compute Card. By Liam Tung | May 31, 2017 -- 13:50 GMT (06:50 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Intel has launched Compute Card, a slim, modular PC that it wants other brands to incorporate into connected things, such as kiosks, smart TVs, different form factor PCs, and home appliances. The top-tier model features a seventh-generation Intel i5-7Y57 CPU, 4GB RAM, up to a 128GB solid-state drive, and wireless chip. Intel's ultra-slim Compute Card to ease upgrades for IoT devices Roughly the size of a credit card, the super-tiny PC can fit a Kaby Lake processor, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and more in a package that's just 5mm thick. Read More The Compute Card differs from Intel's Compute Stick, which was for consumers who needed a small PC to plug into a living-room display. Instead, the Compute Card will show up in devices like an all-in-one and mini PC from Foxconn, LG smart monitors, Sharp digital signage, and a range of other traditional computing devices. The Compute Card's modular design is meant to make it easier for consumers to upgrade smart features in their connected devices, simply by slotting in a new card. Manufacturers would benefit by incorporating a compatible slot into their connected products, cutting the need, for example, to develop their own circuit boards. Lenovo, Dell, and HP are working on Compute Card-powered products, but they're not ready for showing yet, according to Intel. Intel unveiled the Compute Card at CES earlier this year and is now gearing up to ship the devices in August. Intel has released a Compute Card Device Design Kit for product developers, which includes guides and reference designs to support the card. To get developers started, it's also built its own Card Compute Dock with a 19V DC power supply, HDMI port and USB 3.0 ports to connect displays and other peripherals. Though the dock would appeal to consumers, it appears to be aimed at product developers who support customer signage and conference-room systems. It also has a reference design dock that can be customized to fit other connected products. Intel is encouraging would-be Compute Card developers to consider how they would embed, cool, and eject the compute module in a way that meets its requirements for a mechanical secure lock. The Compute Card will be available in four configurations outlined below. Intel's Compute Card comes in four configurations.

An eSIM is an embedded chip which can remove the need to buy a SIM card – and insert it into a device’s SIM tray – when a user wants to connect to a cellular network. When Apple launched its iPad Pro in 2016, the company included an Apple SIM embedded in the device. The embedded Apple SIM supported networks in the US and UK at the time.

Photographer: John Angelillo/Pool via Bloomberg President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, agreed Tuesday to turn over a limited number of documents sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee for its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Flynn has agreed to initially produce documents the committee subpoenaed from his two companies, Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc., according to a person with knowledge of Flynn’s negotiations with the committee. It wasn’t yet determined what kind of documents will be handed over, the person said. The committee also had issued a separate subpoena for Flynn to turn over personal documents and to testify. Although Flynn initially opposed that subpoena, the committee has since narrowed its focus, the person said. Flynn has now agreed to turn over personal documents that the committee, through legal standards, can prove exist, the person said, but he hasn’t agreed to testify before the committee. Flynn will start producing documents on June 6, with more to follow, the person said, adding that Flynn wants to cooperate with the committee to the fullest extent possible as long as doing so doesn’t jeopardize his constitutional rights. Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after revelations that he misled administration officials about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador, had been under threat of a contempt citation after turning down the panel’s request for documents and an interview. His lawyer cited the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, arguing that the committee’s request was overly broad. Russian Influence The committee is investigating Russian meddling in the presidential race and the possibility of collusion by members of Trump’s campaign. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was a top adviser to Trump during his run for president. He has become a central figure in congressional investigations as well an FBI probe that now is being overseen by a special counsel, former FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Sign Up The investigations have entangled a number of Trump advisers and associates, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a senior White House adviser. In December, before Trump took office, Kushner and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak met in New York and talked about possibly setting up a secure and secretive communications channel between the Kremlin and Trump’s transition team, according to a person familiar with the matter. That’s led some Democrats to call for revocation of Kushner’s security clearance. Separately, Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, turned down requests from House and Senate investigators for information and testimony, saying their questions were “poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered.” Like the president and his other allies, Cohen questioned why the investigation was continuing. Blanket Denial “To date, there has not been a single witness, document or piece of evidence linking me to this fake Russian conspiracy,” Cohen said. “This is not surprising to me because there is none.” Russian officials also deny any collusion. The Kremlin sees “hourly” attempts at “fomenting and maintaining Russophobic sentiments” in the U.S., spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday. “It has a very negative impact overall on the atmosphere of our bilateral relations,” Peskov said. Flynn has been under scrutiny since being ousted from the administration. He previously offered to testify to Congress in exchange for immunity from prosecution, a request lawmakers rejected. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last week that Flynn may have lied in his application for a security clearance by saying that his paid speech at a Moscow gala for a Russian TV network in 2015 had been “funded by U.S. companies.” Documents previously released by congressional Democrats show he received more than $45,000 from RT, the Russian government-backed television network, for his participation at a gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin’s table.

Lewandowski explained that "when you have a communications team, they have to have that relationship with the president, to understand how he communicates, because he is the greatest communicator as a president that we've ever had." While the implication that one must already understand how Trump communicates in order to see he's a great communicator may seem dubious, White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks also effused Tuesday that Trump "has an unparalleled ability to communicate with people." The communications shakeup at the White House could see Lewandowski returning to the employ of his former boss. Trump is reportedly considering adding Lewandowski to the communications department; Trump had also considered adding his former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, although Bossie has since expressed his wish not to join the White House. Press Secretary Sean Spicer's on-camera appearances are nevertheless expected to be rolled back and the Great Communicator will reportedly be holding more press conferences on his own.

Qatar 11:40 p.m. ET   Sean Gallup/Getty Images Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates are breaking off diplomatic ties with Qatar, with Saudi Arabia accusing Qatar of backing

Saudi Arabia also believes Qatar is supporting "Iranian-backed terrorist groups" that are active in east Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The countries are halting air and sea travel to and from Qatar, with Saudi Arabia also closing down land crossings. Qatari diplomats now have 48 hours to leave the UAE, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.

Hundreds of people attended the "Trump Free Speech" rally at Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, CNN reports, and even more counter-protesters gathered across the street. Police say at first, the two sides yelled expletives at each other, then counter-protesters started to throw glass bottles and bricks at the officers, who responded by using pepper spray. Tensions in the city have been high since three men were stabbed last week, two fatally, on a light-rail train by a man who was allegedly yelling anti-Muslim statements at two young women. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had unsuccessfully requested that the permit be revoked for the free-speech rally, saying, "I'm a strong supporter of the First Amendment no matter what the views are that are being expressed, but given the timing of this rally, I believed we had a case to make about the threats to public safety." Organizer Joey Gibson noted that the protest was planned before the murders, said he is not racist or a member of the alt-right movement, and argued that the rally was not in support of stabbing suspect Jeremy Christian.

Organizers said the concert, which had a heavy police presence, raised £2 million ($2.57 million) for the victims and families of those killed two weeks ago at Grande's concert in Manchester. The crowd was filled with people holding signs of support for Manchester and the victims, and Grande said the "kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now." With the £2 million raised Sunday, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has collected more than £10 million in donations.

Mitchell/Getty Images The Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the Saturday night attacks in London that left seven people dead and 48 wounded. The official ISIS news agency posted a message Sunday claiming that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks yesterday," the SITE Intelligence Group reports, including running into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people at Borough Market. Police shot and killed the three suspects, and later arrested 12 people in East London connected to one of the suspects, a man who wore a fake bomb vest. Investigators said they do not see any links so far between what happened in London and the suicide bombing in Manchester two weeks ago that killed more than 20 people.

"You and I, you and I personally, have a much closer relationship than I had with Mr. Flynn," Putin said in a translated voiceover. In Putin's account of a widely circulated photo of the Russian president eating dinner next to Flynn, the seating arrangement was unexpected. "I got up and left," Putin said. "And then afterwards I was told, 'You know there was an American gentleman. He was involved in some things. He used to be in the security services' ... that's it. I didn't even really talk to him." Flynn is now subject to a criminal investigation pertaining to his possible communication with Russian officials during and after the 2016 election. Watch an excerpt of the Kelly interview below. Bonnie Kristian   Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. A house divided Edit 2 GOP senators critique Trump's travel ban plan 12:30 p.m. ET   Pool/Getty Images President Trump used Saturday's terror attack in London as an occasion to tout his travel ban executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, which remains stalled pending a Supreme Court ruling. "We need to be smart, vigilant and tough," he wrote on Twitter. "We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump's rallying cry has not been met with universal acclaim, including within his own party. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News Sunday he believes "the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting," but that this could be accomplished "without a travel ban." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was even less enthusiastic. "I think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it has been rejected by the courts," she said Sunday in a CBS interview, while allowing that the U.S. should do a "better job of vetting." Across the aisle, Trump's raising of the travel ban topic also came under fire from former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who served under President Obama. "There's a very real risk that by stigmatizing and isolating Muslims from particular countries, and Muslims in general, that we alienate the very communities here in the United States whose cooperation we most need to detect and prevent these homegrown extremists from being able to carry out attacks," she said while appearing on ABC News.

Already the overclocking crews at Computex have been pushing key products from this HEDT CPU range to their limits and are breaking OC and benchmark world records. Intel Core-X TIM and delidding While it's great to see the capabilities of these chips, and the platform, easily exceed those that came before them, that fact is tempered with some not-so-good news. Sadly Intel's most premium consumer processors still use a 'conventional paste' thermal interface material (TIM). They aren't soldered, so getting the best extreme clock speeds from these parts requires delidding (German language, toggle on the English subtitles), says OC expert der8auer. Skylake-X delidded In the linked video you can see first a Kaby Lake-X processor die (with the lid removed). It is the same size as previously available dies but comes on a bigger and thicker package which facilitates higher clocks thanks to better signalling, more VCC and GND pins, explains the overclocking expert. Moving onto Skylake-X it's an altogether trickier delidding process as the die on a raised level under the lid and surrounded by many tiny raised-up capacitors and resistors. Thus der8auer has designed a tool to help you delid a Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processor, called the Delid Die Mate X (available by the end of June). HWBot world records Moving onto the achievements of the new Intel Core-X processors on X299 motherboards, numerous overclocking world record have already been broken. If you head on over to the world record page of HWBot you can see plenty of new records from the last couple of days. Within the CPU benchmarks table, reproduce above, five out of the 12 listed records have been broken by Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors in the past two days. It looks like the Intel Core i7 7740K and Intel Core i9 7900X are particularly popular with overclockers with records broken in PiFast, SuperPi, and more. You will also find a slew of GPU and application world records broken by overclockers using the new Intel Core i7 7740K and Intel Core i9 7900X as you scroll down through the HWBot world record page. Intel's 8th generation Core processors Here's another important Intel News segment from Computex. Intel has briefly announced that its 8th generation Core processors will deliver more than 30 per cent performance improvements compared to 7th gen parts. It announced this as a 'commitment' with the first devices packing these processors expected to be available by Xmas.

I agree but solder costs money i mean they would have to add at least another $100 to solder the lids on te cpus. (sarcasm) They are bareley scracping by charging what they do, i mean look at all the innovation they have brough us in the last few years (/sarcasm). I have a feeling in a couple of years we will start to see the same anti competative practises admissions from some OEMs (not by the OEMs but by Intel) which we heard in the past when thunderbird etc could nbot get a foothold in the market despite being better.

Why not, it happens everywhere else. Motor manufacturers spend vast amounts of R&D yet still have to issue recalls because they cheap out on a component. Posted by Corky34 - Wed 31 May 2017 15:04 MonkFish Why not, it happens everywhere else. Motor manufacturers spend vast amounts of R&D yet still have to issue recalls because they cheap out on a component. Because CPUs and material sciences isn't comparable to motor manufacturers where cheaping out on a component isn't financially, let alone scientifically, provable to be detrimental to the final product. And before anyone jumps down my throat I'm not saying Intel uses the best quality TIM full stop, I'm saying they use a TIM best suited for their specific needs and those needs do not include cutting costs, a TIM needs to do more than just provide low thermal resistance.

The Snapdragon 835 processor, which has been used in smartphones, will power the new computers Intel's processors are still more powerful, however Todd Haselton | @robotodd Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | 9:06 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters New Windows 10 PCs will run on Qualcomm chips, but Intel investors shouldn't worry just yet    Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | 1:02 PM ET | 00:51 HP, Asus and Lenovo will build new Windows 10 computers running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. It may sound like something Intel should worry about, but investors shouldn't sound the alarm just yet. First, some backstory: It's the first time Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips have been used to power a full version of Windows, which usually runs on processors from AMD or Intel. Microsoft has tried Qualcomm chips with lighter versions of its OS such as Windows RT, but those efforts failed because the computers couldn't run most apps designed for Windows. That's what changes now. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor, typically reserved for smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, will power the new Windows 10 computers and will offer constant connectivity. That means folks who buy a new computer from Asus, HP or Lenovo should expect it to come with the option to add it to their wireless carrier for data service when Wi-Fi isn't available. Qualcomm said the new computers will be "lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available," while also offering longer battery life than current solutions on the market. It sounds appealing, but here's why Intel shouldn't worry. While the Snapdragon 835 is a powerful-enough chip for smartphones, you shouldn't expect these computers to offer robust support for rendering in Photoshop or video editing, even though Qualcomm promises support for "all Windows applications." Those functions might work in some regard, but don't expect these machines to be the most powerful on the market. Qualcomm's chips are becoming more and more powerful, but they're still not a match for a full-fledged seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, the sorts that are used in the latest flagship computers from companies such as Dell and Microsoft, and which we expect to launch in Apple's new MacBooks as soon as next week. These are some of Qualcomm's first steps onto Intel's territory, where Intel has mainly had to worry about AMD as a competitor, so it's still a move worth watching. A final point: we still don't know when the first Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 computers will launch, or how much they'll cost, the latter of which will be important if Qualcomm wants to take share from Intel.

The new X299E-ITX/ac is small, but it takes full advantage of Intel’s new X299 platform, offering support for all CPUs with up to 18 cores, quad-channel DDR4 memory on the higher-end CPUs, three PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots as well as everything that one might expect from a Mini-ITX board, including Wi-Fi. Besides being a miniature motherboard for Intel's HEDT processors, the most important aspect of the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac is support for quad-channel memory in this form-factor. The company’s previous-gen Intel X99-based Mini-ITX mainboard was feature-packed, but one of the things it missed was the quad-channel memory sub-system, which had an expected negative effect on performance in applications that required high memory bandwidth. By contrast, the new unit has four SO-DIMM DDR4 memory slots and even supports DDR4 overclocking (assuming that there are SO-DIMMs that can be significantly overclocked). In fact, putting four memory slots onto a small motherboard while also fitting the LGA 2066 socket and required high-capactiy VRMs is a rather remarkable engineering achievement. The flip side however is that the very tightly packed design of the X299E-ITX/ac may impose certain limitations on compatibility with large cooling systems. Just like every other Mini-ITX motherboard around, the ASRock X299E-ITX/ac has only one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for graphics cards. In the meantime, the X299E-ITX/ac is the first miniature mainboard to feature three M.2 slots (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) for SSDs. In addition, the board carries six SATA 6 Gbps headers for builds that require multiple storage devices in drive form-factor. It is noteworthy that in order to fit everything it wanted onto a Mini-ITX PCB, ASRock had to place the USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and one M.2 slot on custom DIMM-like modules - essentially going vertical when they ran out of horizontal space. Such modules add certain dimension-related limitations to the size of CPU radiators (plus, it remains to be seen how higher-end M.2 SSDs perform when located near a CPU cooler), but this is a tradeoff that the manufacturer had to take. As for connectivity, the X299E-ITX/ac comes with a 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 module (based on an Intel controller), two GbE ports (Intel controllers too), two USB 3.1 headers  (Type-A and Type-C), six USB 3.0 connectors, 7.1-channel audio sub-system (enabled by the Realtek ALC1220 controller) and so on. ASRock's Mini-ITX Motherboard for Intel Core X-Series   X299E-ITX/ac CPU Support Intel Core i9 Intel Core i7 Intel Core i5 CPUs in LGA2066 form-factor Graphics PCIe 3.0 x16 Chipset Intel X299 Memory Four DDR4 SO-DIMM slots Ethernet 2 × Intel GbE controllers Storage 6 × SATA 6 Gbps 3 × M.2 (PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA) Audio Realtek ALC1220 7.1 channel audio USB 6 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 Type-A 1 × USB 3.1 Type-C Other I/O Dual band 802.11ac Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.2 Form-Factor Mini-ITX MSRP $280 ~ $300 The ASRock X299E-ITC/ac will be available in the coming months for about $280 - $300, depending on the region and other factors. Such a price point is considerably higher than MSRPs of most Mini-ITX motherboards, but given the fact that this is a very high-end platform (with equally high component requirements) aimed at enthusiasts, it is not unusual. In fact, from many standpoint it may be considered as an entry-level X299 board simply because it does not provide opulence of its bigger brethren.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > HyperX revamped its Predator-branded DDR4 lineup… HyperX revamped its Predator-branded DDR4 lineup to include 4,000MHz sticks By Kevin Parrish — Updated May 31, 2017 1:02 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC builders and customers looking to update their current memory configuration now have a load of options from HyperX, including kits running at 4,000MHz. Talk about quick thinking! Kingston Technology’s HyperX gaming division introduced new HyperX Predator DDR4 system memory kits with speeds (frequencies) of up to a staggering 4,000MHz. The company also added kits with high storage capacities of up to 128GB clocked at 3,000MHz. All memory sticks provided in the new kits support Intel’s Extreme Memory Profile (XMP) technology for easy and safe overclocking. Here is what HyperX now offers: Single sticks: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3/8 8GB 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3/8 8GB 2,666MHz CL13 HX430C15PB3/8 8GB 3,000MHz CL15 HX424C12PB3/16 16GB 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3/16 16GB 2,666MHz CL13 HX430C15PB3/16 16GB 3,000MHz CL15 Two-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 2,666MHz CL13 HX436C17PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 3,600MHz CL17 HX440C19PB3K2/16 16GB (2x 8GB) 4,000MHz CL19 HX424C12PB3K2/32 32GB (2x 32GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K2/32 32GB (2x 32GB) 2,666MHz CL13 Four-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX424C12PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 2,666MHz CL13 HX433C16PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 3,333MHz CL16 HX436C17PB3K4/32 32GB (4x 8GB) 3,600MHz CL17 HX424C12PB3K4/64 64GB (4x 16GB) 2,400MHz CL12 HX426C13PB3K4/64 64GB (4x 16GB) 2,666MHz CL13 Eight-pack kit: Part Number Capacity Frequency Latency HX430C15PB3K8/128 128GB (8x 16GB) 3,000MHz CL15 Regarding latency, that “CL” designation is short for Column Access Strobe Latency. The typical memory stick consists of the printed circuit board (PCB), storage modules soldered onto that PCB, and input/output pins on the PCB that make an electrical connection to the motherboard’s memory socket. Latency starts when the motherboard’s memory controller tells the memory stick to access data stored on one of its modules, and ends when that data is made available on the PCB/stick’s input-output pins. That said, a DDR4 memory stick clocked at 2,400 with a CL17 latency will see that data retrieval process completed in around 14.17 nanoseconds. Typically, the faster the stick’s frequency/speed, the lower the latency. Yet despite the Intel-based XMP overclocking profiles, the HyperX Predator memory sticks work just fine in the latest AMD-based PCs as well. Overall, each Predator-branded stick provided in the HyperX kits consumes up to 1.35 volts of energy, and has an operating temperature ranging from zero degrees Celsius to 85 degrees Celsius. They also measure approximately 133.35mm x 42.2mm. “HyperX continues to lead the gaming memory market with high quality, high-performance memory for anyone building a new DDR4 rig,” says Kristy Ernt, global memory business manager, HyperX. “If you are a fan of AMD or Intel, HyperX memory offers the enhanced performance needed to game at your best.” HyperX didn’t provide any pricing at the time this article went live, but the company appears to have completely revamped its lineup of Predator DDR4 kits with this new rollout. HyperX also mentioned a two-pack kit of 8GB (2x 4GB) in its Computex announcement on Tuesday, May 30, but didn’t list the part number along with all the other kits posted above. We expect more information will surface once Computex comes to a close later this week.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Buying a new MacBook this week is a really bad idea - here's why Apple is expected to update its MacBook range at its annual WWDC event on 5 June. By Alistair Charlton May 31, 2017 13:13 BST Put that MacBook down. Apple is set to update its laptop range on 5 JuneReuters Step away from the Apple Store and put your credit card away, because now is a really bad time to buy a new MacBook. Let us explain. Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, or WWDC, kicks off on 5 June with a keynote address led by company CEO Tim Cook. New products are always expected from WWDC, but this year the volume of rumours surrounding an update to Apple's laptop lineup mean you should hold off for now. The MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and regular MacBook lines are all expected to be updated at WWDC, according to Bloomberg, which has a strong track record for Apple gossip. The website reported: "Apple is planning three new laptops, according to people familiar with the matter. The MacBook Pro will get a faster Kaby Lake processor from Intel Corp...Apple is also working on a new version of the 12in MacBook with a faster Intel chip. The company is also considering updating the aging 12in MacBook Air with a new processor as sales of the laptop, Apple's cheapest, remain surprisingly strong, one of the people said." By adopting Kaby Lake processors, the MacBook Pro range is expected to get a boost to both performance and battery life. The entire Mac lineup is marked as 'don't buy' or 'caution' by the MacRumors buying guide, which tracks how often Apple traditionally updates each product, then states how many days it has been since the last refresh and whether consumers should buy now or wait. At the time of publication, the MacBook, Apple's smallest laptop, has not been updated for 407 days compared to an average of 375 days. The MacBook Air, however, has gone 814 days since an update compared to an average of 350. The MacBook Pro is the newest of the Apple laptop family, having seen an update 216 days ago. This is just over 100 days short of the computer's average, but MacRumors has applied a caution note to it regardless. Further evidence of a refresh comes from the online Apple Store, which reports a week-long delivery time for some models of MacBook Pro, suggesting that stock is drying up in anticipation of something new. As Apple blog 9to5Mac states: "When shipping dates lapse at the Apple Online Store, it is often a good indicator that a new version is coming soon. When those dates coincide with an Apple event, it's an even stronger signal." The iMac, Apple's desktop computer, is also well overdue an update at 596 days compared to an average of 317 and the Mac Mini sits at 958 days, over double the average update cycle. But, for now, all rumours point towards WWDC 2017 being about MacBooks - and an Amazon Echo rival dubbed the Siri Speaker.

Given the fact that this is a high-end platform, GIGABYTE has opted to use their premium AORUS brand for all three initial models, which are the X299 AORUS Gaming 9, X299 AORUS Gaming 7, and X299 AORUS Gaming 3. Starting off with the flagship X299 AORUS Gaming 9, we get to see GIGABYTE's unconstrained vision for this new HEDT platform. The X299 AORUS Gaming 9 has what appears to be a 12-phase CPU power design, and features Nippon Chemi-Con 10K Durable Black solid capacitors everywhere but in the audio subsystem. There are two 8-pin CPU/EPS power connectors, which should come in handy if a high TDP 18-core Skylake-X processor is installed or just when doing some extreme overclocking. Making full use of this platform numerous PCIe lanes, there are five mechanical PCIe x16 slots, all of which have been mechanically reinforced with steel and additional anchor points for improved retention and shearing resistance. Two of the slots run at x16, one of the slots runs at x8, and the other two are limited to x4, which means that this motherboard will 'only' be able to handle up to three-way graphics card configurations. Storage connectivity appears to be excellent with eight SATA 6Gb/s ports and three M.2 slots that support SATA, PCI-E, NVMe M.2 solid state drives and Intel's new Optane Memory technology. All three slots feature a Thermal Guard cover to help protect and cool the M.2 drives. For those who need a fourth M.2 slot, GIGABYTE have also included an M.2 add-in card in the accessories bundle. If the lack of an U.2 port is a concern, worry not since there is also a  M.2 to U.2 adapter included. This motherboard also supports four USB 2.0 ports (two headers), eight USB 3.0 ports (four rear, two headers), and seven USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (five rear, one header). Focusing on the full-speed USB 3.1 Gen2 ports, there are an impressive four Type-A ports and one Type-C port on the rear I/O panel, and a USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel internal header next to the memory slots. At least some of this USB 3.1 Gen2 connectivity is courtesy of the brand new ASMedia 3142 controller. When it comes to networking, there are two gigabit LAN ports, one powered by an Intel controller and one by a Rivet Networks Killer E2500 chip. The onboard dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi is courtesy of a Killer Wireless-AC 1535 module that supports transfer rates of up to 867Mbps. The wired and wireless Killer interfaces can be used together via the Killer DoubleShot Pro feature to direct high priority traffic to the fastest interface or they can be combined to create one very high throughput interface. While the name might be familiar - Amp-Up Audio - this motherboard features a brand new high-end onboard audio design. It is based on the familiar Realtek ALC1220 codec, but it has been bolstered by some pretty serious components, like a ESS SABRE 9018K2M DAC, Texas Instruments LME 49720 and OPA1622 OP-AMPs, and WIMA audio capacitors. They have also included Creative's Sound BlasterX 720° audio engine software. As should be pretty clear from the above picture, the X299 AORUS Gaming 9 has been outfitted with a ton of RGB LED lighting zones. There are LEDs between the individual memory slots, on both sides of each of the the PCIe slots, built into the chipset cooler, and there's even LED strips integrated into the I/O and audio section covers. Even the rear I/O shield glows! If that's not enough, there are also three headers on which you can plug LED light strips. Speaking of headers, there are seven fan headers, including three water pump headers, one of which is a high current 3 amp version. Apparently some of these Hybrid Fan headers that can provide up-to-the-second information on flow-rate and water temperature and can be monitored in the Smart Fan 5 software suite. The two onboard temperature sensor headers should also be able to feed data into the utility. The bottom edge of the motherboards features an interesting assortment of power and reset buttons, clear CMOS button, ECO button, OC button, and a Debug LED. Last, but not least, the back of the motherboard is covered by a metal armor plate, which will add structural rigidity and protect the various components, solder points, and traces. The X299 AORUS Gaming 7 is far more similar to the Gaming 9 than it is different. When it comes to expansion slots and storage connectivity everything is exactly the same. The only differences are that two of the three M.2 Thermal Guards are missing, and the M.2 to U.2 adapter is not included in the accessories bundle. The onboard audio features the greatest change, with a swap from the ESS Sabre ES9018K2M to the ES9018Q2Ca and the removal of one of the two op-amps. The X299 AORUS Gaming 7 is also missing the fancy glowing I/O shield, though the other RGB FUSION lighting features all remain identical. Since there is no Gaming 5 model yet, the step down from the X299 AORUS Gaming 7 to the X299 AORUS Gaming 3 is a little more severe than between the two previous models. Most notably, the Gaming 3 only has one 8-pin CPU/EPS power connector and only two of its PCIe x16 slots are steel-reinforced. The other clear difference is that there is only two M.2 slots - down one from the higher-end models - and there are no M.2 Thermal Guards at all. The USB 3.1 Gen2 front-panel connector has been replaced with a USB 3.0 version, and three of the USB 3.1 Gen2 ports on the rear I/O panel have been replaced by USB 3.0 ports. So in total, this model has four USB 2.0 ports (two headers), ten USB 3.0 ports (six rear, two headers), and two USB 3.1 Gen2 ports (two rear). Speaking of rear I/O, there is only one gigabit LAN port and no Wi-Fi on the X299 AUROS Gaming 3. The onboard audio has also been demoted, with no DAC or op-amps, and no plastic shroud covering that area either. The RGB FUSION lighting feature has also been cut-down a bit, with no LEDs in between the memory slots and only the two primary PCIe x16 slots being lit instead of all five. While we don't yet have any pricing information for any of the models, the GIGABYTE X299 AORUS Gaming series will be available for purchase sometime in June 2017.

Reply Gothmoth - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link other websites have posted images and infos about X399 boards for 2 days now. could anandtech maybe bring some infos about the x399 boards at computex too? i don´t want to pay 1000+ euro to get my hands on 44 pci lanes. Reply Mark02474 - Saturday, June 03, 2017 - link Disappointing. Has Gigabyte forsaken Thunderbolt 3? Dual Thunderbolt 3 ought to be on the CPU PCIe lanes to get full speed unlike starved Z270 implementation. Here too all those USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports +NVMe + SATA3 are vastly oversubscribed. 8 lanes are enough for me for a single graphics card and I'd rather have the others used for TB3 and NVMe RAID. Audio DACs a disappointment too. New ESS Pro series vastly better than older 9018 parts.

School Zone Latest insights, news in education Features Education Sentinel School Zone Trinity Prep student wins a top award in prestigious Intel science competition Amber Yang, 18, a senior at Trinity Preparatory School created a project that tracks space debris in orbit that won a top prize, $50,000 scholarship, in prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist competition. Amber Yang, 18, a senior at Trinity Preparatory School created a project that tracks space debris in orbit that won a top prize, $50,000 scholarship, in prestigious Intel Foundation Young Scientist competition. Leslie PostalContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Years ago, Amber Yang’s mother decided to feed her daughter’s budding interest in science by hanging a poster of famous scientists in the hallway outside her bedroom. The poster, hung low enough so the then-second grader could read about all their achievements, seems to have done its job. Still on the wall in the family’s Windermere-area home, the poster is now surrounded by plaques and awards celebrating the 18-year-old’s success in science competitions. The latest addition is from earlier this month, a top prize from the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Yang won a “young scientist award” — and a $50,000 prize — for a mathematical analysis used to predict the location of space debris. Her project involves a computer simulation that detects the space junk and then figures out where it will travel next. The goal is to help avoid collisions with spacecraft. The award was an “incredible honor,” she said, and validation of three years of work. She spent hours on her laptop in her room, reading astrophysics journals and learning a computer program to help with her project. She even turned down her mother’s offer to take a cruise during Christmas break last year because she wanted to spend the time on her research. The award also was a huge confidence boost for the teenager who said she had plenty of days when she doubted her efforts, in part because several attempts led to nothing but red error messages on her laptop screen. “This path to success was not easy,” she said. The final round of the competition, held in Los Angeles, was intense and rewarding, giving her a chance to spend time with other teenagers equally passionate about studying science. “It was this great gathering of nerds,” she added with a laugh. Yang’s work stood out even among other excellent projects, said Len Duda, who just retired from the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and served as a coach for the physics and astronomy division at the Intel competition. “I think everyone was just kind of amazed with what she did,” Duda said. The Intel competition “is like the Super Bowl of science fairs,” bringing together some 1,700 student projects from across the country and the world, he said. “To me, just being able to get there is an accomplishment.” Yang won “best in category” in her division and then one of the three top prizes overall. The prize money will help offset costs at Stanford University, where the senior at Trinity Preparatory School will enroll this fall. She plans to major in physics, with a concentration in astrophysics. At Trinity, Yang was a top student who took Advanced Placement chemistry and calculus as a 10th grader — far sooner than most students do — and plenty of other tough courses in the following years. “What’s great is really the way she throws herself into learning,” said Stephanie Dryden, Trinity’s co-director of college counseling. Yang impressed teachers not only with her academic achievements, but also with how down-to-earth and well-rounded she is and how well she tackled challenges, Dryden said. The teenager also played the violin and piano, served as an editor for the student newspaper and read voraciously. As a child, Yang said she was always “the weird kid who was obsessed with space” and loved trips the Kennedy Space Center. Her parents, Joyce Teng and Brian Yang, are both engineers who work at Lockheed Martin and encouraged her interests. Yang liked reading about the scientists on her poster, from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. But early on, she had a question for her mom: “Why are there so few women? They’re all guys.” As she got older, she realized women remain underrepresented in the sciences, particularly in the field she hopes to pursue, and girls often leave the math-science pipeline well before college. She understands why. In middle school, she was the only girl on her school’s robotics team, and the boys left her out, seemingly convinced she had nothing to offer. That discouraged her. But as she explained in a December TEDx talk she gave in Jacksonville, a high school science teacher who said, “Amber Yang can do whatever she wants, if she puts her mind to it” made a difference. “The next time you see the only girl in the room, ask her for her ideas on how to build that robot,” she told the audience at the event meant to showcase “inspiring ideas.” Yang applied to speak at the annual gathering. Her talk was about her efforts to complete her research and to find her place. Yang, who earned a second-place prize at the Intel fair last year and was a finalist in another national competition, said she began her project after reading news reports about an exploded Chinese space satellite and how the debris posed a possible threat to other spacecraft. When she learned data on space debris was publicly available, she knew she could do her project on her laptop, from her pink bedroom stacked with textbooks and notebooks befitting her academic interests and a few relics of her younger years, including stuffed animals and a Hello Kitty pillow. In the years ahead, she hopes to encourage other girls to stick with science, if that is their passion, and some day hopefully help create a different looking famous-scientists poster. “I see myself as having this duty to encourage girls to pursue that,” she added. lpostal@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5273 Student's love of math adds up to big prize » Caption Central Florida’s third graders scored better on the state’s key reading exam this year than last, mirroring an increase seen across Florida.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is reportedly hammering out the details: "They're deciding on whether to initiate a full, formal withdrawal — which could take three years — or exit the underlying United Nations Treaty, which would be faster but more extreme," Axios writes. The Paris agreement, dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, has been signed by every nation except Nicaragua and Syria. Pruitt and Trump have called the global agreement "a bad deal for America." Climate scientists have expressed alarm at the United States' exit: "A Trump presidency might be game over for the climate. It might make it impossible to stabilize planetary warming below dangerous levels," scientist Michael Mann said. "If Trump makes good on his campaign promises and pulls out of the Paris Treaty, it is difficult to see a path forward to keeping warming below dangerous levels." Read more about why the Paris climate agreement is a big deal and why ditching the agreement could have global consequences. Jeva Lange   Trump has reportedly decided to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord May 31, 2017 Developing story Edit Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, UAE cut diplomatic ties with Qatar 11:40 p.m. ET   Sean Gallup/Getty Images Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates are breaking off diplomatic ties with Qatar, with Saudi Arabia accusing Qatar of backing "terrorist groups aiming to destabilize the region," Bloomberg reports, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State. Saudi Arabia also believes Qatar is supporting "Iranian-backed terrorist groups" that are active in east Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The countries are halting air and sea travel to and from Qatar, with Saudi Arabia also closing down land crossings. Qatari diplomats now have 48 hours to leave the UAE, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. Catherine Garcia   Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, UAE cut diplomatic ties with Qatar 11:40 p.m. arrests Edit 14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. ET   Scott Olson/Getty Images Police in Portland, Oregon, arrested 14 people Sunday during dueling demonstrations attended by supporters of President Trump, anti-fascist protesters, and residents concerned about hate speech. Hundreds of people attended the "Trump Free Speech" rally at Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, CNN reports, and even more counter-protesters gathered across the street. Police say at first, the two sides yelled expletives at each other, then counter-protesters started to throw glass bottles and bricks at the officers, who responded by using pepper spray. Tensions in the city have been high since three men were stabbed last week, two fatally, on a light-rail train by a man who was allegedly yelling anti-Muslim statements at two young women. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had unsuccessfully requested that the permit be revoked for the free-speech rally, saying, "I'm a strong supporter of the First Amendment no matter what the views are that are being expressed, but given the timing of this rally, I believed we had a case to make about the threats to public safety." Organizer Joey Gibson noted that the protest was planned before the murders, said he is not racist or a member of the alt-right movement, and argued that the rally was not in support of stabbing suspect Jeremy Christian. Catherine Garcia   14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. Breaking Records Edit Wonder Woman has biggest opening weekend for a female-directed movie 9:54 p.m. ET   Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Wonder Woman brought in an estimated $100.5 million during its North America debut this weekend, making it the best opening ever for a movie directed by a woman. Directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot, the well-received Wonder Woman outperformed such superhero flicks as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy at their openings. Catherine Garcia   Wonder Woman has biggest opening weekend for a female-directed movie 9:54 p.m. Manchester Attack Edit One Love Manchester concert raises $2.6 million for bombing victims 9:09 p.m. ET   Getty Images More than 50,000 people filled the Old Trafford Cricket Grounds Sunday for the One Love Manchester benefit concert, featuring Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, the Black Eyed Peas, Justin Bieber, Oasis' Liam Gallagher, and Robbie Williams. Organizers said the concert, which had a heavy police presence, raised £2 million ($2.57 million) for the victims and families of those killed two weeks ago at Grande's concert in Manchester. The crowd was filled with people holding signs of support for Manchester and the victims, and Grande said the "kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now." With the £2 million raised Sunday, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has collected more than £10 million in donations. Catherine Garcia   One Love Manchester concert raises $2.6 million for bombing victims 9:09 p.m. London Bridge attack Edit ISIS claims responsibility for London attacks 8:33 p.m. ET   Jeff J. Mitchell/Getty Images The Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the Saturday night attacks in London that left seven people dead and 48 wounded. The official ISIS news agency posted a message Sunday claiming that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks yesterday," the SITE Intelligence Group reports, including running into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people at Borough Market. Police shot and killed the three suspects, and later arrested 12 people in East London connected to one of the suspects, a man who wore a fake bomb vest. Investigators said they do not see any links so far between what happened in London and the suicide bombing in Manchester two weeks ago that killed more than 20 people.

Bonnie Kristian   Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. A house divided Edit 2 GOP senators critique Trump's travel ban plan 12:30 p.m. ET   Pool/Getty Images President Trump used Saturday's terror attack in London as an occasion to tout his travel ban executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, which remains stalled pending a Supreme Court ruling. "We need to be smart, vigilant and tough," he wrote on Twitter. "We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump's rallying cry has not been met with universal acclaim, including within his own party. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News Sunday he believes "the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting," but that this could be accomplished "without a travel ban." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was even less enthusiastic. "I think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it has been rejected by the courts," she said Sunday in a CBS interview, while allowing that the U.S. should do a "better job of vetting." Across the aisle, Trump's raising of the travel ban topic also came under fire from former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who served under President Obama. "There's a very real risk that by stigmatizing and isolating Muslims from particular countries, and Muslims in general, that we alienate the very communities here in the United States whose cooperation we most need to detect and prevent these homegrown extremists from being able to carry out attacks," she said while appearing on ABC News.

While we’ll visit their booth for a product tour tomorrow, this evening that had the Republic of Gamers press conference. Targeted specifically at gamers and DiY enthusiasts ASUS introduced the Republic of Gamers (ROG) segment of products several years ago. The ROG branding these days is so big and special that there now are separate press conferences with product introductions for it.  The photo gallery covers all products launched and shown today, and you guys are in luck as seriously hot babe was presenting them all, so please do get your freak on. New items introduced are motherboards, the X399 and Intel X299 range. On stage also was Mr. Huang, CEO of Nvidia talking all things games, VR, and AR.  ASUS has a ton of stuff to show. A new card VROC that can house up-to eight M2 units and reach silly performance in RAID mode over a full X16 PCI-Express link. The unit default towards software RAID, hardware raid needs to be enabled (unlocked) through a physical unlock key and only allows usage of Intel based M2 units. The RAID 0/1 solution will be expensive and starts at 150 USD, for RAID 5 you need to pay roughly 250 USD. We'll post more info later. At the event we also learned that in the Intel procs launched initially are up-to 12-cores, which verifies that the 14, 16 and 18 core parts will be released in a much later stage in time. In the photos you can see a screenshot of a 10-core Intel processor, ASUS did not even have a 12-core part available for testing. So this means the Intel processor launch certainly isn't a hard-launch. We'll have to wait and see when the many core procs are available.  Now I can write a million words here, but well who am I kidding as chances are pretty good that your focus will be the the hotty presenting the products. Once your blood returns to the head, please do check out the ASUS ROG hardware photos. I’ll try and add some more specs and info once I have time for it. ASUS Talks Aura sync as universal implementation for  everything and anything RGB in the PC platform. ASUS is releasing an AURA SDK that can be used by other manufacturers that want to do RGB. ASUS also shows the PG35VQ monitor, a 35" monitor. We will look at that one tomorrow with the ASUS booth tour and take some photos. ASUS on the ROG event also announced its all new gaming notebook called Zyphyrus. This Core i5 and i7 driven laptop is powered by a GTX 1080, and is a slim laptop, actually the slimmest gaming laptop in the world. The laptop is 16.9mm up-to to 17.9mm tick (on it's thickest spot).  Have a browse through the photos of the ROG event. Tagged as: Computex 2017 Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ...

However, the company also teased its upcoming 8th-generation “Coffee Lake” processors which will be powering Apple’s MacBooks in next year. Intel’s Coffee Lake processors will be able to deliver 30 percent more performance than the 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips. “We will have more to say about the 8th Gen Intel Core processor in the future but it’s exciting to share that in the latest testing, we’re seeing a performance improvement of more than 30 percent over the 7th Gen Intel Core processor,” Intel senior executive Gregory Bryant said. Intel’s most recent testing results appear to be more than what the company initially claimed back in February. At the time, Intel said that the 8th-generation chip would only see a 15 percent improvement. Intel used the benchmark tool SYSmark 2014 version 1.5 to test one processor from each generation, accoridng to Apple Insider. For Kaby Lake, Intel used the 17-7500U with 8GB of DDR4-2133 RAM, while Coffee Lake used an undisclosed “estimates” for a processor with DDR4-2400 memory. The turbo clock speed of the Coffee Lake processor is up to 4GHz, but it’s base clock speed was not given. Although the tests shows that the Coffee Lake processor is indeed a huge improvement from its Kaby Lake counterpart, Intel says that estimates are “Pre-Silicon and are subject to change, with a 7 percent margin of error. Even with that in mind, Intel’s Coffee Lake processors will surely deliver on improved performance. Intel says that it plans to make its Coffee Lake lineup available to computer makers sometime during the second half of 2017. This should mean that the first wave computer rocking the next-generation chips will arrive sometime during the holiday season. The Coffee Lake chips should also be able to provide faster performance and longer battery life for MacBooks. Apple’s current Mac lineup isn’t even using the Kaby Lake yet chips yet, so it’s very likely that MacBooks with Coffee Lake chips will arrive next year. With Intel already teasing its Coffee Lake processors, the new chip seems like a promising feature that will come included on next year’s MacBook Pro lineup. However, the new chip has some caveats. It’s very unlikely that Apple’s future MacBook Pro will feature 32GB of RAM. Coffee Lake doesn’t support LPDDR4 RAM which makes it possible it possible to have that much memory. When Apple starts using Intel’s Coffee Lake chips for its MacBook Pro lineup, users will only be able to get a maximum of 16GB of RAM. IBT reported yesterday that Apple is planning to announce new versions of its 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. There’s also rumors floating around that the MacBook Air, which hasn’t been updated for years now, might also see an upgrade as well. Apple’s upgraded MacBook Pro is said to finally feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. As for the rest of the lineup, those will also receive some upgrades as well, but the Kaby Lake processors have not bee confirmed to be included. Apple is also reportedly woking on making its own chips which will be used for its future MacBook Pros. It remains to be seen if Apple will announce its plans during WWDC 2017. Apple's 2018 MacBook Pro lineup might feature Intel's Coffee Lake processors.

Intel's massive 18-core Core i9 chip starts a bloody battle for enthusiast PCs Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Storage buffs will get a massive dose of fun when Intel’s X299 chipset launches. The new Core i9 chipset will support up to 20 devices in a bootable RAID partition. The overlooked featured is called Virtual RAID On CPU (VROC). We got taste of it courtesy of Asus, which showed the feature running in its new X299 motherboards using a 10-core Skylake-X CPU. Few motherboards support more than three M.2 slots, so Asus used its new Hyper M.2 PCIe card. The Hyper M.2 lets you load up to four M.2 NVME PCIe drives into a single x16 card. You don’t have to worry about heat, because the Hyper M.2 features a beefy heat sink, thermal pads, and an active fan. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] IDG/Gordon Mah Ung The Asus Hyper M.2 features active cooling to keep your drives from overheating If you populated the Hyper M.2 with four drives and dropped it into a slot even on an older motherboard, it would work, but all you would see is four individual M.2 drives. What’s new is the ability to RAID it. All you have to do is boot into the board’s BIOS and enable Intel’s VROC feature. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung You enable VROC simply by going into the Hyper M.2 PCIe card's BIOS. Once you’ve done that you can see your drives. For this demonstration, Asus used eight Intel M.2 600P SSDs. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung The VROC demo used eight Intel 512GB SSDs. But wait, you say, you can only put four drives into the Hyper M.2 card—how did we do eight drives? Just use two Hyper M.2 drives. As Coach Madden says: Boom. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung And yes, you can build a RAID with two Hyper M.2 cards. For a quick performance run, Asus used the industry-standard Iometer test as well as Crystal Disk Mark. Below is what it looks like to have a bootable Windows partition with eight M.2 drives. IDG/Gordon Mah Ung With eight Intel SSDs, this Asus X299 motherboard can hit 12GBps of transfer speed. Yes, that’s 12GBps. What’s crazy is that it’s nowhere close to the maximum that VROC supports. With 20 devices, Intel says it can, in theory, hit 128GBps. Asus officials say right now they’re seeing as high as 13GBps, and they thinks there’s more performance to be wrung out of VROC as it matures. What’s the catch? There’s always a catch, and with Intel’s VROC there’s actually multiple catches. The Asus Hyper M.2 card works perfectly fine with, say, a Samsung 960 Pro, and you could see four individual Samsung drives in RAID. If you want to use VROC to create a bootable partition, though, you can use only Intel SSDs. Here's another catch: X299 will launch with Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs, but Intel VROC will work only with Skylake-X.  What may the biggest catch is this little thing right here: IDG/Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s Virtual RAID On CPU supports up to 20 drives in RAID 0 for free, but if you want more RAID 1 or other redundant setups, you need to buy this key from Intel. No, we’re not making this up. That little dongle is a key that Intel will sell to consumers. Out of the box, if you have Intel drives, an Asus Hyper M.2, and a Skylake-X, you can build a RAID 0 partition. But if you want to enable RAID 1, RAID 5, or other RAID schemes with redundancy to protect your data, you have to buy this Intel key to enable it. If you scroll back to the first BIOS shot, you can see the “premium” mode is enabled, which means it supports the premium RAID support. How much? No one seems to know. So why would Intel put all this work into a feature and then add a surcharge which could kill its adoption? Intel officials weren’t on hand to say, but the surcharge is related to the enterprise underpinnings of the Core i9 and X299 platform, where the feature is an up-sell. Intel can’t sell it to one customer and give it away to another, can they? To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

One thing the senators — and a federal grand jury in Virginia, and the FBI — will likely find, The Wall Street Journal reports, is a documentary-style film about Turkey that Flynn's consulting firm worked on last year but never finished. The film apparently makes up the bulk of the $530,000 the Flynn Intel Group was paid by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman close to Turkey's president. Alptekin says he hired the Flynn Intel Group to help burnish Turkey's image after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Erdogan's subsequent crackdown. Erdogan has blamed the coup on a Turkish imam in Pennsylvania, Fethullah Gulen, and Alptekin tells the Journal he envisioned the documentary as "a small, 60 Minutes kind of a thing" to expose America to the purported dangers Gulen poses. The U.S. has so far rebuffed Erdogan's demands for Gulen's extradition. Bijan Kian, the head of Flynn Intel Group, told the film crew different things, and some of them — including Rudi Bakhtiar, a former CNN anchor, and ex-VICE News correspondent David Enders — say they were badly misled. Bakhtiar told the Journal that it quickly became clear she was working on a hit-piece on Gulen. Enders said Kian did not want his or Flynn's fingerprints on this: "He said: 'We don't want anyone to know the Flynn Intel Group has anything to do with this.'" The Journal's Dion Nissenbaum has an overview of the documentary: Alptekin paid the Flynn Intel Group in three installments, saying the money came from his firm, not Turkey's government; with each payment, Flynn's group sent back $40,000 in "consulting fees" that Alptekin insists were really rebates. The last payment was on Nov. 14, two days before Trump named Flynn as his national security adviser. The film was shelved. On Nov. 8, Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill urging the U.S. to extradite Gulen, using an image a PR firm had produced to promote the documentary. In March, after he was pushed out of the White House, Flynn belatedly registered as a foreign agent for his work with Turkey. You can read more at The Wall Street Journal. Peter Weber   Michael Flynn's firm apparently made an unfinished film targeting an Erdogan critic May 31, 2017 Developing story Edit Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, UAE cut diplomatic ties with Qatar 11:40 p.m. ET   Sean Gallup/Getty Images Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates are breaking off diplomatic ties with Qatar, with Saudi Arabia accusing Qatar of backing "terrorist groups aiming to destabilize the region," Bloomberg reports, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaeda, and the Islamic State. Saudi Arabia also believes Qatar is supporting "Iranian-backed terrorist groups" that are active in east Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The countries are halting air and sea travel to and from Qatar, with Saudi Arabia also closing down land crossings. Qatari diplomats now have 48 hours to leave the UAE, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. Catherine Garcia   Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, UAE cut diplomatic ties with Qatar 11:40 p.m. arrests Edit 14 arrested in Portland during dueling Trump protests 10:58 p.m. ET   Scott Olson/Getty Images Police in Portland, Oregon, arrested 14 people Sunday during dueling demonstrations attended by supporters of President Trump, anti-fascist protesters, and residents concerned about hate speech. Hundreds of people attended the "Trump Free Speech" rally at Terry D. Schrunk Plaza, CNN reports, and even more counter-protesters gathered across the street. Police say at first, the two sides yelled expletives at each other, then counter-protesters started to throw glass bottles and bricks at the officers, who responded by using pepper spray. Tensions in the city have been high since three men were stabbed last week, two fatally, on a light-rail train by a man who was allegedly yelling anti-Muslim statements at two young women. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had unsuccessfully requested that the permit be revoked for the free-speech rally, saying, "I'm a strong supporter of the First Amendment no matter what the views are that are being expressed, but given the timing of this rally, I believed we had a case to make about the threats to public safety." Organizer Joey Gibson noted that the protest was planned before the murders, said he is not racist or a member of the alt-right movement, and argued that the rally was not in support of stabbing suspect Jeremy Christian.

Rodriguez/Getty Images Wonder Woman brought in an estimated $100.5 million during its North America debut this weekend, making it the best opening ever for a movie directed by a woman. Directed by Patty Jenkins and starring Gal Gadot, the well-received Wonder Woman outperformed such superhero flicks as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy at their openings.

Organizers said the concert, which had a heavy police presence, raised £2 million ($2.57 million) for the victims and families of those killed two weeks ago at Grande's concert in Manchester. The crowd was filled with people holding signs of support for Manchester and the victims, and Grande said the "kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now." With the £2 million raised Sunday, the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund has collected more than £10 million in donations.

Mitchell/Getty Images The Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the Saturday night attacks in London that left seven people dead and 48 wounded. The official ISIS news agency posted a message Sunday claiming that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters carried out the London attacks yesterday," the SITE Intelligence Group reports, including running into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbing people at Borough Market. Police shot and killed the three suspects, and later arrested 12 people in East London connected to one of the suspects, a man who wore a fake bomb vest. Investigators said they do not see any links so far between what happened in London and the suicide bombing in Manchester two weeks ago that killed more than 20 people.

Bonnie Kristian   Putin on Flynn: 'I didn't even really talk to him' 12:58 p.m. A house divided Edit 2 GOP senators critique Trump's travel ban plan 12:30 p.m. ET   Pool/Getty Images President Trump used Saturday's terror attack in London as an occasion to tout his travel ban executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, which remains stalled pending a Supreme Court ruling. "We need to be smart, vigilant and tough," he wrote on Twitter. "We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!" Trump's rallying cry has not been met with universal acclaim, including within his own party. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News Sunday he believes "the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting," but that this could be accomplished "without a travel ban." Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) was even less enthusiastic. "I think that the travel ban is too broad and that is why it has been rejected by the courts," she said Sunday in a CBS interview, while allowing that the U.S. should do a "better job of vetting." Across the aisle, Trump's raising of the travel ban topic also came under fire from former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who served under President Obama. "There's a very real risk that by stigmatizing and isolating Muslims from particular countries, and Muslims in general, that we alienate the very communities here in the United States whose cooperation we most need to detect and prevent these homegrown extremists from being able to carry out attacks," she said while appearing on ABC News.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel reveals most powerful PC processor series to date By Sead Fadilpašić News  New Core chips allow for faster processing, longer battery life for all. Shares The battle for the title of the most powerful PC processor in the world has just become even bloodier. Intel has today announced its first 18-core processor at Computex in Taipei, officially named i9-7980XE The 7980XE, which will cost from $1,999, represents the very top of Intel's high-end offerings, marking the  eighth generation of its Core processor chips. This is a processor built for the most demanding of desktop users, with Intel saying that many different industries will find things to love about the new chip, particularly those carrying out CPU heavy tasks such as video editing or coding. Besides this model, Intel has also announced 10, 12, 14 and 16-core i9 processors, all in the 3.3Ghz range in standard and 4.5GHz range in Turbo Boost 3.0 operation modes.  Slightly less demanding users will be able to find comfort in 4-core i5 processors, as well as 4-core, 6-core and 8-core i7 models from Intel’s new X series of processors. All of these are expected to hit the shelves in the next half of this year.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Economy Companies Markets Finance Regulation Business Fintech Blockchain Cornell's blockchain experts tackle off-chain transactions with Intel SGX Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer was demonstrating IC3's Teechain at Consensus 2017. By Ian Allison Updated May 31, 2017 12:08 BST There were many exciting announcements at Consensus 2017, the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry's annual gathering. A particularly nice one involves the continuing marriage between a team of distributed systems experts from Cornell University and Intel SGX (software guard extensions). The latter is a set of new instructions from Intel that allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory called enclaves. Cornell's Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3) was demonstrating the newest version of "Teechain", an off-chain transaction protocol which uses SGX (incidentally, IC3 was not the only team touting interesting blockchain applications using SGX; watch this space for more to come). Teechain can offer state channel-like transaction rates, while addressing the problem of transaction malleability: if you have any piece of data that can be altered in the transaction without having the transaction itself becoming invalid you have a case of malleability. Payment channels offer a very powerful way to remove pressure from the blockchain by netting together transactions in series, while only having to place the opening and closing transactions on the blockchain. However, transaction malleability means it is not safe to accept a chain of unconfirmed transactions because the later transactions will depend on the hashes of the previous transactions, and those hashes can be changed, up until they are confirmed in a block. To counter the potential risk here, both parties would have to closely scan the blockchain for what the other is doing, and know what to look out for. A useful analogy would be cheque kiting, whereby a fraud can be committed when cheques are used as a form of unauthorised credit to make use of non-existent funds in a bank account. Cornell associate professor Emin Gün Sirer said: "The problem until now has been that the existing solutions require changes to the blockchain, they require that the blockchain be non-malleable. "The existing solutions are highly dependent on being able to watch that blockchain. There are rumours, claims that maybe you could get Lightning to not be dependent on this kind of thing, but I have never seen them properly specified; I have never seen them actually implemented. "So everybody wants this non-malleability. It's a good feature to have, but it's one that wasn't being deployed." Teechain, short for "trusted execution environments", uses SGX secure hardware to prevent this sort of cheque kiting, ensuring parties cannot manufacture or push old state onto the blockchain. It also achieves enormous speed ups in off chain transactions. Gün Sirer said: "We are doing UK to US transactions at a rate of about 50,000 transactions per second. So that means a transaction every 20 microseconds. That's a lot of transactions. And you can be doing any number of these in parallel. "So between any two parties it can do 50,000 tsx/s; in fact if the parties are closer together it can do even better than that, and it can do it with multiple pairs of participants at the same time." So if the solution to scaling blockchains lies in hardware, why isn't everyone using this approach? "Partly because it's non-trivial to do that transition," said Gün Sirer. "You need to have some expertise on how to build software on top of these hardware platforms, and partly because the hardware platforms are becoming ubiquitous only now." He also pointed out that signing keys to use Intel's SGX have not been given out willy-nilly; some major players in the blockchain space were denied the right because Intel did not trust them. "Essentially you will be handling people's money so you need to be vetted, in this case by the manufacturer of the hardware platform. They don't want you using their hardware for malfeasance, building Ponzi schemes, say, and they don't want you writing bad code that will lose people's money." In a nutshell, SGX hardware hardware allows the user to perform computations on the chip that are unmolested and that are guaranteed to be isolated from any and all malware. So even if there was a hacker on your machine, he or she could not get to the code that is running inside this encrypted enclave. The other key ability is called remote attestation: the chip running this code securely in this enclave can prove to a third party what exact code is running. "So you can prove that to me that you are running the code I trust and now we have a basis for building up something much more complicated. "Most complications in distributed systems stem from not knowing what the counterparties will do, and so the protocols get complex because you have to deal with anything and everything that the other party might decide to do at any time." Gün Sirer said the Teechain solution would be good for Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. "We are quite excited about this. In fact it doesn't have to be for either of those things, it could also be for SWIFT; you could use it for sending money. They could probably use some of our techniques."

Announced Tuesday at Computex in Taipei, Intel’s answer to AMD’s 16-core, 32-thread Threadripper is an 18-core, 36-thread monster microprocessor of its own, tailor-made for elite PC enthusiasts. The Core i9 Extreme Edition i9-7980XE, what Intel calls the first teraflop desktop PC processor ever, will be priced at (gulp!) $1,999 when it ships later this year. In a slightly lower tier will be the meat of the Core i9 family: Core i9 X-series chips in 16-core, 14-core, 12-core, and 10-core versions, with prices climbing from $999 to $1,699. All of these new Skylake-based parts will offer improvements over their older Broadwell-E counterparts: 15 percent faster in single-threaded apps and 10 percent faster in multithreaded tasks, Intel says.  If these Core i9 X-series chips—code-named “Basin Falls”—are too rich for your blood, Intel also introduced three new Core i7 X-series chips, priced from $339 to $599, and a $242 quad-core Core i5. All of the new chips are due “in the coming weeks,” Intel said. Most of the Core i9 chips will incorporate what Intel calls an updated Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, a feature where the chip identifies not just one, but two cores as the “best” cores, and makes them available to be dynamically overclocked to higher speeds when needed. They’ll be Optane-ready, too, with over 130 Optane-ready motherboards waiting in the wings, Intel said. If there’s a catch, it’s that all of the new 165W, 140W, and 112W chips are designed around the new Socket R4. This 2,066-pin LGA socket is compatible with just one Intel chipset, the new X299, though many X299 motherboards are already being announced. Intel and AMD have a real fight going again, and we’ll have to wait and see who’ll end up on top. With Core i9, Intel’s just staked an aggressive claim to the high end of the market. AMD will now be forced to disclose the 14, 12, and 10-core versions of its Threadripper parts, as well as their prices. Intel’s laid down its cards, but the hand has yet to be played. Intel’s disclosure of the new Core i9 chips may be one of the most significant announcements this week at Computex, the Taipei-based trade show that has quietly evolved into a celebration of all things PC. But you can expect much more from Intel, too, including this bombshell: Intel executives will reveal that its next 10nm chip, Cannon Lake, will deliver 30 percent greater performance than the current Kaby Lake chips, a spokeswoman said. Intel also revealed more details about a wireless link to the HTC Vive VR headset using its WiGig technology. The initial HTC-Intel partnership was announced this past January, at CES. Among the big Core i9 news, Intel also announced availability of its Compute Card, a credit card-sized mini PC that slides into displays, digital whiteboards, and quasi-notebook devices. The Core i9’s speeds and feeds As clock speeds have plateaued at slightly above 4GHz, the challenge has been to find a use for all of the additional cores silicon manufacturers are building into their chips. As we’ve pointed out previously, many games still rely heavily on a single processor core. Intel has turned its attention to a new generation of “streamers” who not only use cores to play the game, but ask other cores within the system to encode the stream to Twitch or YouTube, and perhaps play some music in the background. Intel calls all of these simultaneous activities “megatasking” and sees it as a fantastic way to maintain the demand for ever-greater numbers of cores. “Even gamers are becoming content creators,” Tony Vera, the X-series marketing manager, told reporters. Naturally, with prices topping out at a massive $2,000, only those with money to burn (or a corporate sponsorship) will be able to afford Intel’s latest Core i9 family. The prices and core/thread counts are as follows: Core i9-7980XE: 18-core/36-thread, $1,999  Core i9-7960X: 16-core/32-thread, $1,699 Core i9-7940X: 14-core/28-thread, $1,399 Core i9-7920X: 12-core/24-threads, $1,199 Core i9-7900X (3.3GHz): 10-core/20-thread, $999  For enthusiasts with tighter budgets, Intel will also sell three new Core i7 X-series chips: Core i7 7820X (3.6GHZ), 8-core/16-thread, $599 Core i7-7800X (3.5GHz), 6-core/12-thread, $389 Core i7-7740X (4.3GHz), 4-core/8-thread, $339   All of the new chips are based upon what Intel calls “Skylake-X,” except the i7-7740X, which is designed around the Kaby Lake core.  One of the more interesting features of the new chips is what Intel calls an updated Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. (They apparently ran out of adjectives to describe it.) As Gordon Mah Ung showed in his review of Intel’s Broadwell-E chips, Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 identified one “best core” among all of the available models, varying from chip to chip. The chip could then bind CPU-intensive single-threaded applications to that one core, improving the overall performance. The updated version of Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 identifies two “best cores,” and again assigns the most CPU-intensive threads to them. It’s a nod to games and applications that are better at taking advantage of more cores. Not every chip incorporates the new feature, though, including the new six-core and the two quad-core X-series chips. Here’s Intel’s summary of (some of the) new speeds and feeds, below. Overclocking is a huge focus Not surprisingly, Intel’s not recommending that the new X-series parts be air-cooled. Instead, the company will sell the TS13X cooler, designed for the 165 watts and 140 watts of thermal design power heat the new chips will dissipate. The TS13X uses propylene glycol to pump the heat to a 73.84-CFM fan that generates between 21 and 35 dBA, spinning between 800- and 2,200rpm. The TS13X, priced at between $85 to $100, will ship separately, Intel executives said. Otherwise, Intel will maintain support for per-core overclocking and per-core voltage adjustments, using its Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU). New controllable features include AVX 512 ratio offsets, trim voltage control of the memory control, and PEG/DMI overclocking.  Intel will also offer its “performance tuning protection plan,” a sort of insurance policy for overclockers. The company will let you fry your chip once, just once, and get a single replacement. After that, you’re on your own.  The new X299 chipset keeps the data flowing With all of the teraflop of computational horsepower at its disposal, being able to send and receive data to other parts of the system was a priority. The X299 chipset effectively doubles the bandwidth connection to the SATA 3.0 ports and USB ports by moving to Intel’s latest DMI 3.0. X299 features up to eight SATA 3.0 ports, and increases the USB 3.0 ports to ten, compared with the six ports its predecessor, the X99 chipset, used. The X299 chipset also provides up to 24 PCI Express 3.0 lanes vs. the eight PCIe lanes of Broadwell-E’s X99 chipset. Additional PCIe for such things as high-speed PCIe NVMe drives can also be plumbed directly into the PCIe coming from the CPU itself. On CPUs with 10-cores and up, a full 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 lanes are available for use. The X299 supports faster DDR4-2066 memory, though it’s not clear how much. Intel also tweaked its cache hierarchy, an in-the-weeds adjustment that apparently reduces the overall size of the cache, in favor of putting more near the individual processors. Intel says its new cache shows a higher “hit” rate, which means Intel was probably able to cut the size of the chip but maintain its cache performance. It’s all something to get excited about, whether you’re a potential Core i9 or Core i7 X-series buyer. We’re likely to see motherboard makers and PC makers alike jump on the Core i9 bandwagon, if nothing else but to bring in more of those premium gamer dollars. We’ll keep our eyes peeled for these, and more, this week at Computex.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo Homs: Army Forces Claim More Territory in Syria's Desert Iraqi Volunteer Forces Capture Ba'aj West of Mosul from ISIL Iraqis Leave Zanjili Neighborhood as Security Forces Continue Fighting ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Pounding ISIL with Rockets in Syrian Border Region Syria: Army Soldiers Recapture Maskana's Water Pumping Station in Eastern Aleppo 7 Dead, 48 Injured in London Attacks Damascus: Inside Syrian Army's Tank Factory US-Backed Militants Take Control of Syria's 3rd largest Dam as Kurds Allow ISIL to Withdraw from Raqqa Syrian Soldiers Expel ISIL from Aleppo; Maskana Freed Envoy: Iran to Continue Supporting Syria in Anti-Terror Fight Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in UK Iran Warns Against Terrorist Plots to Undermine Security in Region Iran: Paris Deal Withdrawal Shows US Irresponsibility Towards Int'l Community Dara'a: Syrian Army Kills Tens of Al-Nusra Terrorists, 3 Commanders Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army managed to capture 22 villages and farms near Maskana and eventually forced the ISIL terrorists to retreat from its last stronghold in Aleppo province, the town of Maskana, towards Raqqa province.

(Getty Images) New Delhi: As cricket lovers get ready for the ICC Champions Trophy starting in Britain from June 1, Intel technologies has announced advanced pitch analysis by an Intel drone, profiling the bat swing using a bat sensor and a virtual reality (VR) packed experience for the fans at the stadiums. The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. "We couldn't be more excited to have Intel as our 'Official Innovation Partner' of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017," said David Richardson, CEO, ICC. "The innovations Intel is bringing to the game promise to transform how cricket is experienced and enjoyed around the world, and we look forward to partnering with Intel in this effort," Richardson added in a statement. The bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. "Our goal is to lead the way forward into the digitisation and personalisation of sports, transforming the way fans and athletes experience sports," said Sandra Lopez, Vice President, Intel Sports Group. Intel will also showcase VR experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston, to allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," said Atul Srivastava, Managing Director, Speculur which is a Bengaluru-based smart wearables and cognitive computing company. With "Speculur BatSense", aspiring cricketers can measure, track and improve their batting skills.

ICC Champions Trophy 2017 to feature drone, bat sensors Different ball game! ICC Champions Trophy 2017 to feature drone, bat sensors — By Priyanka Vartak | May 31, 2017 01:08 pm FOLLOW US: As cricket lovers are getting ready for the ICC Champions Trophy which is starting from tomorrow, June 1, Intel Technologies has announced advanced pitch analysis by an Intel drone, profiling the bat swing using a bat sensor and virtual reality (VR) packed experience for the fans at the stadiums. The focus is firmly on enhancing the tournament experience for fans, players, media and broadcasters. The innovations will use data, analytics and visualisation and ensure cricket remains at the forefront of technology advancements. The Intel Falcon 8 Drone, equipped with HD and infrared cameras, will be used for advanced pitch analysis before every match. Images captured by the drone will offer rich visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts. #Intel powered VR, drones and bat sensors bring you closer to the action at the @ICC Champions Trophy 2017. #CT17 pic.twitter.com/9Wc59eKNtc — Intel UK (@IntelUK) May 30, 2017 The bat censor powered by the Intel Curie technology can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. These chips will help to analyse the batsmen’s game during the 50-over tournament. Using the Intel Curie technology-enabled cricket bat, the player will be able to see data from their swing such as bat speed and back-lift angle as well as a simulated score from the VR session. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast. Indian batsman Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane and off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will use the chip-installed bats.

Reuters/Albert Gea With the Worldwide Developers Conference fast approaching, most are keeping their fingers crossed for the much-talked about release of an upgraded MacBook Pro. While most know that the refreshed notebook will most likely sport an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, it seems logical that an eventual MacBook Pro 2018 will come with a more powerful chipset. Coffee powered MacBook Pro in 2018? According to Apple Insider, the Cupertino company teased the potential release of a MacBook Pro 2018 backed by an Intel Coffee Lake SoC. This would be Intel’s 8th generation processor, pegged to be 30 percent faster than the current Intel Kaby Lake chipset.  Those should be angles worth looking into, though the amount of power in the Intel Coffee Lake chipsets comes a bit of a surprise. This is mainly because of the fact that Intel previously claimed that the next chips would offer performance improvement of only 15 percent.  Intel brands the Intel Coffee Lake as an optimisation of the current Intel Kaby Lake. They are targeting the second half of 2017 to release these new chips.  Going back to the fate of future MacBook Pros, the release date of the Intel Coffee Lake will be crucial. Most know that the Intel Skylake-backed MacBook Pro 2016 garnered disappointment. A lot of it had to do with the timing of the release of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset, something that only stabilised earlier this year.  The 16 GB RAM problem is back While the added power to a MacBook Pro 2018 should be something, there may be bumps ahead. The problem rekindles an issue tied to the MacBook Pro 2016 – the RAM.  In the event that the MacBook Pro 2018 comes with Intel Coffee Lake, it will not include support for LPDDR4. This means that such would allow quantities of memory to be used without requiring the use of a new RAM controller. Instead, it may be best for the MacBook Pro 2018 to consider using the Intel Cannon Lake. These are chipsets produced using a 10-nm process – something that offers a reduction in power usage. The only problem is that there is no certainty when these chips will be shipped.  For now, it would be best to focus on whether an upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 will be shown at the WWDC 2017 on June 5. A launch could hamper the regular schedule of the Cupertino company and may eventually dictate when to expect a MacBook Pro 2018.

Nier: Automata sales hit 1.5m units HTC and Intel team up to bring WiGig wireless tech to Vive by Katharine Byrne Tuesday, May 30th 2017 at 11:36AM BST Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn HTC and Intel have teamed up to bring Intel's WiGig wireless VR tech to the Vive, the companies announced today at Computex. HTC will also be taking on manufacturing duties for the WiGig wireless VR accessory. This isn't the first wireless accessory that will be coming to the Vive, as TPCast's wireless upgrade pack is currently due to go on sale in Q2 this year. TPCast was one of the companies borne out of HTC's ViveX accelerator program, and its $249 tether-less upgrade kit is designed to sit on top of the main head strap. Judging by the prototype unveiled at this year's Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, it seems Intel's WiGig accessory will be incorporated into the headset in much the same way, but we'll have to wait until E3 before the company reveals exact details.  Either way, it should dramatically improve the headset's overall VR experience. Based on the 802.11ad standard (which is about 11x faster than 802.11n), Intel's WiGig tech works solely in the interference-free 60GHz band, allowing for high throughput and low latency in both directions between a PC and Vive headset.  This should mean video quality with a latency time of under 7ms in any environment, with HTC stating it should also support multiple users in the same space – something that will be good news for anyone interested in setting up location-based VR facilities.  More details are coming soon, but those heading to E3 in a few weeks time will be able to see HTC's proof of concept on display at its booth.  Advertisement Tags: intel , virtual reality , htc vive Follow us on Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(hpq) to sell Windows laptops running on its newest mobile chips. Qualcomm had announced in December that it was working with Microsoft to create a version of Windows 10 that could run on the Snapdragon 835 chip that typically is used in cutting-edge smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S8. Windows PCs usually run on Intel's x86 line of chips. The move marks the counter punch, perhaps, to Intel getting into one of Qualcomm's main lines of mobile chip business. Intel started making its own wireless modem chips to compete with Qualcomm, and last year signed up Apple (aapl) as a customer. About half of the new models of the iPhone 7 contained Intel modems instead of those made by Qualcomm. Both Qualcomm and Intel (intc) face challenges finding growth as their largest markets mature. Intel has been dealing with the declining PC market for years and has since targeted higher growth markets like cloud data centers, wireless modems, and smart devices, or the Internet of things. Qualcomm is seeing mobile device growth slow and also is turning to the Internet of things and data centers for growth, along with the new push into Windows laptops. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. At the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Wednesday, Qualcomm unveiled its three PC partners. Windows laptops running on the Snapdragon chips would gain the benefits of longer battery life and wireless modem capability to get online via mobile networks at up to 1 gigabit-per-second speeds, Qualcomm said. That's exactly what many PC users want, according to Jeff Meredith, senior vice president at Lenovo. "Today’s PC users want solutions that provide better battery life and the ability to connect anytime, anywhere, while also being lighter and more portable than any other laptop currently available," he said in a statement. The laptops will be able to run any Windows software, including Microsoft (msft) Office, Qualcomm (qcom) said. But none of the laptop models was ready for a public unveiling. That will happen in the second half of this year, Qualcomm executives have said. Just how well the new Snapdragon-based laptops will run Windows apps is a key question, because poor performance killed earlier efforts to run Windows on chips like Qualcomm's that use ARM Holdings' basic designs. On the new laptops, some programs will run with code that is completely compatible with ARM, but many more will have to use an emulation mode, notes analyst Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. "This emulation results in a performance hit of unknown percent and may be one of the major make or break points for Windows on ARM," Moorhead wrote in a post on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Intel was showing off connected Windows 10 laptops at Computex running on both its CPU and wireless modem chips. Acer, Dell and many other PC makers are on board with its connected laptop push, Intel said.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Intel Brings The Fight to AMD With New X-Series Processors Haamiz Ahmed 5 days ago A few weeks ago, AMD revealed an ace up its sleeve – the 16 core, 32 thread ThreadRipper. Aimed at the high-end desktop (HEDT) market, the processor was meant only for the PC enthusiasts, software developers or CAD designers. At Computex, Intel revealed its own HEDT platform, stepping it up a notch. The new platform uses the X299 chipset with X-series of processors. The biggest and baddest of them all, Intel Core i9-7980XE will come with a whopping 18 cores and 36 threads. Unlike the consumer friendly version, the HEDT platform are more of a “prestige part” thing. Regular Joes won’t be able to make full use of the processors threads and cores but software developers or video streamers can. Intel is aiming for them with the X-series. Kaby Lake-X Starting at the bottom, we have the Intel Core i5-7640X and i7-7740X. These two fall under the Kaby Lake-X sub category. These two are very similar to the regular Kaby Lake counterparts with four cores and four threads (or eight threads with the i7), two memory channels and 16 PCIe 3. The difference is in the power draw and clock rates. TDP has gone up from 91 W (non X) to 112 W (Kaby Lake-X). The base clock for the i5-7640X is now 4.0 GHz, up from 3.8 GHz with a turbo clock of 4.2 GHz. The i7-7740X also has a slightly higher base clock of 4.3 GHz, up from 4.2 GHz with a turbo clock of 4.5 GHz. Skylake-X Moving up you get the 6, 8 and 10 core processors. They’re called the Skylake-X processors and feature double the memory channels compared the Kaby Lake-X counterparts as well as a higher power draw of 140W. Another feature in the Skylake-X processors is Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (limited to i7-7820X and i9-7900X) which boosts the base clock even further than Turbo Boost 2.0. PCIe 3.0 lanes also increase from 16 to 28 for the i7-7800X, 7820X. The i9-7900X, however, gets 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The final 4 processors, i9-7920X, 7940X, 7960X and 7980XE feature 12, 14, 16 and 18 cores respectively (double the thread count). They will also have a TDP of 165W. The rest of the details weren’t revealed by Intel for now. All of these processors use the same LGA 2066 socket which can give you a strong upgrade path if you start with the lower end processors. All of the processors will be have unlocked multipliers, which makes them easier to overclock. Additionally the chips will Intel Optane Memory, up to three PCIe/NVMe SSDs, 8 SATA ports, and 10 USB 3.1 generation 1 ports. No Intention of Backing Down The new series shows that Intel isn’t changing its strategy because of AMD. The 8 core i7-7820-X costs $599 which is a $100 higher than AMD’s corresponding processor. The price premium is still there. One area where Intel has the advantage is the single threaded performance where AMD lags behind. The Intel X299 motherboards and chips will be available in coming weeks.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out.

The Worldwide Developers Conference event to be held in San Jose, CA on June 5 is said to the be venue for the announcement. While this may sound exciting to Apple fans, perhaps looking at what the future might bring for the MacBook 2018 might give them some more enjoyment. Intel just announced yesterday at the Computex 2017 event in Taiwan that is has successfully tested its latest processor architecture. The company registered a 30-percent performance improvement on its Coffee Lake processors. This performance boost, compared to the current Kaby Lake lineup is quite impressive in the scheme of things. In addition to announcing the said performance gains, Intel also said that it will make the Coffee Lake processors available in the market as early as the second half of 2017. MacBook lineup (via engadget.com) This could mean that MacBook 2018 releases will be able to take advantage of the new processors’ performance gains. This and longer battery life due to the improved efficiency of the new processors. At the moment, the current MacBook laptops are still on older Intel processors, mostly with Skylake architecture. Many consumers expected Apple to release the MacBook Pro on Kaby Lake processors. Unfortunately, the availability made it impossible at the time. This is why Apple is reported to be planning a release of Kaby Lake-powered MacBook laptops next month. Having an updated MacBook 2018 release is a welcomed change especially for hardcore Mac fans. For now, it is still too soon to tell whether Intel will be able to deliver its promise for the Coffee Lake processors. Last year, the company experienced some major delays in the release of the Kaby Lake processors that inevitably affected the MacBook Pro.

Both solutions offer wireless connectivity to the HTC Vive VR headset and the host computer. In addition to these two, HTC has partnered with Intel to bring the very first WiGig Wi-Fi technology to the HTC Vive. According to Digital Trends, Intel has announced in yesterday’s Computex 2017 opening that it is working closely with HTC to bring faster wireless connectivity to the Vive VR headset. In the presentation, Intel did a first public demo of the WiGig Wi-Fi technology with the Vive. The new wireless connectivity technology, otherwise known as 802.11ad, offers transmit rates of up to 7Gbps over various frequency bands. This rate is more than enough to carry data across the host computer and first generation VR headsets. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the WiGig system can even support uncompressed data transmission with as little latency as possible. TPCast (via pcauthority.com) Although there are third-party wireless VR headset interfaces available in the market, like the TPCAST and KwikVR Wireless Kit, the Intel WiGig interface offers much faster connectivity. Furthermore, these third party interfaces rely heavily on compression algorithms in order to transmit massive amounts of data. This affects video quality to certain extent. On other notes, the WiGig interface will make use of DisplayLink XR Codec. This means that there will be some measure of data compression involved. Nevertheless, it would still be less than the compression rates offered by current wireless VR solutions. Unfortunately, at the moment, it is not clear yet when exactly the device will hit the market. However, Intel and HTC claimed that it will be ready sometime in early 2018. As for the price, perhaps consumers would have to wait until Intel and HTC makes to official announcement later this year.

If we were to give a brief history of the CPU space in the personal computer (PC) market, we can summarise it as follows: Intel had a monopoly on the PC space since at least 2006 and nothing from only rival AMD has even come close to dethroning Intel. Intel allegedly took advantage of its position to keep the price of computing performance high. It wasn’t until AMD got its act together and released Ryzen, a new CPU that democratised computing power, that Intel started to get worried. When it comes to computing performance, two things matter a great deal, core count and IPC efficiency. The latter relates to the efficiency with which each core can perform calculations. With Ryzen, AMD doubled the core count compared to Intel’s offering in the same price range. This move, despite Ryzen’s lower IPC, suddenly resulted in customers having dramatically more computing power at their fingertips. Of course, there are some caveats, most notably with regards to Ryzen’s gaming performance, but these are being sorted out. Intel enjoyed a monopoly for a long time, but it also did good work in that time. Intel’s processors are still the best overall option for most high-end consumers, but AMD wasn’t that far behind. High-end processors, especially in serious workstations and servers, is Intel’s core strength. It had to do something to counter Ryzen and it looks like Skylake-X and the Core i9 is the answer. The Core i9 lineup looks like this: Intel Core i9 7900X – 10C/20T @ 3.3 GHz (TurboBoost 3.0 up to 4.5 GHz) for $999 Intel Core i9 7920X – 12C/24T for $1,199 Intel Core i9 7940X – 14C/28T for $1,399 Intel Core i9 7960X – 16C/32T for $1,699 Intel Core i9 7980XE – 18C/36T for $1,999 Details of only the Core i9 7900X are available. As it stands, the base model core i9 7900X will have 10 cores and 20 threads, operate from 3.3 GHz to 4.5 GHz and have a 140 W TDP. You’ll get 44 PCIe lanes and 13.75 MB of L3 cache as well. The 12-core model goes up to 165 W and the rest might be rated higher. One can extrapolate on the specifications of the rest of the lineup based on this. The top of the line Core i9 7980XE is claimed to be the first CPU ever to cross the one teraflop mark. Rounding off the Skylake-X lineup are the Intel i7-7800X and the i7 7820X. These are 6C/12T and 8C/16T parts clocked at 3.5 GHz and 3.6 GHz respectively. These will be priced at $389 and $599 respectively. Also included in the lineup are two Kaby Lake X processors. These are the i5 7640X and the i7 7740X. Both of these are 4-core parts, where the i7 supports hyper-threading, which means that it supports 8 threads. These CPUs are priced at $242 and $339 respectively. These processors are rated at 112 W TDP. As you can see, Intel hasn’t dropped the prices or increased the core counts on its mid-range and higher end processors. These processes will be released on a new LGA-2066 socket, but it will apparently be backward compatible with the 2011 socket. While all these processors are overclockable, the ace up Intel’s sleeve is that the cores on Skylake-X at the very least can be individually overclocked. This is something that AMD can’t do yet. Oh, and did we mention that Skylake-X will come with a bundled liquid cooler? At that asking price, Intel had better provide one anyway. For now, let the information sink in. We’re getting a brand new processor lineup and a slightly revamped architecture. We’ll delve into the details of the new CPUs at a later date. Until then, be sure you stay tuned for more of our coverage on Computex 2017.

And it has, with a new line-up of Core i5, i7 and a new i9 with as many as 18 cores and 36 hyperthreading threads. They'll be phenomenally fast, of course, but will have a price tag that puts any other PC component you could think of to shame. Introduced at Computex in Taipei, Intel's latest CPUs use a new X299 chipset and new 2066-pin socket. CPUs with from four to 18 physical cores are on offer, so there's a huge range of options at — a huge range of prices. The cheapest quad-core Core i5-7640X (with no hyperthreading) is a $US242 part, for example, while the top of the line 10-core (and 20 thread) i9-7900X is an eye-bleeding $US999. Image: Intel Those 4, 6, 8, and 10-core chips will launch first around the world, and 12, 14, 16, and 18-core CPUs will follow soon enough. All the chips have comparatively very high TDP thermal thresholds, so you'll need to invest in a gutsy water or air cooler to let these Core X processors run free without throttling back under load. Where Intel's mainstream desktop CPUs top out at around 90 Watts, these ones will hit 140 — and Intel's recommending water cooling as standard for the first time. Intel says it's by far the most extreme desktop processor it's ever produced, and it's taken a page from the book of its server-grade Xeon chips to put the new hardware together. Compared to its previous generation of "most powerful ever" Extreme chips, the company is quoting a 10 and 15 per cent jump in multi- and single-threaded performance respectively. Ryzen must have Intel spooked, because AMD's massively multi-core chips represented the first time that 8-core CPUs hit the mainstream desktop PC market. AMD's Ryzen is a superlative multi-core performer and brings that "mega-tasking" multi-tasking — gaming, streaming, saving content — to the mainstream in a way that the company hasn't seen success with in years. It has a new server and high-end desktop CPU, too, called Threadripper — up to 16 cores and 32 threads — and likely at a competitive price. Intel also took the opportunity to hint at its 8th-gen Core processors, still a few weeks away from an official unveiling — expect up to 30 per cent better performance, it says, bringing quad-core and eight-thread performance to its mainstream Core i7-7500U equivalent mobile chips which are currently only dual-core. Laptops could be getting a significant speed boost in the near future. Gizmodo traveled to Computex as a guest of Dell. WATCH MORE: PC Gaming News Comments warcroft @warcroft May 31, 2017, 1:11pm I mean this in the nicest posible way... Fuck you Intel! Because you had no competitionfor 10+ years you have been drip feeding consumers with minimal, yet expensive, upgrades each generation. Now that AMD are making a comeback you up your game and announce a crap load of new chips. Yes, its "business", but it doesnt stop you from being opportunistic, gouging arseholes. Reply 2 miak @miak May 31, 2017, 1:28pm Yeah there's a reason I'm still running with my 6-year old i5 2500k ... their incremental upgrades have generally been pathetic and I still have no problem running freshly released games at stable frame rates. I keep telling myself "next generation I'll upgrade" and then change my mind when I see I'm still only gaining 10-15% in raw power, unless I want to go to an i7. At this rate, I'll be using my current setup until it finally breaks down (and it's somewhat surprising it hasn't done that already). Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 May 31, 2017, 2:15pm +1 to the i5 2500K I have the i7 2600K the top of the line Kaby Lake has only a 25% increase in power and better power 25% in 6 years? WTF Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 2:37pm To be fair, we're practically at the speed limit of silicon. There's not a lot of extra speed to be had without overhauling the way we make CPUs in a major way - carbon, etc. That's why they're moving towards more and more cores - 4-5Ghz has been the magic ceiling for standard CPUs for a long time - hell, even late model Pentium 4s were getting close to 4Ghz, and how many years ago was that? And extra cores are great, but unless you're utilising software that's written to take full advantage of extra cores, or you're doing something like VMs where you can allocate specific cores, it doesn't benefit the average user. Until more software is made to utilise the extra cores. Last edited May 31, 2017 2:38 pm Reply 2 soldant @soldant May 31, 2017, 3:21pm This. People might remember back to the early-mid 2000s when CPUs basically stagnated until dual core CPUs came out. The limitations aren't just about complacency. Also AMD had its own period of complacency where it kept churning out comparatively worse CPUs. They share some of the blame. Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 1:33pm Yes and no. These CPUs aren't intended for gamers or average desktop users. Hell, 99% of the PC users in the world would have zero need for anything above a quad core. These are for high end users - people using virtual machines, doing video encoding, streaming, compiling, etc. Everything Intel is overpriced, but you also have to realise anything above a quad core is going to start costing a lot more. I'm still using a six core 3930K I originally bought because I thought it being six core meant it would destroy everything at the time. Then I learnt it was getting beaten in gaming benchmarks by my friend's 4770K quad core with less L3 cache. It all depends on your intended use. If you're just a desktop user/gamer, you'll get absolutely nothing out of anything more than a bog quad core i7. I wouldn't get too offended, you're not missing out on much unless you're a super-high end user.

Just food for thought. I know the Australian market is heavily regulated by the ACCC to encourage competition between brands. Reply 0 os42 @os42 May 31, 2017, 4:16pm To be fair, there's not been much reason to own a hyperthreaded 18-core CPU for gaming until recent years - a lot of games up to 2014-15 were still CPU-capped by their main thread. I remember deliberately skimping a little on my CPU for my current rig (admittedly nearly five years old by now) by going for the 3570k because the only difference between it and the first step into the i7 range was about $200 for hyperthreading, and I've only noticed it being much of an issue in the last 12 months or so. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 1:18pm I haven't really been paying attention. Do we have confirmation on the socket set? Might be nearly time for an upgrade (my 4771 is getting a little long in the tooth). Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 1:25pm I was looking at upgrading my 4790K when Skylake originally dropped and promptly decided not to. Even moving up to 6th/7th gen Intel and DDR4, there honestly wasn't an earth-shattering performance benefit to be had for dropping almost a grand on a new CPU/mobo/RAM. Depending on what your needs are, you'd be better off saving your money. If you were on a 1st gen i7 or something, that'd be a different story. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 1:58pm Its more than just the performance though. I live in Alice, which means that heat is a constant issue when it comes to parts wear. Even with a pretty good single bin water cooling unit I still see issues with keeping parts cool and thats before overclock. More powerful parts means running cooler due to lower overall cpu loading. Reply 0 Cody @ynefel May 31, 2017, 2:16pm Yeah, that makes sense. Just need to be careful you don't catch a tick instead of a tock. 4770Ks were actually fairly warm compared to the 4790K, which was the Haswell refresh. I hear the Kaby Lakes are better on the heat front compared to Skylake too. Lucky being in Melbourne, the central heat would probably wreak havoc on my water loop. Reply 0 vaegrand @vaegrand May 31, 2017, 3:47pm It gets so hot that even with the pump on high I experience throttling (though my 970 isn't helping). Thankfully winter sees a flip, but if I decide that I wanna have a day on the computer it still sees a bit of slowdown after a few hours. Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 May 31, 2017, 2:17pm There really is no need unless your constantly hitting 100% and believe that extra 10% boost will be enough?

Reply 6 fermian @fermian May 31, 2017, 6:13pm Is Intel's top new extreme crazy way-more-than-four core CPU being US$999 especially noteworthy? That's about $1350 in AUDs right now, though of course we'll have to pay GST and Australia Tax... But the i7-6950X came out last year and still costs $2400. The i7-6900K is $1299. The i7-980X from 2010 was US$999. They always have a top-dog zany super-CPU and it always costs US$999. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Unveiled at the Computex trade show in Taiwan, the new family is dubbed the “Intel Core X-series processors family”. One member of the family is a the Core i9 Extreme Edition, which takes the Core range's upper limit from a “7” to a “9”. The Register imagines the next step might be a Core 11 and Spinal Tap jokes. But we digress. The new Skylake-based X-series starts at the i5, compared to the i3 at the bottom of the barrel for plain old Core CPUs. Here's the new lineup. Intel's new Core-X CPU range But wait, there's more! Intel says before too much time has passed it will add models with 18, 16, 14, and 12 cores. For now, Chipzilla is pitching the range at enthusiasts and gamers. But an 18-core, 36-thread beast may well excite some workstation buyers especially when paired with Intel's new X299 motherboard chipset as that product offers up to 24 PCI Express lanes, 14 USB ports (10 of them USB 3.0) eight SATA slots and the ability to handle RAID 0,1, 5 or 10. Chipzilla's also shown off partners' efforts to employ more about the Compute Card it showed off earlier this year. The 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm computer will come in the four configurations below. Partners signed up to play with the device include Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, Seneca Data, InFocus, Contec, Dtx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.

Intel expects the Compute Card to go wherever small form factor computers are required. The Register last year tested an Intel Compute Stick, but didn't review it because we found almost nothing nice to say. Above all, the device was just inconvenient because it was so big that your correspondent's telly needed an adjacent HDMI slot to be empty if the Stick was going to fit. Intel thoughtfully supplied a short HDMI cable with the stick, but that just made it dangle unpleasantly. Hopefully Intel's partners will make that problem go away this time around – and they should because the Card connects over USB-C, a rather more flexible interface than HDMI! ® Tips and corrections 49 Comments MORE Intel Processors Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Intel, Samsung join Apple, FTC firing squad against rival Qualcomm Two more chip heavyweights enter the patent fray 4 Comments Apple weans itself off Intel with 'more ARM chips' for future Macs Cook bakes up another Chipzilla-free component for fruity computers – report 33 Comments Utah fights man's attempt to marry laptop Foe of same-sex unions seeks to wed machine 98 Comments Sysadmin 'trashed old bosses' Oracle database with ticking logic bomb' Always ensure the office laptop gets returned 68 Comments Oracle gets to Wercker, dines on container biz Larry goes Dutch on Docker support 3 Comments Oracle crushes Apiary's hope in slightly awkward email to customers We OWN you, WE review the products, WE say what stays 19 Comments Whitepapers Hybrid and Public Cloud for Mission-critical Deployment Red Hat is a modern-day success story; it’s open-source software (OSS) model has now penetrated nearly every layer of IT systems that were once proprietary.

The company announced today at Computex 2017 that it has partnered with Intel to create a "wireless VR accessory" for the Vive HMD. That accessory will rely on WiGig, the wireless tech Intel created to let you connect basically everything to your PC without having to plug in a single wire, and is expected to work with existing Vive HMDs. This is how HTC described the accessory in its announcement: The WiGig technology, based on 802.11ad standard, works solely in the interference- free 60GHz band, and enables high throughput and low latency in both directions, from the PC to HMD and from HMD to PC. This means pristine video quality with <7ms latency in any environment, supporting multiple users sharing the same space. All of this results in the seamless wireless VR with the Vive! The extent to which the wireless VR is "seamless" depends on how much lower than 7ms latency HTC manages to get. Low latency is crucial to VR--too much can hurt your sense of immersion at best and make you feel sick at worst. The good news is we might not have to wait long to find out how well this accessory works: HTC said it's going to show off a proof of concept when it heads to E3 from June 13-15. In the meantime, we can take comfort in knowing HTC isn't the only company that's chasing that wireless VR dream. AMD acquired an Austin startup called Nitero for its wireless XR technology in April, and we recently went hands-on with Sixa's Rivvr wireless VR system. Oh, and Oculus is also working on a self-contained, untethered HMD with Project Santa Cruz. Hopefully we can bid adieu to all these wires sooner than later.

POST A COMMENT 9 Comments View All Comments boeush - Tuesday, May 30, 2017 - link So, here's what I don't get. If these wireless VR headsets are intended to display video content rendered on an external graphics card, then let's see: 90 [FPS - 'meh', I'd rather see closer to 120, but OK] x (1080 x 1200 x 2 [kinda 'meh', IMO, but OK]) x 24 [bpp - no HDR, sorry] =~ 5.6 Gbps WiGig is only capable of up to 7 Gbps (under ideal conditions, and only by simultaneously using 60, 5, and 2.4 Ghz bands in a tri-band configuration.) So how are they planning on "supporting multiple users sharing the same space"? (And what is 'multiple' - do they seriously mean more than 2 ?!?) Sure, they can try to compress the hell out of the video stream. But intensive decompression workloads would help kill the battery of the headset even faster than the constant-on WiGig streaming, video display to both eyes, and audio to both ears would be doing already... Also, what is 'XR'? Reply MrHollow - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Well i think they meant multiple users but with a different PC and HMD and not one PC and multiple HMDs. Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link That wasn't the point: the point is all those users would be sharing the same spectrum in the same room, and within that room there are only so many bits that can be flying around at any given time (any more, and packets would be getting dropped due to signal interference.) Reply yhselp - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Isn't there some compression happening along the way? HDMI 2.0 supports 4K@60fps with HDR, which by your calculations would require 28.8 Gbps, and yet HDMI 2.0 only allows for 18 Gbps. Is there something I'm missing? Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link Not sure how you get to the 28.8 number. 3840 x 2160 (4K) x 60 (Hz) * 30 (bpp, at 10 bpc) =~ 15 Gbps. At 12 bpc, it would be still only ~18 Gbps... Reply BoyBawang - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link There is one they called Foveated Rendering. The resolution is increased only on the small area where your eyeballs are focused. The rest is rendered in low resolution. Big bandwith & CPU saver. Needs an eyeball tracker to work. Reply boeush - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link A very rapid eyeball tracker, at that... (saccades are super-fast, and the eyes are constantly jittering on a small angular scale and at a very rapid rate that we aren't consciously aware of, and then there's the whole issue of head-motion on top of it all...) Insofar as foveated rendering goes, my impression is that the point was mostly to reduce load on the GPU -- though I can certainly see how it might be leveraged for video signal compression (still, this kind of a non-uniform compression scheme would be pretty novel, as far as I know.) And I'd still question the ultimate efficiency of any such compression vs. the impact on visual quality (and attendant nausea-inducing lag or compression artifacts...) Reply Luminair - Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - link They can compress it however they want, including with AV1 http://aomedia.org/about-us/ Video compression/decompression is very resource intensive, which is why Intel and Nvidia like to talk about how well they can do it in every new product they try to sell you. Which codec they pick is a matter of cost and market size. I assume they'll pick h264 for the demo because common off the shelf parts can do it. But if this will ship in a year, it could use anything Reply Pat78 - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link XR is Extended Reality.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Teases 8th-Generation Core Processors The chip giant has repackaged some old claims around its upcoming eighth-generation Core processors to make them seem new. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 30, 2017 at 8:00PM In addition to launching its new Skylake-X processor family for the high-end desktop market, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently teased its upcoming eighth-generation Core processor for the notebook market. The company had previously said that it expected that its eighth-generation Core processors to deliver a ">15%" performance improvement over its currently available seventh-generation Core processors. Now, Intel claims that its eighth-generation Core processors deliver "more than 30% improvement performance" relative to those seventh-generation Core chips. Image source: Intel. Let's dissect Intel's claims and then put this announcement into broader business context. Moving the goalposts In a footnote accompanying the performance claim, Intel said that this 30% performance improvement compares the Core i7-7500U notebook processor with an unnamed eighth-generation Core i7 chip. Both chips have a value known as PL1 ("power level 1") set to 15 watts. Per Intel, PL1 is "a threshold for average power that will not exceed." In other words, both chips are set to consume the same amount of power on average. The i7-7500U, Intel says, has two cores and four hardware threads (two per core) with a turbo frequency of 3.5GHz. The unnamed eighth-generation Core chip has four cores and eight hardware threads, with a turbo of "up to 4GHz." The performance lift within the same power envelope is certainly nice, but it's important to note that when Intel put its original ">15%" claim out there, it compared seemingly the same unnamed eighth-generation Core processor with a seventh-generation Core chip known as the Core i7-7600U. The 7600U runs at a maximum turbo speed of 3.9GHz, an 11.4% boost compared to the maximum turbo on the 7500U. Indeed, it's clear that the fundamental characteristics of the eighth-generation Core chip haven't improved since the last time that Intel talked about it -- it just picked a weaker seventh-generation Core chip to compare this upcoming eighth-generation Core notebook chip with. Eighth-generation Core still looks good Although I'm not a fan of Intel moving the goalposts to try to paint its upcoming eighth-generation Core chips in a better light, I do think that what Intel has cooking with its eighth-generation Core processors looks quite good. If Intel delivers its eighth-generation Core processors this holiday, as the company claims it will, then that will mark two years in a row of the company delivering new, meaningfully improved processor families for the personal computer market. Now, Intel has had it a bit easier than it did in the past, as it is delivering refined versions of the same basic Skylake architecture and 14-nanometer manufacturing technologies to enable this improvement, rather than radical changes in either the chip architecture or in the underlying manufacturing technology. As I've noted before, I'm waiting to see if Intel can continue this momentum in the years ahead, especially as the company faces a transition to newer, more complex 10-nanometer manufacturing technologies and brand-new chip architectures. If Intel can, then I won't be able to help but become incrementally more enthusiastic about the company's execution and ultimately its long-term business prospects. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Look a Lot Like Intel 30 Years Ago Will Proofpoint, SunPower, and Axon Enterprise transform their industries the way Intel did? Rich Duprey, Daniel Miller, and Matthew DiLallo (TMFCop) May 30, 2017 at 6:24PM Thirty years ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the world's largest computer chip maker, a position it still holds today, but it was on the cusp of transforming itself and the industry in ways unforeseen at the time. We've asked three top Motley Fool contributors to identify a company they think can similarly change the way they're seen in their industry, and how their industry can transform as well. Read on to find out why they think Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR), and Axon Enterprises (NASDAQ:AAXN) sit on the threshold of change. Intel changed the world, these stocks could do the same. Image Source: Getty Images. Solution for growing threats Daniel Miller (Proofpoint, Inc.): When you think of Intel 30 years ago, you conjure the image of a young technology company with innovative products. Intel's chips would bring processing and memory capacities that helped usher in the worldwide adoption of PCs. One company that also conjures the image of a young tech company that could alter the landscape of its industry is cyber security company Proofpoint, Inc. PFPT data by YCharts. For those who haven't heard of Proofpoint, it's a security-as-a-service provider with data protection solutions. Those services and solutions include threat protection, data governance, and secure communication, among many others. Just recently, the company launched its Digital Risk Defense service, which, according to Proofpoint, is the industry's first integrated phishing and fraud defense solution across critical digital channels. The good news for investors? The cyber security company has high renewal rates (90%-plus last year), and it consistently ropes in new clients and consumers. Take the first quarter of 2017 as an example: Its total revenue was up 43% year over year, its billings were up a similar 40%, and it nearly tripled its cash flow. More good news for investors: These problems aren't going away. Email threats remain a huge concern, with over 17,642 organizations victimized in the U.S. alone, according to Proofpoint's Analyst Day presentation in 2016. These concerns will only elevate with the expanding mobile and social networking presence in our lives. You'll have to pay a premium to own shares of Proofpoint, but it's a small price to pay if it can indeed change the industry's landscape as Intel did 30 years ago.  Image source: Getty Images. The Intel of solar technology Matt DiLallo (SunPower): While the solar industry has been around for decades, it's just starting to gain traction in the mainstream. Fueled by climate-change worries and economics, solar installations around the globe are growing rapidly, with America's installed capacity, for example, doubling last year alone. Meanwhile, there's plenty of growth up ahead, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, for example, anticipating that the nation's utility-scale solar generation capacity could increase another 48% by the end of next year. Despite that stunning growth, solar would still only account for about 1% of the country's total utility-scale electric generation. While that massive addressable market alone is a big-time opportunity for leading solar technology company SunPower, what makes it stand apart from the crowd is its Intel-like innovation focus. That drive has enabled the company to build products that are light-years ahead of the commoditized components of its rivals when it comes to energy efficiency. For example, its Maxeon solar cells harness substantially more of the sun's power than a conventional panel, with its latest iteration expected to produce 70% more energy over the first 25 years than competitors' products. The company's efficiency lead should continue to widen in the future thanks to its investments in research and development that are driving improvements in energy production and cost. It's SunPower's focus on always setting the bar higher that reminds me so much of Intel. It's why I think its stock could one day rival the tech giant's success and be a powerful value creator for investors.  Image source: Axon Enterprises. A stunning transformation Rich Duprey (Axon Enterprise): Being able to reimagine your core business and transform yourself into a wholly new -- but related enterprise -- is how I see Intel, and it's how I picture Axon Enterprise. While Intel is still closely linked with processors that came to define computing, today, it is so much more, and it's deeply embedded in the digital world around us. That's what I see Axon doing. It is still very much the same company that came to define stun guns and has seen its Taser become synonymous with the less-than-lethal weapon, but it has now expanded beyond those narrow confines and opened up for itself new avenues of growth. According to TASER's own figures, almost 98% of the 18,250 or so police departments in the country have purchased its stun guns. Certainly, there will be a need for upgrades and replacements over time, but it has pretty much tapped out that market. It's in body cameras and evidence management where the best opportunities lie. As of the end of the first quarter, 36 of the country's 68 major city law enforcement agencies have purchased Axon's body cameras, its digital evidence management systems, or both. And it's the latter that ought to be the real driving force, because not only does it provide Axon with recurring streams of revenue, but it makes itself sticky in that once a department dedicates its evidence management to Evidence.com, switching costs rise astronomically. Unlike a department swapping out a Smith & Wesson duty weapon for a Sig Sauer if features or firepower improve from one manufacturer to the other, logging evidence would seemingly have a huge cost in time and money if a department wanted to switch. It's much easier and cheaper to continue with what you've got. That may ultimately prove to make Axon Enterprise even more of a transformational company than Intel, since swapping processors doesn't necessarily incur the same problems. And it's easy to see Axon moving beyond its close association with law enforcement -- perhaps even into the consumer realm. Daniel Miller has no position in any stocks mentioned. Matt DiLallo has no position in any stocks mentioned. Rich Duprey has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Axon Enterprise.

Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles doubling as security cameras. Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as these cars can spot a specific license plate 'quite rapidly'. Scroll down for video  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles, such as Uber's models (pictured) doubling as security cameras INTEL'S TAKE ON SELF-DRIVING CARS  Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles doubling as security cameras. Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as these cars will have the power to spot a specific license plat 'quite rapidly'. Intel also sponsored a study this month that discussed how passengers of autonomous vehicles will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. This means riders will be able to stream movies during their travels and surf the web – providing advertisers with new outlets for targeting ads. This will create a 'personal economy' sector that is said to be a $7 trillion business by 2050.  On Thursday, Krzanich spoke at the Code Conference in California, where he discussed the benefits of self-driving cars – other than reducing road accidents, CNBC reported. He also acknowledged the fact that using the vehicle's cameras to 'look' at license plates and other cars on the road could be intrusive on people's privacy. 'We'll have to put limitations on it,' he said. 'We'll have to encrypt that data and make sure I can't tell that it's John's [car] necessarily,' said Krzanich. 'I think there will be rules and new areas we'll have to explore, but the amount of social good that can come from that far outweighs those concerns.' 'We just have to deal with them.' The semiconductor manufacturer also sponsored a report written by researchers at Strategy Analytics, which discussed how passengers of these autonomous vehicles will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. The study, entitled 'Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy', has suggested that by 2050, passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a self-driving car) will be a $7 trillion business.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses.

Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats.

The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price.

Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

But that architecture has not come to the laptop market yet. So I would probably stick to an intel chip for a laptop. I do have an AMD A10-5630 or something, and its fine, but I also have an intel i7-4620Q in my other laptop and that is far more powerful. simon14 1815 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 18 Trusted   Reply # 1763827 13-Apr-2017 14:13 Thanks guys,       Ideally looking for a laptop with good processor, 8gb ram and touch screen.

If the machine is low on RAM (4GB or less) it makes the whole machine faster as the swap file is on the SSD instead of a slow spinning disk.   128GB is fine for a SSD for a general machine for email, web, that kind of thing. My PC has a 128GB SSD, of which only 50GB is used, and that's with a LOT of stuff installed - Office, Photoshop, Development tools, etc, but no games.   AMD CPUs are probably fine for general use machines as well. @dazhann If you put up a link to the machines you'll get more advice.

A 7 year old i3 CPU gets 3600. However the AMD is about half as fast as my old i7 single threaded, so it's probably ok for general use. Complex web pages and multiple tabs might not be as fast as you'd like, but should be ok I think.

The 360-degree folding touchscreen converts the Chromebook to a tablet experience. The built-in pen is designed for a natural drawing and writing experience enabling employees to remain productive no matter where they are. They can take notes with Google Keep or Squid, and sign digital documents with apps like DocuSign. You can also work offline with the Samsung Chromebook Pro to create and edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations, view PDFs and other locally stored files, and even reply to emails, which are then sent automatically when the device connects to Wi-Fi again. Security and easy device management at the core Like all Chromebooks, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is built with security in mind, from the time employees bootup and until they shut down. That means the Chromebook includes a tamper-proof Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and also Verified Boot feature, which helps ensure the device is running uncompromised software. Chrome OS also runs each browser tab and application in a sandboxed state to avoid malicious modification of the system software or other applications. User data is encrypted as well, helping to protect both your employee’s information as well as your company’s data. And automatic updates every six weeks help maintain the security of Chrome OS. IT admins can easily deploy and manage this new Chromebook from a centralized management console with more than 200 device policies. That means providing employees with the apps and services they need to get work done, and even pre-configuring network connections for them. The Samsung Chromebook Pro is available now in the U.S. for $549, with additional launch regions expected later. Learn more about the Samsung Chromebook Pro here and see how it can safely enable your business in a variety of uses or buy now through the Shop Chrome store.     Print       Email Published: 3 days ago on June 2, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: June 2, 2017 @ 7:14 am Filed Under: Business, Computer Technologies, Economics, English, Global Economy, Google, MIL OSI, MIL OSI Economics, Open Source Intel NEXT ARTICLE → Visualize data instantly with machine learning in Google Sheets ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Post Disaster Needs Assessment and Disaster Recovery Framework Workshop for Thailand About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts Market Price of Important Means of Production in Circulation, May 21-30, 2017 Average Price of Food in 50 Cities, May 21-30, 2017 Fujitsu and SAP Expand Global Partnership Speech by CE at World Sustainable Built Environment Conference 2017 Hong Kong (English only) Residents urged to have their say on liveability of Shire © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Following a quiz session which featured corporate teams, and a solo singing competition, it was time for a fascinating discussion on 'Careers - Many Pathways to Success'. On the panel was Raj Jain (CEO, BCCL), Saurabh Kumar (co-founder, Grofers), Warren Patrick (chief 'learning' officer and senior president, YES Bank), Debjani Ghosh (ex CEO, Intel) and Ritesh Agarwal (founder and CEO, OYO Rooms), with Swapan Seth acting as the eloquent moderator. So, what is success all about? Are there different paths to success? Is failure a necessary stopover on the road to success? And if you're a college dropout, do you have a better chance of being successful in life? "Success is about being grateful when you wake up every morning, for what you have, what you've done, and where you are. It's also the zeal and energy to make tomorrow better than today," shared Jain. Patrick felt success was the achievement of a goal, whether personal or professional, while Kumar believed if you're happy with what you are doing, then you are successful. For Agarwal, if what you're doing can create a positive impact around yourself, you've achieved success. "Success is a state of mind. It's a time when, and a place where, you feel good with where you are and what you have achieved, and you're ready to move on to the next level," said Ghosh, who quit as Intel CEO at the top of her game. As for yardsticks of success, they differ from person to person. "Acceptance and acknowledgment by your peers fuels your journey to success, a journey that is never-ending. And you keep raising the bar higher, each step along the way," said Patrick. Kumar believed how one defines success comes from within, while Agarwal felt that success is directly proportional to ambition. And what are the attributes of success? Well, topmost are the values and principles that one is taught, and embraces. Also, learning from people who have been there, done that. To these Agarwal added the spirit of contrarianism. "Whatever you do, do it differently to everyone else." Jain mentioned inquisitiveness and a desire to learn all the time. "I would love to be an Uber driver one day - it's such a fun life, doing what you want, when you want! "But there's also no substitute for good old hard work," added Jain. Still, in any conversation about success, failure cannot be too far behind. "Failure without deep reflection has no meaning. You have to learn from failure," Jain advised. According to Agarwal, failure is a stepping stone to success. "It should be considered a badge of honour!" Kumar believed every failure makes you a better person, but insisted it shouldn't be glamourised. "It should be a part of the journey - it's important to take learnings from failure." Patrick took the philosophical approach. "If you haven't experienced the darkness, you won't appreciate the light. If you haven't experienced failure, you won't taste the fruits of success." Failure is part and parcel of life, admitted Ghosh, adding that if success isn't fun, it isn't success at all. It's probably best to conclude by paraphrasing Rudyard Kipling: 'If you can meet with 'Success' and 'Failure' / And treat those two impostors just the same', then the sky truly is the limit.

Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion Study Estimates the Value of Goods and Services in the Early Years of the ‘Passenger Economy’ Will Be More Than Twice the Size of the ‘Sharing Economy’ NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel predicts a new “Passenger Economy” will emerge to support the idle time when drivers become riders The economic opportunity will grow from US$800 billion to US$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream Mobility-as-a-Service will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations and usage A new study by Intel Corporation and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy," the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. (Graphic: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 01, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Here's what that means It's as fast as a turn-of-the-century supercomputer. By Rob Verger posted Jun 1st, 2017 at 1:26pm Intel's Core i9 Extreme Edition processor costs about $2,000. Intel Corporation Earlier this week in Taipei, Intel announced the most powerful desktop chip for consumers that it has ever sold. With 18 cores and a price tag of $1,999, the processor is known as a teraflop chip, meaning it can accomplish a trillion computational operations every second. Called the Core i9 Extreme Edition processor, the chip is not for the average computer user, someone who just wants to check email, read the news, and watch “House of Cards.” Instead, the processor is for people who want to do extreme stuff, like playing a game in 4K while simultaneously livestreaming it—oh, and also doing two other things at the same time. In a cute turn of phrase, Intel calls this “mega-tasking.” This is Intel’s first time making a consumer desktop chip that breaks the teraflop barrier, and Gregory Bryant, an Intel senior vice president, calls it “by far the most extreme desktop processor ever introduced.” From megaflops to teraflops to petaflops To get a sense of what a teraflop can do, it helps to know what FLOPS, a unit of computing speed, are. FLOPS stands for floating-point operation per second; one floating-point operation means taking two numbers that have a decimal point in them and doing some math on them, like multiplying them together. One teraflop is a trillion floating-point operations every second. “There was a time, when if someone said ‘teraflop,’” says Brandon Lucia, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “you would expect them to be talking about a supercomputer that had many, many processor chips.” In fact, if you wind back the clock to 1976, the Cray-1 supercomputer could do just 160 megaflops (that’s a million FLOPS), meaning this singular new Intel chip is about 6,000 times as fast as that machine, says Steve Scott, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at Cray, Inc. The Cray-1. Cray Inc In the late 1990s and 2000s, supercomputers were still measured in teraflops, and an important machine called ASCI Red at Sandia National Laboratory reigned as the fastest machine in the world from 1997 to 2000. It could do over a teraflop. Today, these powerful machines are measured in petaflops (that’s a thousand trillion FLOPS). As just one example, Mira, the supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, is a 10-petaflop machine that has been used to model complex scenarios like a potential Ebola outbreak in the United States. “Supercomputing technologies have now filtered down into the consumer space,” Scott says. “If you can build a petaflop system for many millions of dollars, that means you can build 10 teraflop systems that companies or smaller organizations can afford to buy, or one teraflop systems that individual consumers can afford to buy.” When a chip like the new Intel processor is doing floating-point operations, the math is not done just for the sake of doing math—it’s the computation powering the software you’re running. “This isn’t just to make the computer into a calculator,” Lucia, of Carnegie Mellon, says. “Those floating point numbers represent the kind of important workloads that we care about, whether it’s video editing or virtual-reality environments.” In short: a powerful chip like this can make virtual reality, gaming, streaming 4K video, or video editing all go faster and more smoothly. A PlayStation 4 has a graphics processing unit that can do over a teraflop, if you’re keeping score at home. The Trinity supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Los Alamos National Laboratory Computer processors have cores The Intel chip boasts more cores than a rival processor called the “Threadripper,” which packs 16 cores and is made by AMD. The comparison gets pretty nebulous, however, unless you consider what a core actually does. Envision a supermarket checkout line, says Lucia. Let’s say there’s just one open register, and the cashier is checking out one customer at a time; that’s like a single-core chip. (And if you’re standing in that line with your bananas and ramen, you’re likely feeling frustrated.) Now imagine that 18 checkout lines are open, all of them staffed with cashiers who are checking customers through in parallel with each other. In this utopian scenario, everything moves much, much faster. That represents an 18-core processor. This new chip does even more than that, because it uses an Intel technology called hyper-threading, which means that each core can actually do two things at once. In our supermarket analogy, that’d be as if the store hired robots that could check out two people simultaneously in each of the 18 lines—now they’d be able to help 36 people a time. Similarly, this new Intel chip can actually do 36 tasks at once. So why would we want a chip like this? And all that matters because something like an interactive virtual-reality landscape places a huge demand on the processor. Sure, computers and processors already on the market can power, say, an Oculus Rift headset, but the idea behind a powerful chip like this is that it could do several intense things at once; it could also make for smoother interactions between people and computationally-demanding software. “We want to run these [intense programs] efficiently so that we can do things that are responsive and appear to react in realtime to our interactions with them,” Lucia says. “This is the direction that a lot of computing is going.” All of which means that not only can a chip like this power a virtual reality experience, it could also power other complex endeavors that require tons of computing heft—like simulating how a protein (a large molecule made up of amino acids) interacts with another protein. Intel hasn’t said when this chip will be available, but a company representative said that other chips in the same family (called the X-series) with fewer cores will be available in the next few weeks.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    FACT CHECK: Did 17 Intel Agencies ‘All Agree’ Russia Influenced The Presidential Election? David Sivak 1:35 PM 06/01/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP During an interview Wednesday with the tech news outlet Recode, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton discussed at length her belief that Russian interference in the 2016 election harmed her chances of winning. “Read the declassified report by the intelligence community that came out in early January,” said Clinton. “Seventeen agencies, all in agreement – which I know from my experience as a senator and secretary of state is hard to get – they concluded with ‘high confidence’ that the Russians ran an extensive information war against my campaign to influence voters in the election.” Verdict: False While the intelligence report she mentions does express ‘high confidence’ that Russia sought to undermine her campaign, it only represents the views of three agencies – the FBI, CIA and NSA. Clinton incorrectly claims this report shows consensus among 17 intelligence agencies. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper himself appeared in front of Congress and explicitly pushed back on the idea that “17 intelligence agencies agreed,” stating flatly that it was just three. Fact Check: The intelligence community is comprised of 17 civilian and military agencies including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Another of these agencies – the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) – speaks on behalf of the intelligence community and orchestrated the January report. “The [intelligence community assessment] was a coordinated product from three agencies: CIA, NSA and the FBI, not all 17 components of the intelligence community,” said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a congressional hearing in May. “Those three under the aegis of my former office.” A handful of experienced analysts were chosen from the three agencies to investigate and draw independent conclusions. Each agency reached the same verdict about Russian interference. So while the DNI published the report as an intelligence community assessment, Clapper clarified at the hearing that the report reflects the views of those three agencies alone. In fact, when questioned by Democratic Senator Al Franken, Clapper resisted the notion that all 17 agencies had reached a consensus. Franken: The intelligence communities have concluded, all 17 of them, that Russia interfered with this election. And we all know how that’s right. Clapper: Senator, as I pointed out in my statement, Senator Franken, it was- there were only three agencies that directly involved in this assessment plus my office. Franken: But all 17 signed on to that? Clapper: Well, we didn’t go through that process. This was a special situation because of the time limits and […] the sensitivity of the information, we decided – it was a conscious judgment – to restrict it to those three. I’m not aware of anyone who dissented, or disagreed when it came out. DHS published a joint statement with the DNI back in October expressing the same verdict about Russian interference, so it’s fair to say a handful of agencies have publicly drawn conclusions. But simply because the DNI speaks for the intelligence community as a whole doesn’t mean all 17 agencies reached independent conclusions, let alone conducted independent investigations.

Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Get Flash to see this player. Zenith Extreme and Rampage VI Extreme lead the way for AMD and Intel chipsets. Asus has gone to town on high-end consumer motherboards. We say this because the company has loaded the proverbial kitchen sink on its premier AMD and Intel offerings. Starting off with AMD, Asus is one of the few guys to produce the X399 chipset reserved for the upcoming 'Threadripper' CPU. The Zenith Extreme features premium components all round - integrated OLED screen, Aura Sync lighting, 802.11ad WiFi, RGB strips, and 10Gbe Ethernet - and should be available as soon as Threadripper launches in the summer. Arguably, the X299 Rampage VI Extreme is even more out there, but we won't spoil the surprises until you watch Jonathan from Asus give you the rundown in the video above. Tempted by either ultra-premium platforms?

The PCIe V3.0 lane count is the killer feature and it is going to be NVMe that chews it up. Fair enough the gaming and graphics enthusiasts will be lapping up the dual and perhaps triple x16 V3.0 potential but the slowest part of any PC / Workstation will always be the storage and with ThreadRipper we can potentially start thinking about hitting 10Gb/s in the very near future without the need for a crazily expensive HBA or RAID cards. 2 x Samsung 960 Pros in RAID 0 will be hitting 5Gbs, what will 4 give us? :) - Throw in quad channel to keep the beast fed from a memory perspective and it is beginning to feel like the late 90's and early 00's when the CPU's and platforms were getting some real design and innovation. AMD has completely caught Intel offside with their pricing / PCIe lane restrictions. I was looking at getting a Ryzen 7 + an Asus Sabertooth X370 but now will save a bit more and wait till Oct and build myself a monster 16C, 64GB Ram, 2TB Nvme, 18TB HDD, Vega, watercool the lot and then load up Win 10 Pro, Centos 7 and for giggles OS/2 in its latest Arca Noae 5.0 (Blue Lion) guise.

Then take a look at the components system integrators are employing in their latest builds. With the goal of selling as many PCs as possible, the best boutique builders keep their finger on the pulse and utilise hardware that is favoured by many and easy to work with. Cyberpower has been around long enough to identify current trends. Originally founded in the US and now serving UK customers from a Gateshead HQ, Cyberpower promises "the most up to date hardware for your needs" and has sent in the £1,999 Infinity X77 Titanium for evaluation. Designed with gaming in mind, this enthusiast base unit immediately catches the eye courtesy of a Cooler Master MasterCase Pro 5 Nvidia Edition chassis. We're quite fond of the MasterCase aesthetic, and the GeForce makeover works surprisingly well as the green-and-grey accents add extra interest without overstepping the mark. Build quality is good throughout, with Cyberpower doing a decent job of cable management and overall tidiness, but what's telling is that Intel and Nvidia's stranglehold on high-end PCs appears unbreakable. AMD ought to be back in the race with its competitive Ryzen CPUs, yet Core i7 and GeForce GTX continue to rule the roost - we've yet to hear from a single vendor who is eager to send in a Ryzen PC for review. Multi-threaded goodness obviously isn't a high priority for gaming machines, and Intel's lead in IPC keeps the latest-generation Core i7 'Kaby Lake' at the top of most users' wish list. Sticking with the tried-and-trusted, Cyberpower straps a Core i7-7700K to a Cooler Master MasterLiquid 120 cooler and overclocks the chip to 4.7GHz across all cores. Accompanying the CPU is 16GB (2x8GB) of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3000 memory on an MSI Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon motherboard outfitted with a liquid-cooled MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Sea Hawk graphics card. No major surprises thus far, though Cyberpower does try something different with regards to storage. Rather than adopt the usual SSD primary, HDD secondary configuration, the Infinity X77 Titanium comes equipped with a 3TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk and a speed injection courtesy of a 16GB Intel Optane M.2 accelerator. A 600W Cooler Master MasterWatt Lite PSU is par for the course at this price point, as is a DVD writer and a clean 64-bit install of Windows 10, though it's nice to see Cyberpower employ a sleeved set of green Phanteks extension cables to maintain the overall theme. The default component selection makes sense, and though there's plenty of choice for customisation using the online configurator, we don't see any obvious reason to make changes at first glance. The question for enthusiasts is why buy a pre-built machine when you can buy all of the aforementioned components for roughly £1,850? Well, for an additional £150 premium, Cyberpower takes away the guesswork, guarantees a 4.7GHz overclock and backs the machine with a three-year warranty that includes two years of parts cover as standard. Tempted? Then let's see what the benchmarks have to say.

Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion Study Estimates the Value of Goods and Services in the Early Years of the ‘Passenger Economy’ Will Be More Than Twice the Size of the ‘Sharing Economy’ NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel predicts a new “Passenger Economy” will emerge to support the idle time when drivers become riders The economic opportunity will grow from US$800 billion to US$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream Mobility-as-a-Service will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations and usage A new study by Intel Corporation and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy," the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. (Graphic: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 01, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Andrew Grove served as chairman and CEO of Intel at different points during his career, and he had a famous philosophy about why the two jobs were separate. “Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an employee? If he’s an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the board,” Grove, who died in 2010, once said. “The chairman runs the board. How can the CEO be his own boss?” Facebook’s stockholders will have to answer those questions about chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg at today’s annual meeting. Four Facebook investors, joined by the consumer watchdog group SumOfUs, have put forth a proposal which would “require the Chair of the Board to be an independent member of the Board.” The measure is included as part of Facebook’s proxy statement. “We believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporation’s governance,” the shareholder statement reads. The group’s main problem with Zuckerberg’s monopoly involves an independent committee’s decision last year to alter Facebook’s stock structure.  Every stockholder in Facebook — including Zuckerberg — received two new shares of so-called “Class C” stock for every existing share. The new stock had no value—its sole purpose was to create new shares that Zuckerberg can sell off in order to fulfill his promise of giving away 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity. What’s more, Zuckerberg’s ownership stake in Facebook is not affected, no matter how much Class C stock is sold off—he still has voting control over the company’s board. As The New York Times reported, “(The deal) ensures that Mr. Zuckerberg will have lifetime control over Facebook.” Marc Andreessen. Kimberly White/Getty Images What makes the deal even more ethically dubious is that one member of the “independent” committee which approved the stock split, entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, texted Zuckerberg with updates during deliberations. These actions have affected the company’s stock market standing—the advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has given Facebook a corporate governance score of 10 (the highest level of risk). SumOfUs is using all of this as ammunition—last week the group sent a letter to all Facebook shareholders urging them to vote for an independent chair. “We believe that independent oversight of management would improve the ability of the Facebook board to support Facebook executives as they formulate appropriate responses to these challenges,” the letter reads. For its part, Facebook’s board of directors is lobbying members to vote against the SumOfUs proposal. “Forcing a division between our Chairman and our CEO could harm our performance and be detrimental to interests of our stockholders,” their response reads. “Mr. Zuckerberg, as our founder, has guided us from inception and is invested in our success. We do not believe that requiring the Chairman to be independent will provide appreciably better direction and performance, and instead could cause uncertainty, confusion and inefficiency in board and management function and relations.” This is not the first time SumOfUs has fought Facebook—last year, it was among 80 organizations which accused the social media giant of “racially biased” post moderation. Among the other proposals which will be voted on at the annual meeting is a request for Facebook to compile a report assessing its role in spreading fake news. The board is also opposing this measure, calling it “unnecessary.” SEE ALSO: Facebook Spaces Changes Reality for VR Entrepreneurs Business & Technology Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

News & Analysis Nvidia CEO Says Moores Law Is Dead Alan Patterson 6/1/2017 12:01 PM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has become the first head of a major semiconductor company to say what academics have been suggesting for some time: Moore’s Law is dead. Moore’s Law, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, reflects his observation in 1965 that transistors were shrinking so fast that every year twice as many could fit onto the same surface of a semiconductor. In 1975, the pace shifted to a doubling every two years. The enablers of an architectural advance every generation — increasing the size of pipelines, using superscalar tweaks and speculative execution — are among the techniques that are now lagging in the effort to keep pace with the expected 50 percent increase in transistor density each year, Huang told a gathering of reporters and analysts at the Computex show in Taipei. “Microprocessors no longer scale at the level of performance they used to — the end of what you would call Moore’s Law,” Huang said. “Semiconductor physics prevents us from taking Dennard scaling any further.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang notes the divergence between semiconductor technology and microprocessor performance at Taipeis Computex show. Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling, is based on a 1974 paper co-authored by Robert H. Dennard, after whom it is named. Originally formulated for MOSFETs, it states, roughly, that as transistors get smaller their power density stays constant, so that power use stays in proportion with area. The diminishing returns from Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling have seen the semiconductor industry enter a mature stage in which just a handful of chipmakers can afford the multibillion dollar investments required to push the process technology forward. By now, only a few chip designers have the deep pockets to double down on fabricating silicon at the 16nm and 14nm nodes, design rules where the distinction has become increasingly blurred. That stagnation in the progress of technology has also led to rapid industry consolidation in recent years that’s resulted in a flurry of multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions. Nvidia’s Huang predicts further advances to come from GPU computing. Even so, Huang suggested a modus vivendi for the semiconductor industry that plays into graphics processors, the products that Nvidia expects will enable continuing advances for years to come. Deep learning will use the processing power of GPUs that Nvidia makes as part of a new architecture that will take the company into artificial intelligence, outside the computer gaming business Nvidia has dominated, according to Huang. The semiconductor industry is exploring a number of pathways beyond Moore’s Law. Some upstart Chinese chipmakers are taking a stake in Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator FD-SOI.  Others see a future in going beyond planar design to three-dimensional chips. Nvidia’s bet on artificial intelligence to take the silicon industry forward is bullish, according to Randy Abrams, an analyst with Credit Suisse in Taipei. Nvidia has highlighted its Volta GPU on 12nm at an 815mm die size, taking up the same surface area as 7 iPhone processors, and connected to 16GB of high bandwidth memory using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSMC) silicon interposer technology. A configuration of eight of these chips in Nvidia’s DGX-1 deep learning / high performance computing machine sells for $149,000. NVIDIA’s data center business has grown 186 percent annually to a $1.7 billion run-rate in the recent quarter, Abrams said. That chunk of business is worth $500 million to TSMC, or about 1.5 percent of its total revenue. AI will need more time to offset mobile as a major driver, Abrams said. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times. He is based in Taiwan.

Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Rookie lots of mixed messages, Moores Law is alive and well IraRal   6/2/2017 2:46:52 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate This guy is really ful of mixed messages. Let's start with his first quote: "Microprocessors no longer scale at the level of performance they used to — the end of what you would call Moore's Law," Moore's law was never about anything but economics and transistor density. With that in mind, Moore's Law is actually doing better than ever. Intel's 10nm is bumping against the 100 million transistors per square millimeter and with Bohr's recent interview at Semicondcutor Engineering he suggested that their 7nm node will retain a consistent 0.7x scaling which would put them at over 200 million transistors per square millimeter. Since Nvidia uses TSMC, despite their silly node naming, they are well well behind with respect to desnity. But nonetheless Moore's Law is still alive and better than ever. Let's use Nvidia's very own flagship AI product: their new V100 which is manufactured on TSMC's "12nm FFN" (which is obsucation for their 16nm FinFET which it in itself just their 20nm BEOL with a planar switched to FinFET to get better power reduction). It has 21B transistors on a 815 mm²  die. Given TSMC's reticle limit is around 832mm² (roughly 32mm by 26mm), it's very clear Mr. Huang is in desperate need for more of Moore's Law. The problem is exacerbated when you take into account the power and heat limits. Calling the law dead is premature given Nvidia insatiable appetite for more transistors. I do understand that he is trying to call for a paradigm shift since our traditional performance enablers (logic techniques, NOT Moore's Law!) running out of steam and we need to look into smarter utilization of our available resources but he is not saying that and his products are not exactly any different than how they've always improved - through Moore's Law enablement. Since the author decided to mention the 1975 paper, it's worth noting that Gordon Moore himself coined the term "circuit and device cleverness" in that very paper suggesting that cleaver use of the higher transistor density will be necessary along with scaling to improve products.

Here's what you can expect when the first Alloy-based headsets go on sale later this year. In one corner of a guest room at the Hyatt Regency in Santa Clara, Calif., there's a spinning tower of molten metal that will spew across the bed if you put your finger in it. But you won't be able to see it unless you're wearing a "mixed reality" headset like Intel's Project Alloy. First announced last August, Project Alloy is a reference design for an untethered headset that can display a virtual world with elements from your physical environment mixed in. At the Santa Clara Hyatt this week, Intel showed off Alloy's latest iteration, a headset that looks vaguely like the Sony PlayStation VR but is completely wireless, so you can roam around the physical world with nothing to trip over. When you first put the headset on, you're immediately transported into an intriguing hybrid of the physical and virtual worlds. While Microsoft's HoloLens or Qualcomm's augmented reality glasses superimpose computer-rendered objects on your normal field of view, with Alloy you initially feel as if you're wearing a traditional VR headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. You're completely immersed in the virtual world, until you step close enough to a physical object—a hotel bed, for example—which will materialize in the virtual world as if it was magic. It isn't magic, of course. You can see the bed thanks to Alloy's RealSense camera, which is capable of depth perception, 3D imaging, interior mapping, and object tracking. The data is fed back not to a high-powered gaming PC or PlayStation, as is the case with Oculus or Sony, but instead to a CPU and graphics card contained within the headset. Intel designed the hotel room demo with fairly high filtering of the physical world so you didn't see real objects unless they were about 2 feet in front of you. That distance perfectly demonstrated what is perhaps Alloy's most ground-breaking feature: you can see your hands and the rest of your body in the virtual world, and software developers can design interactive elements that respond not to electronic inputs from controllers like the Oculus Touch, but from your actual hands. The end result was that you could touch the spinning tower of metal with a pointer finger and it would immediately deform, with molten droplets flying everywhere. (If you're less adventurous, you also could have also held a pen or other physical object and used it to interact with the spinning tower). In theory, this opens up augmented reality to a host of non-video game applications that would be awkward or impossible with glasses like the HoloLens or regular VR headsets like the HTC Vive. For instance, surgeons could fire up an immersive simulation of a patient in an operating theater, using their hands to interact with virtual scalpels and other tools. There are a few downsides, however. Perhaps the most obvious is the development time required to devise realistic-looking virtual worlds that respond to motion-tracking inputs. Creating virtual objects for a HoloLens app is remarkably simple using the Unity game engine, and you're not necessarily worried about their realism because users will expect them to look rudimentary compared to objects from the physical world that they can see through the lens. But with Alloy, hands, feet, and other physical objects are intruders in an otherwise virtual world, and the less realistic that world looks, the less time viewers will want to spend in it. Unfortunately, the Alloy demo in the hotel room definitely looked cheap. Everything virtual, from the spinning metal tower to a deformable blob on the other side of the room, was pixelated. There was a static snow effect that covered the display, likely a result of the RealSense cameras picking up light disturbances. And the borders of everything physical—like hands, shoes, or the bed—were jagged, as if they had been badly Photoshopped. Intel can't be faulted for all of this mediocrity, since Project Alloy is simply a reference design for other companies to emulate. The content for Alloy-based headsets, which could go on sale by the end of the year, will almost certainly get better over time. And Intel has rapidly improved the hardware since Alloy was announced—there's now an Intel Core i7 inside instead of an M-series processor, and the number of RealSense cameras has been shaved from three to two in order to improve efficiency and battery life. The fact remains, however, that the industry is a long way off from realizing the full potential of something like Project Alloy. Even Intel, which has pivoted away from desktop and server chips to become one of the VR industry's biggest cheerleaders, readily admits that there is a long road ahead. "I think that we are on this verge of something exciting about to happen, and yet virtual reality has been there before, where it didn't live up to its promises," Achin Bhowmik, Intel's general manager of perceptive computing, said at the Augmented World Expo here in Santa Clara on Wednesday. "There's a lot of work for us to do."

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun JERUSALEM Mobileye (MBLY.N), a maker of driverless vehicle technologies, reported a jump in quarterly profit that topped estimates, boosted by higher sales of its advanced driver assisted systems. The Israeli-based company, which is in the process of being acquired by Intel Corp (INTC.O), said on Thursday it earned 25 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the first quarter, up from 15 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 66 percent to $124.7 million. Mobileye was forecast to have earned 24 cents on revenue of $118.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it posted new advanced driver system wins, forged alliances with new partners and moved forward with its proprietary high-definition mapping project by signing definitive collaboration deals with several major automakers. In March, Intel agreed to buy Mobileye, which develops camera-based systems to help drivers avoid collisions, for $15.3 billion in a deal that promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. In light of the pending transaction, Mobileye said it would not hold an earnings conference call and will not provide and outlook for its financial results for future period. Nissan (7201.T), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) have already signed up to share data from Mobileye's camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems to generate HD maps for self-driving cars, and Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua has said four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program.

Intel fought back with its new Core X-Series announcement and the new $1999 flagship CPU with Core i9-7980XE.     AMD might not have a consumer CPU with 18C/36T, but it will be offering 16C/32T with their flagship ThreadRipper 1998X processor. Interestingly, AMD has nailed the TDP on ThreadRipper where they're offering far superior TDP numbers on their processors. For example, Intel's new 6C/12T right up to the 10C/20T have 140W TDPs, while AMD sips 125W. It's only 15W, but traditionally it has been Intel that has superior TDP numbers.     There will be 9 different Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs in total, with the 'X' models featuring XFR (Extended Frequency Range), which allows the ThreadRipper CPUs to scale their clock speeds past the traditional boost clocks, and it scales the CPU clocks with cooling. So if you have air cooling, you'll hit a certain frequency, but AIO water cooling and LN2 setups will benefit more with XFR.     AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs   16C/32T   ThreadRipper 1998X: 3.5/3.9GHz, XFR, 155W ThreadRipper 1998: 3.2/3.6GHz, 155W   14C/28T   ThreadRipper 1977X: 3.5/4.0GHz, XFR, 155W ThreadRipper 1977: 3.2/3.7GHz, 155W   12C/24T   ThreadRipper 1976X: 3.6/4.0GHz, XFR, 125W ThreadRipper 1956X: 3.2/3.8GHz, XFR, 125W ThreadRipper 1956: 3.0/3.7GHz 125W   10C/20T   ThreadRipper 1955: 3.1/3.7GHz, 125W ThreadRipper 1995X: 3.6/4.0GHz, 125W NEWS SOURCES:Zdnet4.cbsistatic.com >> NEXT STORY: Pokemon Company profits soar by 2400% << PREVIOUS STORY: Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records Related Tags AMD Computex 2017 ThreadRipper AMD ThreadRipper 16C/32T Intel Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD Radeon RX series cards are hard to buy right now New iPhone 8 rumors leak from trusted source Huawei to unveil the Honor 9 on June 12 ASRock delivers with an X299 mITX motherboard GDDR6 arrives in early 2018, GDDR5X hits 16GbpsView More News Posts Forum Activity Z97 Extreme won't go past BIOS - dead mobo?? i have a very problem,help please ASRock C2550D41 Stuck Booting Up Amped Wireless Helios-EX AC2200 Range Extender Review z68x-ud3-b3 REVIVED?
