Twitter Facebook Intel's Optane faces threat as Micron chases future QuantX tech Micron is researching second- and third-generation 3D Xpoint storage technology Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 04 February, 2017 08:08 - - - - print email Comments Intel made waves at CES in January with Optane, a new class of memory and storage that will supercharge PCs and servers. But don't forget that Optane has competition. Memory company Micron is coming out with memory and storage based on the same underlying 3D Xpoint technology. Intel and Micron jointly developed the first-generation 3D Xpoint technology, which was announced in 2015. The fruitful partnership is now turning into a healthy rivalry. While Intel ships its first low-capacity Optanes for PCs, Micron is already researching the second- and third-generations of 3D Xpoint technology. Micron's 3D Xpoint products are called QuantX. The companies believe 3D Xpoint products could ultimately replace conventional SSDs and DRAM in PCs and servers. Intel has said Optane SSDs are 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. The companies say the new technology is significantly denser than DRAM. The first low-capacity Optane storage should appear in PCs in the second quarter of this year. It will be used as cache to allow PCs to boot faster and load applications and games more quickly. Micron has moved a bit slower and expects to ship its first QuantX products in small quantities by the end of the year, the company said during an earnings call in late January. Micron has a different strategy than Intel for the development of QuantX. Instead of PCs, it will target high-capacity QuantX SSDs and DRAM at servers and high-end systems. In the next-generation QuantX products, Micron wants to tack on more storage capacity and reduce latency, Scott DeBoer, vice president of Micron, said during an analyst meeting Scottsdale, Arizona, this week. "This a real exciting technology for the future," DeBoer said. There is significant interest in using both Optane and QuantX in data centers for applications like machine learning. The dual-threat ability for the technologies to be used as both memory and storage makes them handy for caching and hot and cold storage. Micron won't offer the QuantX drives directly but will make it available through companies making storage products.

Let's find out. By: Sergio Andrés Echart Kuc | Guides | Posted: 5 days, 12 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Deliding is the process of removing the IHS (Integrated Heat Spreader) from the CPU with some methods described below which aim to drop CPU temperatures. Since Intel Series 3, 4, 6 and now 7, Intel uses a black silicone type to glue the IHS to the PCB, but the die barely touches it. And Intel uses a poor kind of thermal paste too, so there's very poor contact between the die and HIS, resulting in bad heat dissipation, thus a hot CPU.     Which CPU's can be Delidded?   All Intel Series 3, 4, 6, and 7. You can't on others as the IHS is soldered to the die. Many tried, and CPU ended up dead.     What are the Benefits of Deliding?   Depending on the CPU BATCH, Country of Origin (Malay, Costa Rica, Vietnam), and based on my experience of more than 50 CPUs delidded using the manual method, this is what I got:   Intel Series 3 - From Full LOAD you get -18 to -22C+ Intel Series 4 - From Full LOAD you get -19 to -28C+ Intel Series 6 - From Full LOAD you get -22 to -36C+ Intel Series 7 - Not Tested Yet     The best results on temperatures I got by far were in Skylake CPUs, always around 30C+ less in load testing.     Delid voids your CPU Warranty?   Yes, absolutely.     My CPU will OC better after a Deliding?   Again, this will depend on the batch, but yes, it will - especially on Intel Series 6, you get more overclocking headroom and better IMC cooling (better memory overclocking). The rest will let you run a better OC at lower temps.   Be advised that idle temperatures will stay the same or around 3 to 4C less.     After Delidding, is the IHS glued again?     Yes, but never use silicone or other methods. Deliding is not changing just the thermal paste used, but removing the black silicone utilized by Intel entirely. I use UHU Twist & Glue, one drop on each corner after I finish.     Can I use CPU direct die contact with the cooler?     Yes, but you need a special plate called "Delid Die Guard." If you don't use it, you will be applying different forces on the four corners and may break the die.   Many companies make them, first was ASUS then MSI and others make them. Still, I don't recommend this.     What Thermal Paste should I use?   After 50 successful delids, I can say you should use Collaboratory Liquid PRO. Only on the die, protecting the surface mounted components around with a thin layer of transparent nail polish and let it dry - this is far the best method.     Why use Liquid PRO? Simple, in testing, I can say others will have your CPU at normal temperatures after a month.     Methods used to Delid   1) Manual using a cutter   One of the best methods, but takes a lot of time, patience and work. It involves cutting the silicone using a blade or cutter (the better) with your hands putting the right pressure and grabbing the CPU the right way, going round and round with the blade at a specific angle and avoiding to go deeper scratching the die, PCB, or the surface mounted components.     After the IHS is off, you need to clean all the black silicone using an old credit card, again carefully. Once off, in the PCB and the IHS use Isopropyl alcohol to clean all and let it dry.   Apply the Liquid Pro on both the die and a bit on the IHS and glue the IHS again with one drop of UHU on each corner, place the CPU inside the plastic bag where it came and close it. That's the best way I found to make the IHS stay like factory produced.   2) The Vice Method (I don't recommend it, you will end with a dead CPU)   Picture Credits: cyberspaceandtime.com   This method uses brute force in a vice and is just something you shouldn't consider doing.   3) 3D Printed Delid Tools (I don't recommend them either)   Picture Credits: Chri from YouMagine   This is worse than the above vice method as the 3D printed model has to be perfect, and most people hit it with a hammer instead of using a vice, so it's double trouble.   4) Roockit Cool Delid Tool - The Best Method     5) Der8auwer Delid Die Mate 2 - The Best Method       Risks of Delidding a CPU   Take note:   Carefully inspect the CPU with a magnifier to find any damage on PCB so there no surprises later Remove all thermal paste from it using Isopropyl Alcohol Use one of the methods I recommended and read each carefully If you use the manual method, be careful with your fingers as you may get injured by the cutter Use nail polish to protect the surface mounted components to protect them from Liquid PRO which is very conductive - otherwise, you will end with a dead CPU Be careful on Intel Skylake and Kaby Lake CPUs as the PCB is much thinner than others   I hope this information comes handy to you guys - Sergio Andrés Echart Kuc, Spanish Senior Editor for TweakTown.

USA TODAY Sports surveyed six former players from various eras to learn what they like and don’t like about today’s game, a rule they’d want to change and whether they’d play now, knowing more about health issues. They are all Pro Bowlers. Four are Super Bowl champs. One is Hall of Famer. The group was split evenly between offense and defense. The panel included: Blaine Bishop: Former Oilers, Titans and Eagles safety, 1993-2002; Bob Golic: Former Patriots, Browns and Raiders defensive tackle, 1979-92; Mike Haynes: Hall of Famer, former Patriots and Raiders cornerback, 1976-89; Shaun O’Hara: Former Browns and Giants guard/center, 2000-10; Michael Robinson: Former 49ers and Seahawks fullback, 2006-13; Reggie Wayne: Former Colts wide receiver, 2001-14. USA TODAY How much longer can Tom Brady, Bill Belichick go? USA TODAY Legacy lost: Should Titans return ‘Oilers’ to Houston, site of Super Bowl LI? What do you love about today’s game? Haynes: It’s action-packed. A lot of passes, a lot of big plays. I like that. I think that’s really great. I also love that it’s a safer game, and they’re working really hard to make it safer. Bishop: The team camaraderie that you build, kind of like a brotherhood. Everybody has a role and you have the sacrifice. We were all great players in college. But you have to relish your role and have you’re guys’ back and do your job. Really, that equates to being a professional. That’s never changed. It’s an attribute that you actually can’t teach unless you play, and I’m not going to say football, but sports in general. Golic: That people are still playing football. That it’s still the game, to a certain extent, the game that we loved back in the day. It’s obviously changed a little bit with the hitting and some of the rules. O’Hara: It allows players to have fun. There’s times where you see things on social media where you say, “Wow, that’s great. That’s great you got to share that cause.” There’s so many great things that go on that were left uncovered or unsaid or people didn’t see (when I played). Robinson: The competition. Love the competition. Love the soft skills that football teaches you. I played quarterback (for a while up until college). To be able to look every man in the eye and have them believe in you? That’s a skill. Stuff that you learn in the classroom and be able to go out there and perform it? That’s a skill. To be able take the philosophy from your coach and be able to pump it and inject it into a locker room? That’s a skill. That’s what I love most about this game.

Wayne: It’s kinda leaning towards the flag football side. It’s getting a little softer, man. Even though I was a receiver and played on offense, I look at some of the calls today and I’m like, “That’s defenseless?” (The defense) is at a disadvantage. They really are. You don’t know how to hit a guy these days, you know what I mean? As a receiver, you’re like, “Thanks?” You look at a lot of these receivers now, they’ll probably play a long time, as long as they can take care of (their) body. It’s to the point now where I feel like a lot of these careers (of the receivers) will be extended. Haynes: Some of the things I dislike are also some of the things I like, you know? The officiating, it’s not 100%. And I think that’s what makes the game also a good game. I hit you, and one guy calls it pass interference. Another guys says, “That’s football.” I’m talking the officials. So as a player, I have to figure out, “Which guy are you? What can I get away with? It’s not black and white.” Bishop: There are bigger, stronger, faster athletes, but I just don’t think they’re disciplined. I don’t think they’re coached up. I just think it’s just a game of great athletes out there running around now, who really don’t study and care about the game. It’s all for the money. There was a passion there that I had, that most guys had in my era that just loved the game. They probably would have played for free. I probably would have. And today’s new millennial athlete, it just doesn’t work that way. They learn everything on video and everything else. It’s kind of like certain things you assume that they know, little nuances of the game, they really don’t know. Golic: I hate the fact that nowadays, the collective bargaining agreement basically said you can only have so many days of full contact practices. And we went in for 3 ½ weeks and it was all, until people were falling down, we would go full pads, full contact all the time. Of course, that’s just bitterness and envy jumping out of me now. The focus on controlling the violence. They tell you how to hit, where to hit. I understand some of the things like no spearing. We weren’t allowed to do that back in the time either. But now every time you come near a quarterback, if your hand even touches his helmet, they’re hitting you with a penalty. O’Hara: I think one of the challenges that is tough now is you can get in trouble without ever getting out of bed. With social media now, with your phones and everything you have now, everybody has access to you. As a player it’s so hard right now to not be distracted, because distractions are coming at you from every angle. That to me is probably the toughest things the players and teams are facing. There’s not a lot that’s sacred. You used to go in the locker room and it’s like, “What is said (in here) stays in here.” Now, you never know. Everybody’s a reporter. Everything is out there. So that’s a challenge. I think the other thing too is it’s a different game now. One of the things I liked about the old school football players is that they genuinely disliked each other. It made for good theater. Now everybody is buddies, all friends on everything, and the jersey swap after the game has kind of become the big thing. You kind of lose that animosity that made game day great. USA TODAY Super Bowl 2017 odds: Latest on spread movement, MVP bets USA TODAY Fifteen years ago, the Patriots were the dynasty no one saw coming What is one rule change you’d like to see? Wayne: I’d make a lot of them. Targeting to the head. I mean obviously, that’s tough. They can try and launch and try to hit you in the chest area but I know as a receiver, I know when you’re there, I’m gonna duck. And all of a sudden you hit me in my head. I get it. It’s a tough sport and we know the history of concussions and all that stuff. (Expletive), that’s what we signed up for. Bishop: I’m trying to figure out which one I want to go with. Being a defensive back, that pass interference is not a spot foul. It should just be a 15-yard penalty. … The reason why I say that now is because if you barely touch a guy – back in the day, you could touch a guy down the field, and when I was playing you could have a little bit of contact and still not call pass interference. Some guy can run in the back of you, you can be looking at the ball and everything and they could still call pass interference. You’ve got to be looking at the ball. OK, well, I’m looking at the ball and I cut his path off. I have the right to the ball just as much as he does, but the way the rules are set up, now is everything’s for the offense because they want more points. But I don’t think that now justifies having a spot foul. Because you can just throw the ball up and a guy can get contact easily, to me, and you can call that pass interference. Another rule that I wish we’d change – I want the referees to be able to pass an obstacle course, physicals and times to justify, because I think they’re getting the wrong angles and not being in the right positions because I don’t think they’re in shape enough to actually be in the right position to make an appropriate call. Golic: Nobody can hit the nose tackle. Nobody over 200 pounds. Centers must be the size of kickers. That’d be a good one. O’Hara: If I could change one thing I’d move the Pro Bowl back to Hawaii and I’d make it after the Super Bowl. I think the whole spirit of the Pro Bowl was a reward for the players, a reward for a great season. And to not have some of the best players in the Pro Bowl because they’re playing the Super Bowl, to me, is wrong. If you got 5-7 guys who make the Pro Bowl, and to go to the Super Bowl and win it, and you go to the Pro Bowl after you just won the Super Bowl, it’s probably the best week ever. To not have that is just a shame. And if people wanted to make it more competitive, I wouldn’t pay the losing team. You wanna see guys play hard in the fourth quarter, if you know you have to cut a check for all the flights and hotels? Robinson: We do have a lot rules. I get it, it’s all about protection. With the advent of spread offenses and how that’s starting to infiltrate our game – and it’s all on the college level, it all starts with job security there with coaches because they have to win now and score points. At the end of the day we’re hurting quarterbacks, the most important position. When I was playing flag, especially in my younger days, as the quarterback I had to go into a huddle, had to look every man in the eye, and tell him the play. They don’t do that anymore. Some quarterbacks never had to. If I had to change something, and I have some stuff I’m going to be talking to the NFL about, they need to go and reinvest back into the kid, back into the community, and I think that’ll help this whole dynamic.

Haynes: Yes, I would. Because I know a lot about them. One of the things is if I had a concussion, I would not continue to play. I would wait until I was able to play with doctor’s approval or whatever. Back in my era, I didn’t know that I shouldn’t have been playing, and I think in a lot of ways I got fortunate because my cognition was affected or my vision was affected and I couldn’t play anyway. I couldn’t play. But when I found out a headache was a symptom of a concussion, then I realized I needed more information. I didn’t have that. It was obvious I couldn’t play with those two issues, but a headache as a symptom? Maybe I played a lot of plays where I shouldn’t have played. So that would be a concern of mine and I would want to try to figure out a way to know if I had a concussion or not. Bishop: I was so passionate about football I probably would. But I wish I would have known what I know now. That’s probably why my son doesn’t play. He told me no. He played for a couple years. Was pretty good, too. He played sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade. … He’s his own person. Golic: Yeah. I played the game because I loved playing football. My dad played when he was in the Marines, Camp Lejeune. He was on their football team. Went to Indiana University for a year, played there. Went up to Canada, played seven years in the CFL. And I used to, as a young kid, he’d take me down to the park, set me on the field and he’s just go running, getting himself in shape. And I used to watch, and I don’t know, maybe I was trying to fulfill a dream of being like my dad. But we would watch football together, and when I got a chance to play it, I took it. Robinson: Absolutely. It’s afforded my family a different life. I was of the generation that was a little bit more informed than my predecessors, the people that came before me. When I started playing this game I knew that there was a big risk that it may take five, 10 years off my life. I knew there was a big risk that I may be walking a little funny one day. But I wouldn’t change my journey, I wouldn’t change the things that I’ve learned. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Patriots, Falcons practice for Super Bowl LI  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

USA TODAY Sports surveyed six former players from various eras to learn what they like and don’t like about today’s game, a rule they’d want to change and whether they’d play now, knowing more about health issues. They are all Pro Bowlers. Four are Super Bowl champs. One is Hall of Famer. The group was split evenly between offense and defense. The panel included: Blaine Bishop: Former Oilers, Titans and Eagles safety, 1993-2002; Bob Golic: Former Patriots, Browns and Raiders defensive tackle, 1979-92; Mike Haynes: Hall of Famer, former Patriots and Raiders cornerback, 1976-89; Shaun O’Hara: Former Browns and Giants guard/center, 2000-10; Michael Robinson: Former 49ers and Seahawks fullback, 2006-13; Reggie Wayne: Former Colts wide receiver, 2001-14. USA TODAY How much longer can Tom Brady, Bill Belichick go? USA TODAY Legacy lost: Should Titans return ‘Oilers’ to Houston, site of Super Bowl LI? What do you love about today’s game? Haynes: It’s action-packed. A lot of passes, a lot of big plays. I like that. I think that’s really great. I also love that it’s a safer game, and they’re working really hard to make it safer. Bishop: The team camaraderie that you build, kind of like a brotherhood. Everybody has a role and you have the sacrifice. We were all great players in college. But you have to relish your role and have you’re guys’ back and do your job. Really, that equates to being a professional. That’s never changed. It’s an attribute that you actually can’t teach unless you play, and I’m not going to say football, but sports in general. Golic: That people are still playing football. That it’s still the game, to a certain extent, the game that we loved back in the day. It’s obviously changed a little bit with the hitting and some of the rules. O’Hara: It allows players to have fun. There’s times where you see things on social media where you say, “Wow, that’s great. That’s great you got to share that cause.” There’s so many great things that go on that were left uncovered or unsaid or people didn’t see (when I played). Robinson: The competition. Love the competition. Love the soft skills that football teaches you. I played quarterback (for a while up until college). To be able to look every man in the eye and have them believe in you? That’s a skill. Stuff that you learn in the classroom and be able to go out there and perform it? That’s a skill. To be able take the philosophy from your coach and be able to pump it and inject it into a locker room? That’s a skill. That’s what I love most about this game.

Wayne: It’s kinda leaning towards the flag football side. It’s getting a little softer, man. Even though I was a receiver and played on offense, I look at some of the calls today and I’m like, “That’s defenseless?” (The defense) is at a disadvantage. They really are. You don’t know how to hit a guy these days, you know what I mean? As a receiver, you’re like, “Thanks?” You look at a lot of these receivers now, they’ll probably play a long time, as long as they can take care of (their) body. It’s to the point now where I feel like a lot of these careers (of the receivers) will be extended. Haynes: Some of the things I dislike are also some of the things I like, you know? The officiating, it’s not 100%. And I think that’s what makes the game also a good game. I hit you, and one guy calls it pass interference. Another guys says, “That’s football.” I’m talking the officials. So as a player, I have to figure out, “Which guy are you? What can I get away with? It’s not black and white.” Bishop: There are bigger, stronger, faster athletes, but I just don’t think they’re disciplined. I don’t think they’re coached up. I just think it’s just a game of great athletes out there running around now, who really don’t study and care about the game. It’s all for the money. There was a passion there that I had, that most guys had in my era that just loved the game. They probably would have played for free. I probably would have. And today’s new millennial athlete, it just doesn’t work that way. They learn everything on video and everything else. It’s kind of like certain things you assume that they know, little nuances of the game, they really don’t know. Golic: I hate the fact that nowadays, the collective bargaining agreement basically said you can only have so many days of full contact practices. And we went in for 3 ½ weeks and it was all, until people were falling down, we would go full pads, full contact all the time. Of course, that’s just bitterness and envy jumping out of me now. The focus on controlling the violence. They tell you how to hit, where to hit. I understand some of the things like no spearing. We weren’t allowed to do that back in the time either. But now every time you come near a quarterback, if your hand even touches his helmet, they’re hitting you with a penalty. O’Hara: I think one of the challenges that is tough now is you can get in trouble without ever getting out of bed. With social media now, with your phones and everything you have now, everybody has access to you. As a player it’s so hard right now to not be distracted, because distractions are coming at you from every angle. That to me is probably the toughest things the players and teams are facing. There’s not a lot that’s sacred. You used to go in the locker room and it’s like, “What is said (in here) stays in here.” Now, you never know. Everybody’s a reporter. Everything is out there. So that’s a challenge. I think the other thing too is it’s a different game now. One of the things I liked about the old school football players is that they genuinely disliked each other. It made for good theater. Now everybody is buddies, all friends on everything, and the jersey swap after the game has kind of become the big thing. You kind of lose that animosity that made game day great. USA TODAY Super Bowl 2017 odds: Latest on spread movement, MVP bets USA TODAY Fifteen years ago, the Patriots were the dynasty no one saw coming What is one rule change you’d like to see? Wayne: I’d make a lot of them. Targeting to the head. I mean obviously, that’s tough. They can try and launch and try to hit you in the chest area but I know as a receiver, I know when you’re there, I’m gonna duck. And all of a sudden you hit me in my head. I get it. It’s a tough sport and we know the history of concussions and all that stuff. (Expletive), that’s what we signed up for. Bishop: I’m trying to figure out which one I want to go with. Being a defensive back, that pass interference is not a spot foul. It should just be a 15-yard penalty. … The reason why I say that now is because if you barely touch a guy – back in the day, you could touch a guy down the field, and when I was playing you could have a little bit of contact and still not call pass interference. Some guy can run in the back of you, you can be looking at the ball and everything and they could still call pass interference. You’ve got to be looking at the ball. OK, well, I’m looking at the ball and I cut his path off. I have the right to the ball just as much as he does, but the way the rules are set up, now is everything’s for the offense because they want more points. But I don’t think that now justifies having a spot foul. Because you can just throw the ball up and a guy can get contact easily, to me, and you can call that pass interference. Another rule that I wish we’d change – I want the referees to be able to pass an obstacle course, physicals and times to justify, because I think they’re getting the wrong angles and not being in the right positions because I don’t think they’re in shape enough to actually be in the right position to make an appropriate call. Golic: Nobody can hit the nose tackle. Nobody over 200 pounds. Centers must be the size of kickers. That’d be a good one. O’Hara: If I could change one thing I’d move the Pro Bowl back to Hawaii and I’d make it after the Super Bowl. I think the whole spirit of the Pro Bowl was a reward for the players, a reward for a great season. And to not have some of the best players in the Pro Bowl because they’re playing the Super Bowl, to me, is wrong. If you got 5-7 guys who make the Pro Bowl, and to go to the Super Bowl and win it, and you go to the Pro Bowl after you just won the Super Bowl, it’s probably the best week ever. To not have that is just a shame. And if people wanted to make it more competitive, I wouldn’t pay the losing team. You wanna see guys play hard in the fourth quarter, if you know you have to cut a check for all the flights and hotels? Robinson: We do have a lot rules. I get it, it’s all about protection. With the advent of spread offenses and how that’s starting to infiltrate our game – and it’s all on the college level, it all starts with job security there with coaches because they have to win now and score points. At the end of the day we’re hurting quarterbacks, the most important position. When I was playing flag, especially in my younger days, as the quarterback I had to go into a huddle, had to look every man in the eye, and tell him the play. They don’t do that anymore. Some quarterbacks never had to. If I had to change something, and I have some stuff I’m going to be talking to the NFL about, they need to go and reinvest back into the kid, back into the community, and I think that’ll help this whole dynamic.

Haynes: Yes, I would. Because I know a lot about them. One of the things is if I had a concussion, I would not continue to play. I would wait until I was able to play with doctor’s approval or whatever. Back in my era, I didn’t know that I shouldn’t have been playing, and I think in a lot of ways I got fortunate because my cognition was affected or my vision was affected and I couldn’t play anyway. I couldn’t play. But when I found out a headache was a symptom of a concussion, then I realized I needed more information. I didn’t have that. It was obvious I couldn’t play with those two issues, but a headache as a symptom? Maybe I played a lot of plays where I shouldn’t have played. So that would be a concern of mine and I would want to try to figure out a way to know if I had a concussion or not. Bishop: I was so passionate about football I probably would. But I wish I would have known what I know now. That’s probably why my son doesn’t play. He told me no. He played for a couple years. Was pretty good, too. He played sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade. … He’s his own person. Golic: Yeah. I played the game because I loved playing football. My dad played when he was in the Marines, Camp Lejeune. He was on their football team. Went to Indiana University for a year, played there. Went up to Canada, played seven years in the CFL. And I used to, as a young kid, he’d take me down to the park, set me on the field and he’s just go running, getting himself in shape. And I used to watch, and I don’t know, maybe I was trying to fulfill a dream of being like my dad. But we would watch football together, and when I got a chance to play it, I took it. Robinson: Absolutely. It’s afforded my family a different life. I was of the generation that was a little bit more informed than my predecessors, the people that came before me. When I started playing this game I knew that there was a big risk that it may take five, 10 years off my life. I knew there was a big risk that I may be walking a little funny one day. But I wouldn’t change my journey, I wouldn’t change the things that I’ve learned. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Patriots, Falcons practice for Super Bowl LI  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) 292 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE HOUSTON – Radio row in the days leading up to Super Bowl LI, like always, has featured a who’s who of football stars from the past and present. USA TODAY Sports surveyed six former players from various eras to learn what they like and don’t like about today’s game, a rule they’d want to change and whether they’d play now, knowing more about health issues. They are all Pro Bowlers. Four are Super Bowl champs. One is Hall of Famer. The group was split evenly between offense and defense. The panel included: Blaine Bishop: Former Oilers, Titans and Eagles safety, 1993-2002; Bob Golic: Former Patriots, Browns and Raiders defensive tackle, 1979-92; Mike Haynes: Hall of Famer, former Patriots and Raiders cornerback, 1976-89; Shaun O’Hara: Former Browns and Giants guard/center, 2000-10; Michael Robinson: Former 49ers and Seahawks fullback, 2006-13; Reggie Wayne: Former Colts wide receiver, 2001-14. USA TODAY How much longer can Tom Brady, Bill Belichick go? USA TODAY Legacy lost: Should Titans return ‘Oilers’ to Houston, site of Super Bowl LI? What do you love about today’s game? Haynes: It’s action-packed. A lot of passes, a lot of big plays. I like that. I think that’s really great. I also love that it’s a safer game, and they’re working really hard to make it safer. Bishop: The team camaraderie that you build, kind of like a brotherhood. Everybody has a role and you have the sacrifice. We were all great players in college. But you have to relish your role and have you’re guys’ back and do your job. Really, that equates to being a professional. That’s never changed. It’s an attribute that you actually can’t teach unless you play, and I’m not going to say football, but sports in general. Golic: That people are still playing football. That it’s still the game, to a certain extent, the game that we loved back in the day. It’s obviously changed a little bit with the hitting and some of the rules. O’Hara: It allows players to have fun. There’s times where you see things on social media where you say, “Wow, that’s great. That’s great you got to share that cause.” There’s so many great things that go on that were left uncovered or unsaid or people didn’t see (when I played). Robinson: The competition. Love the competition. Love the soft skills that football teaches you. I played quarterback (for a while up until college). To be able to look every man in the eye and have them believe in you? That’s a skill. Stuff that you learn in the classroom and be able to go out there and perform it? That’s a skill. To be able take the philosophy from your coach and be able to pump it and inject it into a locker room? That’s a skill. That’s what I love most about this game.

Wayne: It’s kinda leaning towards the flag football side. It’s getting a little softer, man. Even though I was a receiver and played on offense, I look at some of the calls today and I’m like, “That’s defenseless?” (The defense) is at a disadvantage. They really are. You don’t know how to hit a guy these days, you know what I mean? As a receiver, you’re like, “Thanks?” You look at a lot of these receivers now, they’ll probably play a long time, as long as they can take care of (their) body. It’s to the point now where I feel like a lot of these careers (of the receivers) will be extended. Haynes: Some of the things I dislike are also some of the things I like, you know? The officiating, it’s not 100%. And I think that’s what makes the game also a good game. I hit you, and one guy calls it pass interference. Another guys says, “That’s football.” I’m talking the officials. So as a player, I have to figure out, “Which guy are you? What can I get away with? It’s not black and white.” Bishop: There are bigger, stronger, faster athletes, but I just don’t think they’re disciplined. I don’t think they’re coached up. I just think it’s just a game of great athletes out there running around now, who really don’t study and care about the game. It’s all for the money. There was a passion there that I had, that most guys had in my era that just loved the game. They probably would have played for free. I probably would have. And today’s new millennial athlete, it just doesn’t work that way. They learn everything on video and everything else. It’s kind of like certain things you assume that they know, little nuances of the game, they really don’t know. Golic: I hate the fact that nowadays, the collective bargaining agreement basically said you can only have so many days of full contact practices. And we went in for 3 ½ weeks and it was all, until people were falling down, we would go full pads, full contact all the time. Of course, that’s just bitterness and envy jumping out of me now. The focus on controlling the violence. They tell you how to hit, where to hit. I understand some of the things like no spearing. We weren’t allowed to do that back in the time either. But now every time you come near a quarterback, if your hand even touches his helmet, they’re hitting you with a penalty. O’Hara: I think one of the challenges that is tough now is you can get in trouble without ever getting out of bed. With social media now, with your phones and everything you have now, everybody has access to you. As a player it’s so hard right now to not be distracted, because distractions are coming at you from every angle. That to me is probably the toughest things the players and teams are facing. There’s not a lot that’s sacred. You used to go in the locker room and it’s like, “What is said (in here) stays in here.” Now, you never know. Everybody’s a reporter. Everything is out there. So that’s a challenge. I think the other thing too is it’s a different game now. One of the things I liked about the old school football players is that they genuinely disliked each other. It made for good theater. Now everybody is buddies, all friends on everything, and the jersey swap after the game has kind of become the big thing. You kind of lose that animosity that made game day great. USA TODAY Super Bowl 2017 odds: Latest on spread movement, MVP bets USA TODAY Fifteen years ago, the Patriots were the dynasty no one saw coming What is one rule change you’d like to see? Wayne: I’d make a lot of them. Targeting to the head. I mean obviously, that’s tough. They can try and launch and try to hit you in the chest area but I know as a receiver, I know when you’re there, I’m gonna duck. And all of a sudden you hit me in my head. I get it. It’s a tough sport and we know the history of concussions and all that stuff. (Expletive), that’s what we signed up for. Bishop: I’m trying to figure out which one I want to go with. Being a defensive back, that pass interference is not a spot foul. It should just be a 15-yard penalty. … The reason why I say that now is because if you barely touch a guy – back in the day, you could touch a guy down the field, and when I was playing you could have a little bit of contact and still not call pass interference. Some guy can run in the back of you, you can be looking at the ball and everything and they could still call pass interference. You’ve got to be looking at the ball. OK, well, I’m looking at the ball and I cut his path off. I have the right to the ball just as much as he does, but the way the rules are set up, now is everything’s for the offense because they want more points. But I don’t think that now justifies having a spot foul. Because you can just throw the ball up and a guy can get contact easily, to me, and you can call that pass interference. Another rule that I wish we’d change – I want the referees to be able to pass an obstacle course, physicals and times to justify, because I think they’re getting the wrong angles and not being in the right positions because I don’t think they’re in shape enough to actually be in the right position to make an appropriate call. Golic: Nobody can hit the nose tackle. Nobody over 200 pounds. Centers must be the size of kickers. That’d be a good one. O’Hara: If I could change one thing I’d move the Pro Bowl back to Hawaii and I’d make it after the Super Bowl. I think the whole spirit of the Pro Bowl was a reward for the players, a reward for a great season. And to not have some of the best players in the Pro Bowl because they’re playing the Super Bowl, to me, is wrong. If you got 5-7 guys who make the Pro Bowl, and to go to the Super Bowl and win it, and you go to the Pro Bowl after you just won the Super Bowl, it’s probably the best week ever. To not have that is just a shame. And if people wanted to make it more competitive, I wouldn’t pay the losing team. You wanna see guys play hard in the fourth quarter, if you know you have to cut a check for all the flights and hotels? Robinson: We do have a lot rules. I get it, it’s all about protection. With the advent of spread offenses and how that’s starting to infiltrate our game – and it’s all on the college level, it all starts with job security there with coaches because they have to win now and score points. At the end of the day we’re hurting quarterbacks, the most important position. When I was playing flag, especially in my younger days, as the quarterback I had to go into a huddle, had to look every man in the eye, and tell him the play. They don’t do that anymore. Some quarterbacks never had to. If I had to change something, and I have some stuff I’m going to be talking to the NFL about, they need to go and reinvest back into the kid, back into the community, and I think that’ll help this whole dynamic.

Haynes: Yes, I would. Because I know a lot about them. One of the things is if I had a concussion, I would not continue to play. I would wait until I was able to play with doctor’s approval or whatever. Back in my era, I didn’t know that I shouldn’t have been playing, and I think in a lot of ways I got fortunate because my cognition was affected or my vision was affected and I couldn’t play anyway. I couldn’t play. But when I found out a headache was a symptom of a concussion, then I realized I needed more information. I didn’t have that. It was obvious I couldn’t play with those two issues, but a headache as a symptom? Maybe I played a lot of plays where I shouldn’t have played. So that would be a concern of mine and I would want to try to figure out a way to know if I had a concussion or not. Bishop: I was so passionate about football I probably would. But I wish I would have known what I know now. That’s probably why my son doesn’t play. He told me no. He played for a couple years. Was pretty good, too. He played sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade. … He’s his own person. Golic: Yeah. I played the game because I loved playing football. My dad played when he was in the Marines, Camp Lejeune. He was on their football team. Went to Indiana University for a year, played there. Went up to Canada, played seven years in the CFL. And I used to, as a young kid, he’d take me down to the park, set me on the field and he’s just go running, getting himself in shape. And I used to watch, and I don’t know, maybe I was trying to fulfill a dream of being like my dad. But we would watch football together, and when I got a chance to play it, I took it. Robinson: Absolutely. It’s afforded my family a different life. I was of the generation that was a little bit more informed than my predecessors, the people that came before me. When I started playing this game I knew that there was a big risk that it may take five, 10 years off my life. I knew there was a big risk that I may be walking a little funny one day. But I wouldn’t change my journey, I wouldn’t change the things that I’ve learned. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Patriots, Falcons practice for Super Bowl LI  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The idea is that purchasing a Surface Pro 4 or any of the devices that resembles it means you don’t have to purchase both a notebook and a tablet. Since Microsoft announced its first tablet that can be a notebook, all we’ve heard about are those types of 2-in-1s. We’ve all ignored another benefit of purchasing a Surface Pro 4. Advertisement The Surface Pro 4 doesn’t just make a great  tablet and notebook. It also makes a pretty great Windows 10 desktop PC. As a Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4 user, I’ve spent some time with the form factor at my desk. The way I see it, there are couple of different scenarios to get Surface Pro 4 users the best desktop experience. Pick The Right Surface Pro 4 Desktops are powerful, bulky beasts. They’re big because transporting them isn’t really that much of a concern. The Surface Pro 4 is a mobile powerhouse, a machine that was designed to be portable. At first, one might assume that it wouldn’t be that great at doing the things that desktops do: playing video games and editing video. Read: Which Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Should You Buy? Advertisement That’s absolutely true of the entry-level Surface Pro 4 for $899. It’s not really great at playing the latest games at all since it doesn’t have a fan and uses less powerful internals. The Surface Pro 4s with Intel Core i7 and Intel Core i5 processors are better at those activities. Any Surface Pro 4 plan that involves the device doubling as a powerful desktop Windows 10 PC starts with those two models. The Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 Processor and 4GB of RAM starts at $999. If you really want the best performance possible, investigate purchasing a Surface Pro 4 with at least 8GB of RAM. The Microsoft Store sells all versions of the Surface Pro 4, including a model with 16GB of storage. Buy a Surface Pro 4 Dock Once you’ve acquired a Surface Pro 4, you need a way to charge the device and connect to accessories. Microsoft makes two docks for this task, both of which have advantages and disadvantages. The Surface Pro 3 Docking Station is a typical dock. There are no cables to connect. Instead, its two arms encapsulate the Surface Pro 4, on three sides. Built into it are three USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, Ethernet out and a Mini DisplayPort. The Surface Pro 4 Dock isn’t built specifically for the Surface Pro 4, which is why users need a free spacer from Microsoft to enjoy the $199 accessory. Advertisement The Microsoft Surface Dock is this year’s docking option for the Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro 3 and Surface Book. It too costs $199. There are two front-facing USB 3.0 ports, a power port, Gigabit Ethernet, two more USB 3.0 ports and 2 Mini DisplayPorts on its rear. With this dock, you need to physically plug in a cable, but just the one. The dock itself does the rest. Other companies make compatible port replicators, but in those cases you’d need to plug your Surface Pro 4 into a charger, then have a separate USB cable running from the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft’s solutions are expensive, but simplistic. Use A Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse The next thing you’ll need are the typical accessories that desktops require. The Surface Pro 4 has two pretty loud speakers, but don’t hesitate to pick up external speakers if you feel like you need to. The Surface Pro 4 and Windows 10 support Bluetooth audio profiles. The docks and device itself all have 3.5mm headphone ports built-in. Bluetooth headphones work too, that’s what I use at my desk when playing music late at night and early in the day. Advertisement Microsoft used to make a Bluetooth keyboard accessory for its Type Covers. It’s long since killed that device, betting that users would rather purchase separate keyboards and mice that offer better battery life and bigger keys. For the best results, go with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Microsoft makes the, entry-level Wireless Keyboard 850 for Bluetooth users. I personally use the Wedge Wireless Mobile Keyboard. It’s $79.95 – not cheap – but does have a thin profile. For a mouse, I recommend the $69.95 Surface Arc Mouse because it becomes very portable when you need it to be. That being said, anything you have around the house works fine too. You can go with USB mice and keyboards, but if you do you’ll need a USB hub or a Surface Dock. Remember, the Surface Pro 4 only has a single USB port.   Advertisement I actually skipped the mini adapters, displays and docks in the early days. Instead, I purchased a Surface Pro Power Supply for $79.99 and a tablet stand that held up my Surface Pro 4. This method does hinder viewing angles somewhat, but it’s cost effective and keeps me from being surrounded by screens and accessories I don’t need. The stand I purchased from Amazon is long gone, but there are more available from other makers. Disable Tablet Mode Finally, remember to set your device to either ask you before switching in and out of Tablet Mode or turn off switching entirely. Read: How to Use Tablet Mode in Windows 10 Windows 10 is able to detect physical keyboards and make the switch, but not with Bluetooth accessories. My solution to this has been to manually toggle Tablet Mode on and off when I’m done with work using the Action Center. The Action Center is always a left swipe from the right edge of your display. Optional: Get a Monitor, Maybe With Touch On its own, your Surface Pro 4 is a great all-in-one PC in its own right. At least, it is if you’re comfortable with using a 12-inch display. If you aren’t, consider adding a widescreen monitor to your desktop setup to get more screen real estate. Which display you get really does depend on your tastes as a user. Some people like to get large monitors, then hide the Surface Pro 4 somewhere in their setup because they don’t need to monitors. Others prefer to keep the Surface Pro 4 and external monitor sitting side by side. If you’re going to hide the Surface somewhere in your setup, like a desk drawer, be sure that it has plenty of ventilation. Be sure that whatever monitor you do go with has matching connections for whatever dock you use too. Stay away from any monitor that has a VGA cable. For consistency, it might be better to with a monitor that supports touch. The Surface Pro 4 can be connected to a monitor even without a docking accessory. For this you will need a MiniDisplay Port adapter for whatever plug the display features. Microsoft makes a line of Surface Mini DisplayPort Adapters and a Wireless Display Adapter. Two monitors connect through the Surface Dock, but you can add a third running straight from the Surface pro 4’s body too. Microsoft frequently runs specials on Surface Docks and monitors at the Microsoft Store. Read: The Best Surface Pro 4 Deals Available The Surface Pro 4 gained a reputation for being a great tablet and a decent notebook. I’d make the argument that it’s also a terrific Windows 10 all-in-one with the right accessories. 15 Responses 02/13/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I understood that the pro 4 could handle 3 external monitors – 2 from the dock and 1 from the tablet. You say it is restricted to 2 monitors. Will it not handle a third monitor from the tablet’s mini DP port? 02/29/2016 Leander Reply Yeah it does, 2 monitors from the docking station. One from the surface it self. So 3 screens at the same time. I got the configuration running at this very moment. Two normal monitor’s and big presentation screen. 02/29/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply Thanks. I’m going to give the SP4 i7 16gb a try with three 27″ monitors. 03/05/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I bought the SP4 with dock and cables. Win 10 shows 4 displays, but will only use three, one of which is always the tablet. So I can get two of my three externals, but not three at once. Surface support told me I have to use a video hub to go to three. Is this what you have done? Or is a splitter enough? 03/22/2016 Matt Smith Reply What’s the recommended settings for the larger monitor, I’ve currently got it connected to another screen and the icons are massive and there’s black banding down the sides. 04/19/2016 Molly Hampel Reply This is a question not reply – i have a surface pro 4 with the docking station. The surface will go to sleep and when we wake it backup the external large monitor will not work. We thought it was the docking station but after trying two others it’s not. Any suggestions? Could the monitor not be compatible? 04/19/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I now run two ASUS 27″ monitors and the Surface tablet screen. The primary display is set as one of the 27″. When my Surface wakes up, the two large monitors also come alive – usually, but not always. Very occasionally, I have to go to display settings on the tablet screen and “extend the desktop” to the two large monitors. This does not happen often.

By: Hana Levi Julian Published: February 5th, 2017 Facebook Twitter Telegram Google Reddit LinkedIn Printer-Ready Page Layout Intel booth at the Jerusalem Geek Picnic on Passover week 2016 Photo Credit: Facebook Israelis are often a part of the action no matter where in the world it happens. But, the Super Bowl? Yes. “For the first time during an NFL broadcast, Intel technology is enabling viewers to “Be the Player,” allowing them to experience plays from the player’s point of view and fully immerse themselves in the action of the game,” Intel Corp. announced on Sunday, hours before the big game. “Through its partnerships with leading sports leagues, teams and athletic brands, Intel is driving the next wave of powerful technologies that will transform the sports experience for the next generation of fans, athletes and coaches.” Actually, the brainchild came from an Israeli Tel Aviv startup called Replay Technologies. Intel snapped it up last March for a cool $175 million, just in time to slide it into place for this year’s Super Bowl extravaganza. Fox Sports has teamed with Intel on its use of the new technology, which allows viewers to see what any player on the field is seeing. It shows up at home like a video game, according to Fox Sports’ SVP of field and technical operations, Michael Davies, who says it allows the viewer at home to analyze the choices that were open to the player. The software uses an array of cameras that encircle the stadium and replay it at various angles, in “3D space.” Hana Levi Julian About the Author: Hana Levi Julian is a Middle East news analyst with a degree in Mass Communication and Journalism from Southern Connecticut State University.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 5, 2017 at 10:35AM In April 2016, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that it would be implementing a restructuring program that it internally referred to as "ACT" -- short for "accelerating change and transformation." It was designed to reduce the company's annual operating expense run rate by $1.4 billion by mid-2017. A wafer of Intel processors. Image source: Intel. It would seem, though, that the company's spending on both research and development (R&D) and marketing, general, and administrative costs (MG&A) continues unabated. This was evident in the company's fourth quarter financial results, in which the company reported shelling out $3.28 billion in R&D expenses -- up almost 5.2% year over year. Meanwhile, MG&A spending was up a smidgen year over year, going from $2.12 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $2.16 billion the following year -- a modest increase but an increase nonetheless. For full-year 2016, Intel's R&D spending hit $12.74 billion, up from $12.13 billion in the year prior. MG&A climbed to $8.4 billion, up from $7.93 billion in 2015. Not quite cutting back in 2017 Looking ahead for this year, Intel says it plans for combined R&D and MG&A spending of $20.5 billion -- a roughly $600 million reduction from the levels seen in 2016. However, considering the company's spending was up by $1 billion in 2016 relative to 2015 levels, and considering that part of that reduction will come from the company's spin-out of its Intel Security (a.k.a. McAfee) business, the net spending reduction doesn't seem very substantial. Intel has made it clear what's going on: It's taking the money it saved in the restructuring efforts and plowing them into new growth areas, such as self-driving cars and memory technologies. That's fine, but it shouldn't stop investors from asking some tough questions Intel has increased its R&D substantially since 2011, but where's the return? In 2011, Intel spent $8.35 billion in R&D and $7.67 billion on MG&A. To be fair, the MG&A figure isn't up that much over the years -- Intel's product offerings have broadened and salaries naturally rise over time, so an 8.9% increase in MG&A spending over five years seems quite reasonable. R&D, on the other hand, is up almost 53% in that time. Yes, developing new products is expensive, and yes, Intel is investing in building products for markets that it didn't participate in, or that simply didn't exist, back in 2011. However, Intel's R&D spending has rocketed upward, and consolidated revenue simply hasn't followed suit. Now, one could reasonably argue that Intel's revenue mix has shifted as the personal-computer market has declined, and the company has successfully capitalized on new growth areas, including data centers and the Internet of Things. I'll accept that. Nevertheless, cracks in the armor have appeared even as the company spends more on R&D. For example, Intel's execution with respect to chip manufacturing technology seems to have deteriorated over the past five years -- 14 nanometers was problematic, and 10 nanometers is very late. Although Intel's business performance in its data center group (DCG) -- arguably the business that the company has bet its future on -- has been as strong as could be expected, as Intel has nearly 100% of the server processor market, the company has seen numerous product delays over the past five years. And though it's not that big of a deal, DCG's financial performance was hurt last quarter over a product warranty issue. I would think that with a far bigger R&D budget available, Intel's execution here would be a bit sharper than it seems to be, though it's still very good.  The true litmus test Intel isn't expecting much growth in 2017. It guided to "low-single-digit" revenue growth excluding McAfee for the year. But at some point, it would be nice to see Intel's growth accelerate as a result of all these large investments. Perhaps a potential litmus test for whether this spending is paying off will be the company's financial performance in 2018. If the company can accelerate growth compared with what it ultimately sees in 2017, then that'll be an indication that these investments have been worth it. However, if growth remains anemic in 2018 and potentially beyond, then it might be a sign that the company just isn't investing wisely. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ARVR Will the Patriots’ VR training help them win the Super Bowl? David Z. Morris, Fortune February 5, 2017 3:34 AM Tags: 360 Replay, football, Intel, NFL, Strivr, Super Bowl, Tom Brady Above: The New England Patriots, who face the Atlanta Falcons in today's Super Bowl, are one of six teams now using a VR training system designed by Palo Alto startup StriVR. Image Credit: Shutterstock When Super Bowl 51 (pardon me, “LI”) hits TV screens nationwide, Fox viewers will be treated to unique, immersive glimpses from the field, using Intel’s 360 Replay virtual camera. But even more intriguing is what’s happening behind the scenes—more and more teams, including Super Bowl contenders the New England Patriots, are convinced that virtual reality will change the way players prepare for the big game. The Patriots, who face the Atlanta Falcons, are one of six teams now using a VR training system designed by Palo Alto startup StriVR. Others include the Dallas Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, and Arizona Cardinals. The system, inspired by work done at Stanford’s VR lab, uses 360-degree video to put players—primarily quarterbacks—through their paces, with less physical risk and wear-and-tear than on-field practice, and more interactivity than just watching game video. The Pats were early adopters, becoming the third team to sign up with StriVR back in mid-2015. No word on whether Patriots QB Tom Brady has trained using the tech—though he is featured in a Super Bowl ad for the Intel 360 video system. But another legendary quarterback has cosigned the idea in a big way. At the Consumer Electronics Showcase in January, hall of famer Joe Montana said he wished he’d had VR in his heyday, emphasizing that mental preparation is the largest part of quarterbacking. That’s one big reason the StriVR system uses 360-degree video of plays, often shot during team practices, instead of 3D graphics. It’s closer to an immersive film than a fully interactive simulation, but as Fortune reported when we first checked in on StriVR in 2015, research shows that seeing real humans in action helps the brain refine its timing and stay focused. And because football is based on coordinated plays with fixed timing (at least in theory), rote repetition helps program players’ muscle memory. There’s an intriguing further possibility here. Intel’s 360 video system allows a ‘virtual’ camera to recreate a first-person perspective by compiling film shot from a variety of outside angles. If teams could get access to the full feed of game cameras, they could give QBs virtual run-throughs of past real games, even if there was nobody on the field wearing a 360 camera. According to Recode, StriVR has expanded its list of NFL clients to six. It has also started building experiences for fans, including a Boston Red Sox VR project, and a hockey ‘goalie simulator’ that lets LA Kings fans practice blocking pucks. Be the #LAKings goalie with our VR Experience at tonight's game outside of Section 105! pic.twitter.com/DUlNFj4U1a — #LAKings (@LAKings) January 19, 2017 Of course, there’s a vague dystopian edge to all this. If quarterbacks are training in VR, and fans are watching the game in immersive 360 video, does the actual action on the field get lost in the virtual shuffle? But the transition of spectatorship to television has already irrevocably changed how we experience sports—if anything, VR is most people’s best chance to reconnect with games that cost hundreds of dollars to attend in person. And the game could benefit immensely if VR training fulfills its promise, giving players more insight and, at least as important, longer careers. For a strange and promising parallel, just look at the world of chess, where computer training has raised the bar for human players. And if you’re really worried about technology creeping into your Sunday ritual, here’s one big reassurance: it’ll be a while before a robot can throw deep on the run.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 February 2017 by Military News Top Tech Stocks to Buy in 2017 Whether investors are in search of growth and income, value, or long-term appreciation, the tech sector has sound alternatives. The digitization of the world around us, including the Internet of Things, the cloud, and multiple touch points driving an unprecedented amount of data has resulted in market opportunities with nearly unlimited potential. The solutions needed to take advantage of the fast-changing tech marketplace include comprehensive data analytics from the likes of IBM (NYSE: IBM) and powering cloud data centers, a market dominated by underappreciated Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) . The cloud is also home to Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE) , which has transformed it into a financially rock-solid business with skyrocketing recurring revenue. Image source: IBM. Growth and income on sale It may seem counterintuitive to include IBM on a list of top stocks, given that its stock has skyrocketed 40% the past year. But don’t dismiss IBM. As CEO Ginni Rometty undertook the arduous task of transitioning away from legacy enterprise hardware, IBM’s stock had languished for years. The result is that even after its share price jump, IBM remains a top tech stock in 2017 for a couple of reasons. One, IBM is still ridiculously cheap based on earnings expectations. And two, IBM can attribute its stellar performance to delivering on its “strategic imperatives.” Last fiscal year, IBM generated $32.8 billion in combined strategic imperatives sales, equal to 41% of its $79.9 billion in total revenue. That was a goal Rometty had targeted for next year, but IBM is hitting on all cylinders where it counts. Yet it’s still trading at a mere 12 times forward earnings. And boasting one of the tech industry’s best dividends of 3.2% makes IBM a growth and income investor’s must-have stock. Image source: Adobe Systems. An unlikely cloud leader It was about four years ago that Adobe CEO Shantanu  Narayen got serious about his intention to shift to a recurring revenue model with the introduction of its Creative Cloud. Fast-forward to last quarter’s and year’s earnings report, and it’s become clear Adobe’s shift to a sustainable, relatively reliable source of revenue is working like a charm. Of 2016’s record sales of $5.85 billion — a 22% jump over the prior year — $4.01 billion of was generated from its Digital Media unit’s annual  recurring revenue (ARR) model, equal to nearly 69%. Leading the way in the fourth quarter was Adobe creative cloud’s 33% increase in ARR to $866 million. Adobe’s Marketing Cloud fared well, too, climbing 32% in the fourth quarter to $465 million. The good news for growth investors is Adobe is hardly resting on its laurels. Adobe has recently unveiled a voice-activated speech and image editing tool, as well as working on incorporating both virtual reality and augmented reality into its solution. Considering it’s sitting on a record $2 billion in deferred revenue, Adobe is primed for yet another stellar year. Image source: Intel. Still underappreciated Based on its stock price, Intel didn’t impress many last quarter. After reporting an all-time revenue high of $59.4 billion annually and $16.4 billion in the quarter, Intel’s share price hasn’t budged from pre-earnings levels. Intel handily beat analyst estimates for both quarterly revenue and earnings per share, excluding one-time items. Pundits had expected  EPS of $0.74 and sales of $15.7 billion. Similar to IBM, Intel is in the midst of a transition, with an eye toward burgeoning new markets, including IoT, cloud data centers, and security, among others. How is the transition coming along? Intel ended 2016’s fourth quarter with IoT sales climbing 16% to $766 million, data center revenue jumping 8% to $4.7 billion, and security-related revenue of $550 million representing a 7% year-over-year increase. Much of Intel’s 10% increase in revenue last quarter fell to the bottom line, thanks to managing operating expenses effectively. Intel is growing the revenue drivers that will determine its future, and it’s trading at just 12.5 times forward earnings.

Intel's VP Datacenter Group and GM for AI solutions, Naveen Rao explains: "We have developed the Nervana hardware especially with regard to deep learning workloads. In this area, two operations are often used: matrix multiplication and convolution".   The next generation Lake Crest CPU will operate as a Xeon co-processor, but is designed to increase AI workloads in a big way thanks to Intel's new "Flexpoint" architecture, which will be used inside the arithmetic nodes of the new Lake Crest CPU. Intel's new super-power can increase arithmetic operations on the Lake Crest CPU by up to 10x, as well as offering MCM (Multi Chip Module) design.     Better yet, it will have 32GB of HBM2 available, with a huge 8Tbps of memory bandwidth across the entire CPU.     Intel will be using "proprietary inter-chip links" which the company says are "up to 20x faster than PCIe".   Diane Bryant, Executive Vice President and GM of the Data Center Group at Intel explains: " We expect the Intel Nervana platform to produce breakthrough performance and dramatic reductions in the time to train complex neural networks. Before the end of the decade, Intel will deliver a 100-fold increase in performance that will turbocharge the pace of innovation in the emerging deep learning space".

While AMD has made brilliant technological strides over the years, it has never gained lasting competitive advantage over its rival. But that could soon change, thanks to a new executive team led by CEO Lisa Su, 47, who joined the company in 2012 and took the helm in October 2014. “AMD has, in the past, suffered from a lack of execution and a lack of focus,” says Linley Gwennap, head of the Linley Group, a tech research...

Join For Free Operating costs are a concern for all building managers, whether they’re in charge of an office or a factory. LED lights can help — and when those lights connect to the internet of things (IoT), they can deliver still more benefits. Intelligent lighting can make energy adjustments automatically, using sensors to decide when to light up a room — or to turn down the air conditioning. And that’s not all. Intelligent lighting can have surprising benefits. It can improve indoor air quality, tighten facility security, and even help factories run more efficiently. Lights That See and Hear Intelligent lighting combines LEDs, sensors, and wireless networks with building automation software. Pulling these technologies together takes a team effort. Consider the approach taken by Current, a smart energy startup within GE. By combining GE’s lighting knowledge with Intel’s sensor-processing expertise, Current created a full-fledged lighting solution that is as efficient to deploy as it is to operate. In commercial buildings, Current’s lights can detect ambient temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels. They can determine whether a room is full of people, has a just a few occupants or is empty. Together these measurements provide the information needed to adjust temperature and lighting automatically. Plus, intelligent lights can integrate with conference room scheduling systems to simplify planning and keep energy bills low. Intelligent lights can “see” a building and its grounds using cameras and motion detectors and “hear” what’s going on with sound sensors. In many cases, the sensors can eliminate the need for single-purpose security cameras and motion detectors, helping cut capital expenditure (because less equipment is needed) and operational expenditure (because there are fewer systems to maintain). If a window breaks or someone yells for help, those lights can alert owners, police or firefighters. Over time, property managers might spot trends to help with long-range planning and predictive maintenance. The benefits can be massive. GE used the technology at a manufacturing facility to achieve a 24 percent reduction in energy use and a boost in productivity worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. How Intelligent Lighting Works Setting up Current’s lighting can be surprisingly easy. The lights connect to a local controller through a wireless ZigBee network, which in turn connects to a server either on the premises or in the cloud. From there, data can be sliced and diced in any number of ways. Controller dashboards can display information as granular as a burnt-out light bulb or as broad as the annual cost of heating 500 offices. “Companies can take terabytes of data from all of their branches and quickly evaluate it,” said Samuel Grebe, director of strategic accounts, commercial and hospitality at Current. Secure in The Middle, Open on the Ends Current’s platform has an open architecture, which means it can work with sensors and other hardware made by any manufacturer. Analysis can be done either in the cloud or on the local controller using powerful Intel processors to crunch data on-site. In either case, the analytics run on GE’s Predix platform. This secure platform lets third-party developers create custom apps that allow building managers to focus on the information most important to them. “We provide an open bottom, a secure middle and an open top, so companies aren’t restricted to using GE equipment or one kind of software,” Grebe said. More Efficient Factories Manufacturers, too, can use lighting to improve operations. At a plant run by GE Power in Greenville, South Carolina, GE and Intel are installing LED lights with embedded sensors. These lights will measure the temperature near a turbine assembly stand, where it’s critical for parts to be heated and cooled at a uniform rate. By tracking temperature with intelligent lighting, the factory expects to identify potential defects that could avoid rework — dodging weeks of possible downtime. Temperature information will be uploaded to the Predix cloud, which will use Intel technology to deliver readings in real time along various points of the turbine as parts are heated and cool down. Data will be visualized, letting the workers know if there is a potential defect. Other factories could find their own ways of using intelligent lighting. The built-in sensors could detect malfunctions or parts that are wearing down, benefiting both product quality and equipment maintenance. Or they could optimize air quality, enabling manufacturers to maintain safe conditions without running ventilation systems excessively. Make Intelligent Buildings a Reality The more building and factory managers use intelligent lights to collect information, the more insights they stand to gain. Though their needs may change, they will always have access to the latest and most detailed information to guide their decisions. When humble light fixtures are outfitted with sensors and connected to the cloud, they can unleash truly brilliant ideas for cities, buildings, and factories. Like This Article?

Tim Brugger (timbrugger) Feb 4, 2017 at 1:14PM Whether investors are in search of growth and income, value, or long-term appreciation, the tech sector has sound alternatives. The digitization of the world around us, including the Internet of Things, the cloud, and multiple touch points driving an unprecedented amount of data has resulted in market opportunities with nearly unlimited potential. The solutions needed to take advantage of the fast-changing tech marketplace include comprehensive data analytics from the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and powering cloud data centers, a market dominated by underappreciated Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The cloud is also home to Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), which has transformed it into a financially rock-solid business with skyrocketing recurring revenue. Image source: IBM. Growth and income on sale It may seem counterintuitive to include IBM on a list of top stocks, given that its stock has skyrocketed 40% the past year. But don't dismiss IBM. As CEO Ginni Rometty undertook the arduous task of transitioning away from legacy enterprise hardware, IBM's stock had languished for years. The result is that even after its share price jump, IBM remains a top tech stock in 2017 for a couple of reasons. One, IBM is still ridiculously cheap based on earnings expectations. And two, IBM can attribute its stellar performance to delivering on its "strategic imperatives." Last fiscal year, IBM generated $32.8 billion in combined strategic imperatives sales, equal to 41% of its $79.9 billion in total revenue. That was a goal Rometty had targeted for next year, but IBM is hitting on all cylinders where it counts. Yet it's still trading at a mere 12 times forward earnings. And boasting one of the tech industry's best dividends of 3.2% makes IBM a growth and income investor's must-have stock. Image source: Adobe Systems. An unlikely cloud leader It was about four years ago that Adobe CEO Shantanu  Narayen got serious about his intention to shift to a recurring revenue model with the introduction of its Creative Cloud. Fast-forward to last quarter's and year's earnings report, and it's become clear Adobe's shift to a sustainable, relatively reliable source of revenue is working like a charm. Of 2016's record sales of $5.85 billion -- a 22% jump over the prior year -- $4.01 billion of was generated from its Digital Media unit's annual  recurring revenue (ARR) model, equal to nearly 69%. Leading the way in the fourth quarter was Adobe creative cloud's 33% increase in ARR to $866 million. Adobe's Marketing Cloud fared well, too, climbing 32% in the fourth quarter to $465 million. The good news for growth investors is Adobe is hardly resting on its laurels. Adobe has recently unveiled a voice-activated speech and image editing tool, as well as working on incorporating both virtual reality and augmented reality into its solution. Considering it's sitting on a record $2 billion in deferred revenue, Adobe is primed for yet another stellar year. Image source: Intel. Still underappreciated Based on its stock price, Intel didn't impress many last quarter. After reporting an all-time revenue high of $59.4 billion annually and $16.4 billion in the quarter, Intel's share price hasn't budged from pre-earnings levels. Intel handily beat analyst estimates for both quarterly revenue and earnings per share, excluding one-time items. Pundits had expected  EPS of $0.74 and sales of $15.7 billion. Similar to IBM, Intel is in the midst of a transition, with an eye toward burgeoning new markets, including IoT, cloud data centers, and security, among others. How is the transition coming along? Intel ended 2016's fourth quarter with IoT sales climbing 16% to $766 million, data center revenue jumping 8% to $4.7 billion, and security-related revenue of $550 million representing a 7% year-over-year increase. Much of Intel's 10% increase in revenue last quarter fell to the bottom line, thanks to managing operating expenses effectively. Intel is growing the revenue drivers that will determine its future, and it's trading at just 12.5 times forward earnings. Its relative value, long-term prospects, and 2.8% dividend yield are why underappreciated Intel is worth a good, long look in 2017. Tim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

It’s all part of a virtuous cycle, according to Anil Nanduri, vice president in the new technology group and general manager of Intel’s unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The world’s biggest chip maker has moved beyond chips to focus on great outdoor experiences for users. And drones are a good market because they use a lot of technology, including Intel’s RealSense depth cameras, and they produce an enormous amount of data. That data keeps the servers in data centers humming, and that creates more demand for Intel’s processors. Nanduri is in charge of keeping that virtuous cycle going, and I talked with him about that, and more. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation. Above: Anil Nanduri, vice president in the New Technology Group and general manager of the UAV. Image Credit: Intel VentureBeat: How did you get into the drone field? Anil Nanduri: When we started with RealSense, we were working on PCs and tablets. We were trying to see how we could change the computing interface with gestures and other use cases. As we were exploring, we had two versions of RealSense cameras: one, the front-facing, was primarily for PC interaction, and then we had the world-facing, which we designed for tablets. That can see further away. The world-facing camera, which was depth-sensing, also had the ability to work outdoors. Then we said, “Wait a minute. This depth-sensing camera could be used in other fields besides PCs and tablets. How do we apply that?” The use cases around scanning for printing, or robotics for collision avoidance, or drones for collision avoidance — that’s what the ideation triggered. Where could we apply this beyond PCs? It was part of that exercise, looking at RealSense capabilities beyond PCs and tablets, that got me into drones. How do we apply this in a flying platform? If you recall, at CES 2015 we had two demos on stage. One was a media conferencing robot navigating using RealSense. The other was a drone with six RealSense cameras. VB: To step back a bit, what was the thinking around going into drones at all? Intel is historically an ingredient-maker, a chip maker. This is making this whole dish. You guys don’t make that move in every case where your chips are used. Nanduri: We’re part of Intel’s New Technology Group. This was formed to scope out new opportunities and new markets and different ways we could operate within that domain. We’re not held to any kind of engagement model where we only have to do ingredients. We have that ability to innovate. When it came to drones, we started with the RealSense technology. We worked with Yuneec in the consumer industry and got RealSense collision avoidance in the Typhoon H drone, which is more of a pro-sumer standpoint. We made some acquisitions as well — Ascending Technologies, and later MAVinci. What we realized is that we own some amazing technology now, including full commercial-grade systems. These had very high redundancies built into them, very accurate, high-precision systems. For commercial applications, like construction inspection, where you need high accuracy reconstruction of your point of interest, these systems were deployed and widely used — not in the U.S., but in Europe and other markets. For enterprise use cases and commercial use cases, the capabilities that are needed come to be much more rigid. We said, “Hey, we have a good value proposition here. There’s great demand in this space. Why should we be encumbered by history?” This was a completely green field. VB: If you have a mastery of the technology already, it makes sense. Nanduri: Right. The other part of it, even though Intel’s model has been traditionally making ingredients — you know very well that we’ve done a lot of system development, even up to PCs. We develop a lot of capabilities. We just don’t productize them. We have the knowledge to build things end to end, so we took the extra step to brand it and sell it as well. That know-how, building end-to-end systems, is very instrumental in pushing the technology and innovation forward. Above: Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel Image Credit: Intel VB: Brian has mentioned this before, that these are not just things that use Intel’s chips. They’re also products that generate an enormous amount of data. Nanduri: Correct. That’s where it connects to our virtuous cycle. Each drone flight, depending on the payload you’re using and a rough map, each frame that you’re capturing with a high-resolution sensor or camera is about 25 megabytes. If you take 200 images, that’s five gigabytes. If you take 2,000 images, it’s 50 gigabytes. That’s one flight. These are the standard file sizes you deal with in the space. Then you have the processing behind it, applying tools and software that need a lot more compute. It clearly fits into our virtuous cycle, the next set of machines that are going to be generating huge amounts of data: autonomous cars, robotics, virtual reality. Drones fit into the domain of huge data sets beyond what consumers can typically generate. VB: Having data itself is considered a good thing or a priority these days, as far as making good use of all the servers out there in the data centers. Nanduri: Right. But the workflows are different, how you apply them and deploy them. It’s good to have an end-to-end understanding of the workflow. These are new use cases. We’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg right now in how they can be applied. Talking about bridge inspections — there are more than 600,000 bridges out there in the United States. Think about manpower and individual safety. It’s dangerous to put all those folks out there on cherry pickers or harnesses. These machines can do the work more quickly and reliably. They can automate it in easier ways. The value prop becomes a no-brainer at that point. If people look at how inspections are done today, people literally climb towers on harnesses, sitting there doing visual inspection. You don’t need to do that anymore. You still need to send people in to fix things, maybe, you can reduce the number of times a person has to go up there, and you can inspect more often. The later you find a problem, the more expensive it is to fix. You can build a database to create those inspection reports more often, and then analyze and use compute to check for inspection issues earlier. Today you can’t do it as often because it’s expensive and unsafe. With drones you can do it more often, and at a fraction of the cost. The question, then, is how do we get there? What needs to happen to have that become a widespread use of drones day to day? 1 2 3 View All ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here In 2010, a decade after it was founded, online travel portal MakeMyTrip (MMT) was ready to get listed on the stock exchanges. The only problem? The investors in MMT were split down the middle on where it should be listed: in India or the US. Two large investors along with a few independent directors were keen on a US listing, whereas another investor along with an independent director reckoned a local listing was best. Cofounder Deep Kalra was torn. To make a decision, he decided to look beyond MMT, to at least six of India Inc’s best minds, including Ajit Balakrishnan, founder of digital content firm Rediff.com — which listed on Nasdaq in 2000 — and Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai. Based on their inputs, Kalra took the call to list on the American exchange. “We wanted to raise $80 million in 2010, and we ended up collecting 15x,” recalls Kalra. In the seven years since, only two Indian companies — Azure Power and travel portal Yatra in 2016 — have gone on to list on the American exchange. But as valuations come under pressure and raising further rounds of funding becomes increasingly difficult, a listing may be one of the very few options for Indian tech and digital firms. And where better than the exchange that’s home to tech and internet bellwethers like Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Amazon? Newspapers have been reporting since mid-2015 about etailer Flipkart readying for an IPO on Nasdaq. Last month, Business Standard reported that the decade-old ecommerce firm had hired top auditing firms to begin the process of filing for an IPO on the American bourse. Flipkart did not respond to queries from ET Magazine on a proposed listing. Flipkart may not be the only internet firm eyeing a US listing. Another ecommerce unicorn ShopClues says it is planning to make its debut on the Nasdaq by the end of the year; online insurance platform PolicyBazaar is exploring a listing on the US stock exchange; and GirnarSoft, which runs auto portals CarDekho, Gaadi and Zig-Wheels, may also take the plunge. So, are Indian startups finally ready for Nasdaq? Kalra reckons so. The ecosystem is maturing, even as another round of high-value funding looks tough. Entrepreneurs, contends Kalra, would look to go to a place where they would get a depth of investors — who are more likely to buy into their story than back home, where appetite for the new economy is still low. What’s more, a listing is impossible for loss-making firms — which most online ventures are. “Even if you are unprofitable but have a sustainable business model, you will find takers at Nasdaq who realise the value of scale,” adds Kalra. Also Read : AcquiHiring: The new startup buzzword to gain technology and talent For Yatra, the second online travel portal from India to get listed on Nasdaq through a reverse merger, it was a huge leap of faith. “We had the right internal structure, processes and systems in place to take this huge leap forward,” says CEO Dhruv Shringi. Yatra was founded in August 2006, had raised $222 million before it got listed and counts Reliance Capital, IDG Ventures India, Intel Capital and Norwest Venture Partners among its investors. The company with a network of some 61,000 hotels, 14,000 travel agents across 1,100 cities and gross bookings of $897 million in fiscal 2016 has a market value of some $347 million after listing. Nasdaq provides established valuation benchmarks for companies, which is something missing in India, says Shringi. A key stopover Venture capitalists contend that Nasdaq is better suited to, and more appreciative of, the nuances of a new tech company than the Indian stock exchanges. So, it can offer better price realisation. “Time seems ripe for getting listed,” says Shubhankar Bhattacharya, venture partner at Kae Capital. The relative dearth of funding will not only enforce frugality and more prudent business decisions, but also lead to a rationalisation of valuations that will be closer to public market norms, he says. Apart from injecting the muchneeded liquidity, a listing provides an avenue for investors to make an exit. Any company — whether unicorn or otherwise — that has had investors for 10 years is under pressure to give investors a lucrative way out, says Sandeep Murthy, partner at Lightbox Ventures. “The pressure to get listed is real,” he adds. Last November, Morgan Stanley marked down the value of its holdings in Flipkart by about 38% — a fourth valuation markdown in a year — which pegged the etailer’s valuation at $5.54 billion. And, last week, US mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments slashed the valuation of its holdings in Flipkart by more than a third, at roughly $5.58 billion. For a highly funded company, explains a foreign VC who is an investor in one of the Indian unicorns, listing appears to be the only way out as raising a new round of funding at a drastically marked-down value would do more bad than good. “How long can investors burn money in any company? They are getting edgy,” he says, requesting anonymity. Radhika Aggarwal, cofounder of ecommerce marketplace ShopClues, insists it is not pressure from investors that’s nudging her towards Nasdaq. Rather, it’s a well-calibrated plan and a key stopover on the roadmap for growth. Aggarwal pegs ShopClues’ valuation at over $1.1 billion; the firm that has raised $200 million so far from the likes of Nexus Venture, Helion and Tiger Global claims to be on track to break even in 2017-18. “We will be ready to list by year-end,” she says, adding that the long-term goal of the company was always to go the IPO way. Aggarwal stresses that “VCs are not running out of patience”, and that the private pool of capital is still dense enough to delay listing. For instance, Uber or Airbnb, which who have raised billions of dollars, are nowhere close to going public. “They feel that there is so much of opportunity to grow that way,” she says. Yet, she maintains that ShopClues is on track to be one of the fastest — if not the fastest — unicorns to get listed. Experts say that a listing is no walk in the park. To go public, says venture capitalist Sid Talwar, one needs to have strong corporate governance, discipline and excellent processes. “You go public when you have your business figured out,” says Talwar, cofounder of Lightbox Ventures. And, once public, valuations normally reflect the profitability of a company or at least a roadmap to profitability at some point. In today’s market, Talwar explains, for many potential IPO candidates, there’s the added burden of high valuations pre-IPO. Will they be able to achieve a publicly tradable price in the same range, irrespective of the quality of the business? One has to remember that less than 300 venture-backed technology companies have ever gone public. “And that’s before you look at how many of them struggle post IPO,” he says, asserting that Indian startups are not prepared, for one reason or the other, to list. “I do hope they will be soon.” PolicyBazaar, an online financial products platform that has raised Rs 500 crore since its inception in June 2008, believes that it is prepared for listing. “We are open to the idea of exploring listing on Nasdaq,” says Alok Bansal, cofounder of PolicyBazaar. Also Read : Should founders run their course, or is it time for a CEO from outside? The company claims to be on track to break even this fiscal, has investors such as InfoEdge (Naukri.com), Tiger Global and Premji Invest, and claims to have a valuation of over Rs 2,500 crore. Bansal dismisses the theory that a funding crunch is making companies tread the listing path. “I don’t think any of the scaled-up businesses have a liquidity problem,” he says. Bansal believes that listing serves multiple purposes: it shows to the world that the company has come of age, and the business model is settled. And listing on Nasdaq gives an added edge as investor mindset in the US is slightly different than in India. The US market, he reckons, would focus on growth for a digital business, even if it’s a loss making one. Back home a strong balance sheet and profitability are bigger concerns on the bourses. If the market is not rewarding one for growth, then the whole strategic positioning at the management level undergoes a makeover and can impact the business severely, explains Bansal. Umesh Hora, chief financial officer of GirnarSoft, too maintains that it may be worth exploring Nasdaq listing as the US platform is the go-to stock exchange for growth-oriented tech companies. However, Hora sounds a word of caution for overzealous startups. An IPO requires introspection, a certain scale of business and long-term planning as going public, among other things, translates into additional corporate governance, and increased regulatory and investor scrutiny and costs. Moreover, one needs to understand that the current funding crunch is simply a muchneeded course correction, he says. Rather than consider Nasdaq listing as the best option, the time is ripe for startups to rework their business models to get to a stage where they are able to build truly sustainable and profitable companies. In sharp contrast to Hora, there are others like serial entrepreneur K Ganesh who prefer an Indian listing. Reason: norms of disclosures and compliance have been relaxed, the government is open to feedback and the authorities would be willing to go the extra mile to ensure that more startups get listed in India. “Listing in India provides good visibility, reinforces trust, brand recognition and gives credibility across the country among retail investors,” he says. The unwanted pressure While conceding that US listing gives access to the largest source of capital in the world and access to debt improves, Ganesh believes that the cost of listing, compliance and ongoing follow-up is substantial and off-putting for the Indian companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) accounting, disclosure and reporting requirements are cumbersome and a big distraction for an Indian company in the startup stage. The investors might get wary more easily, leading to price variations unconnected to the core business metrics, he adds. Though listing, lets on Ganesh, is definitely the best way to monetise in terms of returns to investors and shareholders, it is a tough life with continuous quarter– on-quarter pressures of disclosure and scrutiny by analysts. While companies like Infosys have managed it brilliantly, there have been many who got listed and withered away, he adds. Last April, Rediff announced that it had applied to the US SEC to delist from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The decision came a couple of months after the portal received a notice from Nasdaq that it had failed to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement of $1 per share. “The company believes that it may be difficult and expensive to try to regain compliance… and therefore has determined to voluntarily delist from Nasdaq,” Rediff had said in a media communication. Clearly, one way to avoid such a fate is not to list at all if one is not ready for the big leap. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The news is coming from HardOCP boss Kyle Bennett, who has said Intel's new processor would be a multi-chip module (MCM) with a Radeon GPU die that is separate to the CPU die, and won't be on-die like Intel's current GPU tech.   Intel's upcoming Radeon-powered Kaby Lake CPU would be a mid-range part, so we could expect something in the 1080p 60FPS region for maybe $249?

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple to Augment Intel Chips in Mac with In-House Processors February 4, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Google Now is Going Down; Top Five Alternates to Pick From  Lenovo Yoga A12 is an Android Tablet Packed with the Pros of a Laptop Apple is planning to introduce a new chip to the Mac devices that will be built in-house. But that shouldn’t end Apple’s love story with the chips from Intel as Apple’s new in-house processor will not be entirely replacing the Intel processors that have been in for years in Mac. Instead, the company will be introducing to augment the currently used chip so as to offload some of its features to the new processor that’s being developed. That will include the Power Nap features of the Intel processor that has been there to save the battery life. Mac makes use of the Power Nap features to perform tasks while in sleep mode like email downloads and calendar updates, iCloud sync, Time Machine driver backups and a host of other features. Apple is planning to introduce the new chip so as to make it power-efficient, by switching all the tasks from Intel to a more energy-efficient processor. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro did receive some criticism in regard with its battery performance. With the process, Apple will also be able to work further with the capabilities of the Power Nap features. It’s not an entirely new move from Apple, as the company has previously introduced secondary processor to aid the Intel chips. The recently released MacBook Pro came with a dedicated Apple-made chip that was put to dedicatedly handle the Touch Bar. If reports are to be believed, the new processor will fall along the same line. The new chip is likely to make its debut in the new MacBook Pro that will be announced later this year.

While AMD has made brilliant technological strides over the years, it has never gained lasting competitive advantage over its rival. But that could soon change, thanks to a new executive team led by CEO Lisa Su, 47, who joined the company in 2012 and took the helm in October 2014. “AMD has, in the past, suffered from a lack of execution and a lack of focus,” says Linley Gwennap, head of the Linley Group, a tech research...

WireGuard Secure Network Tunnel Is Eyeing Mainline, Running On Android Back in June we reported on WireGuard as a next-generation secure network tunnel for the Linux kernel. We haven't heard much on WireGuard in recent months, but this New Year's morning we received a message from their lead developer with a status update. A Look Back At Some Of The Best Features Added To The Linux Kernel In 2016 Going from the Linux 4.5 kernel merge window that was open in last January to the Linux 4.10 merge window that closed this past Christmas, here is a look back at the prominent features added to the kernel in 2016. VK9 - Direct3D-Over-Vulkan - Reaches New Milestones The VK9 project that's working to implement Direct3D 9 over Vulkan that's been under heavy development the past few months has reached new development milestones. Debian Stretch Enters Its Soft Freeze, Full Freeze In One Month The soft freeze is now upon us for Debian 9.0 "Stretch" while the full freeze will happen in February. AMD Kaveri vs. Intel Skylake With The Latest Linux/Mesa Open-Source Drivers I'm in the process of testing a lot of my different CPUs/APUs in preparation for some Kaby Lake Linux benchmarks next week with the Core i5 7600K and Core i7 7700K. Along the way with the different CPU benchmarks I've also been running some fresh integrated Linux graphics tests on the newer and interesting hardware. And the most-viewed featured articles: Intel Kabylake: Windows 10 vs. Linux OpenGL Performance For those curious about the current Kabylake graphics performance between Windows 10 and Linux, here are some OpenGL benchmark results under each operating system. Windows 10 Pro x64 was tested and the Linux distributions for comparison were Ubuntu 16.10, Clear Linux, Antergos, Fedora 25 Xfce, and openSUSE Tumbleweed. GCC 7.0 vs. 6.3 vs. 5.4 vs. 4.9 Compiler Benchmarks On Linux x86_64 With GCC7 feature development ending, this week I conducted some benchmarks of the latest GCC 7 snapshot against that of the past three major release series of the GNU Compiler Collection: 6.3.0, 5.4.0, and 4.9.4. All tests were done on Ubuntu Linux x86_64 with an Intel Core i7 6800K processor. Linux Memory Performance With Intel Kabylake From DDR4-1600 To DDR4-3333MHz For those that may be thinking about picking up an Intel Kabylake processor and trying to justify if DDR4-2400 memory is worthwhile for your budget, or even faster DDR4 memory via XMP profiles / overclocking, here are some tests using a Kabylake CPU and testing DDR4 memory at frequencies from 1600MHz up to 3333MHz. GCC 7.0 vs. LLVM Clang 4.0 Performance (January 2017) LLVM Clang 4.0 is set to be released in February while GCC 7 will be released as stable in March~April. For those curious how both compilers are currently performing, here is our latest installment of GCC vs. LLVM Clang benchmarking on Linux x86_64. Open-Source Nouveau Linux 4.10 + NvBoost vs. NVIDIA Proprietary Linux Driver Performance Earlier this week I posted some benchmarks showing the open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) driver performance on Linux 4.10 with the new NvBoost capability for finally being able to hit the "boost" clock frequencies with Kepler graphics cards when using this reverse-engineered driver. While the manual re-clocking and enabling NvBoost is able to increase the Nouveau driver's performance, how do these results compare to using the closed-source NVIDIA Linux driver? These benchmarks answer that question. 26-Way Intel/AMD CPU System Comparison With Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 Kernel In preparation for Intel Kaby Lake socketed CPU benchmark results soon on Phoronix, the past number of days I have been re-tested many of the systems in our benchmark server room for comparing to the performance of the new Kaby Lake hardware. For those wanting to see how existing Intel and AMD systems compare when using Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 and the latest Linux 4.10 Git kernel, here are those benchmarks ahead of our Kaby Lake Linux CPU reviews. AMD & NVIDIA: Open vs. Closed-Source Driver Performance Continuing on from this weekend's open-source Nouveau vs. closed-source NVIDIA Linux driver performance are results now added in with showing AMD's open-source vs. closed-source driver performance with the same tests. Antergos vs. Fedora vs. Ubuntu vs. openSUSE vs. Debian 9 vs. Clear Linux For Early 2017 At the end of December I posted a number of Linux workstation/server distribution benchmarks while this article has the results from the more desktop-focused (non-graphics) Linux distribution benchmarks. Up for benchmarking off a Skylake NUC in this article was Antergos, Fedora 25, Ubuntu 16.10, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Debian 9 Testing, and Intel's Clear Linux. Fedora vs. Ubuntu vs. openSUSE vs. Clear Linux For Intel Steam Gaming Performance With this week Clear Linux now being able to run Steam, I was excited to see how this performance-minded Linux distribution out of Intel's Open-Source Technology Center would compare to other more popular Linux distributions when it comes to Intel Linux gaming performance. Here are some benchmarks of this traditionally workstation/server-oriented Intel Linux distribution running some Steam Linux games. Radeon Ubuntu Linux Users Have A Lot To Gain By Upgrading Mesa For those curious about the performance difference if upgrading to third-party PPAs from Ubuntu 16.10 when using a modern AMD Radeon graphics card with the open-source driver stack, here are some fresh numbers.

Now, the specification's latest delay, combined with a slew of competition, is shaping up to be an epic computer interconnect battle in the 2018 timeframe. By Evan Koblentz | February 3, 2017, 4:40 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock PCI Express 3.0 is enterprise computing's dominant standard for communication between memory, microprocessors, networking, and storage, but it's facing new competition, as its upcoming major update is underwhelming to some of the most important observers. Officials of PCI-SIG, an industry group that controls the specification, talked about their fourth-generation plans more than five years ago and said version 4.0 would likely arrive by 2015. Now, fresh delays, combined with recent trends in big data, Internet of Things, and mobile computing, are pushing several top IT vendors to call for new approaches to data bottlenecks. PCIe 4.0, as it's known, will move data at 16 gigatransfers per second—that is double the current version. This can be performed at half or quarter of the current voltage levels by using a burst method of sending large amounts of data for shorter times, explained IBM's Al Yanes, an engineer who chairs PCI-SIG. Yanes announced last year that PCIe 4.0 would roll out early this year. Now, due to testing issues, "I think it's going to be more in the third quarter before the cycle rolls out," he said. There hasn't been much demand until recently, he added. SEE: Hardware Procurement Policy (Tech Pro Research) Delays in computer industry standards are not normally a big deal. It's common knowledge that such things take time to get right, but almost all major hardware companies except Intel are starting to work together on alternate plans. Such companies already use and support PCIe 3.0 and 3.1, but the information world is moving too fast to wait much longer, they argue. There is also a business motivation: Intel's recent purchases of smaller companies in the hardware acceleration and programmable chip niches are leaving other hardware giants without a choice. More about Networking How the NFL and its stadiums became leaders in Wi-Fi, monetizing apps, and customer experience (PDF download) 3 ways to connect your private network to the public cloud Video: What's in store for the next generation of software development Subscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter There are three consortia—CCIX, Gen-Z, and OpenCAPI—that could work together to force Intel's cooperation and possibly render PCIe 4.0 moot. CCIX, which advocates pronounce "C-6," stands out for a slightly different perspective, as the goal is to work with PCIe 4.0, not against it. CCIX, officially the Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators, includes name brands such as AMD, Amphenol, ARM, Broadcom, Huawei, IBM, Mellanox, Micron, Qualcomm, Red Hat, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx. "We are always interested in the data acceleration market... PCI Express is really good because it's everywhere," noted Gaurav Singh, vice president of architecture for Xilinx and chair of CCIX. However, "In order to improve the performance, we need to have a higher bandwidth on the interface, and we also need to eliminate the bottleneck," he said. Programming for PCI requires a lot of software overhead, and it experiences too much delay because of bit ordering and software drives, Singh explained. As such, "What we're doing with CCIX is we're extending that memory domain into the accelerator. This is something that PCI does not have." "The CCIX approach is to say, 'Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water'," Singh continued. "The same pins can be used for PCI Express, and it can also be used for CCIX." CCIX is already developing speeds of 25 gigabits and 56 gigabits per second, Singh stated; it works at PCIe 4.0 speed, too. The consortium expects to demonstrate its chips in the first half of 2018, he said. Dell is part of the PCI-SIG. Dell and its new subsidiary EMC both widely use PCIe in servers and storage, yet Dell-EMC exemplifies a hardware giant that's involved part of the Gen-Z and OpenCAPI organizations. "Anytime we can get more and more in and out of processors, we can build better storage platforms, we can build better servers, and our customers can get better results accordingly," said Danny Cobb, the EMC vice president of flash storage strategy and fellow. "The transition from [PCI Express] generation two to generation three, there were some hiccups. Things didn't just work as smoothly as we would like to see. But that's life in the big city," Cobb said. "For the longest time, PCIe hasn't been viewed as the easiest thing to implement... PCIe just wasn't there in terms of the distances it could support, the bandwidth it could deliver [or] multistream, multinode," he said. EMC has a precedent for doing what must be done to make high-end products work. For example, the company used PCIe alternatives such as RapidIO in previous versions of its high-end storage arrays and currently uses another alternative, InfiniBand, in similar products including those involved flash drives. What does it all mean for enterprise technologists? "What customers need to do, and what they are doing, is start thinking about where they have information-intensive applications," particularly those running atop high-speed transactional databases, Cobb said. "What I'm advising customers is to start to think about their real-time workloads," which can include anything from serving immediately customized web advertisements to security detection. Intel, for its part, is sticking to the three-pronged approach of its proprietary QuickPath technology between processors, double-data rate memory, and PCIe for connecting to other systems. Asked about the three consortia, "I don't think there's anything they're planning that we don't have plans on our roadmap to go do," said Rob Hays, vice president and general manager of strategic planning in the Intel data center group. Special versions of the Intel approach to hardware acceleration are being prepared for upcoming applications such as machine learning and 5G mobile communications, he added. Veteran IT workers will grin upon hearing Intel's PCIe hardware identifier number: 8086—it's the same name as its milestone processor released in 1978 that kicked off Intel's era of dominance in microprocessors. Whether Intel can maintain the lead 40 years later may come down to a nice game of chess between PCIe 4.0 vs. industry consortia, which are looking out for customers' and their own interests.

Ever wonder what it would be like to play in the Super Bowl? Most of us will never be able to experience that in real life, but this weekend, anyone can get a players-eye view from the comfort of home. Fox Sports teamed with Intel on a new "Be the Player" experience, which lets viewers see what any player on the field is seeing, from their point of view, without requiring players to wear a physical camera. For viewers, the result will be a video game-like experience, according to Fox Sports' SVP of field and technical operations Michael Davies. "This broadcast enhancement is like no other — it literally brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment," Davies said. "What other choices did he have? Was his sight blocked? It all looks much different from field level, and can assist our announcers in describing what actually happened on the field." The feature relies on Intel's 360 Reply technology and an array of cameras circling the stadium to capture the scene and reply it at any angle. Check out a sneak peek in the video below: "The cameras, backed up by a huge bank of Intel computing power, allow a moment to be recreated in 3D space, so that a 'virtual camera' can be placed at the player's eye line — not unlike how limitless camera views can be created in video games," Davies said. According to Preston Phillips, director of business development for the Intel Sports Group, about 20 of the biggest plays can be redone in the 3D, 360 replay view during the game. But viewers will probably only see five.

"This will be improved with technology in the coming year." But as he points out, "five is five more than most NFL fans have ever seen in a game broadcast." You can also view them on Fox Sports's online live stream. There should be no shortage of streams online from those lucky enough to watch the game in person. Verizon, in an effort to ensure its network doesn't get bogged down from the many people who will be snapping and streaming video, increased its data capacity in Houston by 450 percent ahead of the big game.

We are proud to build on our long history in Ireland with today’s official opening of The Dock and investment in new jobs to drive innovation that helps our clients meet the demands of a rapidly evolving digital world.” Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Mary Mitchell O’Connor said, “Accenture’s decision to expand its innovation capability in Ireland represents a major win for the country, providing high-value employment and opportunities for people to work on exciting projects. We have earned a great reputation for technology innovation in recent years, and The Dock will enhance our country’s credentials even further. I wish the company and employees the very best in the future.”  The Dock, which is reportedly supported by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise & Innovation through IDA Ireland is located in Dublin’s Silicon Docks.  According to reports, The Dock is one of the world’s most connected and intelligent buildings, using sensors to learn from occupant behavior, react to user feedback and allow the building to continually evolve. Martin Shanahan, Chief Executive of the IDA, said, “The Dock showcases Accenture’s depth of technology expertise in Ireland. The company’s continued investment in innovation and in its team of talented professionals greatly enhances Ireland’s position as a compelling location for global professional service firms. IDA continues to target additional investment in this key sector.” Find Irish Sun on Facebook Latest Irish Sun news Accenture to add 300 jobs in Dublin as it expands in the country DUBLIN, Ireland - In a bid to expand in the country, professional services firm Accenture ...

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on a technology that is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare.  Photo: Al Drago / The New York Times The Pentagon's plan to bring AI to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies. Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech. Advertisement Although they boasted that they had outperformed their American competitors, a well-known AI researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently taunted Microsoft, noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier. We had surpassed human-level Chinese recognition in 2015; happy to see Microsoft also get there for English less than a year later.— Andrew Ng (@AndrewYNg) October 20, 2016 That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence. First announced last year by Ash Carter, President Barack Obama's defense secretary, the "Third Offset" strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia. Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on brand-new Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation's leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons. But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls. In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon's ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today's new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees. As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation's government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence. The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Qi Lu, a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, left the company to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the company's ambitious plan to become a global leader in AI. And last year, Tencent, developer of the mobile app WeChat, a Facebook competitor, created an artificial intelligence research laboratory and began investing in US-based AI companies. Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field. "The Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies," said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. In August, the state-run China Daily reported that the country had embarked on the development of a cruise missile system with a "high level" of artificial intelligence. The new system appears to be a response to a missile the US Navy is expected to deploy in 2018 to counter growing Chinese military influence in the Pacific. Known as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, or LRASM, it is described as a "semiautonomous" weapon. According to the Pentagon, this means that though targets are chosen by human soldiers, the missile uses artificial intelligence technology to avoid defenses and make final targeting decisions. The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as "remote warfare," said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, California. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers. "They are making their machines more creative," he said. "A little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost." Whether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and self-confident to understand the speed of the Chinese competition. "There are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas," he said. "But then US media reports only on the US version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the US" A key example of Chinese progress that goes largely unreported in the United States is Iflytek, an artificial intelligence company that has focused on speech recognition and understanding natural language. The company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between Chinese- and English-language texts. The company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a "Humanoid Answering Robot." "Our goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future," said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek's chief executive. The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to American and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. In April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel's laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a self-driving car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal — taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas — after just nine months of work. "The AI technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely home-brewed," Wu said. "We wrote every line by ourselves." Their first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis. The United States' view of China's advance may be starting to change. In October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is publishing more research than US-based scholars. Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make AI a priority in its military systems. "I think while China is definitely making progress in AI systems, it is nowhere close to matching the U.S.," said Abhijit Singh, a former Indian military officer who is now a naval weapons analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view. "It is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in AI, and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years," said Kai-Fu Lee, a Taiwanese-born artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoft's and Google's China-based research laboratories. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $US675 million to invest in AI both in the United States and in China. "Using a chess analogy," he said, "we might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the master-level AI scientists." What is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American AI research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China. In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu's Silicon Valley AI Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses. One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom. Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly. Last year, China also brought the world's fastest supercomputer, the Sunway TaihuLight, online, supplanting another Chinese model that had been the world's fastest. The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation, a shift from its role as a manufacturing hub for components and devices designed in the United States and elsewhere. In a reflection of the desire to become a centre of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intel's Xeon processors; after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing. The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets. But similar advances in high-performance computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with machine-learning research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries. While there appear to be relatively cozy relationships between the Chinese government and commercial technology efforts, the same cannot be said about the United States. The Pentagon recently restarted its beachhead in Silicon Valley, known as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility, or DIUx. It is an attempt to rethink bureaucratic US government contracting practices in terms of the faster and more fluid style of Silicon Valley. The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China's market. "There are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that they're going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir," said Peter Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the start-up founded in part by venture capitalist Peter Thiel. "But if you're thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they can't become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market." Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley. "No one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can't say it's about China, and the tech companies can't," Singer said. "But it's there in the background."

The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China's market. "There are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that they're going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir," said Peter Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the start-up founded in part by venture capitalist Peter Thiel. "But if you're thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they can't become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market." Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley. "No one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can't say it's about China, and the tech companies can't," Singer said. "But it's there in the background."

(Associated Press files) By BARBARA ORTUTAY, Associated Press Published: February 5, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. • THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. • WHY IT MATTERS. Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: • Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. • Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. • Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece, Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” • INTO THE PIPELINE. Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. • WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT. Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” “dominant” and “leader” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. • MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN. Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Wearables-Wearables+ Intel and New Balance announced the product of their collaboration, the RunIQ smartwatch, in early January at CES 2017 trade fair. Starting today, customers can order one through Amazon for just $300. Unfortunately, those who order the smartwatch will have to wait quite a long time since Amazon states the New Balance RunIQ usually ships within 1 to 2 months. If you don't want to wait so long, then you might have more luck when ordering the smartwatch from the New Balance site. The timing chosen by New Balance for the release of its RunIQ smartwatch powered by Android Wear 1.5 seems a bit off considering Google is about to launch Android Wear 2.0 this week. On top of that, other companies are likely to launch their Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches by the time New Balance will be able to start shipping the RunIQ. If you can get past the fact that you will have to wait so long for the smartwatch, the RunIQ seem a quite decent choice. The wearable device is powered by am Intel Atom Z34XX CPU and packs a 410 mAh battery inside. The smartwatch carries a 1.39-inch AMOLED display, as well as 512MB RAM and 4GB of internal memory. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are also on board, along with GPS and heart monitor. Even though New Balance RunIQ ships with Android Wear 1.5, there's no doubt that customers will be able to update it to the latest version, Android Wear 2.0.

Then why can't they just ship it with Android Wear 2.0 instead? Especially since they are shipping it in 1-2 months from now anyways. The only downside side is the Intel processor. I have the first gen Q Founder, and battery life sucked with that version. However their second gen Q Founder has much better battery life, because they decided to go with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 SoC, which has much better battery life. Intel doesn't really have a good track record with battery life, especially in small devices like smart watches, view all comments Want to comment? Please login or register.

These two have the greatest number of acquisitions in the space. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Feb 4, 2017 at 3:17PM Market-intelligence firm CB Insights has compiled a list of the major acquirers of private artificial-intelligence (AI) companies over the last five years. This list reveals well-known tech giants making large investments to increase their capabilities in AI. It also provides insight into the evolution of the technology, and its direct uses.   Google and Intel are in the race for artificial intelligence. Image source: Intel. Google's been on a buying spree Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is well known for its aspirations in artificial intelligence; it heads the list with 11 acquisitions. A number of these companies specialized in areas that led directly to recent improvements in the Google Assistant. They also tie to the launch of Google Home and its plans to take on Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa virtual assistant and the Echo smart-speaker home system. The acquisition of Emu provided an assistant that used voice commands to schedule appointments, set reminders, and make reservations. Api.ai added tools for building conversational bots, while Dark Blue Labs contributed natural-language improvements. Two companies helped personalize recommendations: Clever Sense learned about nearby coffee shops, restaurants and bars; Jetpac searched for visual cues in photos to improve recommendations. Timeful used priorities to add items to a calendar using smart scheduling. Three companies specialized in image recognition: DNNResearch focused on image search and facial recognition; Moodstocks technology improved image recognition for smartphones; Vision Factory worked to enhance accuracy and speed in object recognition. Each of the aforementioned technologies serves to improve specific functions in Google Home's ecosystem, and specifically within Assistant. This will compete directly in the virtual personal assistant market currently led by Amazon's Alexa. London-based DeepMind was one of the largest acquisitions, with a price tag estimated at $660 million. Google already boasted a significant investment in the area with its development of the Google Brain, a neural network developed in-house. Gains in AI research have been used to improve many areas of its current business. DeepMind is focused on improvements in general AI research, without any specific business objectives. That said, Google will use every opportunity to apply research gains to business uses.   Is Intel's acquisition of Nervana a threat to NVIDIA? Image source: Intel. Intel will take the fight to NVIDIA Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has made a number of acquisitions as well. Saffron specialized in cognitive computing, combining data analytics with deep learning; this relates directly to Intel's efforts in the same area. Indisys provided natural-language recognition, gesture recognition, and virtual-assistant technologies, but also created user interfaces for unmanned drones. Itseez focused on software for the Internet of Things (IoT), cameras, drones, and autonomous driving. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its IoT business. The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems. With a reported price of $408 million, this company is attempting to reduce machine learning to the size of a computer chip. Intel competitor NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has seen its stock price triple in 2016, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) become the chip of choice for companies training AI systems. If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for NVIDIA. As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an edge in this nascent technology. Success in the field will likely depend on successful integration of these acquisitions into existing business lines. Alphabet and Intel are on the right track.

Tim Brugger (timbrugger) Feb 4, 2017 at 1:14PM Whether investors are in search of growth and income, value, or long-term appreciation, the tech sector has sound alternatives. The digitization of the world around us, including the Internet of Things, the cloud, and multiple touch points driving an unprecedented amount of data has resulted in market opportunities with nearly unlimited potential. The solutions needed to take advantage of the fast-changing tech marketplace include comprehensive data analytics from the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and powering cloud data centers, a market dominated by underappreciated Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The cloud is also home to Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), which has transformed it into a financially rock-solid business with skyrocketing recurring revenue. Image source: IBM. Growth and income on sale It may seem counterintuitive to include IBM on a list of top stocks, given that its stock has skyrocketed 40% the past year. But don't dismiss IBM. As CEO Ginni Rometty undertook the arduous task of transitioning away from legacy enterprise hardware, IBM's stock had languished for years. The result is that even after its share price jump, IBM remains a top tech stock in 2017 for a couple of reasons. One, IBM is still ridiculously cheap based on earnings expectations. And two, IBM can attribute its stellar performance to delivering on its "strategic imperatives." Last fiscal year, IBM generated $32.8 billion in combined strategic imperatives sales, equal to 41% of its $79.9 billion in total revenue. That was a goal Rometty had targeted for next year, but IBM is hitting on all cylinders where it counts. Yet it's still trading at a mere 12 times forward earnings. And boasting one of the tech industry's best dividends of 3.2% makes IBM a growth and income investor's must-have stock. Image source: Adobe Systems. An unlikely cloud leader It was about four years ago that Adobe CEO Shantanu  Narayen got serious about his intention to shift to a recurring revenue model with the introduction of its Creative Cloud. Fast-forward to last quarter's and year's earnings report, and it's become clear Adobe's shift to a sustainable, relatively reliable source of revenue is working like a charm. Of 2016's record sales of $5.85 billion -- a 22% jump over the prior year -- $4.01 billion of was generated from its Digital Media unit's annual  recurring revenue (ARR) model, equal to nearly 69%. Leading the way in the fourth quarter was Adobe creative cloud's 33% increase in ARR to $866 million. Adobe's Marketing Cloud fared well, too, climbing 32% in the fourth quarter to $465 million. The good news for growth investors is Adobe is hardly resting on its laurels. Adobe has recently unveiled a voice-activated speech and image editing tool, as well as working on incorporating both virtual reality and augmented reality into its solution. Considering it's sitting on a record $2 billion in deferred revenue, Adobe is primed for yet another stellar year. Image source: Intel. Still underappreciated Based on its stock price, Intel didn't impress many last quarter. After reporting an all-time revenue high of $59.4 billion annually and $16.4 billion in the quarter, Intel's share price hasn't budged from pre-earnings levels. Intel handily beat analyst estimates for both quarterly revenue and earnings per share, excluding one-time items. Pundits had expected  EPS of $0.74 and sales of $15.7 billion. Similar to IBM, Intel is in the midst of a transition, with an eye toward burgeoning new markets, including IoT, cloud data centers, and security, among others. How is the transition coming along? Intel ended 2016's fourth quarter with IoT sales climbing 16% to $766 million, data center revenue jumping 8% to $4.7 billion, and security-related revenue of $550 million representing a 7% year-over-year increase. Much of Intel's 10% increase in revenue last quarter fell to the bottom line, thanks to managing operating expenses effectively. Intel is growing the revenue drivers that will determine its future, and it's trading at just 12.5 times forward earnings. Its relative value, long-term prospects, and 2.8% dividend yield are why underappreciated Intel is worth a good, long look in 2017. Tim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Made by runners for runners, it's jumping into the wearable competition targeting fitness enthusiasts.  ( New Balance ) Advertisement New Balance is now launching the RunIQ, an Android Wear smartwatch targeted at fitness buffs. Introduced at CES 2016, the wearable already had some attention from consumers before it became a ready product at CES 2017, with the appeal mainly hinging on the tagline "made by runners for runners." RunIQ Specs And Details: What's Under The Circular Hood New Balance crafted the RunIQ in collaboration with Google, Intel, and Strava, and that combination alone probably gives a good idea about what it can bring to the table. Packing almost everything that a runner needs, it sports a built-in GPS, a heart-rate sensor, and interval functionality. More than that, it has pace, distance, and course tracking to boot. Also, it features a water-resistant body, an Intel Atom Z34XX processor, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing it to function like an ordinary smartwatch. In line with that direction is the design, making it fit right in with day-to-day life and not only while exercising. The RunIQ has three physical buttons too. The first one opens up the RunIQ app, the second serves as the home button, and the third controls music or laps. Out of the box, it runs on Android Wear 1.5, but it's probably safe to assume that it'll get upgraded to Android Wear 2.0 not long after since Google does have a hand in it. Battery life is A-OK at 410 mAh, lasting 24 hours with typical use or 5 hours with GPS turned on all the way. Nothing impressive, but hey, it does a good job keeping up with the standard. Price And Availability: How Much The RunIQ Costs And Where To Buy It The RunIQ retails for $299, and it's available via Amazon and the official New Balance website. However, at the time of this writing, it's not available via the online retailer, so it would be best to go straight to the manufacturer's page for now. The Competition: Is RunIQ The Answer To Apple's Watch Nike+? Based on what the RunIQ has in store, it's arguably the Android rival of the Apple Watch Nike+, and the two are pretty similar to each other, including in terms of pricing too. To compare, the RunIQ is $70 or $100 more affordable than Apple's wearable, which is set at $369 for the 38mm model or $399 for the 42mm one. It's also compatible with many more phones too, including the iPhone, while the Apple Watch is limited to the Cupertino brand's handsets. But where the Watch Nike+ lacks in compatibility, it makes up for in fashion options. The RunIQ is only available in one dark color. However, considering that the Apple Watch's community is restricted to those who own one of the models in its lineup, those who want to meet their fitness goals along with more people are better off with the RunIQ because it fully supports Strava. With all said and done, will you be picking up New Balance's RunIQ? If so, feel free to hit us up in the comments section below and let us know.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews Intel Pentium G4560 review: the ultimate budget CPU? A gaming grade i3 in all but name, and yours for around £60. By Richard Leadbetter Published 04/02/2017 So here's a thought. Buy a Core i5 or Core i7 processor for gaming and the bottom line is this: on the majority of titles out there, its resources are highly underutilised. The GPU is the primary bottleneck during gaming, sometimes leaving your CPU with a significant amount of untapped overhead. So the question is this: can you spend less on your CPU and still get a great experience? And more to the point, what processor can keep your graphics card fed with data while offering exceptional value? We put our money where our mouth is and spent £63 on a Pentium G4560 - and it's something special. It truly is the new budget CPU king. Indeed, since we bought it, we've even seen it on pre-order for as low as £57. The remarkable reality is that the real excitement in Intel's new Kaby Lake processor line-up isn't actually at the high-end, it's in the budget sector. Up until now, Pentium processors have been hamstrung by only offering two threads in a world where games require at least four. The Pentium G4560 is essentially a junior i3 - clock-speeds are lower, but crucially, hyper-threading is retained. As we saw in our recent Core i3 7350K review, the end result is that the Pentium is offering 75 to 80 per cent of the i3's performance at just 36 per cent of the price. An i7 7700K is twice as fast in many cases, but it's over five times more expensive. So just how well does it perform? First of all, we'll take a look at some basic benchmarks. Of course, there is something of a disconnect between synthetic benches and real-life gaming performance, but for the record, here's how the Pentium G4650 stacks up against a range of Core processors we've recently tested. Its 3.5GHz clock speed puts it at a disadvantage compared to the pricier chips, but there are other cutbacks too. AVX2 instructions are disabled, meaning that the benchmarks here show a considerable disparity between the Pentium and last year's Core i3 6100 - which on paper, offers just 200MHz of additional frequency. Our test system, featuring the MSI B250M Mortar We tested the Pentium G4560 on an MSI B250M Mortar, a product that sits at the premium end of the chipset's spectrum. The idea behind the board is pretty simple - what if you want a good-looking, functionally rich board but aren't too fussed about overclocking? It's based on the micro-ATX form factor, allowing for integration into a very small case. On the board itself, the full limitations of the B250 chipset are in place, so despite the BIOS featuring an overclocking area, you're effectively limited to adjusting DDR4 latencies and little else of consequence - there's a hard and fast limit of 2400MHz here when using a Kaby Lake processor. M.2 SSDs and even Intel Optane are fully supported on the B250M Mortar, and there's no shortage of fast SATA-3 ports for hooking up and getting the most out of standard solid state storage. Intel supplies the LAN technology (which features power surge protection support) and sound is taken care of with MSI's Audio Boost. USB 3.1 is fully supported, and there's a reversible Type-C socket on the rear. Multi-GPU is also supported via AMD's CrossFire, but Nvidia SLI is off the table. We paired this board with four sticks of Corsair Vengeance LPX rated for 3000MHz (but limited to 2400MHz on this board), with 15-17-17-35 latency and ran everything from an OCZ Trion 100 SSD. Corsair's RM1000i supplied power, while cooling the Pentium required nothing more than the supplied Intel heatsink and fan - which is surprisingly very quiet bearing in mind how slight it is. This is particularly evident when we look at HEVC encoding under Handbrake, which is effectively crippled on the Pentium and where the i3 6100 offers up a 40 per cent performance boost. But the good news is that the cutbacks in the G4560 do not seem to impact gaming performance whatsoever, and improvements elsewhere within the Kaby Lake platform can actually draw you level with i3 6100 frame-rates. And this is significant. Last year, we paid £93 for the i3 6100 and called it the best budget CPU on the market. This year, even factoring in the massive bump to PC component prices in the wake of the Brexit vote, we have the same performance for £30 less. In speccing out a budget build, this is a big deal. In-depth analysis on the new budget CPU king, with benchmarks, comparisons and a look at how well this thing actually runs games. Pentium G4560 Core i3 6100 Core i3 7350K Core i5 7600K Core i7 7700K Core i5 6500 XTU Benchmark 336 664 760 1244 1490 1055 Cinebench R15 Single-Core 145 156 184 173 187 144 Cinebench R15 Multi-Core 365 386 450 654 963 537 Handbrake 0.10.5 x264 5.11fps 5.70fps 6.37fps 9.6fps 13.10fps 8.12fps Handbrake 0.10.5 x265/HEVC 1.92fps 2.70fps 2.82fps 4.84fps 6.20fps 4.06fps Buy the Intel Pentium G4560 from Amazon [?], BT Shop, Scan or Ebuyer. To test the Pentium G4560, we put together a budget-orientated PC gaming set-up. The Z270 boards we've previously used for reviewing the unlocked Core 'K' chips are replaced with a more modest MSI B250 Mortar board. The B250 chipset has no CPU overclocking facilities whatsoever, making motherboards based on this set-up better suited for a budget build. However, the B250 chipset has a secret weapon - support for 2400MHz DDR4 memory, compared to the 2133MHz limit on RAM imposed on all Skylake processors. We've yet to confirm it, but even cheaper H110 boards may support 2400MHz RAM too - but it will require an updated BIOS. But the point is that this support for additional memory bandwidth is significant. Prior Digital Foundry processor reviews have found a distinct relationship between CPU performance in gaming and faster memory. This is especially significant for lower-end chips like the Core i3 line and the Pentium G4560 - because you are far more likely to be CPU-bound using one of these chips, so anything that can push up lowest recorded frame-rates is obviously a good thing. And this is borne out in the benchmarks where the move from 2133MHz DDR4 to the new 2400MHz standard effectively allows the Pentium to overcome its clock-speed disadvantage against the Core i3 6100. In six out of the seven games we tested, the G4560 with 2400MHz DDR4 matches the performance of an i3 6100 paired with slower memory. To put these benchmarks into perspective, let's explain our methodology. As the GPU is the primary limiting factor in gaming, many processor benchmarks do not highlight CPU performance at all. Average frame-rates don't work as a comparison measure when only split-second excerpts of any given benchmark may be CPU-bound. We overcome this by running our titles at 1080p on ultra settings or equivalent using an overclocked Titan X Pascal. This pushes processor power and memory bandwidth to the forefront and allows us to measure relative performance in processing game logic and preparing draw calls for the graphics hardware - the primary tasks for your CPU. Complete FCAT video benchmarks for the Pentium G4560, squared up against the Core i3 6100 and AMD FX 6300. 1080p/Titan X Pascal OC Pentium G4560 Pentium G4560 Core i3 6100 Core i5 6500 Athlon X4 8600 FX 6300 Memory Frequency 2133MHz DDR4 2400MHz DDR4 2133MHz DDR4 2133MHz DDR4 2400MHz DDR3 1600MHz DDR3 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 77.4 81.8 81.9 98.9 56.3 70.9 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 17.3 18.2 18.6 22.0 10.7 15.0 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 65.6 66.5 69.9 82.8 46.2 62.0 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 108.2 111.0 111.0 126.1 92.5 103.4 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 79.0 82.2 82.5 90.1 59.8 65.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 50.5 53.8 53.8 69.7 35.6 47.8 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 61.0 64.5 64.1 76.2 41.2 59.2 Our initial table here shows performance of the Pentium paired with both 2133MHz and 2400MHz DDR4, and stacks it up against a selection of processors you may be considering for a budget build - including the aforementioned Core i3 6100, plus a quad-core i5 6500 for those willing to invest a little more. Joining the Intel trio in the line-up is a brace of AMD chips - the Athlon X4 860 and the FX 6300. Both are significant in that they can be overclocked, and the Athlon can be matched with very fast DDR3 - we used 2400MHz modules here, while our AM3 board limited the FX 6300 to 1600MHz modules. Regardless, the end results are fascinating. Finding the right graphics card for a budget CPU Check out the shot above (click on the thumbnail for the full resolution image). Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare runs faster on AMD's RX 480, compared to its Nvidia rival, the GTX 1060. It's an advantage that plays out consistently, as you can see in our Infinite Warfare PC performance analysis. But here's the thing: running these GPUs with an i7 - as we did above - essentially offers something akin to a bottomless pit of CPU power, and the balance of power between the green and red teams changes rapidly when you pair each GPU with a less capable processor, like the Pentium G4560 we're reviewing here. And you can see that in the shot below, taken mere seconds later. As soon as the action intensifies, the RX 480 suddenly loses a lot of performance. Minimum frame-rate actually hits 45fps in our tests - 20fps lower than the GTX 1060. And that's important when choosing a graphics card to pair with a less capable CPU. AMD's DirectX 11 driver lacks multi-threading capabilities and is significantly less optimal than Nvidia's, meaning that when the CPU is taxed, certain titles lost a lot of performance (and we stress, not all games exhibit the issue, but you have no guarantee which titles will be affected and which are fine). And that's a shame, because in looking at the most powerful CPU you can comfortably pair with the Pentium G4650, AMD's RX 470 actually looks like a winner. On sale, it's often just a little more expensive than Nvidia's far less capable GTX 1050 Ti. In fact, get the right RX 470 and overclocked, it can beat a reference 4GB RX 480. But when so much performance is lost owing to driver overhead, it's not a good idea. It's even more frustrating because AMD's Vulkan and DX12 drivers are excellent - the RX 470 worked beautifully with Doom 2016 in our tests, running locked at 1080p60 with ultra settings. And at the same time, the GTX 1050 Ti is perhaps a little underpowered for the Pentium, while the GTX 1060 is enormously expensive. For these reasons, we reckon that a used GTX 970 may be the best GPU partner for the Pentium. It's much faster than the GTX 1050 Ti, and second-hand, it only costs a little more. For gamers really on a budget, looking for a new GPU - there are two decent choices: the GTX 1050 and the RX 460. Both are under-powered to the degree that driver overhead shouldn't be an issue on the AMD side, and with realistic tweaks to visual presets, you can still get a console-beating experience on many titles. In the UK, the Pentium is priced relatively closer to the Athlon and it's cheaper than the FX 6300. In both cases, it is faster - indeed, up against the Athlon, there's no contest - Intel's budget offering is on another level. However, the era of the many-core game engine is finally paying dividends for AMD's now-ancient FX line. Titles like Rise of the Tomb Raider and The Witcher 3 hold up remarkably well on the six-core FX 6300, though games like Far Cry Primal - which rely heavily upon single-threaded performance - drop off significantly. Also notable is Ashes of the Singularity's CPU benchmark: the Pentium and the i3 are slow compared to an i5 or (especially) an i7, but the FX 6300 stutters noticeably, while the Athlon has multi-second pauses. While we don't have full benchmarks to hand, we can also confirm that the Pentium G3258's stuttering issues are even more pronounced than the Athlon's. Regarded as a budget winner by some, the fact is that the lack of hyper-threading combined with hobbled memory bandwidth reduces the G3258's gaming capabilities considerably. Put simply, the new G4560 wipes the floor with it - a combination of hyper-threading and wider memory bandwidth effectively making it an i3 in all but name. It's also interesting to note that the lack of AVX2 instruction support does not appear to be holding back the new Pentium in the slightest - and this is interesting because this functionality is supported in the PS4 and Xbox One Jaguar CPU cores, so we should expect them to be utilised in modern titles. The Pentium takes on the Core i3 7350K, i5 7600K and i7 7700K - all running at stock frequencies and paired with 2400MHz DDR4. The idea is to show upgrade potential for a budget rig, along with giving some idea of performance vs value across the Intel line-up. 1080p/Titan X Pascal OC Pentium G4560 Core i3 7350K Core i5 7600K Core i7 7700K Memory Frequency 2400MHz DDR4 2400MHz DDR4 2400MHz DDR4 2400MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 81.8 93.7 113.0 129.3 Ashes of the Singularity, DX12, CPU Test 18.2 21.5 27.7 38.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 66.5 79.3 98.5 135.0 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 111.0 122.2 130.4 133.6 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 82.2 97.7 103.7 127.5 Rise of the Tomb Raider DX12, Very High, SMAA 53.8 63.3 85.7 114.9 The Witcher 3, Ultra, No Hairworks 64.5 78.9 92.4 125.7 And finally, we put together a comparison table showing the expandability of a budget PC based on the B250 chipset. Just how much more performance do you gain by moving on up to a more expensive chip that can replace the G4560? We've compared the Pentium against the stock performance of the Core i3 7350K, Core i5 7600K and Core i7 7700K running with the same 2400MHz DDR4 modules we used with the G4560. In short, it's a straight CPU swap-out - and it shows some dramatic gains as we move through Intel's stack. For our money, the i5 remains the sweet spot for running modern games at high frame-rates, but what's clear is that there is a marked level of diminishing returns with regards to performance the more money you sink into your set-up. In terms of a straight value comparison between CPU cost and resultant in-game frame-rates, the Pentium is a clear winner. Of course, benchmarks are one thing but the actual gameplay experience is quite another. Finding the right GPU to pair with the G4560 took some doing. However, we enjoyed good results using the GTX 1060. On the face of it, pairing a £230 GPU with a £63 CPU seems ludicrous, but we could happily run Doom 2016 on ultra settings under Vulkan at a locked 60fps. Similarly, Infinite Warfare ran beautifully with everything bar shadows maxed. Star Wars Battlefront? Even in huge multiplayer games, 1080p60 at ultra was no problem. However, a 64-player Battlefield 1 game shows the Pentium consistently maxed across all four threads, and while performance was mostly locked at 1080p60 on the required ultra settings, drops beneath the threshold were evident in heavier scenes. As a rule of thumb, console titles running at 60fps run great on the Pentium, even with a powerful GPU. However, 30fps console titles require some work - The Witcher 3 needed to be dropped down to high settings and even then it could frame-out in the busier city areas. Crysis 3? It's a disaster on the Pentium, leaving the GTX 1060 highly under-utilised. The best advice here is to lock to 30fps using the Nvidia control panel's half-rate adaptive v-sync, and scale up resolution. We could run the game on high settings with medium shading and shadows and hit 4K, 30fps with the 1060 (!). Alternatively, 1440p30 on very high is equally attainable. Gallery: Intel Kaby Lake - Pentium G4560: the Digital Foundry verdict Here at Digital Foundry, we love to test the latest and greatest gaming technology and with Skylake/Kaby Lake, Intel is the (current) undisputed king of CPU technology. The i7 6700K and 7700K are capable of phenomenal performance while the i5 6600K/7600K offer excellent results for 60fps gaming. But it's the budget components that we love to test: the challenge of tweaking games and customising the experience to work on less capable kit offers a level of fun you don't often get with more expensive hardware, which essentially does all the work for you. Mainstream PC hardware has reached the point where 1080p60 gameplay is possible simply by whacking all settings to high or ultra. That's brilliant of course, but there's much fun to be had diving into the settings and manually tweaking the experience to your liking, to push a budget set-up to its limits. Mass Effect Andromeda: everything we know so far Story, setting and who is replacing Shepard. And when it comes to more value-orientated kit, it's all about price vs performance and the G4560 is simply untouchable. Taking the GPU out of the equation as the primary limiting factor during gaming, the Pentium offers around half the performance of a stock i7 7700K for 20 per cent of the cost. And of course, the actual real-life differential between the two processors will adjust based on the GPU you pair with it. So in prepping your new budget PC build, some degree of care is needed in choosing a graphics card, but the choice of CPU is a no-brainer - shop around for 2400MHz DDR4, ensure you get a motherboard capable of running the RAM at its required speed and buy one of the hyper-threading enabled Pentiums. Yes, the G4560 isn't the only Pentium capable of running four threads - the G4600 and G4620 offer frequency bumps to 3.6GHz and 3.7GHz respectively, but you do pay extra for the privilege. Based on our tests here with the G4560, all of them should be great performers for budget gamers. But as things stand, the G4560 is the cheapest hyper-threaded Intel processor available and the value on offer here is simply phenomenal. However, as good as it is for its ridiculously low cost, it's also important to recognise its limitations in real world gaming: many of us prefer the PC experience because it allows us to break free of the 30fps limits found in console titles - and 1080p60 gaming remains a highly desirable experience. Results here with the Pentium G4560 are variable and as good as it is as a budget processor, we still recommend a fast i5 for 60fps gaming on demanding modern titles.

AMD will make Ryzen fully compatible with Windows 7, which is still supported by Microsoft for another three years. The info was shared by AMD at an partner event. Basically this opens up all processor instruction sets for Window 7, as long as they are compatible with the OS of course similar to what Kaby Lake had with HEVC / 10-bit encoding driver support. Microsoft is not supporting Intel’s latest Kaby Lake range of CPUs on any OS below Windows 10, kind of weird right? We're not sure how that will detail itself in realtion to Ryzen as Microsoft clearly stated not to support new processors on older operating systems.  So there you have it, if you do not have the stomach upgrading to Windows 10. AMD have reportedly announced they will be providing drivers for Windows 7, the favourite OS of many. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

They weren't "fixes" really, just a proper CPU scheduler for AMD's design. That was Microsoft's job to implement. I feel that decoding of that has to do with DRM and paths like that for APUs really, not CPUs. Quote: Originally Posted by labidas Windows 7 is the pinnacle of Windows evolution.

All CPUs have drivers actually, they are the most important drivers you have for an OS actually. It is the same thing, since AMD will write that driver, unlike Intel with Kaby which won't write that CPU driver for Windows.

And installing Windows 7 on a new PC... well, it is strange. I don't get it. You don't have to buy a new OS for a new PC if you're replacing it - I've had the same Windows 7 key from my Q6600 build when I moved to my i5 build - all you have to do is revoke the licence from an installation (so Windows is no longer activated) and you regain an activation with the key - then replaced hardware, used the key and hey presto, Win 7 on the i5 (and of course, upgraded to Win10 when it was available). So anyone who has an existing Win7 PC and want to migrate to a new build, they can (of course it means you can no longer use the old build with that key if you intend to still have the PC).

I don't get it. These are the same people that were trying to do high end gaming in 2010 on Win XP! And then crying when they could play BF3 cause of DX10/11 min requirements. The only pc in my house not running Win 10 is my gfs pc with Win 7. Dont feel the need to upgrade it too ten.

Seriously hilarious. Win 10 is better for anyone who games and even Win 8.1 made BF4 play alot better. Funny people claiming a 8 year old OS is better then a new OS that is even getting a game mode now.

SSD_PRO Member Guru Posts: 94 Joined: 2013-02-07 #5387905 Posted on: 02/02/2017 05:11 PM As for the Win10 vs Win7 debate, each OS has pluses and minuses. If you prefer 7 use, in you prefer 10 use, whatever. I take no teams there. What I do have a bone with is the need AMD has to use a driver patch. Why does AMD need a special driver to make their product performance not suck? And why are they "hard at work" on a driver for a product that is supposed to be out in a month after YEARS of waiting? How long do they qualify these drivers? A week?

Intel released the first Super Bowl ad of the season back on Jan. 12. Since then there has been a steady stream of others, peaking this week when brands from Bud Light to Hulu sought to seize on the pregame buzz. There are still some holdouts, including Fiat Chrysler, which on Friday said it will run three ads but confirmed little else. Bai Brands has said Justin Timberlake is in its ad, but the spot is not expected to be released early. Below are all ads that have come out so far, from 84 Lumber and Audi to WeatherTech and Wonderful Pistachios. (We only included ads that have been released as they will air in the game; no extended versions.)

We're at the tail end of one of the worst NFL seasons ever in a year where the Super Bowl is being contested in Trump's America, with a team that most people feel has this game in the bag also clearly has a Trump problem; there's just not a lot to get excited for. Well, except for the commercials. Related 7 Reasons Why This Was the Worst NFL Season Ever Super Bowl Commercials That Became Pop Culture All-Stars The Best Super Bowl Commercials of 2016 When all is said and done, people will remember these multi-million dollar TV spots, spots that can either become memorable pieces of pop culture lore or thankfully-forgotten, like Puppymonkeybaby (sorry for even mentioniarng that thing). Either way, we're here because of the game, but we stay because of the commercials. It's just how it goes. That said, let's get into the TV spots that will make this year's Super Bowl hot, including a bunch that already got millions of baywatchviews leading up to the big game. 'Stranger Things' Season 2 Teaser HALLOWEEN 2017!!! The Fate of the Furious   The rules have changed. THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS hits theaters April 14. #F8 pic.twitter.com/595v53SNLu — Fast & Furious (@FastFurious) February 6, 2017 THIS LOOKS INSANE MUST SEE RN 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' On of the most anticipated MCU films for 2017 has already dropped a trailer, but this new, extended spot has way more hi-jinx and badassery. You also get to see Nebula, Mantis, and Yondu rocking with the squad. 'Ghost In The Shell' This looks NUTS. "Grace" for 'Logan' We still have another month before Logan hits, but this quick spot gives us a little bit more on the squad Logan, Laura and Charles will be facing. 'John Wick 2' The long-awaited sequel to John Wick hits theaters on February 10, which is the reason they threw shade at Fifty Shades Darker. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales'' Due out Memorial Day, another long-awaited film is finally making the rounds. 'Transformers: The Last Knight' For those of you who are still lit off new Transformers films. 'Baywatch' There's not much new to this spot, although if you're down for Zac Efron in tiny briefs, #itsyours. 'A Cure For Wellness' This looks nuts. And confusing. Due in theaters Feb. 17. "Football Is Over" for 'The Walking Dead' #NeganBack. Bai Drinks Heads have been salivating for this Justin Timberlake ad; the addition of Christopher Walken makes this thing legendary. "#BagofUnlimited" for T-Mobile BFFs Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg make all of the weed puns in this T-Mobile spot. "#UnlimitedMoves" for T-Mobile T-Mobile pulled out the big guns for this one, allowing Justin Bieber to showcase the history of the end zone performance with special guests Rob Gronkowski and Terrell Owens. "Arnold's One Liners" for Mobile Strike If you're a fan of action movie megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger, this will have you chuckling. "Easy Driver" for Mercedes Benz This Coen Brothers-directed spot features the legend Peter Fonda. "Calling JohnMalkovich.com" for Squarespace Lowkey one of the more hilarious spots of the night. "Dead Cowboy Casting" for Snickers Oh hai, Adam Driver. Wix.com You can't really go wrong with Jason Statham and Gal Gadot...right? And here's Part 2! "Yearbooks" for Honda It's almost like someone was on a Distractify website one day saying, "Hey, we should turn that into a commercial." "Hero's Journey" for Kia The hilarious Sean Spicer Melissa McCarthy does all of the things in this Kia Niro spot. "Brady Everyday" for Intel Feel like we saw a similar premise done much better years ago. Yawn, indeed. "THE ENCOUNTER" for Buffalo Wild Wings This Brett Favre spot is weird af. "Science of Clean: 10 Dimensions" for Persil ProClean All Bill Nye Everything. "#AmericaIsBeautiful" for Coca-Cola Today millions cheer together, because together is beautiful. #AmericaIsBeautiful pic.twitter.com/z65LimssjD — Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) February 5, 2017 I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying! "Born the Hard Way" for Budweiser Essentially, you can't be here for banning immigration while drinking an ice cold Bud. Very timely piece. "Ghost Spuds" for Bud Light Speaking of Budweiser, Spuds MacKenzie is back for this new Bud Light spot. Some real Christmas Carol sh*t, for good or ill. "Man and Machine" for Lexus Dope dance moves; kind of wish they had used a better song? This bad boy hits in May. "#BradshawStain" for Tide   You owe me some @Tide, @TerryBradshaw. And a new wall. #BradshawStain #SB51 #ad pic.twitter.com/fgFwMmCD86 — Jeffrey Tambor (@jeffreytambor) February 6, 2017   Shouts for getting Transparent's Jeffrey Tambor in a Super Bowl spot. "Romance" for Skittles Bruh. This one already hit YouTube trending, although the joke gets old quick. Next. "The Entire Journey" for 84 Lumber Here's the full, uncut, immigration-themed Super Bowl spot from 84 Lumber. "Humpty Fall" for TurboTax Kudos to whoever came up with this one. You have to love modern takes on age-old stories, although what exactly was Humpty doing on the wall in the first place? "Cleaner of your Dreams" for Mr. Clean Did you hear that? That was the sound of millions of guys running to the supermarket to grab a bucket and some Mr. Clean. Although you have to get the girl before you can keep her with your amazing cleaning skills. Cam Newton for Buick Can't front; it's kind of satisfying seeing Cam Newton go ham on some Pee Wee football players. "Cold Storage" for Wendy's For what it's worth, Wendy's clapbacks on Twitter regarding frozen beef > Wendy's Super Bowl commercials regarding frozen beef. That othr-guyz.com website is pure hilarity, though. Nintendo Switch If you already aren't rocking with Nintendo's latest batch of game systems, we doubt this spot will make you a believer, but it does a great job of showcasing how portable and interactive the Switch can be. "Car" for Sprint Now that is just dark (although the dad asking his son if he's a cop was pretty funny). "Go Further" for Ford Alternate title: "The struggle is real." "Inspiration Drops" LIFEWTR This spot for Pepsi's new bottled water (WTR?) features music from John Legend and is directed by Robert Stromberg. "False Cabinet" for King's Hawaiian Can't front; we weren't sure what a King's Hawaiian commercial would look like, but this turned out funnier than it should be. Also, King's Hawaiian BBQ? Send a care package, ASAP. "Daughter" for Audi My Name is Offred for 'The Handmaid's Tale' on Hulu We're not sure what the cross section of people who are here for the NFL and The Handmaid's Tale is, but Hulu decided to drop a spot for their upcoming original series, which premieres on the service April 26. "Halftime #BathroomBreak" for Febreze If you run to the john during Lady Gaga's halftime performance, you might miss this one. Low-key surprised this hasn't been done before. "Lady Gaga for Tiffany HardWear" for Tiffany Co. Speaking of Super Bowl LI halftime performer Lady Gaga, Tiffany wisely signed the check for this quick commercial. “BUSCHHHHH” for Busch Hopefully whatever Busch is trying to do with the Busch Guy doesn't backfire on them. "Our Bar" for Michelob ULTRA Because when we think high intensity workouts, we think Michelob ULTRA... wait, what? This post will be updated throughout the night. "#AvoSecrets" for Avocados From Mexico I know, ha ha Illuminati, but what about the real secret society meeting going down rn. "Ernie Gets Physical" for Pistachios John Cena is an elephant on a treadmill...or something.

I would wait until both amd ryzen and intel counterpart cpu has been tested then go from there. far as vega, who knows now.

No need to fret as FOX has planned to show a full live stream of the Atlanta Falcons playing against the New England Patriots at the NRG Stadium in Houston Sunday night.  FOX was boasting some serious technological advances that it promised to enhance viewing pleasure for fans, both online as well on a television. Chief among them were the high definition cameras the network laced the stadium with to provide 260 degree TV camera shots. More from FOX: "You’ll not only see next generation graphics and stats and augmented reality, you’ll even some footage from 4k and 8k cameras, there will also be cameras on the field so you can be a part of the play action and even get the players view. "New technology from Intel will let viewers get inside the helmet of any player on the field, sort of. They’re actually using an array of 38 high definition cameras around the field, which gives a 360-degree view, so you can be virtually placed in any position. A first on the field this year: An 8k camera which is eight times the definition of your HD-TV. The game isn’t going to be in 8k, but the cameras will be used for some of the super-slow replay’s so they’ll look perfectly crisp in high definition." While many have predicted the Patriots would win Sunday, New England was only a three-point favorite over the Falcons, which means we may be in for a close, competitive contest. More than 100 million people were predicted to watch the big game either through traditional means, such as a TV, or online. You can be one of the latter by using the below information to watch a live stream online. The game kicks off around 6:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, but live online coverage from Houston begins around 5:50 p.m. TV Channel: FOX Related Stories Super Bowl Win Comes With A Bonus Check And Ring When Does The Halftime Show Start?

The 104-year-old company has a legacy for vehicles that have sinuous bodies and enduring cool, and has long been a particular point of British pride. Look no further than the romance of James Bond’s original DB5 in the 1964 film Goldfinger. When Aston Martin celebrated its centenary in 2013, thousands gathered on the green lawns of Kensington Gardens in central London to fawn at 550 historical and posh cars including elegant coachbuilt Zagatos and the iconic Bond car collection, in total worth well over a $1 billion dollars. It might be surprising then that a company so steeped in its heritage would be enthusiastic about how technology is impacting its design plans for its second century. I sat down with Reichman, design director and chief creative officer, in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, to talk about how new technology has made car design a more exciting gig in the last few years. Reichman joined Aston Martin in 2005 after serving as a designer at Ford Motor Company. He also had a hand in the Rolls-Royce Phantom and the Range Rover MKIII in past designer roles. Aston Martin has introduced the V12 Vanquish Volante, a DBX Concept, and the Vulcan under his watch. Tall and lean, with spiky red hair, Reichman has the enthusiasm of an earnest professor — he also teaches car design at the Royal College of Art. Reichman spends between much of his time in Gaydon in northern England, where Aston Martin is based, and in many ways represents the way Aston Martin is hedging its fine pedigree with edgy advances into sports cars of the future. Its lineup of new products starts with the DB11, which is now on the streets and its next feat, a highly technical collaboration with Red Bull, AM-RB 001. “This is the car that sets the tone for the next century in terms of technology and our competitive nature. The one thing we’ve never been recognized for in the past is being the outright fastest,” Reichman said. Aston Martin AM-RB001 Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge How do you make technology tasteful in a beautiful car? What do you put inside? If there’s anything Aston Martin lacked in the past people might argue that it’s technology. Now, we might add that we have the best technology in the world. It’s Daimler-based electrical architecture. It’s your Intel chip. It's the connectivity. It’s the driver control units. It's the safety units in the cars. It's how the car talks to the outside world. It’s how you become autonomous and that’s embedded in our cars. “Technology allows you more freedom.” Technology allows you more freedom. It’s not constrained. In the past you were constrained with a screen because you had to put 12 buttons inside of the the car, and initially there was no screen. But now these devices will be so much more with voice recognition, recognizing retina, noticing your movements, and gesture control. All of those things are giving design more freedom in terms of beauty of the object. We make beautiful cars and it’s allowing the cars to have more beauty, to be unconstrained by technology. No one quite knows how the introduction of autonomous cars will unfold. You kind of have to plan for every scenario. How do you do that? The whole idea of autonomy doesn’t mean it has to look it from the outside of the car. Potentially it will look different on the inside of the car, because you’ll have more free time in the inside of the car. Maybe it’s more like an airline lounge or your living room, but for us the object is something of desire. Customers want desirability even if its autonomous or a drone. That’s part of the ingredients to feed a designer. What a designer is really good at is finding an application for technology or finding the technology to get the idea into production. For example, designers will google “hyper bendable material,” and find that there’s one funky college in Princeton that makes nanostructures. Designers will find a way to make something happen, the more you give them an impossible task, the better the solutions. I think the car industry is incredibly innovative. Silicon Valley might argue, but when they think about developing cars they are hiring car people. Other than airplanes that are made in smaller numbers, there isn’t a more complex product that exists. The car is so complex, when you add connectivity and software and hardware, it becomes a hyper computer that can do so many different things. You’ve got to make it repeatedly with quality and it’s got to save your life. If you launch something and your software isn’t fully developed you destroy your business. Do you have a relationship with different tech companies? One of the reasons we partnered with Red Bull Technologies and we’re now doing a car together, is that they have material science technology, aerodynamics and Adrian Newey is probably the world’s greatest aerodynamics engineer stroke designer. He’s won more F1 championships than anyone else. Through material science, it’s through big data and how it drives and how it feels. It’s connectivity. We have a huge relationship with Dow on the chemical side of things. Dow is important because they make materials, they make chemicals, they make bonding solutions. Making something lighter and stiffer means you can be more efficient. Daimler, the reason they have 5 percent shareholding in Aston Martin, is that we have an open door to their future technologies. Daimler, just in terms of electric and architecture that sits in DB11 is probably 2 billion euros worth of investment. They have engines, future technology, autonomous technology, and camera technology. And Bosch engineering who are software developers. It’s not heavy engineering in terms of mechanical parts, but it’s really important in terms of stability and activity and electrification and electric propulsion. Because we’re small and independent it means you can pick and choose as well. Is it getting more difficult to focus on form when so much of design is about integrating technology? No, because the form has to support the function. No other Aston Martin has done it. Aluminum became the choice over steel, and they responded by making a thinner steel structure. And then carbon fiber and composites came in the game. Everything becomes lighter, easier to produce. Technology moves on and the cost base moves down. Carbon fiber composites will do the same. All the costs are coming down. The first autonomous cars used four camera units and they were hundreds of thousands of dollars. They are about $800 now and once they come down to $200 mark, you can have all those cameras in any car. As technology improves and becomes much more mainstream, you always find a way to make it more cost efficient. That’s why the industry is so exciting right now. Who would have thought the car industry would be interested in Silicon Valley right now, but because of Google, because of Apple, because of Microsoft, because of Uber that’s happening. Change is great to inspire great design. Do you have to go to Silicon Valley to get that inspiration? The UK used to have only one region the old automotive world and that was the Midlands. But now we have north of England, the south, and different technology and different supply bases. The UK is renowned for hi fidelity and some of the best high-end micro chips. The Formula One and aerospace industries are feeding into our world. Marine technology has been building carbon fiber boats long before F1 technology. “Should an Aston Martin be autonomous?” Are you designing with autonomy in mind? We are not testing. How much do we employ it? Should an Aston Martin be autonomous? We have to design and innovate for a future we’re not quite sure of. We’ll be a fast adopter, but we're not going to innovate in that way. Our innovation is in car control and driver control in terms of feeling and feedback. It’s about making sports car more effective, efficient, capable, comfortable. We’ll be a fast follower with something like an autonomous car, something that has 360 adaptive radar. The core of what we are is to make handbuilt luxury sports cars that are highly competitive. You don’t necessarily want a sports car to be autonomous. It might someday be important, but right now it’s more about the language of design, the technology that’s there and with DB11, it’s a grand touring sports cars. It’s about the driver being alert and being relaxed and comfort on a longer journey. The more relaxed and comfortable you are the more you can enjoy the journey.

Audi Audi opted for a message about gender inequality and the gender pay gap in its commercial, which, of course, has somehow still managed to anger some viewers online. 84 Lumber After Fox reportedly rejected 84 Lumber’s first draft of a commercial for showing the U.S.-Mexico border wall, the company submitted a re-edited version that ends on a cliffhanger. The rest of the trailer, which completes the story of a family of Mexican immigrants, will go up on the company’s site during the game. INSPIRATIONAL Ford Where other companies might have been more explicitly political, Ford simply wants you to “go further!” Faster! Easier! Better! Wrestle your enemies to the ground! LIFEWTR When you drink this water, all the colors in the world will become brighter, and John Legend will sing. Michelob ULTRA Have you noticed that the sound of opening a beer bottle resembles human breath? Michelob has! McDonald’s While your take may differ, I find it personally inspiring that for every action in the universe there is a Big Mac. CELEBRITY CAMEOS Buick Oh, if only every elementary-school sports game featured quarterback Cam Newton and supermodel/chef Miranda Kerr. Honda Young versions of Tina Fey, Robert Redford, Amy Adams, Magic Johnson, Steve Carrell, Missy Elliott, Stan Lee, Jimmy Kimmel, and Viola Davis are here to say that it gets better, especially if you are as talented and lucky as they are. Intel Tom Brady does a lot of dramatic things in his house. Offscreen, Gisele mutters, “Always, with the mess.” Kia Turns out that the real thing that needed saving was Melissa McCarthy all along. Mercedes Starring Peter Fonda and directed by the Coen Brothers, this is an homage to Easy Rider, presumably because Mercedes cars make for an easy ride. T-Mobile [Justin Bieber puts on glasses.] America: We will follow this scholar anywhere. Tide See, it’s an elaborate joke about how Rob Gronkowski can’t figure out how to make Jeffrey Tambor’s stains transparent. (Ha ha, get it?) Wix.com Don’t tell me if this is the plot of Keeping Up With the Joneses; I have been meaning to watch that movie on a plane sometime soon. (Part 2 of Wix’s commercial is available here.) National Geographic We’ve left off most of the film and TV trailers that will air during the game here, as we’ve covered those elsewhere, but National Geographic’s cheeky trailer for its Eistein series Genius deserves a mention. Do you think Geoffrey Rush knew who Lady Gaga was before they filmed it? ANIMALS AND NATURE Budweiser From this commercial, I learned both that Spuds Mackenzie is back and that Spuds Mackenzie once was. Busch Nothing like the vintage sound of onomatopoeia. Wonderful Pistachios Honestly, this just makes us feel bad for Ernie the Elephant. Keep it up, Ernie! Yellowtail The first wine Super Bowl commercial in 40 years comes to your courtesy of a grilling Kangaroo. MASCOTS KFC This spot approaches a Goldfinger-lickin’ good joke, but some horrors were not meant to be. Mr. Clean Mr. Clean is sexy now. What else is there to say? Sprint The former Verizon guy continues his traitorous ways. FANTASTICAL SITUATIONS Nintendo The new Nintendo platform looks fine, but the new Legend of Zelda game looks great. Evony: The King’s Return We’re gonna need a fact check on whether this game actually exists. TurboTax Pity the generation of children who will spend years having nightmares about Humpty Dumpty’s broken face. Avocados From Mexico The avocados also released a statement saying they will not pay for a wall. Skittles Psst! Wanna see my sweet new #SB51 commercial ahead of the game? You totally can! #TasteTheRainbow pic.twitter.com/iAFQfdk1gY— Skittles (@Skittles) January 24, 2017 Romance the rainbow, taste the rainbow, be slightly creeped out by the rainbow. Wendy’s Instead of freezing their burgers, at Wendy’s, they will actually kill a cow in front of you. OTHER Febreeze Odds are you will actually be taking a bathroom break when this commercial airs. King’s Hawaiian Cruel to give these kids buns, but deprive them of fillings of any kind. Lexus A Vogue insider says this video is the theme of next year’s Met Ball. TEASERS Bai drinks Just wait until you see Justin Timberlake (Trolls) in action. Mobile Strike Arnold will probably devote most of his commercial to arguing with Trump. Persil Before you Google, that is Peter Hermann of Younger. Snickers Snickers’s commercial is being filmed live. Anything could happen, but it will probably include a horse and Adam Driver. Tiffany & Co. Halftime show star Lady Gaga appears in Tiffany’s first Super Bowl commercial, but sadly does not wear her giant Joanne hat. WeatherTech Just how far does WeatherTech go? Take a look at our Super Bowl® teaser and decide for yourself! https://t.co/N7e8yzMJmo pic.twitter.com/SSb0w5YxFk— WeatherTech (@WeatherTech) January 31, 2017 Are the people in the WeatherTech commercial going to rob a bank? Is this the cover for the Ocean’s 8 heist? REJECTED GNC GNC’s commercial got rejected by the NFL over some of the substances that appear in a small number of GNC products. You can still watch the trailer here — if you have the courage, that is.

We’ll Find Out Thursday NVIDIA is expected to report another strong quarter, but can the high-flying GPU maker keep the momentum going? John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Feb 5, 2017 at 10:09AM NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1080 GPU.  IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA. Over the past year, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has rocketed to the stratosphere, up some 300%, and that means the GPU maker's financial results are more scrutinized than ever. When NVIDIA announces fourth-quarter earnings results on Thursday, Feb. 9, investors will be looking to see if it can prove itself worthy of its rich valuation. NVIDIA's gaming and automotive segments had generated impressive growth of 63% and 61%, respectively, in the fiscal third quarter. Analysts are expecting this growth to have continued in the fourth quarter. For all the talk about NVIDIA's efforts in artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles, gaming revenue is the largest operating segment and has been the main driver of growth in recent quarters, so it is important this segment continues to post strong results. Gaming revenue will be the main focus So far in fiscal 2017, gaming revenue is up 35% to $2.7 billion. NVIDIA has powered growth in its largest segment by continuing to innovate with the new Pascal GPUs. These new GPUs are starting to drive an upgrade cycle for PC gamers. High-end graphics cards are not cheap, so the question will be whether there was a strong enough lineup of PC games on the market in the fourth quarter to encourage gamers to upgrade. On this front, NVIDIA may already have good news. On Intel's Jan 26 quarterly conference call, management cited gaming as an area of strength in its business during the quarter. Advanced Micro Devices also reported strong results driven by GPU sales. We'll find out soon if NVIDIA shared in its competitors' success. No matter how strong the gaming segment performed in the recent quarter, investors will be more interested in how NVIDIA handles upcoming hurdles. One potential hurdle is competition from AMD's re-entry into the high-end GPU market with its Vega GPU. If AMD takes back some of the market share it lost, NVIDIA will face a difficult year-over-year comparison with financial results in the last two quarters of fiscal 2018. Automotive segment is small but growing fast Unlike the potential near-term challenges in the gaming segment, NVIDIA's opportunities with autonomous vehicles are big enough that it should continue growing the automotive segment. At the recent 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, NVIDIA announced a partnership with Audi to produce a self-driving car by 2020. Management will likely get questions from analysts about the near-term and long-term implications for NVIDIA's automotive segment as a result of this announcement. Automotive revenue for the first nine months in fiscal 2017 grew 58% to $359 million. The segment represents less than 10% of NVIDIA's total revenue, but this could quickly become a billion-dollar business if NVIDIA can continue applying its DRIVE PX 2 platform with other manufacturers throughout the transportation industry. Looking ahead Analysts are expecting NVIDIA to report $0.83 in earnings per share, which would represent more than 100% growth year over year. Once NVIDIA reports its actual results for the fiscal fourth quarter, all attention will be on management's outlook for the next quarter. Analysts already have high expectations looking out through the fiscal first quarter. As of this writing, analysts are expecting nearly 100% growth year over year in earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to how management characterizes the year ahead. All in all, NVIDIA's momentum will continue as long as there is growing demand for its gaming GPUs -- driven by a steady release schedule of quality games -- and as long as NVIDIA is successful in applying its GPU technology to a variety of industries. In that respect, management's comments about existing and new partnerships will be important. John Ballard owns shares of Nvidia. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Nvidia.

The 12-minute halftime show, sponsored by Pepsi, will feature Lady Gaga performing under a canopy of shimmering drones, CNN reported Saturday citing sources familiar with the production, which Variety can confirm. It’s the first time drones will be used in a live TV event, and the first time the robotic aircraft will appear in the Super Bowl. Neither Gaga nor the event’s organizers have revealed the set list for the halftime show. According to Twitter, the top four songs that fans tweeting about Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl perf are hoping she sings are “Telephone,” “Bad Romance,” “Poker Face” and “Born this Way.” Related Lady Gaga Performs Patriotic, High-Flying Super Bowl Halftime Show (Watch) Along with the drone light display, Lady Gaga also may make her halftime entrance by descending from the roof of the stadium. Gaga apparently confirmed rumors about the stunt on a radio show last week, revealing that it was her sister’s idea to fly her above the pitch, per the New York Times. Meanwhile, the internet was abuzz that Beyonce may make a cameo performance with Lady Gaga (aka Stefani Germanotta) at the show, after Gaga posted a photo on Instagram on Feb. 2 with the caption “Houston, you are beautiful,” followed by a bee emoji. But Gaga dispelled the rumor on Thursday, saying that Queen Bey will not be joining her on the field, according to CBS Sports. (Recall that Beyonce last week broke Instagram’s record for a most-liked post with a double baby-bump photo announcing she is pregnant with twins.) Tony Bennett, though, is scheduled to appear in a video intro for Lady Gaga. UPDATE, 9:30 p.m. ET: The 300 drones for Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl show were supplied by Intel, which has been touting its Shooting Star GPS-controlled drones outfitted with advanced LED lights. However, the Intel drone light display wasn’t live: The sequences featured in the Fox telecast were recorded earlier in the week, according to an Intel rep, confirming a report by tech site the Verge. The tech company’s drones — which can create more than 4 billion color combinations — made their public debut in an eight-week engagement over the 2016 holiday season for a live daily light show at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida that required a fleet of 300 drones to be airborne for 12 minutes. Watch Intel’s video detailing a 500-drone light display, staged last October: Even though it didn’t occur during the actual Super Bowl, the drone light show still required special permission from the FAA, which established a 34.5-mile-radius “no-drone zone” around NRG Stadium for the game for safety and security reasons. Related Super Bowl as a Politics-Free Zone? With Trump, Lady Gaga and Some Ads, That’s Doubtful Intel was involved in another Super Bowl first: The company is working with Fox Sports to create 360-degree replays recreated as of they were from the point of view of players on the field. An array of 38 cameras positioned around NRG Stadium will capture video to generate the POV replays, which Fox plans to incorporate in the Super Bowl telecast.

Search Box Search This Blog Sunday, February 5, 2017 Video - Portland teen discovers cost-effective way to turn salt water into drinkable fresh water. Video - Portland teen discovers cost-effective way to turn salt water into drinkable fresh water. (KPtv) A Portland teen is turning heads across the country all because of a science experiment that began in his high school classroom. Companies like Intel and universities like MIT are now invested in his findings. With certainty you'll want to remember his name. "My name is Chaitanya Karamchedu, but you can call me Chai," said the Jesuit High School Senior. Karamchedu has big plans of changing the world. "1 in 8 people do not have access to clean water, it's a crying issue that needs to be addressed," said Karamchedu. He made up his mind to address the matter himself. "The best access for water is the sea, so 70 percent of the planet is covered in water and almost all of that is the ocean, but the problem is that's salt water," said Karamchedu. Isolating drinkable water from the ocean in a cost effective way is a problem that's stumped scientists for years. "Scientists looked at desalination, but it's all still inaccessible to places and it would cost too much to implement on a large scale," Karamchedu added. Karamchedu figured it out, on his own, in a high school lab. "The real genesis of the idea was realizing that sea water is not fully saturated with salt," Karamchedu said. By experimenting with a highly absorbent polymer, the teen discovered a cost effective way to remove salt from ocean water and turn it into fresh water. "It's not bonding with water molecules, it's bonding to the salt," said Karamchedu. It's his creativity that makes this a big deal. "People have been looking at the problem from one view point, how do we break those bonds between salt and the water? Chai came in and thought about it from a completely different angle," said Jesuit High School Biology Teacher Dr. Lara Shamieh. "People were concentrated on that 10 percent of water that's bonded to the salt in the sea and no one looked at the 90 percent that was free. Chai just looked at it and said if 10 percent is bonded and 90 percent is free, then why are we so focused on this 10 percent, let's ignore it and focus on the 90." It's a breakthrough that's estimated to impact millions of lives if ever implemented on a mass scale. "What this is compared to current techniques, is that it's cheap and accessible to everyone, everyone can use it," said Shamieh. Scientists across the country are taking note. He won a $10,000 award from the US Agency for International Global Development at Intel's International Science Fair and second place at MIT's TechCon Conference where he won more money to continue his research. "They were very encouraging, they could see things into it that I couldn't, because they've been working their whole lives on this," said Karamchedu. A contribution to science that's sure to make a difference. Though he's not done yet. "Now, he's working on at least mentally thinking about the idea of killing cancer cells from the inside out. I keep telling him to remember his high school biology teacher when he wins the Nobel prize," said Shamieh.

 Snapchat has partnered with an ad agency to begin investing in tech startups Lara O'Reilly Feb. 2, 2017, 9:24 AM 2,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel. Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Time Inc Snap Inc., Snapchat's parent company, has formed a partnership with IPG-owned ad agency R/GA and its "marketing tech venture studio," the companies announced in a press release. The R/GA Marketing Tech Venture Studio is similar to a tech accelerator, inviting early-stage and later-stage startups from the marketing tech industry to apply for the five-month program, which ends with a demo day at R/GA's New York City headquarters in September. The studio is looking for startups that work on areas to improve mobile advertising — such as machine learning, optimization, and data analytics. The 10 startups selected will get access to Snap, R/GA, and the IPG network's teams, who will help them build their businesses and offer advice, networking, and the opportunity to access executives and projects at sponsors including Intel, IBM Watson, and American Airlines. In addition, each company will be invited to present their businesses to "global brand leaders" at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in June. R/GA will also invest up to $120,000 in the selected startups in exchange for up to 6% equity. Snap will be co-investing, although the company is not providing specifics on the value of those investments. For Snap, the program gives it the opportunity to get first-look at the types of technologies that could help it boost its revenues in the future. Plus, it will help the company build on its relationships with ad buyers across the IPG group. The company has reportedly been seeking advertising commitments of $100 million upwards from all the major advertising holding companies. Snap Inc. chief strategy officer Imran Khan said in a statement: "We believe that mobile engagement has given rise to some of the best and most unique advertising opportunities. We are excited to work with R/GA and IPG to support innovative companies that help marketers provide creative and effective advertising experiences.” The venture studio — R/GA's eighth startup program — isn't the first time Snap has formed a partnership with an ad agency group. Back at Cannes Lions 2015, Snap formed a partnership with the world's largest advertising holding company, WPP, and The Daily Mail to launch a content marketing agency called Truffle Pig. Snap is expected to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange at some point this week in an initial public offering valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion.

The 12-minute halftime show, sponsored by Pepsi, will feature Lady Gaga performing under a canopy of shimmering drones, CNN reported Saturday citing sources familiar with the production, which Variety can confirm. It’s the first time drones will be used in a live TV event, and the first time the robotic aircraft will appear in the Super Bowl. Neither Gaga nor the event’s organizers have revealed the set list for the halftime show. According to Twitter, the top four songs that fans tweeting about Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl perf are hoping she sings are “Telephone,” “Bad Romance,” “Poker Face” and “Born this Way.” Related Lady Gaga Performs Patriotic, High-Flying Super Bowl Halftime Show (Watch) Along with the drone light display, Lady Gaga also may make her halftime entrance by descending from the roof of the stadium. Gaga apparently confirmed rumors about the stunt on a radio show last week, revealing that it was her sister’s idea to fly her above the pitch, per the New York Times. Meanwhile, the internet was abuzz that Beyonce may make a cameo performance with Lady Gaga (aka Stefani Germanotta) at the show, after Gaga posted a photo on Instagram on Feb. 2 with the caption “Houston, you are beautiful,” followed by a bee emoji. But Gaga dispelled the rumor on Thursday, saying that Queen Bey will not be joining her on the field, according to CBS Sports. (Recall that Beyonce last week broke Instagram’s record for a most-liked post with a double baby-bump photo announcing she is pregnant with twins.) Tony Bennett, though, is scheduled to appear in a video intro for Lady Gaga. UPDATE, 9:30 p.m. ET: The 300 drones for Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl show were supplied by Intel, which has been touting its Shooting Star GPS-controlled drones outfitted with advanced LED lights. However, the Intel drone light display wasn’t live: The sequences featured in the Fox telecast were recorded earlier in the week, according to an Intel rep, confirming a report by tech site the Verge. The tech company’s drones — which can create more than 4 billion color combinations — made their public debut in an eight-week engagement over the 2016 holiday season for a live daily light show at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida that required a fleet of 300 drones to be airborne for 12 minutes. Watch Intel’s video detailing a 500-drone light display, staged last October: Even though it didn’t occur during the actual Super Bowl, the drone light show still required special permission from the FAA, which established a 34.5-mile-radius “no-drone zone” around NRG Stadium for the game for safety and security reasons. Related Super Bowl as a Politics-Free Zone? With Trump, Lady Gaga and Some Ads, That’s Doubtful Intel was involved in another Super Bowl first: The company is working with Fox Sports to create 360-degree replays recreated as of they were from the point of view of players on the field. An array of 38 cameras positioned around NRG Stadium will capture video to generate the POV replays, which Fox plans to incorporate in the Super Bowl telecast.

With avid fans and professional users demanding more from the Cupertino-based tech giant’s most powerful notebook line, rumors are high that Apple might very well address all the MacBook Pro’s issues this 2017. If speculations prove true, a 32GB RAM, Kaby Lake MBP could be set for release later this year. The 2016 MacBook Pro was the first real upgrade to Apple’s esteemed professional-grade laptop line in years. After holding out on a redesign and a major update for the year, the Cupertino-based tech giant opted to roll out a number of radical changes to its most iconic laptop last October. Despite the 2016 MacBook Pro’s innovative new features, however, the powerful device was met with mixed reviews from longtime Apple fans and critics alike. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] One of the main reasons behind the 2016 MacBook Pro’s criticisms is the device’s raw specs. Powered by an aging Intel Skylake processor and capping off its RAM at 16GB, many felt that the device’s premium price point was largely unwarranted. Coupled with a hate-it-or-like-it keyboard and a lack of USB-A ports, the MacBook Pro 2016 appeared for the most part like an upgraded version of the controversial 12-inch MacBook, which was introduced a couple years ago. If rumors are true, however, 2017 could finally be the year when Apple’s MacBook Pro would once more be worthy of its moniker. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities and one of the most reputable sources for Apple leaks in the industry, has weighed in on the future of the MacBook Pro in a MacRumors report. According to the esteemed analyst, Apple’s power laptop would see a notable upgrade to its internals in 2017, coupled with a significant price cut for the 2016 models. Headlining the speculated MacBook Pro 2017 upgrades is the actual inclusion of a Kaby Lake chip and support for up to 32GB of RAM. A Kaby Lake chip makes perfect sense for Apple’s most powerful laptop since its aging processor could be considered as one of the 2016 MacBook Pro’s most notable weaknesses. By upgrading the flagship laptop to Intel’s powerful Kaby Lake processors, the 2017 MacBook Pro would finally have enough processing power to justify its fairly high price. After all, practically all of the MacBook Pro’s Windows-powered rivals have already embraced Kaby Lake chips since last year. Thus, with the adoption of Intel’s seventh-generation chips, Apple would effectively be catching up to the competition. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Among the most notable predictions from Kuo that has managed to get the full attention of fans is the 2017 MacBook Pro’s support for up to 32GB of RAM. When the current generation MBPs launched last October, power users who delve into video editing and heavy graphics processing were largely disappointed that Apple’s flagship laptop caps off at 16GB of memory. While 16GB of RAM is adequate for most tasks, it could prove inadequate when intensive, professional-grade applications are being run. With 32GB of RAM, however, processing becomes a completely different story, according to a MacWorld report. Lastly, one of the most recent rumors about the 2017 MacBook Pro is the idea that the powerful laptop would be equipped with a special chip designed by Apple itself. This chip, internally code-named as the T310 processor, is speculated to handle the MacBook Pro 2017’s low-power tasks, such as email updates, while the laptop is in Sleep mode. This rumored chip is a variant of the custom processor powering the MacBook Pro 2016’s Touch Bar. By utilizing a highly efficient chip for the upcoming flagship laptop’s low-power tasks, Apple would be able to create a laptop that is truly power-efficient. The 2017 MacBook Pro might very well be what the 2016 MacBook Pro was supposed to be. Apple’s MBP line for 2016, while revolutionary in their own right, just had far too many compromises to make it a justifiable purchase for numerous Apple fans and everyday consumers alike. Considering the rumors surrounding the 2017 MacBook Pro, however, it appears that Apple is finally catching up to the competition and making a laptop that is both powerful and worthy of its premium price.

Gigabyte has unveiled an IoT gateway that taps Intel’s new 14nm fabricated “Apollo Lake” chips, in this case the quad-core, 1.1/2.5GHz Pentium N4200 with 6W TDP. The EL-30 follows a series of Intel Braswell-based EL-20 IoT gateways, which are primarily promoted as being Windows and Android devices, but also support Ubuntu. By contrast, the EL-30, which is due to ship in the second quarter, gives Ubuntu 16.04 LTS equal billing with Windows 10 IoT, Windows 10, and Android Nougat (7.0). EL-30, front and back (click images to enlarge) Like many IoT gateways, the fanless EL-30 offers dual Gigabit Ethernet ports and extensive wireless support, but it’s the first we can recall that sports dual HDMI (1.4b) outputs. The audio-ready HDMI ports are driven by the Intel HD Graphics 505 GPU to up to 3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz resolution. This would suggest an upward expansion of the IoT concept to media applications like remote digital signage or surveillance. The 140.8 x 107.5 x 29.5mm, 560-gram EL-30 is sized like the EL-20 gateways except for being two millimeters taller. The gateway supports up to 8GB of dual-channel DDR3L-1600/1866 RAM, and comes standard with 32GB eMMC. A microSD slot is also available. EL-30 detail views (click image to enlarge) In addition to the dual GbE ports, communications are enabled by a WiFi and Bluetooth module installed in the half-size mini-PCIe slot. There’s also a full-sized mini-PCIe where you can add 3G and mSATA storage. Dual WiFi and single 3G antennas connectors are said to be available. The photos show a fourth antenna, however, which is probably an antenna for the optional ZigBee radio. EL-30 with antennas (left) and internal detail view (click images to enlarge) The EL-30 features 4x USB 3.0 ports, an audio combo jack (Realtek ALC255), an RS485/232 serial interface via an RJ45 port, and a “Micro-B” RS232 full-duplex port. There’s also a TPM header for an optional security chip, as well as 2x LEDs. The manual, but not the product page, also lists internal SATA, GPIO, SPI/SMB, a USB 2.0 header, a Kensington Lock interface, and SIM Card slot interfaces, as seen in the image above. The EL-30 has a DC jack and a wide-range 12-19V power input with an AC 100 to 240V adapter. The system runs at 65W/3.42A, and supports 0 to 40°C temperatures. Gigabyte’s embedded line also includes a Bay Trail Atom-based GB-TCV1A Wind River Validated Intelligent IoT Gateway Solution, which supports Wind River Linux and Fedora in addition to Android and Windows.   Further information The EL-30 gateway will be available in Q2 2017 at an unstated price. More information may be found at Gigabyte’s EL-30 product page.   Related posts: Rugged, compact IoT gateway runs Linux on Apollo Lake Embedded controller powers up with Apollo Lake Fanless, linux-ready gateway builds on first-gen UP board 3.5-inch Apollo Lake SBC hands you a sixpack of USB 3.0 Pico-ITX Apollo Lake SBC gives you expansion options Rugged IoT gateway runs Linux on Atom Embedded PC roll-out spans Apollo Lake and Bay Trail First 3.5-inch Apollo Lake single board computers appear Compact, rugged IoT gateway runs Linux on Quark Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston, where the NFL Fan Experience as well as the Media Center is located, on Feb. 1, 2017. Super Bowl LI takes place in Houston on Sunday. Photo Credit: Getty Images advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS Homeland Security, FBI work with local authorities, NFL in probing leads Documents illustrate numerous incidents investigated in past Confetti still was falling on Seattle Seahawks players celebrating their Super Bowl victory three years ago when a Homeland Security director sent the closest thing to a congratulatory email to officers. The director’s email, sent seven minutes after the end of Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium, said: “We encountered a few minor security incidents — all resolved and deemed nonthreatening to SB48 operations. It was a nice, safe (and thankfully warm) game.” Super Bowl Pats’ McCourty won’t go to White House Pats take victory lap, parade Boston for Super Bowl win Patriots' Super Bowl parade Falcons’ new OC: Alabama’s Steve Sarkisian Brady giving James White Super Bowl MVP car Super Bowl LI will be played in Houston on Sunday evening, and security again is of the utmost concern. FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza told Newsday that security planning for this Super Bowl began three years ago. “The Super Bowl is a classic symbolic target, and that’s what the bad guys like to hit, because it puts them front and center to the world,” former FBI agent James Conway told Newsday on Tuesday. The Super Bowl XLVIII email, along with dozens of Homeland Security and FBI documents obtained by Newsday via a Freedom of Information Act request, illustrate the seemingly endless and perhaps unenviable task of maintaining safety at the nation’s biggest sporting event. Conway spent 15 years working in counterterrorism and now runs Houston-based consulting firm Global Intel Strategies. He said the reports obtained by Newsday show a limited window into the inner workings of security at an event such as the Super Bowl. According to a Homeland Security summary, the incidents that were investigated during the New York-area Super Bowl included multiple false bomb threats, a threat of an aerial attack, someone threatening “to make the power go out at the Super Bowl again” (a reference to the power outage that stopped play at the previous Super Bowl) and a person arrested for flying a drone around Times Square, near where the Super Bowl fan festivities were being held. advertisement | advertise on newsday Most notably, the documents omit the methods by which agents investigate each lead. “I was in the FBI a long time, and a lot of what is done is secret because we don’t want to tell the bad guys what we’re doing,” Conway said. “People will see some of the security and some of the security they will not see.” Conway added, “We’ve been doing this for so long that it becomes more and more sophisticated and more and more detailed every year. You can rest assured that in the three years since the Super Bowl in New York, today there are more elements in place that weren’t there then.” What those elements are, no one is saying — also by design. Garza, the FBI spokeswoman, declined to say how many officers are involved with security at the Super Bowl. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said this past week that authorities are ready to handle any protests that might occur in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and immigration. Giants videos “I have no concerns related to that,” NFL security chief Cathy Lanier said during the NFL’s annual pregame security briefing Wednesday in Houston. Homeland Security chief financial officer Chip Fulghum — who is the department’s second-in-command — noted that there are 41 federal agencies working with the NFL’s security team and the Houston Police Department. The NFL said it has hired more than 4,000 private security and crowd management personnel to work at the Super Bowl. “We have visible security and behind-the-scenes security as well,” Fulghum said. FBI special agent Perrye Turner added, “We hope you don’t see us this week, but know that we are there.” Officials said there are no credible threats, but as the Homeland Security documents obtained by Newsday show, what often goes unnoticed is the work that takes place behind the scenes to determine that a threat is not credible. The documents list more than 100 incidents of suspicious activity that raised to the level of requiring further investigating. advertisement | advertise on newsday “Intelligence is really important,” said Fulghum, the Homeland Security CFO. “Our federal partners in the state and county and local intelligence agencies are doing a really good job in monitoring the threat stretch around the region, the state, the country and the world.” Enter your email address to subscribe to Newsday's Sports Now newsletter sign up    Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

New Balance is getting in on the action with the RunIQ Smartwatch which has just gone on sale for $299.99. Some unexpected players have started making wearables and smartwatches over the past few years. Fossil we expected, Garmin and New Balance… not so much. The latter has just released the RunIQ Smartwatch, and it has a sport look that’s geared towards the fitness crowd. That means it has some unique features built-in but still retains its Android sensibilities thanks to the platform. New Balance isn’t known for making tech, so they teamed up with Google, Intel and Strava for the RunIQ Smartwatch. We already know what the first two companies were in charge of while Strava is handling the fitness part. Through the setup you’ll be able to keep tabs of your workouts online or off, and you will get the usual tracking features as well like a pedometer, heart rate scanner, and pace/distance. When it comes to the specs, the RunIQ Smartwatch is about what you’d expect when compared to other devices in its class. Unfortunately, they don’t have the specs listed but we do know it will have a GPS and an Intel processor to go along with Android Wear. It will be water-resistant to a degree as well, so no worries if you are a heavy sweater. The design is far from groundbreaking, but it isn’t a bad looking watch considering it’s sporty exterior. You never know how folks are going to take to a new wearable, especially one that’s not geared towards everyone. Well, it appears consumers like the RunIQ Smartwatch as it’s currently sold out on Amazon with a ship date of 1-2 months. As we all know, that can change overnight but if you want to purchase one now, New Balance has them in stock for $299.99.

(Matt Cowan/Getty Images) BY Nicole Bitette NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, February 4, 2017, 2:05 PM Lady Gaga — and drones — ooh, la la! The "Bad Romance" singer's Super Bowl LI halftime show will reportedly feature hundreds of drones, CNN reports. Gaga, 30, who is set to take the stage on Sunday for her first time, will be incorporating lit-up drones by the hundreds, a source close to production told CNN. The area surrounding NRG stadium in Houston is in an area where drones are banned by the Federal Aviation Administration. Lady Gaga should get political during Super Bowl Halftime show Pra quem não viu ontem: vazou a produção do halftime ensaiando com drones formando GAGA em cima do estádio que acontecerá o evento! pic.twitter.com/yQllZpRj6W— Felipe 🏈 (@Felipe_Oif) January 27, 2017 A rep from FAA said special approval wouldn't be needed for the performance since it is a domed stadium.  This will be the first time drones are part of a halftime show. It was first speculated that Gaga would use drones after a volunteer at the stadium took a video of drones forming the letter "G" in lights. The project is reportedly helmed by Intel, who worked to create the pop star's innovative David Bowie tribute performance during last year's Grammys. 25 photos view gallery Look back at the most memorable halftime shows ahead of Super Bowl LI Intel did not respond to a request made for comment. Can Lady Gaga compare to the top 10 Super Bowl moments? Lady Gaga — born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta — was reportedly told by the NFL not to get political during the performance. Last year, Beyoncé came under fire for making an overtly political statement in support of the Black Lives Matter movement by wearing Black Panther-inspired costumes. Musician Lady Gaga will take the stage during Super Bowl LI on Sunday along with hundreds of drones. (CHARLES PLATIAU/REUTERS) Music insiders say Gaga's fans are hoping she'll make some sort of statement while she has such a huge platform at her disposal. The Grammy winner, however, said she wants to celebrate "inclusion" and the "spirit of equality" on Sunday. A rep for Gaga did respond to request for comment. "This performance is for everyone," she said Thursday at a press conference. "I want to, more than anything, create a moment that everyone that's watching will never forget." Tony Bennett will join Gaga at some point during her performance, but it is unclear if any other guests will take the stage.

Register for an Exam Today> Super Bowl Online: Tech Tips for Game Day By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 04 2017 Wondering what time does the 2017 Super Bowl start? Super Bowl 51 between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons at NRG Stadium in Houston begins at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time, 3:30 p.m. Pacific time. FOX will broadcast Super Bowl LI, and also livestream the game on the Fox Sports Go app and FoxSportsGo.com. You can watch the Super Bowl online for free, but there are a few catches. For starters, you're out of luck on phones unless you're a Verizon customer. And if you're interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here's your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Watching the Game It's true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV. You can join them even if you don't have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it's free. If you can't get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you're a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. Watching the Ads The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads. A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox's online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren't participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only; a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube's AdBlitz. Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn't planning to this year. You don't have to wait until Sunday, as many of the ads are already available online. Gizmos Galore Fox is partnering with Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn't mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it's using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don't expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung's Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won't be as immersive. You'll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. Video Extras Fox has video specials throughout the week on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, Fox is offering a backstage look before the game; the online-only NFL Field Pass stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warmups and various stadium activities. It's not clear whether Fox's pre-game and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it's possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn't respond to inquiries for clarification. If that's something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that's only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. Digital Smarts Virtual assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa have been tweaked to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you're on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, "Alexa, give me a Patriots burn" or "Alexa, give me a Falcons burn." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Is Snapchat the New Facebook? 5. Filing Gets Snapchat IPO Ball Rolling Next Article > Will Snapchat's $3 Billion IPO Boom or Go Bust? By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 03 2017 Snap, the company behind the Snapchat mobile messaging app best known for its commitment to privacy, is ready to go public. The company will be listing itself on the New York Stock Exchange for a whopping $3 billion. It's a bold move for a business that has amassed a $1.2 billion deficit over the past five years, leaving many pondering whether the IPO will boom or go bust. The filing is providing a first look inside the company that was once famous primarily as a sexting service, because images would disappear shortly after viewing. One of the more intriguing details of Snap’s IPO filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission is that the company has just entered into a $400 million agreement with Google Cloud Platform to provide infrastructure and services for the soon-to-be public company. Oh, Snap According to the SEC filing, the agreement between Snap and Google has an initial term of five years, and requires Snap to purchase at least $400 million of cloud services in each year of the agreement. However, for each of the first four years, up to 15 percent of this amount may be moved to a subsequent year. That sounds like a hefty sum, particularly for a company that has so far failed to turn a profit in its five-year history. In fact, the company posted a staggering $514.6 million loss last year and only $404.5 million in revenues. And those numbers are even worse than the previous year’s loss of $372.9 million. Over its five-year existence, the company has posted a whopping $1.2 billion deficit. User adoption has slowed recently as well. The company reported only gaining 15 million new users in the past six months, down from the 36 million it had picked up in the previous six months. Snap has also struggled to monetize its business, bringing in less revenue per user than other social networks such as Facebook. Nevertheless, the company has succeeded in turning heads among Silicon Valley investors and competitors. In fact, just three years ago Facebook, one of Snapchat’s most important competitors, offered to acquire the company for $3 billion in cash. The upcoming IPO will value the company at somewhere between $20 billion and $25 billion. Facing Apple and Google While Snapchat is seen primarily as a social media platform competing with the likes of Facebook, Snap described itself as a “camera company” in its IPO filing, listing Apple and Google as the companies that present the greatest risk to its business model. Both Apple and Google exercise enormous amounts of control over the mobile device environment, thanks to the near ubiquity of the iOS and Android operating systems. That puts both companies in powerful positions to hamstring the Snapchat mobile app if they decide to roll out competing products of their own. "We may be able to create new products based on advances in their capabilities, but we may also be limited if they choose to block a particular feature or reject new updates in our application," Snap said of the two companies in its security filing.

Brown Convention Center in Houston. (Photo: Tannen Maury, EPA) 35 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE It’s called Super Bowl Sunday for a reason Americans can finally agree on one thing: It's time for some football. The Atlanta Falcons face the New England Patriots in Sunday’s championship game in Houston (Fox, 6:30 ET/3:30 PT). Patriots coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady are looking to win their fifth title together, while the Falcons are aiming to bring home the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the first time in franchise history. Lady Gaga will provide the halftime entertainment so expect a spectacle (and probably a political statement). President Trump is keeping with tradition and will give a Super Bowl Sunday interview (Fox’s Bill O’Reilly gets the honors). Not into the game? Tune in for the commercials.

While Patriots coach Bill Belichick undoubtedly spent the past week drawing plays for his New England Patriots to run against the Atlanta Falcons a half-dozen groups met in secret to create a different type of game plan: organizing anti-Trump marches and rallies that will occur throughout the weekend and culminate at NRG Stadium. The goal? To present a united front against the president’s immigration policies. This may mean Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady aren’t done answering questions about their close relationships with the president. Demonstrators protest against President Trump's executive order temporarily suspending the entry of travelers from seven majority Muslim countries during a rally outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 30, 2017.  (Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) Banning immigrants? We've been here before On Feb. 5, 1917, Congress passed a law banning immigrants from a region including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and most of China. A century later, the world is reeling from more than just echoes of this damaging era. The centennial arrives Sunday, nine days after President Trump signed an executive order that barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days, and refugees for 120 days. The order shocked the globe, but experts see established nativist sentiments in this country that took root long before Trump took his oath of office, or a century-old immigration law took effect. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The Immigration Act of 1917 was one of the most discriminatory immigration acts in American history. Now critics say history is repeating itself under President Trump. USA TODAY Louvre to reopen after attack The Louvre will reopen Saturday after a man wielding a macheteattacked French soldiers near the Paris museum Friday. The soldiers shot down the man, who was seriously wounded and has been hospitalized. A police union official said the man, who was carrying two backpacks and two machetes, tried to stab a soldier when told he could not bring his bags into the Carrousel Du Louvre, an underground shopping center connected to the museum. The Louvre closed for the day after evacuating the hundreds who were inside the museum during the attack.

Minyanville 3 Tech Stocks That Will Win as Qualcomm Collapses By Scutify Feb 03, 2017 10:01 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. It's often stated by motivational speakers that the Chinese word for "crisis" is composed of two characters - one signifying danger, the other opportunity. It's also embarrassingly inaccurate. This goes to show you that if the crux of an investment argument invokes "the Chinese," stop! You might be getting had. Still, this "Chinese philosophy" is extremely relevant for tech stocks these days. Source: Shutterstock That's because semiconductor and digital communications giant Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is having a year to forget. Despite the fact that it's only early February, QCOM shares are down 18.5% year-to-date. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm is trading firmly below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. If something substantive doesn't happen soon, it risks repeating the disaster of 2015, when QCOM lost nearly 31%. The disaster that Qualcomm is currently facing was seen well in advance by those watching the industry closely. The crux of the issue is the company's technology licensing business. This is the most lucrative division for QCOM, accounting for the majority of its profits. By "selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems," QCOM had a monopoly. That's an incredible opportunity, so long as you don't get caught. Of course, they got caught. First, it was, you guessed it - the Chinese. Regulators in the world's second-biggest economy found Qualcomm guilty of violating their anti-monopoly law. Then, individual companies began filing complaints. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission got involved in mid-January, claiming that QCOM illegally maintained a monopoly. Shares never looked the same after that, and who knows when Qualcomm will recover. Those are questions that analysts will squabble over. But for rival tech stocks, they only have one message - better you than me. It's not just the fact that a major competitor is falling. This is a classic case where an enemy of an enemy is a friend. Furthermore, the benchmark Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA:XLK) is up 4.6% YTD. Granted, these aren't the best numbers, but it's much more preferable than what Qualcomm is going through. While QCOM is swimming with the sharks, here are three tech stocks that are now set up to win big! Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Click to Enlarge Undoubtedly, of all the tech stocks that were affected by Qualcomm, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands to be the biggest winner. On Jan. 20, AAPL filed suit against Qualcomm, alleging that the company "withheld $1 billion in rebates in retaliation for Apple cooperating with Korean efforts to open the radio chip market." Although it's difficult to call a stalwart like AAPL a "victim," the pattern of allegations is pretty damning. First, we already saw Qualcomm violate foreign anti-competition laws, and pay dearly for it. Second, Korean manufacturer Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) alleged similar shenanigans, although they later backed down. Finally, and most importantly, the FTC claimed that Qualcomm forced AAPL to use their chips to prevent competitor encroachment. For Qualcomm, Applr is its biggest customer, so the potential ramifications are deep and wide. Of course, Cupertino isn't going to shed any tears. Last October, AAPL "reported its first decline in annual sales and profit in 15 years," according to The Guardian. There are serious concerns that the king of consumer tech stocks has reached peak popularity. Whatever it is, Apple needs to boost its profitability. Getting out of unfavorable contracts is a good start. And with the world seemingly against Qualcomm, AAPL has an excellent chance of reviving itself at their expense. Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Intel Corporation (INTC) Click to Enlarge Although I believe that Apple will get the most benefit out of the QCOM fiasco, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has a strong case as well. I wouldn't be surprised if most people viewed it as a toss-up between the two titans. Among tech stocks, INTC is one of the most recognizable, but for the wrong reasons. Everybody knows the "Intel Inside" slogan, but the only problem is that it relates to the aging personal computer business. It's a common challenge for consumer tech stocks - INTC needs to find new blood. The company's revenue growth isn't the most consistent in the world. That's why the partnership last year between Intel and AAPL was a much-needed step in the right direction. Up until that point, Qualcomm was the sole provider of chips for the iPhone. In 2016, INTC stepped in to provide half the demand. Apparently, QCOM took exception to this arrangement; hence, the FTC charges of competitive foul play. So far, the market response towards Intel stock has been mixed. Therefore, I still give the advantage to Apple. Nevertheless, encouraging signs do exist. Yes, shares are down 4% from its high of the year. However, it's still very close to parity for the year. Furthermore, INTC remains inside a bullish trend channel that began in late summer of 2015. The collapse at Qualcomm just gives other tech stocks more options, and Intel is happy to help. ADVERTISEMENT Tech Stocks That Will Win as QCOM Falls: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO) Click to Enlarge While virtually all tech stocks are affected by the Qualcomm crisis, few were as glued to their TV screens as Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO). As a semiconductor and communications company themselves, AVGO is a direct competitor and rival to QCOM. Naturally, if your primary nemesis goes down hard, it raises the boat for everyone else. And Qualcomm is sinking quite nicely for the Singapore-based firm. It's not just the fact that QCOM has transitioned into the world's most hated stock. Nor is it the money that they'll have to dish out in penalties. Rather, Qualcomm will be forced to fundamentally change its business plan. If it doesn't, government watchdogs are on standby, eager to pounce. That just gives AVGO and others a leg up. Maybe Broadcom is no saint. However, at the moment, the spotlight isn't on it, providing a margin of comfort. Most importantly, AVGO is making the most of its "Chinese crisis." On a YTD basis, shares are up a smoking 16% - that's almost the exact inverse of Qualcomm's results. Furthermore, Broadcom is trending inside a steadily rising channel. With so much ugliness associated with its primary rival, it's hard not to see anything but optimism for AVGO.

(YouTube) About The Author Jessica Wong Senior online arts writer Jessica Wong is the longtime online arts and entertainment writer for CBC News. She's a fan of Harry Potter, musical theatre, Game of Thrones, Dave Chappelle's comedy, '90s R&B and those little Tasty videos.

U.S. Super Bowl commercials test future of CRTC ad policy 10 Super Bowl halftime shows that changed everything Judgment Day: the high stakes of Super Bowl advertising To stand out at Super Bowl LI, ads are going for stunts NFL alerts Trump to fight with CRTC over Super Bowl ads An epic Super Bowl commercial — reportedly costing about $5 million US for a 30-second window — is a complex confection requiring just the right balance of ingredients: great writing, plus a dose of humour or a dazzling feat, with a sprinkle of surprise. A tug of the heartstrings, a large helping of celebrity and a pinch of nostalgia never hurt. Think Old Spice's ideal man. Volkswagen's darling Darth Vader. Remember Apple's 1984-inspired Macintosh mini-movie or Larry Bird taking on Michael Jordan for a Big Mac? The goal is always to stand out from the pack. But for 2017, companies are going even further with social and political messages, envelope-pushing live stunts and — for most — campaigns that extend beyond TV across social media and online. Day 6 | From booing Lady Gaga to Belichick's hoodie: Here are the craziest things you can bet on at the Super Bowl This year also marks the first time Canadians can actually tune into these big-budget American spots (when watching on Fox), thanks to a CRTC decision banning simultaneous substitution for the championship match. The move has riled Canadian advertisers, Canadian broadcast rights holder Bell Media and the National Football League itself. Sure, the matchup of the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots is undoubtedly the main event and the often-outrageous Lady Gaga's halftime show a major draw, but millions will also be tuning in for the commercials. Here are standout ads, released early online, that have already made a splash. On the message track Budweiser: Call it prescient, defiant or just plain coincidence, but Budweiser's cinematic, months-in-the-works mini-movie Born the Hard Way — about co-founder Adolphus Busch's arrival in the U.S. as an immigrant — has definitely struck a chord, arriving amid the furor surrounding the Trump administration's travel ban. Audi: Expectations were high for Audi after its moving 2016 ad The Commander (memorably set to the late David Bowie's Starman) and the German carmaker has followed it up with a powerful, already controversial spot targeting gender inequality — a stronger message following an animated holiday season spot skewering gender stereotypes.  Kia: Choosing a more lighthearted approach for a spot highlighting environmental activism, Kia enlisted slapstick queen Melissa McCarthy to pitch its hybrid crossover.  Hulu: While this message is not directly socio-political, the streaming service has nonetheless grabbed a Super Bowl commercial slot to promote its anticipated series The Handmaid's Tale, based on the Margaret Atwood story that's among the dystopian classics that are resonating anew for audiences. Going for laughs Mercedes-Benz: Marking the 50th anniversary of its AMG high-performance line, Mercedes-Benz nabbed some heavy hitters from the past for its Super Bowl pitch: Easy Rider star Peter Fonda, Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild and acclaimed sibling filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen — with their quirky humour.  Intel: In a casting coup, Intel landed Tom Brady for a spot touting its 360-degree camera technology — typically used to replay thrilling sports moments — with some not-so-exhilarating scenes at home with the Patriots QB. Squarespace: John Malkovich + a frustrating web domain situation (based on a true story!) = audience win. And, in case you're wondering, the actor, filmmaker and designer really does have his own fashion line. WIX: What do you get if you mix Wonder Woman, Frank Martin from The Transporter and a budding chef? Apparently an action-packed, increasingly incredible series from web development firm WIX. Bud Light: Building on its latest motto "Famous Among Friends," Bud Light has several new offerings that toast friendship, including this bromantic best-man speech.  Mr. Clean: A famous American mascot gets sexy for Mr. Clean's latest Super Bowl spot. Long overdue or kinda creepy? You decide. T-Mobile: A "serious" Justin Bieber, "celebration expert," explores the so-called history of the touchdown dance with the help of NFL stars Rob Gronkowski and Terrell Owens.  ​ Buick: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Since the model + NFL star pairing worked well in 2016, Buick returned to the winning formula this year, casting Miranda Kerr and Cam Newton for its latest spot.  Live experiments Snickers: A western theme, Adam Driver and a horse: That's what we know about Snickers and the Super Bowl's first-ever live commercial, a 30-second ad that will be shot and broadcast in real time during the game's third quarter. It's a neat gambit that's worked for Target in the past (see Gwen Stefani and Imagine Dragons). We may just be seeing more of these.  Hyundai: Betting on Deepwater Horizon and Friday Night Lights director Peter Berg and Super Bowl attendees themselves, Hyundai is gambling on getting good footage from the stands in Houston to craft a 90-second commercial that will air immediately after the Super Bowl ends. Dazzlingly simple Lexus: Sometimes a straightforward concept is best. Lexus is offering up a sizzling Sia track, the spectacularly sinuous Lil Buck and a smooth star voiceover thanks to Minnie Driver.  Report Typo or Error Send Feedback To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Read More NEW DELHI: ShopClues, Policy-Bazaar and GirnarSoft, which runs auto portals CarDekho, Gaadi and ZigWheels, are contemplating listing on the Nasdaq, the American exchange that currently has the shares of new-age Indian companies like Make-MyTrip (MMT), Yatra Online and Azure Power trading on it. As valuations come under pressure and raising further rounds of funding becomes difficult, a listing may be one of few options for Indian tech and digital firms. And where better than the exchange that's home to tech and Internet bellwethers such as Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Amazon. Radhika Aggarwal, cofounder of ShopClues, pegs the ecommerce marketplace's valuation at over $1.1billion; the Tiger Global-backed venture claims to be on track to break even by year ended March 2018. "We will be ready to list by year-end," Aggarwal says. PolicyBazaar, an online financial products platform that has raised .`500 crore since inception in June 2008, is also eyeing a Nasdaq listing. "We are open to the idea," says cofounder Alok Bansal. The company, funded by Tiger Global and Premji Invest, claims to be on track to break even by the end of the current fiscal year. GirnarSoft chief financial officer Umesh Hora maintains that it may be worth exploring listing as the US platform is the go-to stock exchange for growth-oriented tech companies. MMT cofounder Deep Kalra believes this may be the right time to list as the ecosystem is maturing, even as another round of high-value funding looks tough. Yet, a Nasdaq listing calls for robust corporate governance and excellent processes. Do Indian Internet firms have all that? (Find out more in ET Magazine on Sunday.)

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 February 2017 by Military News ClearBridge Mutual Fund Manager Sticks To Stocks With Rising Dividends Shutterstock photo Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund ( SOPAX ) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends. The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31 , topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund’s 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%. His bull’s-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices. The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says. “Stretching for yield is risky,” he warns. “Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.” Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors’ rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes. Just look at some of his fund’s holdings. Among the fund’s four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD , Texas Instruments ( TXN ) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing ( ADP ) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%. IBD’S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD’s Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company’s growth metrics – like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth – stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup . That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president’s policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it. Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year. From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it’s wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund’s overall investment approach. IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks? Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded. We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn’t find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years. IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund’s expenses? Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up. And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on. IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What’s your thesis? Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable. IBD: Texas Instruments’ ( TXN ) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What’s driving it? Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they’re attractive because they are the largest player in that space. Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity. High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments’ chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders. IBD: Automatic Data Processing ( ADP ) got a nice Trump bump. But you’ve owed this for years, right? Clarfeld: It’s been a core holding for 10-plus years. It’s a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company’s payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business. And recently it’s benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase. IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back? Clarfeld: We’re a dividend portfolio. We don’t go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don’t want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it. Over the past 10 years, we’ve owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won’t initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he’s gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We’re not forecasting that, but we think they will. IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that? Clarfeld: Actually, it’s an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It’s cyclical with the economy. There’s been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they’ve been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation. IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names? Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can. And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators. IBD : Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth? Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what’s going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don’t own a lot of retailers because they’re hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They’re not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don’t need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it’s trading around the high 130s.) It’s a play on people spending on their homes. IBD: UnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation? Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.

President Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise to tax companies that make products overseas. Trump has pressured Apple CEO Tim Cook to make iPhones in the U.S., but the smartphone manufacturing industry is already entrenched in China, and making the move overseas would be a costly, time-consuming task.  (Spencer Platt / GETTY IMAGES)   By Marisa KendallThe Mercury News Sat., Feb. 4, 2017 SAN JOSE, CALIF.—When Pat McIntyre’s company started making its smart sprinkler system 10 years ago, ETwater’s production was done in China, where labour costs were cheaper. Today, the company, based in the Bay Area city of Novato, Calif., does its manufacturing at a production facility in Silicon Valley’s Santa Clara. Although McIntyre’s costs initially went up by 10 to 15 per cent, thanks to automation, his new factory is much more efficient. It also employs far fewer workers. As President Donald Trump pushes U.S. companies to make more products in the U.S., firms like ETWater and Tesla, which rely heavily on automation, illustrate that it can be done in some industries. But even if more Bay Area companies start making products in the U.S., experts in manufacturing and job creation say Trump’s pledge to tax offshore manufacturing isn’t likely to produce a boom in old-style factory jobs. And despite rising labour costs in China, it’s still cheaper for Apple — and consumers — to build smartphones overseas. Article Continued Below “The success of Tesla is a good example that you can bring manufacturing back to this country, for sure,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures and chairperson of the board of the National Venture Capital Association. “But don’t expect it to create a tremendous amount of jobs.” Since winning the election, Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise to tax companies that make products overseas and ship them to the U.S., meeting with tech and auto executives last week to talk tariffs. Last week, the White House announced a new Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, which will tap tech leaders, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell. Trump has also promised to ease regulations in the U.S. as an incentive for companies to bring production here. But not all tech gadgets are good candidates to return home. “The question everyone seems to be asking is: Will the iPhones come back?” said Andy Tsay, a business professor at Santa Clara University who specializes in global manufacturing. “My answer is: there’s not a good economic reason for it.” Trump has pressured Apple CEO Tim Cook to make iPhones here, but the smartphone manufacturing industry already is entrenched in China. Everything from the companies that make smartphone components to the technicians who repair the factory machines is there, Tsay said, and moving that massive ecosystem to the U.S. would be a costly and time-consuming endeavour. Some of that cost would be passed on to consumers. The price of a $749 iPhone 6s, for example, would increase between $30 and $40 if Apple assembled the product closer to its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, according to a report by the MIT Technology Review. If the phone’s components were also made in the U.S., the price likely would go up by $100. The auto industry faces a similar problem, AutoPacific analyst Dave Sullivan said. Union workers at U.S. auto manufacturing plants make almost $50 an hour, he said, compared to $7 or $8 in Mexico. “There’s a lot working against the notion of bringing auto manufacturing back to the U.S.,” he said. U.S. companies with overseas factories risk being demonized by the president on Twitter and watching their stock prices plunge as a result. But at least one global company appears to be taking advantage of Trump’s agenda. Taiwanese Foxconn, which makes iPhones and other electronics, is reportedly considering spending more than $7 billion to open a display-making plant in the U.S. Now companies in emerging Silicon Valley-centred fields, such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence, are primed to open local factories for everything from the cars themselves, to the semiconductors that go in those cars, to the cameras and other sensors used by AI technology, said Peter Leroe-Munoz, vice-president of technology and innovation for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. “I really see these emerging companies being localized here in Silicon Valley,” he said. “It’s going to make more and more economic sense to build, produce and ultimately sell in the same marketplace as where your expertise and ultimately your consumer base is.” And labour costs are rising in Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai after years of American factories pumping money into the local economies, Tsay said, making it less enticing for companies to build factories there. Chinese factories also tend to be less productive, while U.S. plants rely more on automation and require fewer human workers. At Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., factory, for example, which moved into an old Toyota plant in 2010, a combination of robots and skilled technicians and engineers replaced many of the blue-collar labourers who used to build Toyotas there. Tesla says it employs more than 6,000 people at the factory, including former workers who were retrained. ETwater started production of its smart sprinkler system in 2006 in China because it was cheaper, McIntyre said. In 2009, the average manufacturing worker in the U.S. made $34.19 an hour, compared to $1.74 in China, according to the most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But having a factory so far away made quality control difficult, McIntyre said. ETwater began transitioning to a Santa Clara factory in 2010. While the Chinese plant employed hundreds, McIntyre said, the more automated Santa Clara factory has about 50. After the move, the number of sprinklers returned by unhappy customers was cut in half. “If there is a quality issue, we’re there,” McIntyre said. “We can work collaboratively with our engineers.” Read more about: China, United States Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Libav Now Supports VA-API VP8 & MPEG2 Encode, Other Improvements Written by Michael Larabel in Multimedia on 31 January 2017 at 06:19 AM EST. Add A Comment For those continuing to make use of the FFmpeg-forked Libav project, a number of VA-API improvements have landed in recent days. The latest improvements to Libav pertaining to Intel's Video Acceleration API (VA-API) are VP8 encode support, MPEG-2 encode support, VBR mode support, and other small improvements. More details can be found via this Git query. Other VA-API-enabled programs have already supported VP8/MPEG-2 so it's not too much of a big deal, unless you're still relying upon Libav, but nevertheless it's always great seeing more Linux applications support VA-API/VDPAU for GPU-based video acceleration.

This is good news, rolling in off the back of AMD's impressive quarterly financial report.     We know that AMD is preparing a Ryzen CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads, at 4GHz - but we haven't known the model of this processor... until now. AMD will reportedly don the R7, R5, and R3 series of SKUs - with the flagship AMD R7 1800X processor 8C/16T, with the performance to reach the Core i7-6900K (which goes for $1037 on Amazon right now). We've been hearing about performance on the purported R7 1800X for a while now, but it seems like we can expect the X series models to be the "Black Edition" processors, primed for the enthusiasts.     AMD will have 5 processors in the Ryzen R7 family, which all feature 8C/16T of Zen goodness - led by the R7 1800X, and joined by the R7 PRO 1800, R7 1700X, R7 1700, and R7 PRO 1700. AMD will have its mid-range R5 series, which will come in 6C/12T variants, while the R3 will compete against Intel's new Pentium and Core i3 processors with 4C/4T.   As for pricing, we can only estimate that AMD will price its R7 1800X at the $499-$699 market - and motherboards should be cheaper than the Intel alternative, as well as a $300-$500 saving from the Core i7-6900K. I think the Ryzen R5 series processors will be one of the best-selling CPUs of 2017, with 6-core/12-thread CPU performance and 3.5GHz base clocks to be impressive if AMD can hit up the $200-$400 market with these CPUs.   ETA? AMD will unveil these processors in a couple of weeks, with a larger launch at GDC 2017 in early March. We will be covering the new Ryzen CPUs as much as we can, with previews, reviews, and trade show coverage in the coming weeks.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Galaxy TabPro S2 Kaby Lake-Powered 2-In-1 Get Bluetooth Certification – Could Arrive This Month By Omar Sohail Feb 2, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S2 lineup of 2-in-1 machines were supposed to get announced during the CES 2017 trade show, but their absence no doubt means that the company is going to be planning a different venue for these mobile computing slates. Turns out that the Galaxy TabPro S2 has finally received Bluetooth certification, suggesting that their official announcement might come this month. Galaxy TabPro S2 Will Maintain the Same 12-Inch Form Factor to Take on Different 2-in-1’s – Could Be Announced During MWC 2017 Taking a look at the certification sheet given below, you can see the design model number as SM-W727V. It has not been confirmed if this is going to be a Wi-Fi-only model, but we are certain that Samsung is going to be announcing LTE-capable 2-in-1s in the future. Receiving a Bluetooth certification means that the latest notebook replacement family could be announced very soon, possibly during the MWC 2017 trade show. These notebooks are expected to come touting Intel’s latest Kaby Lake series of processors, with the highest performing model coming with a Core i7 processor and hefty amounts of SSD storage and RAM. In a way, the Galaxy TabPro S2 is expected to be a close competitor of the Surface Pro 5, so getting announced early will help Samsung gain an early lead in the market, provided it is priced properly. With the era of Type-C USB ports highlighted, a Thunderbolt 3 port might be present on the Galaxy TabPro S2. Advertisement This particular port is known for its versatility and while it might give you a ton of headaches as far as port compatibility goes, a single Thunderbolt 3 port will grant the user with a ton of expansion freedom ranging from hooking up a secondary display, transfer data across devices using storage peripherals, provide power to the tablet, and attach several USB-A peripherals such as a keyboard, mouse or USB flash drives. Samsung Executive Sends Out Cautionary Message to Employees From Making Quality-Compromised Products The 2-in-1 is also expected to come with a slightly larger battery capacity as opposed to its predecessor while maintaining the same crisp Super AMOLED panels. Do you want the Galaxy TabPro S2 to be announced during the MWC 2017 trade show? Let us know your thoughts right away.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Global Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry to Witness Growing Demand for PaaS, Says TMR Report Global Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry to Witness Growing Demand for PaaS, Says TMR Report Posted on February 3, 2017 by ReleaseWire - Latest Press Releases in Press Releases Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 02/03/2017 — The competitive landscape of the global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry is crowded by the presence of a large number of players. The presence of a large number of participants has led to the fragmented nature of the market. Some of the major players operating in the global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry are Cisco Systems Inc., Carestream Health Inc., Carecloud Corp., AGFA Healthcare, IBM Corp., Cleardata Networks, Merge Healthcare Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., and Oracle Corp. "The high level of customization required by various healthcare organizations has resulted in the emergence of a large number of market players with unique expertise," a TMR analyst points out. This level of customized services prevents any form of standardization across the market. Browse Global Strategic Business Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/healthcare-cloud-computing.html Concerns About Data Leakage is a Major Challenge for Market Players Rapid transformations in the healthcare IT sector, coupled with the growing demand for security of access and data integrity have supported the growth of cloud computing in the healthcare industry. "An increasing number of companies are reducing investments in the creation and maintenance of a physical IT infrastructure and are shifting towards cloud computing for easier management of profiles," states TMR. However, data relocation from established systems is a major hiccup in the market's growth during the forecast horizon. Data integration and consistency is also another challenge faced by the market players. The growing concerns pertaining to data leakage have made a number of healthcare providers apprehensive about the adoption of the cloud computing technology. The market players are focusing on the introduction of wireless technologies in cloud computing solutions to allow remote access of data on a real-time basis. The increasing usage of ACOS for data sharing through mobile devices has created ample opportunities for the growth of the market players. PaaS to be Largely Preferred by the Healthcare Industry Among the major service models, the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model is expected to register the highest demand. "Simple application and high rate of deployment are the primary factors driving the demand for the PaaS model," states TMR. The PaaS model does not rely on hardware and software and offers support within the service's lifecycle. Though the market was dominated by the IaaS model in 2011, PaaS is anticipated to generate more revenue in the years to come. The global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry is projected to expand robustly at a CAGR of 21.30% during the period between 2012 and 2018. The market was valued at US$1.82 bn in 2011 and is anticipated to be worth US$6.79 bn by 2018. The information in this review is based on the statistical findings of a report published by Transparency Market Research, titled, "Cloud Computing Market In Healthcare Industry – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Trends And Forecast 2012 – 2018." Global cloud computing market in healthcare industry has been segmented as: By service models Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) By pricing models Spot pricing or subscription model Pay-as-you-go model By end users Clinical Information systems (CIS) Market EMR PACS RIS Others Non-clinical Information systems (NCIS) Market RCM Claims management APB Others Major geographies analyzed under this research report are: Europe North America Asia-Pacific Rest of the World Download Exclusive Brochure of This Report : http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=802 For more information on this press release visit: http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/global-cloud-computing-market-in-healthcare-industry-to-witness-growing-demand-for-paas-says-tmr-report-766390.htm Media Relations Contact Rohit Bhisey Head Transparency Market Research Telephone: 518-618-1030 Email: Click to Email Rohit Bhisey Web: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/ Latest News Mazzitti & Sullivan Counseling Services Launches New Website Introducing the First Guitar Stand ​That Fits in the Palm of Your Hand Cablefax is Now Accepting Entries for The FAXIES Awards; Entry Deadline March 3 A’ Photography Awards 2017 is Looking for Photographers with Outstanding Works who are Aiming at Getting Global Fame and Recognition Paso Robles Plumber Quality 1st Plumbing Announces Special Discount For Local Veterans Pixel Film Studios Announces TransFocus Layers for Final Cut Pro X Vernon Computer Source Offering $2,000 Scholarship National Debt Relief Explains When Debt Consolidation Is A Good And Bad Idea Uncorked Wine Tours Releases “Top Paso Robles Wine Tour Stops” List for 2017 Credit2B Announces Addition of Chief Product Officer © 2015 SSUChronicle.

Photo via Intel. Update: The drones — 300 of them — were indeed from Intel. The company collaborated with Lady Gaga and supplied the 280-gram quadcopters, which can create more than 4 billion color combinations. The drones created a red and blue moving star formation; an American flag; and a Pepsi logo followed by Intel’s logo at the end of the show. You can watch the drones here. Update No. 2: As Wired notes, the drones weren’t actually flying in real-time — Intel pre-recorded the show earlier in the week. Photo via Intel. Photo via Intel. “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience,” Josh Walden, general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, said in a statement. “The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of.” Our drones have returned to the ground after an amazing #PepsiHalftime show #ExperienceMore pic.twitter.com/Augpbt05u6 — Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 Le coup du drapeau américain avec des drones et son entrée par le toit, Lady Gaga fait en grand pour le #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/4Fw7H4XuLS — Bruno Guglielminetti (@Guglielminetti) February 6, 2017 Here are details about the software inside the drones, via Intel: Intel’s proprietary algorithms automate the animation creation process by using a reference image, quickly calculating the number of drones needed, determining where drones should be placed, and formulating the fastest path to create the image in the sky. Intel also partnered with FOX for its 360-degree replay technology during the Super Bowl. You can learn more about the company’s drones here. Original story: There will be a geeky aspect to Lady Gaga’s highly-anticipated Super Bowl halftime show performance. CNN reported Sunday that “hundreds of lit-up drones” will be used during the show — a Super Bowl first. You can expect the drones to be flying in unison, similar to how we’ve seen drones used in entertainment. Intel uses its Shooting Star quadcopters to create drone light shows, for example. The drones used during the halftime performance are exempt from the FAA’s no-drone zone around NRG Stadium in Houston on Sunday. Intel secured special waivers from the FAA.

The Atlanta Falcons will face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Fox will show the game online for free, but you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. (Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File) Related Coverage Super Bowl LI: A History of Super Bowl Halftime Performances in the Modern Era NEW YORK (AP) — You can watch the Super Bowl online for free, but there are a few catches. For starters, you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. And if you’re interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here’s your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday on Fox. ___ WATCHING THE GAME It’s true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV. You can join them even if you don’t have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it’s free. If you can’t get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you’re a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. Related: Gallery: How to sound like an NFL fan while watching the Super Bowl ___ WATCHING THE ADS The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads . A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox’s online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren’t participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only; a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube’s AdBlitz . Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn’t planning to this year. You don’t have to wait until Sunday, as many of the ads are already available online. ___ GIZMOS GALORE Fox is partnering with Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn’t mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it’s using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don’t expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won’t be as immersive. You’ll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. ___ VIDEO EXTRAS Fox has video specials throughout the week on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, Fox is offering a backstage look before the game; the online-only NFL Field Pass stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warmups and various stadium activities. It’s not clear whether Fox’s pre-game and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it’s possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn’t respond to inquiries for clarification. If that’s something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that’s only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. ___ DIGITAL SMARTS Virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have been tweaked to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you’re on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, “Alexa, give me a Patriots burn” or “Alexa, give me a Falcons burn.” Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Anick Jesdanun, AP Technology Writer NEW YORK — You can watch the Super Bowl online for free, but there are a few catches. For starters, you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. And if you’re interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here’s your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. Sunday on Fox. WATCHING THE GAME It’s true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV.

You can join them even if you don’t have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it’s free. If you can’t get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you’re a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. WATCHING THE ADS The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads . A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox’s online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren’t participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only; a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube’s AdBlitz . Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn’t planning to this year. You don’t have to wait until Sunday, as many of the ads are already available online. GIZMOS GALORE Fox is partnering with Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn’t mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it’s using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don’t expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won’t be as immersive. You’ll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. VIDEO EXTRAS Fox has video specials throughout the week on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, Fox is offering a backstage look before the game; the online-only NFL Field Pass stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warmups and various stadium activities. It’s not clear whether Fox’s pre-game and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it’s possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn’t respond to inquiries for clarification. If that’s something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that’s only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. DIGITAL SMARTS Virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have been tweaked to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you’re on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, “Alexa, give me a Patriots burn” or “Alexa, give me a Falcons burn.” Tags:  Super Bowl Super Bowl 2017 Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Denver Broncos Raiders reward coach Jack Del Rio with new 4-year contract February 11, 2017, 12:07 am The Oakland Raiders rewarded coach Jack Del Rio with a new four-year contract Friday, replacing the original four-year deal he received when he took the job in January 2015.

Image: bud light, screenshot By Patrick Kulp2017-02-05 18:15:01 UTC The Super Bowl: the one time of year people not only tolerate but actively seek out commercials.  Hell, if you're a cord-cutter or DVR owner with an ad blocker, it may be the one time of year you actually see commercials. Perhaps you were hoping this year's commercial breaks might provide an escape from our country's current political insanity. Wrong!  SEE ALSO: While the top teams compete in the Super Bowl, everyone else eats Budweiser probably didn't expect its German immigrant founder's story to be so controversial when it was greenlit last October, but it's taken on new meaning in our current political climate. One construction supply company even tried to include a border wall in its ad, but Fox wouldn't have it. Others are going to extreme lengths to stand apart from the crowd. Hyundai will become the first brand to film its post-game ad during the event itself. Snickers will air the first-ever live commercial with Adam Driver during the third quarter. As in the past few years, many advertisers tried to build buzz by releasing their ads ahead of time. After all, they did pay nearly $170,000 per second to air them. Below are all the Super Bowl ads we know of so far. We'll be updating the list throughout the game. The touchdowns Honda Honda leaned hard on star power with an ensemble of celebrities offering bits of light-hearted advice from their old high school yearbook photos.  Audi A thoughtful narrator dad wrestles with how to explain gender inequality to his young daughter as a race track serves as a metaphor. The equal pay message has already been slammed online by some who are critical of Audi's own gender diversity and others who are just mad about feminism.    Avocados from Mexico A secret illuminati-like order discusses how they faked the moon landing, deflated Tom Brady's footballs and oversold the number of shades of gray. Oh, and they also hid the health benefits of avocados for some reason. The whole premise is actually a sly reference to the fact that government regulators only recently let avocado suppliers advertise the fruit as "healthy." But you don't have to know about avocado bureaucracy to find it entertaining. GoDaddy  GoDaddy returns to the Super Bowl with a human embodiment of internet memes and not a single bikini in sight. Bai Christopher Walken — who seems to show up in every single Super Bowl — recites the lyrics to *NSYNC's "Bye, bye, bye" with Justin Timberlake. The former boy band star is actually an investor and "chief flavor officer" for flavored water brand Bai.  Mercedes-Benz The Coen Brothers directed their first-ever Super Bowl ad with this "Easy Rider" tribute starring Peter Fonda. Bud Light The ghost of Spuds Mackenzie, Bud Light's previously retired spokesdog, makes his triumphant return to the screen to convince some guy not to be a wet blanket. The original Spuds, a bull terrier whose real name was Honey Tree Evil Eye, died in 1993 and was last seen on TV in 1989. Budweiser Budweiser follows the journey of its founder, Adolphus Busch, from Germany to America. In our current political climate, it seems like a moving statement about the value of immigration but the company says it didn't intend it that way. T-Mobile Justin Bieber explains the evolution of the touchdown dance with help from a caveman Gronk and T.O. The carrier also brought co-stars and BFFs Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart together for a delightful conversation. Kristen Schaal plays a Verizon customer addicted to pain in yet another of the company's ads. NFL Mike Ditka, Joe Namath, Bill Belichick and other Super Bowl legends are surprisingly adorable in baby form. Squarespace John Malkovich is dogged by an imposter who's being John Malkovich in this clever nod to Being John Malkovich. Fun fact: In an ironic twist, Malkovich had to get the legal blessing  from the rights holders of that film to make this commercial. Kia Melissa McCarthy plays a hapless environmental activist who painfully fails at everything she does. It's supposed to be slapstick fun, but it comes off as a little dark given the recent onslaught of very real blows to environmentalism. Anyway, she's promoting an eco-friendly car. LifeWTR After six consecutive Super Bowls, Pepsi ceded its spot to the company's new "premium water brand" this year. LifeWTR debuts with a colorful commecial set to John Legend. Buick Cam Newton calls plays for some Pop Warner kids in the car brand's second Super Bowl appearance. Wix.com Website builder Wix.com enlisted Jason Statham and Gal Gadot to beat up some goons and blow up a restaurant in a pretty well-done action sequence. Somehow, that inspires a chef to launch a food truck. 84 Lumber Construction supply company 84 Lumber tells a story about a family of Mexican immigrants, despite Fox nixing its plan to show a border wall. Making the best of the situation, it turned the ad into a cliffhanger with an ending to be posted online during the game. "It's a 10!" hair care The hair care brand made quite an impression with its first Super Bowl appearance — between a backpack shaved out of back hair, a full-face beard and a hat in the shape of a pig's head made out of hair.  Airbnb Airbnb recycled a diversity-themed ad that's been rendered all the more timely. The campaign actually first launched as part of a PR campaign to repair the startup's image in the wake of accusations of racism among hosts.   Persil ProClean Bill Nye is wowed by parallel dimensions in this detergent ad.  The second-stringers Intel Tom Brady proves anything is exciting in replay. Intel made a winning bet in tapping the Super Bowl quarterback well before the Patriots made the big game. Though with four wins under his belt already, it wasn't the longest odds. KFC Yet another version of Colonel Sanders introduces the chain's latest new style of chicken. This time he's made of solid gold.  Skittles A teenage boy stands outside the bedroom window of a girl he's chasing and feeds her Skittles. And her family, a burglar, a cop and a beaver. It's all pretty strange, but not terribly funny. Mr. Clean A computer-generated Mr. Clean gets sexy in his Super Bowl debut. But it's also a bit creepy. Tide Jeffrey Tambor finds out Rob Gronkowski is a terrible dry cleaner. It's an unlikely pairing but it sort of works. Lexus Fresh off a gravity-defying turn in an Apple ad, dancer Lil Buck provides some abstract visuals for Lexus. Febreze  Kathryn Hahn narrates the struggle of a half-time bathroom break. Febreze is one of three P&G household brands to join the big game this year.  Sprint A dad tries to fake his own death against his kids' better advice before Sprint's Verizon-turncoat spokesman shows up. Nintendo Nintendo makes its Super Bowl debut to advertise the Legend of Zelda. TurboTax Humpty Dumpty falls off a wall while doing taxes. Busch An especially loud can of beer disturbs nearby forest animals. Wendy's The fast food chain makes its Super Bowl debut with an ad about a guy thawing beef with a hair dryer. Yellow Tail Yellow Tail becomes the first wine ad to advertise in the Super Bowl despite Anheuser-Busch's deal that guarantees no competition from other alcohol companies. To circumvent this rule, the brand bought enough local ads to cover 80 percent of the country.

The Atlanta Falcons will face the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Fox will show the game online for free, but you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File By ANICK JESDANUN, AP Technology Writer Posted: 02/05/17, 9:37 AM PST | Updated: 5 days ago # Comments NEW YORK >> You can watch the Super Bowl online for free, but there are a few catches. For starters, you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. And if you’re interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here’s your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday on Fox. WATCHING THE GAME It’s true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV. You can join them even if you don’t have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it’s free. If you can’t get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you’re a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. WATCHING THE ADS The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads . A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox’s online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren’t participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only; a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube’s AdBlitz . Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn’t planning to this year. You don’t have to wait until Sunday, as many of the ads are already available online. GIZMOS GALORE Fox is partnering with Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn’t mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it’s using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don’t expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won’t be as immersive. You’ll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. Advertisement VIDEO EXTRAS Fox has video specials throughout the week on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, Fox is offering a backstage look before the game; the online-only NFL Field Pass stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warmups and various stadium activities. It’s not clear whether Fox’s pre-game and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it’s possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn’t respond to inquiries for clarification. If that’s something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that’s only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. DIGITAL SMARTS Virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have been tweaked to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you’re on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, “Alexa, give me a Patriots burn” or “Alexa, give me a Falcons burn.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off Related Super Bowl LI: Live updates and chat Top Stories ‹ › MOST POPULAR Day Week News Sports Biz A&E Email Life Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(Seeking Alpha) Related CMG Analysts React To Chipotle's Q4 Earnings Report Chipotle's Trajectory Is Both Realistic And Improving, More Buybacks Likely Does Optimism Index Bode Well For Stocks? (Investor's Business Daily) This weekend's Barron's cover story considers what's in store for a once-hot burrito chain. Other featured articles offer a peek at the outlook for a semiconductor maker and for a casual dining company. The prospects for a social media IPO and an independent power producer are also examined. "Chipotle: Can It Be Fixed?" by Jack Hough is this week's cover story. While the once-hot fast-casual chain is getting past its food-safety issues, and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) CEO Steve Ells should be able to improve service and win back customers, rising costs could cut into an earnings rebound, says Barron's. Could the stock fall as much as 35 percent? In "Snap's Coming IPO Looks Like One to Avoid," Andrew Bary takes a look at why Snapchat's parent is preparing to come public at an eye-popping valuation. Could it be the next Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) or the next Twitter (NYSE: TWTR)? See why Barron's believes that the higher Snap's post-IPO stock price goes, the greater will be the risk that any misstep could clobber its investors. Is this a deal to avoid? Tiernan Ray's "This Time, AMD's Revival Is for Real" makes a case for sweeping changes at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) to elevate it in cloud computing and for shares to double in a year. This despite the fact that the stock already has grown fivefold in the past year. Are AMD's days as a second banana to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) now behind it? Casual dining stocks are out of favor, according to "Brinker International Sets the Table for Growth at Chili's" by David Englander. However, improvements at the Chili's chain could win Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE: EAT) shares some new fans. Will the negativity around this stock be short-lived, and can the stock rise by 20 percent or so in the coming year? In Andrew Bary's "Vistra Energy's Promising Next Act," discover why this Texas electricity producer's depressed shares could get a jolt from higher power prices. Shares of Vistra Energy (OTC: VSTE) look like a bargain compared to other independent power producers, according to Barron's, and the article offers five catalysts for a rally, including a possible New York Stock Exchange listing.

For starters, you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. And if you’re interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here’s your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots.

For starters, you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. And if you’re interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here’s your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday on Fox. ___ Connolly calls for 3.2 percent pay raise for feds in 2018 WATCHING THE GAME Advertisement It’s true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV. You can join them even if you don’t have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it’s free. If you can’t get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you’re a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. ___ WATCHING THE ADS The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads . A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox’s online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren’t participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only; a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube’s AdBlitz . Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn’t planning to this year. You don’t have to wait until Sunday, as many of the ads are already available online. ___ GIZMOS GALORE Fox is partnering with Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn’t mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it’s using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don’t expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won’t be as immersive. You’ll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. ___ VIDEO EXTRAS Fox has video specials throughout the week on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, Fox is offering a backstage look before the game; the online-only NFL Field Pass stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warmups and various stadium activities. It’s not clear whether Fox’s pre-game and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it’s possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn’t respond to inquiries for clarification. If that’s something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that’s only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. ___ DIGITAL SMARTS Virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have been tweaked to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you’re on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, “Alexa, give me a Patriots burn” or “Alexa, give me a Falcons burn.” Topics: Business News Entertainment News Sports News Technology News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Sports News » Super Bowl online: See… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1916: Sec. of War Lindley M.

The Internet of Things has matured to the point where we’re now starting to see vertical ecosystems that combine IoT endpoints with industry specific IoT cloud ecosystems. Asus-owned embedded equipment vendor Aaeon has joined up with Kii to create just such a platform for controlling and aggregating data from vending machines. The partners’ Smart Vending Platform Alliance has initiated a limited launch of the Smart Vending Now platform, and plans a full roll-out in April. Kii’s IoT Solution Enablement Platform (click image to enlarge) Smart Vending Now is based on a vending specific version of Kii’s IoT Solution Enablement Platform, as well as vending machine computers built on Aaeon’s maker-oriented, first-gen, Intel Atom x5-Z8350 based UP board. Aaeon has informed LinuxGizmos that the Kii Agent component deployed on the UP-based vending node can run on either Linux or Windows. It’s unclear if the Raspberry Pi-like UP board will be deployed in the form of the recently released, UP-based UP-GWS01 IoT gateway. (See farther below for more on UP.) The customizable Smart Vending Now platform enables mobile Android and iOS device controlled automation, optimization, and 24/7 real-time visibility and remote control for vending operations. The platform can save customers money by being able to remotely power down machines based on historical or projected buying patterns, says the Smart Vending Platform Alliance. Detail view of Smart Vending Now hardware platform, which is identical to the UP board (click image to enlarge) Customers can also generate revenues from onscreen advertising while attracting customers by offering wireless hotspots and other services, says the Alliance. The platform supports informational kiosks and other interactive “smart venue” systems in addition to vending machines. Different interfaces are available for operators, refill attendants, technicians, and even consumers. Mobile apps can help identify the location and services of nearby vending machines. A Sanmina vending machine Kii’s IoT Solutions Enablement Platform provides cloud-based backend functions like management of users, data, devices, notifications, and analytics, and provides business rules and backend logic code. The top API and SDK layer enables the development of mobile and web apps. The Kii Agent stack residing on the UP board includes different device agents for device, sensor, and gateway level integration. These connect to the cloud platform, which provides extensible server extensions, APIs such as REST, and SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript, and C. The system provides real-time monitoring of purchase patterns, inventory management, and functional diagnostics. The solution appears to be based in part on the “open” Space: The Infinity of Things cloud platform that Kii sponsors along with SoftBank’s Brightstar wireless distribution and services firm. Space supports several Linux-friendly frameworks including AllSeen and OIC, the forerunner of OCF, which hosts the IoTivity framework. The Smart Vending Now Alliance can also provide turnkey design and manufacturing of smart vending devices equipped with the UP-based computers in partnership with Sanmina. Customizable products include enclosures, cable harnesses, and complete vending systems.   Aaeon’s UP Aaeon’s UP board is not fully open source, but it offers hacker-friendly services and a lower price than commercial Atom-based SBCs. It sells for $99 with 2GB RAM and 16GB eMMC, and for up to $149 with 4GB RAM and 64GB eMMC. The UP SBC runs on Intel’s 14nm “Cherry Trail” Atom x5-Z8350, a quad-core SoC clocked to 1.44GHz with 1.92GHz burst speed and low, 2 Watt consumption. UP board The board has a similar port layout and 85.60 × 56.5mm footprint as the Raspberry Pi, and offers a 40-pin RPi-compatible expansion interface. Other features include GbE and USB 3.0 ports, as well as 6x USB 2.0 connections, including 4x real-world ports. Other features on the Ubuntu, Android, and Windows 10 IoT compatible board include HDMI, eDP, CSI, and I2S connections, as well as an RTC. In April, Aaeon plans to fulfill the investments of Kickstarter backers with a second-gen, $98 and up UP Squared board. The UP Squared features a faster Intel Apollo Lake SoC, and offers up to 8GB DDR4 of RAM and up to 128GB eMMC 5.0. Additional features include 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE, dual HDMI, SATA, M.2, and mini-PCIe, as well as new 40- and 60-pin GPIO connectors.   Further information Aaeon and Kii will formally launch the Smart Vending Now platform at the Nama OneShow 2017 in Las Vegas on April 19-21 at booth #1611.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Can a new option in your OS really improve performance? Home Hardware Windows 10 Interview: Windows 10’s new Game Mode explained By Alec Meer on January 25th, 2017 at 6:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Just last week (and yet somehow an eternity ago, in terms of world events), Microsoft announced that they’d soon be adding something called ‘Game Mode’ to Windows 10 with the aim of improving games’ performance, but gave away few details about what this might involve. Are we talking real framerate gains, suppressing potentially bothersome background tasks or just freeing up a wee bit of RAM? With the first iteration of Game Mode due to arrive as part of Windows 10’s optional early Insider builds due today, I had a chat with Kevin Gammill, Partner Group Program Manager, Xbox Platform, spokesperson for the group building Game Mode, to find out what this thing actually does, which games it will support and what kind of control users will have over it. I’ll run the interview itself first, but underneath are a few quick thoughts from me on what I think this might all mean. RPS: What’s the basic thrust of Game Mode? Kevin Gammill: Game Mode’s a feature that we’re adding with the Creator’s Update in Windows 10. Our goals with Game Mode are pretty straightforward. It’s really about making Windows 10 the best operating system to play your games. We kind of look at that with two different lenses. One is both what I’ll call increased framerates for getting more performance out of the box, but the other one that I’d argue is probably more important is a more consistent gaming experience as you play your game. I don’t know if you’re a core gamer, I am; there have been many times where I’m in a game and I’m update against the final boss fight or whatever you want to call it, and because of what’s going on in the game I get a drastic reduced framerate and things start to get a little bit laggy. Providing a more consistent experience throughout the entire gameplay is also kind of an important feature of game mode. RPS: Is this with something that will apply just to Windows 10 games or all games? Kevin Gammill: Basically, I think you’re asking ‘will Game Mode only work for UWP-based games or will they also work for Win32 games?” Absolutely it will work for both. I do want to say that Game Mode will likely see a slightly better performance increase in UWP-based games, simply because we know the boundaries of the game. The way the operating system works and the way Win32 works, we really don’t know where the game starts and ends from a system level perspective, whereas with UWP we do. Because we know those boundaries better in UWP, we’re likely to be able to afford the game slightly better performance increases. But it absolutely works with both Win32 and UWB-based games. RPS: Is that legacy as well? Not just DirectX 12 stuff? Kevin Gammill: Correct. Absolutely. If you have a game that still runs on your Windows 10 machine that’s 15 years old, Game Mode will absolutely work with it. RPS: I was told in advance that you wouldn’t be saying too much about the nitty and gritty of performance gains just yet, but clearly that’s what most people are concerned with here. I’ve seen speculation that all it will do is suspend background tasks to free up a little more memory – any truth to that? And can it do anything to improve GPU performance specifically? Kevin Gammill: OK, great, I’ll go there. I want to keep this at a relatively high level because we’re short on time here, but what I’d love to do with you guys is go on to the depths on a future call, but I will touch a little bit on your questions now. With the Creator’s Update and Game Mode right now, we’re primarily focused on biasing the game versus the rest of the operating system, from a GPU and CPU perspective. So for some of the other system resources, we can get into a roadmap discussion on the next call, but really right now Game Mode is about biasing the game from a GPU perspective so it gets more of the cycles if it’s in the foreground, and from a CPU perspective both biasing to get more CPU cycles as well as avoiding what I’ll call thread contention for the game. The current UI overload that is the Xbox app in Windows 10 – not actually related to Game Mode per se, but hey, we had to illustrate this piece somehow RPS: Can you give a ballpark on the kind of performance boosts you’ve seen from this so far? Kevin Gammill: I’ll touch on that a little bit. Yes, is the short answer. Kind of the way I look at it is that any increase is a benefit, without question. Even it’s as low as, say, a 2% increase in framerate, if you’re running a hundred frames per second, I will take those extra two frames per second without question. Two percent is pretty significant when you’re playing your game. A specific answer to your question is that it’s probably too early in testing to give you a good idea where we’ll land. Basically of the broad configuration of PCs out there, both from a hardware perspective as well as from existing software running on those systems perspective, and then you throw in a variety of different games… We’re still doing a lot of testing and getting telemetry on how those results come back. So it’s really too early to tell, but the early results definitely look positive. RPS: How does it operate in terms of the UI and automation? Does it kick in by itself or is essentially extra faff before running your game? Kevin Gammill: It’s a little bit of both. At any time a user can call up the Game Bar and enable Game Mode for any title or game they would like. That’s kind of option one. And then at the same time we will have what we call kind of an approved list or whitelist of games that we feel super-comfortable about and we want to enable out of the gate. Those will be turned on by default. It’s a little bit of both. The user has full control to turn it on or off, that’s up to them on any game. And then we will have a list of games we know Game Mode works really well with, and that list will continue to grow over time, where it will be automatically enabled unless a user decides to turn off Game Mode. RPS: How will those updates work? Automated or manual? Kevin Gammill: It’ll be transparent to the user. We maintain a list – we call it the Known Games List – internally for both Game Mode and other game-related features, and that gets updated on a regular basis. RPS: Is this comparable to how new graphics card driver updates have new profiles for new games? Kevin Gammill: Yup, that’s a good analogy. RPS: A lot of people have a Netflix stream or a podcast playing or they’re streaming themselves while they play a game – what risks are there that Game Mode will interfere with that? I know they can just turn it off but it’s still a back and forth. Kevin Gammill: At the end of the day, if your machine is being fully-taxed it is a zero sum game. The amount of total GPU resources, for example, that you have on your system, is capped at a certain value. If you have a game running in the foreground and you have Lightroom running in the background crunching some video, you’d expect that to slow down if you have the game in the foreground running Game Mode. Absolutely, because we will bias the game that in in the foreground to have more of the GPU cycles than normal. RPS: What about stuff that’s not specifically GPU-y, like video streams or music? Kevin Gammill: If that is running in the background, depending on your system configuration, what machine you have, the amount of resources that you have, how much the game is taxing your system and the other software that you have running on your computer for that matter. Depending on that, there’s a chance that whatever you have running in the background does slow down because of what you’ve done. That should not be surprising, because it really is a zero sum game. RPS: Is there any scope to additionally whitelist non-game applications? Kevin Gammill: I think we should talk about that on our next call. That answer is there is a more complicated roadmap question, but it’s certainly something we’re considering. A good example for a lot of people is that they’ll have YouTube up and running as kind of a tutorial while you’re playing the game. That’s a scenario we want to be very thoughtful. We should probably talk about that more later. The other thing I’ll point is that we absolutely are working with IHVs (independent hardware vendors, specifically AMD, NVIDIA and Intel in this case – Acronymnonious Ed) on this. We’re working closely with IHVs on helping us to tune this even further. RPS: We’re not going to see anything favouring the green team over the red team or vice-versa? Kevin Gammill: No, not at all. Not at all. RPS: Just to confirm, by ‘Game Mode’ we are talking about purely a performance thing, not that the UI somehow switches to something alternate form? Kevin Gammill: Correct. At this point, it is more low-level than that. RPS: What game-related features are you looking at outside of performance? For instance, we’ve had some frustrations about how limited the control we have over games installed via the Windows store are – where they install to, even how to access the files. That’s outside my engineering area,. It’s a good question, and I apologise for not knowing the answer, but my team doesn’t handle that. RPS: Do you feel that, once you’ve got these profiles coming in and a baseline of functionality, that’s what Game Mode is? Or can we hope for far more significant performance gains later on? Absolutely. We have quite a roadmap built up for Game Mode, and our next conversation I would love to tell you more. We have easily a year’s worth of work we could do for continual improvements to Game Mode we want to make. RPS: What was it, broadly speaking, that made you do this? From the outside looking in, Windows has been fairly quiet about games despite occasional statements to the contrary. How much more significant a push is this one, and why? I would argue that it’s been more subtle, but we’ve continued to do work, at least with Windows 10, on improvements for games. A good example for that is shipping DX12 about two years ago. A game that adopts DX12 – huge performance increase, lower power draw etcetera. It’s not like we’ve ignored gaming up until now, but more specifically to answer your question – I have come more from the console side of the business. Those machines are dedicated gaming boxes, obviously, and we have a learned a lot in fine-tuning the operating system for the original Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One and soon to be Scorpio. We’ve taken some of those best practices, and we’re starting to apply those more broadly across more Windows devices. Game Mode’s an incarnation of that. RPS: What degree of crossover is there between this and DirectX? Do they remain separate projects and separate teams? We work very closely with the DirectX team, but this is more of a parallel work effort. This doesn’t bias the game better or worse depending on what version of DirectX you’re running. That is independent of how Game Mode works. RPS: I was more wondering if it will affect the future of DirectX if this is potentially the future of Windows for gaming. That’s probably a better roadmap conversation. Once I open that door, we have a very long conversation. RPS: Thanks for your time. Closing thoughts of my own, then? Real deep-down detail on what this does and how it really works is yet to come, but the main takeaway I had was that it may be focused on the aggressive suppression of other tasks so as to not steal performance from the game. This may well be useful – I’ve had situations where e.g. Windows’ antimalware tools suddenly start chewing up a bunch of CPU time because they’re not sure what some application or service is, or some third-party application or the other decides it wants to update itself at precisely the wrong moment. Something Kevin asked me outside of the interview was if I knew what he meant in terms of consistency of performance as opposed to performance itself, and yeah, sure, I’ve certainly known situations where things briefly go haywire because something other than game starts screaming for attention in one way or another. A few headaches might be saved if that kind of thing can be blocked. Actual graphical performance boosts I’m less sure about, however. Certain applications, such as Photoshop or video streaming, can tie up GPU time even in the background, so maybe there are situations whereby ensuring that the game has absolutely nothing denied to it will help, but it’s hard to see right now how this could go all the way to a meaningful improvement at all times. But maybe Game Mode can help to stop Windows itself from troubling the graphics card when it’s otherwise engaged – for instance, how Windows Shell Experience Host handles graphics for ‘Modern’ apps and controls rotation of desktop wallpaper. Various tiny background things that might minutely distract the GPU; as he says, a 2% performance gain might not be a big number, but there are certainly cases where it’s enough to make a difference. I mean, if you’re using Vsync, two or three fewer frames per second can be enough to drag the framerate lock down from 60 to 45 or even 30. Anyway: I’ll give Game Mode and spin once it’s available, and see what difference it’s actually making to games on my system. The first iteration of Windows 10 Game Mode is due to be made available later today, but for the time being requires opting into potentially raw and buggy Insider builds via Windows Update. It will see a wider public release as part of the forthcoming Creators Update for Windows 10. This update does not have an official release date as yet, but is rumoured to arrived in April.

Log in to Reply 25/01/2017 at 19:41 Baines says: I’m guessing that they aren’t saying much both because expectations are low and because the bulk of the potential work is still undone and up in the air. He kept talking about future conversations as well as having ideas for a year of work. They’ve probably got a tiny performance boost from adjusting CPU/GPU priority and tinkering with resource allocation (like thread usage), and have likely reduced or at least smoothed out some of those mid-game performance dips. They’ve probably got a variety of future ideas, but those ideas aren’t implemented yet, and many turn out to be busts anyway. I’d figure stuff like more aggressive code prediction might fall into this area, along with other optimizations. They don’t want to over-promise and then fail to deliver. That leaves them with not much at all to say, though, as tiny frame rate increases aren’t major news. (And who knows, the whole project could go belly up if it managed to catastrophically fail in widespread testing.)

Just our mood or a caffeine drink can cause a 15% percent speed perception change – this isn’t a batch process, it’s real time plus messy human brains. Secondly, hearing MS talk about forking performance models just makes me cry. You *know* it’s going to require a developer to get on board or not, thus tying their horses to code that might well be in the bargain bin this time next year. I don’t buy the bafflegab about everyone benefitting “a bit”. Finally, salesman. I don’t care what he does for a living, he talks like a salesman.

If I was asked to code this the way I’d do it is: Target the obvious thread jacking nonsense that the OS does like reindexing and pause it. These don’t run up a large amount of CPU or memory but it can eat concurrent threads which are limited. Perhaps give as far as giving the game a CPU affinity. Next I’d make sure that the game is given more real RAM and less swap. If it’s UWP/Unity, I’d give the garbage collector more room to breathe. These are safe sorts of things to do. Then I’d release it to the public with low expectations, measure what real machines with various configurations actually do and then iterate using the regular Windows update. I use Razer Cortex to shut down all the dev services I use on my box to grab back RAM and CPU but then my machine is far from clean.

Which isn’t even really that large a group even on the XBox, let alone the PC. The takeaways I got from this are: There’s a Gamer Bar now, so you have even more UI cruft you don’t want and Microsoft will probably use it to market to you, and Microsoft is going to supply a list of game->minor-performance-tuning mappings as part of Windows Update, which you won’t be able to get in isolation since you can’t choose which updates to install or not anymore. It’s shit like this that makes me really wish Steam boxes had taken off and made Linux support practically mandatory for games. Log in to Reply 26/01/2017 at 17:11 KillahMate says: There already is a Gamer Bar in Windows 10, been there since the OS came out – it’s just that nobody uses it since it’s a part of the XBox app which also nobody uses, but it already runs on Windows startup and stays in the background.

Updates and background services causes the fps to dip below that, something I immediately notice. Today, I can white list Overwatch as one of the applications i need all my resources for (Game mode), and in the future this would be done automatic. This is a good thing. Log in to Reply 29/01/2017 at 05:37 Phasma Felis says: You definitely do not notice your FPS “dipping below 165 FPS.” Unless you mean dipping to, like, 30 FPS. But if you think you can eyeball the difference between 165 and 155, you’re deluding yourself. Log in to Reply 26/01/2017 at 16:32 Avus says: M$ did something for PC gaming?? Talk to me again when they REALLY did something to PC gaming. I still remember the bad experience with GFWL, games for Windows Store (more like Windows 10 + anniversary update store). It is stupid that a game (example: Forza Horizon 3) that “require” the newest Windows + Windows update to play. I am not asking a “Microsoft WINDOWS game” need to work all the way back to Windows XP… But not even work in Windows 7, 8 and 8.1?! Unless MS have the “technology” the made their games available in other digital distribution, otherwise I don’t need M$ do too much “for” the PC gaming. All you (M$) need to do is made Windows stable and don’t screw up Windows update too much (like the last couple times) Log in to Reply 27/01/2017 at 14:33 immaletufinishbut says: “I don’t know if you’re a core gamer, I am” Cmon, who even says stuff like this?

The case for the latter is “because of what’s going on in the game I get a drastic reduced framerate”. However smartly you allocate CPU and GPU resources, busier, frantic moments in games will see framerate dips. So does this feature actually cap framerates, so that the dips are less noticeable? Or does it work on frametimes like Rivatuner is supposed to do? (link to pcgamer.com) – The Game Mode is said to operate in two ways: manual activation by the user or automatic detection that a game is running, based on a whitelist. So what would be the disadvantage of having Game Mode always on? Higher CPU and GPU allocation to foreground processes, less to background ones? Certain Windows components being permanently disabled? Arbitrary third-party processes being stopped? None? Log in to Reply 28/01/2017 at 05:15 Photonboy says: “ZERO SUM GAME” is being used incorrectly BTW. It’s being used as there being no benefit. The correct usage involves at least two parties with one losing and one gaining such that the TOTAL is zero. As per the tool, there’s already a tool called “CPUCORES” which does much of what MS Game Mode looks to do. It prioritizes a game thread onto its own core, disables HT where it makes sense etc. Log in to Reply 28/01/2017 at 06:05 Snowskeeper says: Nnno, as much as I dislike him, he was using it correctly.

Log in to Reply 05/02/2017 at 06:56 gebrps says: I’ve been reading a lot of articles in other places with writers that don’t understand what is the objective. They do frame tests mainly, and that is not what Game Mode may be about. Right now I do a lot of stuff manually before launching a very demanding game: closing unnecessary programs, killing unnecessary processes, pausing anti-virus and other “shielding” software, etc. That’s not for frames is for a general better “flow” of the game: loading times, reading to disk, less lag, better response. If “Game Mode” does something of what I do manually, but automatically, I’m in. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Chaitanya Karamchedu from Portland, Oregon, is turning heads across the country all because of a science experiment that began in his high school classroom. The Jesuit High School Senior told KPTV that he has big plans of changing the world. "1 in 8 people do not have access to clean water, it's a crying issue that needs to be addressed," said Karamchedu. He made up his mind to address the matter himself. "The best access for water is the sea, so 70 per cent of the planet is covered in water and almost all of that is the ocean, but the problem is that's salt water," said Karamchedu. Isolating drinkable water from the ocean in a cost effective way is a problem that has stumped scientists for years. "Scientists looked at desalination, but it's all still inaccessible to places and it would cost too much to implement on a large scale," Karamchedu said. Karamchedu figured it out, on his own, in a high school lab. "The real genesis of the idea was realising that sea water is not fully saturated with salt," he was quoted as saying. By experimenting with a highly absorbent polymer, the teen discovered a cost effective way to remove salt from ocean water and turn it into fresh water. "It's not bonding with water molecules, it's bonding to the salt," said Karamchedu. "People have been looking at the problem from one view point, how do we break those bonds between salt and the water? Chai came in and thought about it from a completely different angle," said Jesuit High School Biology Teacher Dr. Lara Shamieh. "People were concentrated on that 10 per cent of water that's bonded to the salt in the sea and no one looked at the 90 per cent that was free. Chai just looked at it and said if 10 per cent is bonded and 90 per cent is free, then why are we so focused on this 10 per cent, let's ignore it and focus on the 90," Shamieh said. It is a breakthrough that is estimated to impact millions of lives if ever implemented on a mass scale. "What this is compared to current techniques, is that it's cheap and accessible to everyone, everyone can use it," said Shamieh. Scientists across the country are taking note. He won a USD 10,000 award from the US Agency for International Global Development at Intel's International Science Fair and second place at MIT's TechCon Conference where he won more money to continue his research. "They were very encouraging, they could see things into it that I couldn't, because they've been working their whole lives on this," said Karamchedu. Back in January, Karamchedu was also named one of 300 Regeneron Science Talent Search Semifinalists. The STS is thought to be one of the most prestigious competitions in the country for high school seniors.

But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of Tinsel, right, talks about program placement with Kara Lee at the offices of Galvanize in San Francisco. Ms. Williams says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities at the maker of jewelry for women. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos, and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic; the numbers are unchanged. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse, though not when it comes to gender, and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse work force in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the work force at many firms — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees, and diversity advocates say Silicon Valley has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” said Leslie Miley, engineering chief at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he said, worry too much that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Mr. Miley, an African-American, has been an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google, and Yahoo. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel set a goal of achieving full representation in its work force by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” The industry has similar programs in place, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps, to little avail. Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives, and advocates suggest the blame lies with biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments, and a scarcity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, said it’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she said.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) 37 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 24 COMMENTEMAILMORE The next wave of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown reportedly will focus on a visa program that allows foreign workers to fill job openings in the United States. It’s a piece of the new president’s promise to put America first, but it could end up pushing the United States backward in a critical economic segment. Work visas are an essential tool for the technology industry. U.S. companies are in an intense competition to recruit and retain the best talent from around the world. There aren’t enough qualified domestic tech workers to meet the demand, or the varied needs of the industry. A draft order being circulated in Washington indicates Trump will largely target H-1B visas that allow companies to bring in workers to fill positions when they can’t find local talent. The tech industry contends there are 500,000 available jobs in the United States that are going unfilled because they can’t find qualified applicants. Currently, the work-visa program permits 65,000 skilled workers into the U.S. annually, and the industry has been lobbying to increase that number. Instead, Trump is poised to restrict access to foreign talent. The president on the campaign trail accused employers of abusing the visa program, bypassing American workers in favor of cheaper foreign help. The executive order apparently will prioritize higher paid immigrants. That provision could serve to cut off new graduates who have the potential to rise to top levels. Current law requires visa applicants to have at least a bachelor’s degree and be paid the prevailing wage for similar workers in their region. If there is abuse in the system, it is appropriate to address it. Companies should not be allowed to replace qualified American workers with foreigners to save money. But this country has lagged in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) training, even while its industries have increased their appetite for such skills. An executive order of this sort would have broad consequences, and could negatively affect the American workers Trump purports to help. Companies starved for talent may decide to go to where the workers are if they can’t bring the help they need here. Google, Intel, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Apple and Oracle are among the large tech companies that hire more than 1,000 foreign workers a year using H-1B visas. The talent pool for the industry is global; cutting off American companies from those workers will place them at a competitive disadvantage. It could well force them to locate more research and development facilities overseas. Trump has no love for the Silicon Valley executives who worked to defeat him in the November election. But the impact goes beyond the tech industry. The automotive industry is now deeply invested in technology and increasingly reliant on H-1B visas to fill out engineering and research staffs. Medical facilities also use the visas to bring in doctors and other health care workers. The U.S. has lots of talent, but needs more. The president should be opening the door to more highly skilled foreign workers who are willing to come here and keep America first in technology innovation. 37 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 24 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2kBeoB5 TOP VIDEOS George Blaha 3:49 Mike Ilitch honored with a moment of Silence at Joe Louis Arena 0:56 59th Annual Detroit Boat Show 1:52 Suspect sought in theft at Detroit market 0:55 Candice Miller discusses $20 million loan 0:46 Bernard Young speaks of his freedom after nearly 30 years 2:49 State Police on embezzlement charges against former Dearborn Clerk 1:18 Detroit teachers, students, parents rally against school closures 0:38 Microsoft moving to Detroit 3:49 Metro Detroit immigrants react to President Trump's executive order. 5:23 Microsoft Ivanka Trump navigating Washington social, political worlds Catherine Lucey Trump’s Oval Office tweets force CEOs to choose fight or flight Shannon Pettypiece Microsoft CEO censures immigrant ban Louis Aguilar Howes: Microsoft arrival will bolster downtown tech hub Daniel Howes Seattle judge derided by Trump known for conservative views Gene Johnson It's official: Microsoft moving office to Detroit Louis Aguilar

For starters, you're out of luck on phones unless you're a Verizon customer. And if you're interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here's your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday on Fox. ___ WATCHING THE GAME It's true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV. You can join them even if you don't have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it's free. If you can't get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you're a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. ___ WATCHING THE ADS The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads . A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox's online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren't participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only; a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube's AdBlitz . Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn't planning to this year. You don't have to wait until Sunday, as many of the ads are already available online. ___ GIZMOS GALORE Fox is partnering with Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn't mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it's using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don't expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung's Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won't be as immersive. You'll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. ___ VIDEO EXTRAS Fox has video specials throughout the week on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, Fox is offering a backstage look before the game; the online-only NFL Field Pass stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warmups and various stadium activities. It's not clear whether Fox's pre-game and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it's possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn't respond to inquiries for clarification. If that's something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that's only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. ___ DIGITAL SMARTS Virtual assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa have been tweaked to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you're on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, "Alexa, give me a Patriots burn" or "Alexa, give me a Falcons burn." Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

With Lady Gaga headlining the halftime show this year, you can expect quite a spectacular and energetic performance. According to sources with knowledge of the show's production, there will be an inclusion of hundreds of illuminated unmanned aerial vehicles which required special clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA has declared a "No Drone Zone" within a 34.5-mile radius around the stadium on game day - except for Lady Gaga that is. Earlier in the week, an observer recorded footage of drones buzzing over the stadium forming a capitalized letter G: Pra quem não viu ontem: vazou a produção do halftime ensaiando com drones formando GAGA em cima do estádio que acontecerá o evento! pic.twitter.com/yQllZpRj6W — Felipe 🏈 (@Felipe_Oif) January 27, 2017 Lady Gaga has collaborated with Intel in the past, specifically for her tribute to the late David Bowie at the 2016 Grammys. Recently, the technology giant blanketed the night sky by using 500 aerial light drones in a wondrous display of patterns and theatrics. This is the first time drones will be used as part of a halftime show. There is no doubt extensive safety procedures will be followed. With hundreds of drones being remotely piloted above thousands of people, let's just hope for the safety of everyone there are no hiccups along the lines of what GoPro experienced with its Karma drone late last year.

And he’s managed to do it all from his classroom. Chaitanya Karamchedu, a senior at Jesuit High School Senior in Portland, decided to address the fact that 1 in 8 people don’t have access to clean water by using his high school lab to experiment. MORE: Teenager releases devastating pictures after being covered in 95% burns He told KPTV: ‘It’s a crying issue that needs to be addressed. The best access for water is the sea, so 70% of the planet is covered in water and almost all of that is the ocean, but the problem is that’s salt water.’ This magical resort has a water slide that goes directly into the sea ‘Scientists looked at desalination, but it’s all still inaccessible to places and it would cost too much to implement on a large scale.’ Trying to isolate drinkable water from the ocean in a cost effective way is something scientists have been trying to figure out for years. But Karamchedu thinks he may have figured it out by experimenting with a highly absorbent polymer. He discovered it by doing a science experiment in his school lab (Picture: Fox 12 Oregon) He said: ‘The real genesis of the idea was realising that sea water is not fully saturated with salt. It’s not bonding with water molecules, it’s bonding to the salt.’ You can now dine in an underwater restaurant at the bottom of a pool His teacher, Dr Lara Shamieh, said people have been looking at breaking bonds between salt and the water but Chai came in and thought about it ‘from a completely different angle’. She said: ‘People were concentrated on that 10 percent of water that’s bonded to the salt in the sea and no one looked at the 90 percent that was free. ‘Chai just looked at it and said if 10 percent is bonded and 90 percent is free, then why are we so focused on this 10 percent, let’s ignore it and focus on the 90.’ The teen has already won a $10,000 award from the US Agency for International Global Development at Intel’s International Science Fair for his work (Picture: Fox 12 Oregon) Scientists are now taking note of Chai’s work and he’s already won a $10,000 award from the US Agency for International Global Development at Intel’s International Science Fair. He also came second place at MIT’s TechCon Conference where he won more money to continue his research. But that’s not all he’s been working on. His teacher said: ‘Now, he’s working on at least mentally thinking about the idea of killing cancer cells from the inside out. I keep telling him to remember his high school biology teacher when he wins the Nobel prize.’ MORE: Mother and child, 3, rescued from freezing water after car overturns in ditch   More Woman flogged until she passed out for having sex out of wedlock SponsoredThis Valentine’s Day feast will put any restaurant deal to shame Have you got the Valentine's Day filter on Facebook?

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Earlier this year during CES 2017, New Balance announced their smartwatch efforts in the form of the RunIQ. If you were intrigued by the device and wouldn’t mind getting your hands on the device, you’ll be pleased to learn that the New Balance RunIQ smartwatch is now available for purchase where it is priced at $300. However unlike other smartwatches that we’ve seen from the likes of Huawei, LG, Samsung, or Apple, the New Balance RunIQ smartwatch is geared more towards fitness enthusiasts instead of those looking for a smartwatch that is fashionable and that could be worn to a black tie event, so that’s something to take into consideration if you were thinking about it. The RunIQ is also aimed more at runners and was created in partnership with Intel. There is built-in GPS so that the watch knows how far you’ve run and where you’ve run. There is also a heart rate monitor, and there are additional functions like a lap button, intervals, and more. New Balance is also boasting a long battery life, but we guess that will depend on how you use your device. It’s not the cheapest smartwatch we’ve seen, and there are cheaper fitness trackers that you could use as an alternative, but if like what you see then head on over to New Balance’s website for the details.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 February 2017 by Military News Star Staffing Announces Sacramento Office Opening Sacramento, CA (PRWEB) February 04, 2017 Star Staffing, the premier staffing resource for Northern California employers and job seekers, is pleased to announce the opening of its newest, the 6th office location, in Sacramento. Due to high demand and new business in the Elk Grove region, Star Staffing sees the opening as a natural step to meet the growing staffing demands of clients in the Sacramento area. The office is set to employ over 200 + employees in the first year and generate approximately 2 million in revenue. Star has had substantial growth year over year making Inc 5000 Magazine’s list of fastest-growing companies in America for the second consecutive year with zero sales representatives. This growth is in-part due to positive word-of-mouth from their dedication and reputation for building relationships. Star focuses on helping team members build real careers and companies build real and long lasting teams. As a full-service agency, they do more than simply place candidates, they create the best match with; strategic placements, training, coaching, vetting candidates thoroughly and taking the time needed to understand the bigger picture to serve each candidate and client fully. These relationships ensure lasting position fulfilment while still supporting both sides of varying needs. Learn more about the team and how to become involved at http://www.starhr.com or call 916-274-4543 – all are welcome to come visit the new office anytime located at 800 Howe Ave., Ste. 110. The company has brought on Heidi Fretwell, as the branch manager, she brings 16+ years of industry experience in the Sacramento area. “Each of our offices serves a unique area requiring local expertise. Heidi’s local insight and knowledge will be important as Star Staffing grows in Sacramento County,” shares Star Staffing’s CEO, Lisa Lichty. Sacramento region’s economy grew 3.5% last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the fastest increase since 2005. Three sectors drive much of the increase—government, construction, and healthcare. Major employers, such as Intel, Kaiser Permanente, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and the many state of California offices depend upon outside recruiters to funnel talented workers into open positions. “We invite local companies and candidates seeking positions with real career advancement opportunities to visit the new office or to call at any time,” says Nicole Smartt, Vice President of Star Staffing. “For two years running, we’ve made Inc 5000’s Fastest Growing Company list, which is testament to our ability to “get the job done” for our clients, whether they be on the seeking or offering side of the employment equation.” Share article on social media or email: CategoriesUncategorized TagsBusiness, Companies, company, Economy, Industry, major, service, star, Uncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Karen Strickland Joins RE/MAX Alliance Group Next PostNext DCL Logistics Named Top 3PL Provider in 2017 – Ecommerce, Retail and Wholesale Company Selected by Multi-Channel Merchant Search our contacts Search for: Search Recent Posts Operation Food Search to Hold Fourth Purses for Pantries Fundraiser Operation Food Search to Hold Fourth Purses for Pantries Fundraiser Keller Williams Realty Memphis Announces Kiana Lee Keller Williams Realty Memphis Announces Kiana Lee Attendee List Released Ahead of RNA Therapeutics Industry Summit Featuring MHRA, Silence Therapeutics and GSK Business Contacts aBusiness contacts Proudly powered by WordPress

The fingerprint reader option was first revealed when Dell announced the upgraded XPS 15 (9560), although it wasn't clear how much the optional extra would cost. As it turns out, it's pretty cheap to add the sensor to the XPS 15; it'll set you back just $25 when added to any configuration. You can also add a fingerprint reader to the new Dell XPS 13 (9360), a laptop that first hit the market a couple of months ago. Like with the XPS 15 option, adding a fingerprint reader to the XPS 13 only costs $25. The fingerprint reader on both laptops is fully compatible with Windows Hello, which makes it fast and easy to secure your device. It's located below the arrow keys in a reasonably convenient position for everyday use. The Dell XPS 13 and XPS 15 are already very configurable laptops. The XPS 15 comes with a high-performance Intel Kaby Lake CPU and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics, along with an optional 4K display and loads of storage and memory configurations. The XPS 13 packs a U-series Kaby Lake processor, an optional 3200 x 1800 display, and a number of PCIe SSD options.

For starters, you’re out of luck on phones unless you’re a Verizon customer. And if you’re interested in the ads, you may have a surprise in store. Here’s your online guide to the matchup in Houston between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots. Kickoff is at 3:30 p.m. Sunday on Fox. Watching the game: It’s true: Some people will be watching the Super Bowl for the actual game on an actual TV. You can join them even if you don’t have a cable subscription or a good signal with an antenna. Just fire up the Fox Sports Go app on many streaming TV devices, including Roku, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV and Xbox. Fox is suspending its usual requirement that you log on with a cable or satellite account, meaning it’s free. If you can’t get to a TV, try the Fox Sports Go app on a tablet or the website FoxSportsGo.com on a laptop or desktop. Verizon has exclusive rights on phones. If you’re a Verizon customer, you can watch through the NFL Mobile app. Otherwise, find another device. Watching the ads: The Super Bowl is the rare event where viewers do pay attention to ads . A 30-second spot goes for about $5 million. Fox’s online stream will get you most of the same ads shown on television. This includes local ads, thanks to a technology Fox is employing to customize the stream to your local station. The catch is that a handful of stations aren’t participating, so you may see a static screen denoting a commercial break. There may also be a few cases in which a national or local advertiser has bought the spot for television only. Then, a substitute ad may appear online in its place. You can also watch many of the ads on the Web. Fox is planning to showcase ads at FoxSports.com. You can also check iSpot.tv and YouTube’s AdBlitz channel. Hulu has shown Super Bowl ads in the past, but it isn’t planning to this year. Many of the ads were online ahead of the game. Gizmos galore: Fox is working with Santa Clara’s Intel to offer replays from the perspective of players on the field. Fox isn’t mounting cameras on individual players. Rather, it’s using 38 cameras surrounding the field. Powerful computers then create videos to depict how a play would have looked to the player. Although these are 360-degree videos, don’t expect a lot of viewer control. They will be more like replays shown as part of the regular broadcast, available a few minutes after the play. If you have a virtual-reality headset such as Google Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR, you can get highlights and top plays through the Fox Sports VR app. Without a headset, you can also view 360-degree video with a phone, but it won’t be as immersive. You’ll need to sign in with a cable or satellite account to watch in VR. Video extras: Fox has video specials on Facebook and Twitter, as well as Fox websites and apps. On Sunday, the network is offering a backstage look before the game. The online-only NFL Field Pass video stream is expected to include player arrivals, on-field warm-ups and various stadium activities. It’s not clear whether Fox’s pregame and postgame television coverage will be available through Fox apps and websites. Even if it is available, it’s possible a cable or satellite account will be needed. Fox didn’t respond to inquiries for clarification. If that’s something you need to have online, you may want to invest in an online television package such as Sling TV, PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now. A subscription will cost at least $25 a month (though weeklong free trials are available). But check to make sure those services offer Fox stations in your city; that’s only true in a handful of locations across the country. A subscription to PlayStation Vue or DirecTV Now will also get you Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl, an homage to the big game played with puppies. Digital smarts: Virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa have been programmed to understand Super Bowl questions. Ask either for player and team stats, or the latest Super Bowl odds (you’re on your own for actual bets). And if someone at your party is cheering for, um, the wrong team, Alexa can help with taunts. Just ask, “Alexa, give me a Patriots burn” or “Alexa, give me a Falcons burn.” Anick Jesdanun is an Associated Press writer.

The Linux Foundation Unikernels aren’t a new concept; the stripped-down, library-specific application machine images have been around for decades.  But unikernels are enjoying a renaissance thanks to cloud computing; they offer major efficiencies in resource use and provide a tiny attack service for nefarious online activities. At CloudNativeCon in Seattle in November, Idit Levine presented the open source project UniK (pronounced “unique”) and announced new features to make unikernel creation more attractive and viable, both for cloud computing and Internet of Things devices. Unikernels haven’t been popular, historically, because they’re not easy to create. Narrowing down the essential libraries and drivers for a unikernel from the full application stack has made unikernels a less attractive option for some developers. That’s the problem UniK is trying to solve, according to Levine, who is the CTO of the Cloud Management Division at Dell EMC, and a member of the technical advisory board for the Cloud Foundry Foundation. “What we wanted to do is make it easy for you do it, so we will do all the hard work for you, and that's exactly what UniK is about,” Levine said. Just as Kubernetes creates application containers for clusters through a simple command interface, UniK is a tool to compile application sources into unikernels. By using unikernels instead of virtual machines, OS kernels can be avoided altogether, saving significant computing resources -- and money. Levine said unikernels mesh very well with microservices architecture; the unikernel runs a single process for a single user, and that’s the same philosophy as microservices, isolating processes and decoupling APIs. “In order to make something like this we need to make some design choice, and our design choice was, we're going to run only one single process,” Levine said. “If you're running one single process and one user, which is what we're doing in microservices architecture today, then we can be very, very smart about reducing a lot of the complexity.” UniK offers builds for several different operating systems (MirageOS, IncludeOS, OSv, et al.), types of hardware (Intel chipsets or ARM for IoT devices), and cloud infrastructures (AWS, OpenStack, and Google Cloud), and now fully supports Kubernetes. Levine said the whole goal was to let developers choose what works best for them. The project team is adding more compatibility all the time; Levine welcomed anyone to join the project and contribute.

By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Sunday, February 5, 2017 - 15:31 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Whatsapp  Comment (Image for representational purposes only) Follow @ZeeNews New Delhi: Environmental scientists have been concerned with regard to drying water bodies as a result of severe climate change. Many areas around the world are slowly falling short of drinking water, leaving scientists in a tizzy. Of course, oceans are full of it and they soon might be the only respite, going by the rate at which climate change is working. But drinking saltwater has never been even a remote consideration. How do we separate the salt from the water? Well, an Indian-American teenage boy has the answer! Chaitanya Karamchedu has made that possible by finding a cheaper and easier method to turn salt water into drinkable fresh water! Karamchedu's research, which began as a science experiment in his high school classroom, is turning quite a few heads and has caught the attention of major technology firms and universities. The Jesuit High School Senior told KPTV that he has big plans of changing the world. "1 in 8 people do not have access to clean water, it's a crying issue that needs to be addressed," said Karamchedu. He made up his mind to address the matter himself. "The best access for water is the sea, so 70 per cent of the planet is covered in water and almost all of that is the ocean, but the problem is that's salt water," said Karamchedu. Isolating drinkable water from the ocean in a cost effective way is a problem that has stumped scientists for years. "Scientists looked at desalination, but it's all still inaccessible to places and it would cost too much to implement on a large scale," Karamchedu said. Karamchedu figured it out, on his own, in a high school lab. "The real genesis of the idea was realising that sea water is not fully saturated with salt," he was quoted as saying. By experimenting with a highly absorbent polymer, the teen discovered a cost effective way to remove salt from ocean water and turn it into fresh water. "It's not bonding with water molecules, it's bonding to the salt," said Karamchedu. "People have been looking at the problem from one view point, how do we break those bonds between salt and the water? Chai came in and thought about it from a completely different angle," said Jesuit High School Biology Teacher Dr. Lara Shamieh. "People were concentrated on that 10 per cent of water that's bonded to the salt in the sea and no one looked at the 90 per cent that was free. Chai just looked at it and said if 10 per cent is bonded and 90 per cent is free, then why are we so focused on this 10 per cent, let's ignore it and focus on the 90," Shamieh said. It is a breakthrough that is estimated to impact millions of lives if ever implemented on a mass scale. "What this is compared to current techniques, is that it's cheap and accessible to everyone, everyone can use it," said Shamieh. Scientists across the country are taking note. He won a USD 10,000 award from the US Agency for International Global Development at Intel's International Science Fair and second place at MIT's TechCon Conference where he won more money to continue his research. "They were very encouraging, they could see things into it that I couldn't, because they've been working their whole lives on this," said Karamchedu. Back in January, Karamchedu was also named one of 300 Regeneron Science Talent Search Semifinalists. The STS is thought to be one of the most prestigious competitions in the country for high school seniors.

The company requested the United States International Trade Commission (US ITC) to investigate the matter and, if the ITC finds in their favor, ban products based on chips that infringe on AMD’s intellectual property rights. In its complaint, AMD asserts that products by LG, MediaTek, Sigma Designs and Vizio infringe three patents, two of which were originally filed by ATI Technologies (which AMD acquired in 2006) in early 2000s and one filed by AMD itself. The patents in question cover fundamental aspects of contemporary graphics processing, such unified shaders (‘133), parallel pipeline graphics system (‘506), as well as a graphics processing architecture employing unified shaders (‘454). In addition, the lawsuit mentions an in-progress patent application covering GPU architectures with unified shaders (‘967) that is also claimed to be infringed by two of the defendants. Notably, all the defendants license their GPU technologies from third party developers such as ARM and Imagination. As case law involving IP infringement is generally weak - it's more difficult to sue over ideas as opposed to physical products - AMD is going after product manufacturers instead. As a result, instead of accusing IP vendor ARM of using its intellectual property, AMD is taking a legal action against MediaTek, LG, Sigma and Vizio, all of whom either make chips that AMD believes use their IP, or use said chips as part of finished consumer goods. Overall the case draws some immediate parallels with a case filled by NVIDIA in the latter part of 2014, where the company filed complaints with the US ITC over accused patent infringement by Qualcomm and Samsung. Like AMD’s case, the core issue was over GPU patents that NVIDIA believed the companies’ products were violating. A side issue in the case that NVIDIA was also trying to get addressed was to figure out who is responsible for patent infringement in devices like smartphones: the handset manufacturer, or the SoC manufacturer. It was a case that NVIDIA essentially lost; the companies settled, but only after Samsung’s counter-suit was more successful in court than NVIDIA’s original suit. That the case was settled out of court also means that there is no significant legal precedent to come out of the case. As for the AMD case, diving deeper into matters, one of the allegedly infringing products is MediaTek’s Helio P10 SoC for smartphones, which is used by certain handsets from LG (e.g., LG X Power). The chip features the Mali T860MP2 GPU licensed from ARM and is not developed by MediaTek itself. Another SoC that allegedly infringes AMD’s patents is Sigma’s SX7 (STV7701) SoC for UHD TVs with HDR support. Details on this SoC are harder to come by, but at a high level this chip appears to use an ARM-developed quad-cluster GPU. Downstream, Vizio uses the SX7 SoC for its advanced televisions, which is why they are one of the defendants in the complaint. Importantly, AMD's complaint also states that the infringement is not limited to the named products, but rather that AMD is naming them as examples of infringement. The case could ultimately go beyond the two SoCs, one smartphone, and several TVs (including LG’s 49UH6500 and Vizio's E43U-D2) named, depending on which side any rulings favor. AMD claims that the aforementioned SoCs and products not only infringe on its intellectual property, but that those products also damage legitimate licensees of AMD's IP. To support the claim, AMD made one interesting disclosure: Samsung and GlobalFoundries have licensed its intellectual property covered by the ‘506, ‘454 and ‘133 patents, as well as the ‘967 application. The former has rights to use the IP in its Exynos mobile SoCs (up to 10-nm Exynos 8 Octa 8895 that uses an ARM Mali GPU), whereas the latter has rights to manufacture the appropriate chips. The List of AMD's Patents Allegedly Infringed by Defendants Patent Name Abstract Description Asserted Claims Filing Date Infringing IC Products* 7,633,506 Parallel pipeline graphics system The parallel pipeline graphics system includes a back-end configured to receive primitives and combinations of primitives (i.e., geometry) and process the geometry to produce values to place in a frame buffer for rendering on screen. 1-9 November 26, 2003 MediaTek Helio P10 SDI SX7 7,796,133 Unified shader A unified shader unit used in texture processing in graphics processing device. Unlike the conventional method of using one shader for texture coordinate shading and another for color shading, the present shader performs both operations. 1-13 and 40 December 8, 2003 8,760,454 Graphics processing architecture employing a unified shader A GPU that uses unified shaders 2 - 11 May 17, 2011 MediaTek Helio P10 Patent Application 14/614,967 1-8 June 27, 2016 *The list of infringing products is not limited to two ICs. In fact, one big unknown right now is just which GPU architectures AMD believes to infringe on their IP. The two named SoCs are ARM Mali based, and given the patents involved (e.g. unified shaders) it looks like AMD takes issue with ARM’s Midgard architecture in particular. Midgard itself is a few years old now, and while it will be shipping in products for years to come, it’s interesting to note that ARM has already released designs based around their new Bifrost architecture, which is radically different from Midgard. Meanwhile not named in any of the complaints are chips using any generation of Imagination’s PowerVR architectures. As MediaTek is known to use both ARM and Imagination GPU designs – and because AMD is only listing a couple of chips as examples – it’s not clear in AMD’s complaint whether they consider PowerVR to be infringing. However an important clue lies in the fact that in listing the SoCs Samsung is licensed to make, only SoCs using ARM GPUs are mentioned. As a result, our best guess is that this complaint is solely about ARM’s GPU IP. Looking at the broader picture and possible motivations for why AMD would bring this complaint up now, AMD announced plans to monetize its IP portfolio in late 2014 in a bid to secure new revenue streams and improve overall profitability. As part of the effort, the company inked a deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd (THATIC), who is an investment arm of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, regarding the development of server SoCs last year. Apparently, in addition to finding partners like THATIC, AMD has approached certain technology companies that ship products based on technologies developed by third parties (e.g., ARM) in regards to patent licensing. AMD says that it has already “enforced” its “intellectual property rights” against Samsung and LG and the new family of lawsuits against the latter is a continuation of these efforts. The AMD complaint requests the US ITC to issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order to stop the infringing products from being imported and sold in the U.S. If the commission finds that the defendants do infringe on AMD’s patents and decides to ban them from the U.S., multiple product lines of LG and Vizio would be affected. AMD is not a company that goes to court often and it is not a company that brings its litigations to the public attention, which is part of the reason this is only coming to light now. Back in 2005, the chip designer sued Intel alleging the latter of multiple wrongdoings that harmed AMD’s business in the 1990s and the early 2000s, but that was the only public legal process that AMD was involved into in the recent years. By contrast, the legal proceedings against Samsung and LG in the recent years went unnoticed. This also significantly contrasts with NVIDIA, which was quite vocal and public about their 2014 suit against Qualcomm and Samsung. The litigation against MediaTek, LG, Sigma Designs, and Vizio will not attract as much attention as the AMD vs. Intel fight, but it certainly marks a rare situation when AMD goes to court on the offensive. In the meantime this will be a case worth watching. As AMD already has a license agreement with a major SoC manufacturer (Samsung) in place, it means they aren't facing an entirely uphill battle. Still, barring an early out of court settlement, it may take years for this case to be fully resolved.

Reply ddriver - Saturday, February 04, 2017 - link Curious whether it is a sign of confidence or desperation. They plan on paying for it with zen money I guess. They've been in a desperate financial situation for a while, thus the timing dictates they are doing it now because now they can afford to. Reply close - Sunday, February 05, 2017 - link vladx is a patented troll. He doesn't need arguments or details, he just knows. How about we wait to see the merits of the patents in court since we have no details yet? A patent troll is an entity that buys rights to patents for no purpose other than litigation and they bully others into paying up through the threat of litigation. AMD is not and has probably never been in a position to bully anyone into anything. Also ATI was there to write the book on GPUs. They were never in the business of patenting the rectangle with rounded corners or anything like that. So chances are they feel confident justice is on this one but only now could they afford to do anything about it. Reply Michael Bay - Sunday, February 05, 2017 - link Except nV actually wrote it instead. Reply close - Sunday, February 05, 2017 - link No, actually it was written together by 3dfx, ATI, Nvidia, PowerVR, Matrox, and others. Nvidia was never alone on the market. The point was ATI (now AMD) has been doing actual research, obtaining real patents, and applying them to real products for more than 3 decades now. Quite unlike any patent trolls who usually deal with exceptionally vague or obvious patents. Nice try though :). Reply Alexvrb - Sunday, February 05, 2017 - link Nvidia coined the catchy phrase GPU, yep. Just like AMD coined APU. Catchy! Anyway, these lawsuits certainly don't fall under the category of patent trolling, and Samsung wouldn't have licensed these patents if they didn't think AMD had a legitimate claim. Reply Gich - Saturday, February 04, 2017 - link It doesn't sound like a troll patent if Samsung agreed to pay... Reply rpmrg - Saturday, February 04, 2017 - link You're a worse troll than AMD.
