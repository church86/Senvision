While it took some time before the tech giant was able to create a device that sat with consumers just right, the release of the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015 heralded the beginning of Microsoft’s burst of innovation. With the tech firm’s flagship hybrid device being more than a year old, however, speculations are high that the Surface Pro 5 would make a debut a bit later than what many expected. The release date of the Surface Pro 5 has long been in the rumor mill, with numerous missed predictions over the last few months. With the rumored October 2016 release date ultimately proving itself to be false, speculations are now high that the highly anticipated device would see a spring 2017 release date instead, according to a Tech Radar report. While this date is a bit later than what analysts and Surface fans expected, an early 2017 release actually makes perfect sense. This is because the Surface Pro 5 is an enterprise-grade device. In a lot of ways, the Surface Pro line is Microsoft’s ongoing statement that a hybrid device could be robust enough to become a full-fledged desktop replacement. With this in mind, it seems like Microsoft is definitely holding out on the Surface Pro 5’s release due to the availability of Intel’s latest processors, the Kaby Lake family. With Kaby Lake processors being shipped late 2016, a spring 2017 release date for the Surface Pro 5 definitely seems to be Microsoft’s best way to ensure that its next flagship hybrid would be its best one yet. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The rumors surrounding the Microsoft Surface Pro 5’s specs have been very encouraging so far, with numerous speculations pointing to a device with robust specs that far exceed those offered by its competitors. While the specifics of the device have not been leaked as of date, rumors have largely been unanimous in the notion that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 would carry Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, around 16GB of RAM and a 2K screen at least. Apart from this, speculations are also high that the Surface Pen, one of the most important accessories of the hybrid device, would finally be rechargeable, just like the Apple Pencil in Apple’s iPad Pro. One particular rumor that has been very persistent lately is the speculation that the Surface Pro 5 would be released in two versions, with one being the top-tier Pro variant and another being an entry-level non-Pro device. A PC Advisor report has stated that Microsoft recently released a demo of Windows 10 running on an ARM-based computer. This has then triggered further speculations that the Surface 5 (the entry-level, non-Pro variant) would come equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor instead of an Intel Kaby Lake chip. Utilizing an ARM-based processor opens up numerous possibilities for the Surface Pro 5. While the device would lose the raw computing power that is provided by Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, the ARM-based Surface device would most likely feature a vastly improved battery life and possibly even LTE connectivity. Considering the advantages that an ARM chip could give to the Surface line, it is possible that Microsoft might actually take the gamble and release a more lightweight, endurance-focused, LTE-capable machine. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] In a lot of ways, releasing an ARM-based device with full mobile connectivity would enable Microsoft to consume yet another chunk out of Apple’s target market. After all, the iPad Pro, which is Apple’s enterprise-grade hybrid device, might lag behind the Surface Pro 4 in terms of raw power, but its capability to connect to the internet through LTE is a definite plus for the device. If the next Surface hybrid would debut with the same feature, then Apple’s power tablet would definitely be in trouble. That is, of course, unless the iPad Pro 2 proves to be a revolutionary device. As for the price of the upcoming hybrid device, rumors are high that the Surface Pro 5 would start once more at $899 for its entry-level version, with higher-tier models going well into the thousands of dollars. Surface devices have never really been affordable, but they have managed to become successful nonetheless. Thus, despite the most likely steep prices of the Surface Pro 5, its features and raw power might very well be enough to warrant a purchase from consumers. For now, at least, the wait for the next great hybrid device would continue.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 17, 2016 at 5:31PM Image source: Getty Images. Looking at Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) chart this year, it's hard to imagine anything could be wrong with the memory-chip specialist. Micron's stock has risen more than 40% so far in 2016, easily outpacing the Nasdaq's 8% return. However, since the end of the dot-com bubble sell-off around the start of 2003, a far more important long-term pattern has emerged that anyone considering investing in Micron ought to consider: MU data by YCharts. While more diversified semiconductor producers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have also underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Micron shares have performed slightly worse than Intel while also proving far more volatile in the process. This boom-and-bust tendency in Micron stock makes it highly unappealing from a long-term investor's perspective. So here are two other semiconductor names investors could do well to consider in lieu of Micron. 1. Intel Though they share a common industry, Intel's and Micron's respective places within the semiconductor market give them little else in common. Intel dominates the market for PC and server microprocessors, the chips that serve as the "brains" for PCs and servers. In these markets, speed matters, and Intel's ability to consistently produce the fastest chips has allowed it to command premium prices for its chips. Over time, Intel's cushy margin structure allowed it to reinvest heavily in research-and-development and manufacturing innovations, thus extending its chips' competitive position. This self-reinforcing cycle has lead Intel to enjoy what many view as a moderate competitive advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices. The difference in quality between Intel's and Micron's segments of the semiconductor market truly shines through when you compare their respective margin structures. For example, Intel's two core operating segments are each larger, more profitable, and more stable than Micron's entire revenue base, which relies almost exclusively on commodity-like memory chips. Moreover, Micron, which recently released its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings, generated $12.4 billion in sales this fiscal year. And though Intel will not release its FY 2016 report until early next year, Intel's 2015 operating profits topped $14 billion, more than Micron's entire sales this fiscal year. For this article's purposes, Intel's chief virtue is its lack of exposure to the low-margin memory-chip business. 2. Samsung Unlike Intel, Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) competes head-to-head against Micron in the memory-chip market to a meaningful degree. However, Samsung holds an advantage over Micron in that its memory business serves as a single piece of its many business segments, one that nicely complements its consumer-electronics businesses. Samsung's phones, tablets, wearables, and other devices require memory chips in order to store the code on which their software runs. Manufacturing its own memory, via its Samsung Foundry business, allows Samsung to reduce its reliance on third-party memory suppliers like Micron, while also lowering its component costs. Samsung's memory business is not just a profit center for the company, but also serves its overall strategy by allowing it to more effectively produce its electronics. Equally important, Samsung likely remains the market's largest memory-chip maker; Samsung not only builds its own chips, but also makes chips for third-party tech companies like. Especially in industries where the market sets prices, being the largest provider can provide some benefits over the competition. In that vein, Samsung's $29 billion in memory-chip sales in fiscal year 2015 more than doubled Micron's total sales this year. What's more, Samsung's massive Foundry business gives it the ability to more effectively compete for market share against stand-alone operators like Micron. However, I prefer Samsung (like Intel) over Micron for its diversification away from the memory-chip market, not its strong competitive stance within it. Foolish bottom line Each of the companies presented here was selected because it faces less exposure to the memory-chip business than Micron. As evidenced by Micron's performance this year, investors can profit immensely by investing in Micron under the right conditions. As in any commodity-esque business, though, times of weak pricing can cause wrenching losses for companies like Micron, which relies on memory-chip sales as its sole source of revenue. To be sure, Micron has done a nice job consolidating market share, which could help give it the ability to compete throughout the memory-chip price cycle. However, for long-term investors, plenty of other stocks in the semiconductor market offer less risk and more growth than Micron does today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Google just launched a serious IoT platform under the Android Things brand. This could be a serious revenue driver for NXP, Intel, and Broadcom. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Dec 17, 2016 at 10:10AM The NXP PICO platform for Android Things, up close and personal. Image source: NXP. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google division has released a slew of specialized Android versions. This week, the Android Things platform for devices under the Internet of Things umbrella made its first appearance. Investors in the semiconductor sector should pay attention, especially those who own shares of launch partners NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). What's new? Android Things started life under the code name "Brillo" back in the spring of 2015. From the start, this platform was designed to support sophisticated sensors and efficient wireless networking, all while requiring extremely low amounts of memory space and electric power. The Brillo project has now grown up, launching into an Android-branded market presence and a handful of Google-approved hardware systems. The first Android Things developer kits come from Broadcom (under the Raspberry Pi brand), Intel, and NXP. Google has vetted five specific system-on-a-module packages to work with the launch version of Android Things, and it will stand behind those hardware-software combinations with support services and officially approved plug-in attachments. These platforms are expected to form the core of actual IoT products running the Android Things software. Given Google's massive presence in the online business world, including Android's global domination of the smartphone market, this development channel seems likely to gain traction quickly. Being aboard the initial launch hardware should lead to large volumes of IoT chip sales as this platform matures. The contenders The five launch-date platforms cover a lot of ground. For example, the Intel Edison module cuts every corner it can. It has a slow dual-core Intel Atom processor, only supports limited amounts of RAM and permanent storage, and doesn't even come with a graphics processing unit. This is the one you'd want for a no-frills IoT device where low cost and minimal power consumption are the primary design goals. But Android Things also supports the high-end Intel Joule module. Armed with about six times the processing power of an Edison module, the latest and greatest WiFi technology, and a decent graphics chip to boot, this one would be a better choice for advanced processing tasks or a screen-equipped service kiosk. The Joule development board is available now for $337 per kit. An Edison kit will run you $48 today. These products are aimed at very different target markets and are priced accordingly. NXP takes the middle ground between Intel's extreme high-end and low-end options. The Argon and Pico boards come with the same NXP i.MX6UL processor, with similar mid-range amounts of memory and support for technology standards. The Pico costs a little bit more and comes with a couple of additional networking features. These boards cost roughly $60 apiece and fit comfortably into a potential mainstream space between Intel's radical outliers. NXP is aiming these boards at decidedly mid-range applications such as locks, thermostats, temperature sensors, and lighting systems. Finally, the Broadcom-powered Raspberry Pi 3 has been available to consumers since February, 2016. The board packs a respectable processing punch for just $42, but it's currently out of stock. The Google Things launch may have overwhelmed the Raspberry Pi supply chain temporarily -- a good sign for the long-term value of these hardware and software platforms. Image source: Getty Images. What's next? This is just an early salvo in a long war. Android Things does have the deck stacked in its favor, but it still must execute over the long haul in order to make a difference. The Android brand and the years of network security work that have gone into it will help, and some of the biggest semiconductor hardware suppliers are already involved. These are positive signs for the platform's long-term survival. On the other hand, Android Things is far from first out of the gate. Name a large technology business, and chances are that your pick is testing the waters with its own IoT platform. You could even argue that Google is late to the party. That's not good. So, there's is a lot of work left to do before crowning any winners. In the end, the IoT market is easily large enough to support several major platforms, each one burrowing into a specific niche.

The KVM & Xen Changes For Linux 4.10: Includes Intel GVT Work Written by Michael Larabel in Virtualization on 17 December 2016 at 02:49 PM EST. 4 Comments Earlier in the week the KVM and Xen updates were sent in for the Linux 4.10 kernel to add to the list of changes so far for Linux 4.10. On the KVM front within the x86 space there is now support for hiding nested VMX features from guest, nested VMX can now run Microsoft Hyper-V in a guest, there is support for more AVX512 extensions, and there is infrastructure support for virtual Intel GPUs. The Intel virtual GPU work on that front is exciting with the pieces finally coming together. Already in Linux 4.10 is the VFIO mediated device interface being used by Intel's GVT plus the needed prep work within the DRM driver. It looks like Intel's getting very close to having GVT be a mainline reality, but I think there still are some needed DRM patches that didn't land yet so it might not end up happening until Linux 4.11 for having Intel virtual GPU support within VMs. More of the Linux 4.10 KVM changes via this pull request. Then with the Xen pull request there are various fixes, including for ARM/ARM64, and a change of maintainership. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The chip is expected to best Intel's finest but for a fraction of the cost.  ( AMD ) Advertisement The AMD New Horizon event took place recently, and there, the company officially announced its newest desktop processor, RyZen. The new processor is based on the Zen architecture, and it is designed to bring faster performance to regular desktop users and gamers alike. The current line of AMD processors comes from the FX line, the most notable being the FX-8150. However, this line of processors isn't capable of competing with Intel in the enthusiast market, and as such, AMD has failed to compete greatly with the market leader. With RyZen, the company is hoping to break free and return to the days of the Athlon 64 where it had the upper hand over Intel. How Good Is RyZen? AMD CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, was very excited during the entire conference, as she spoke much about what RyZen is capable of and how it stacks up against similar Intel processors. "[W]e believe that there has been no innovation in desktops over at least the last five years," Su said. She's not wrong, as the performance gains have been small and unimpressive. Then again, we could blame AMD here, as Intel would have little reason to innovate in a meaningful way if the company had strong competition in the market. However, this could change soon, seeing as the processor is set to hit store shelves before the end of Q1 2017. "The 'Zen' core at the heart of our Ryzen processors is the result of focused execution and thousands of engineering hours designing and delivering a next-level experience for high-end PC and workstation users," said Su. "Ryzen processors with SenseMI technology represent the bold and determined spirit of innovation that drives everything we do at AMD." Now, when RyZen is released, AMD claims the main processor, which is designed for the high-end market, will compete neck and neck with the Intel Core i7-6900K. In the demo shown at the event, RyZen is rocking eight cores and 16 threads at a speed of 3.4 GHz. Unfortunately, AMD did not talk about the price, but seeing as the company has been consistently releasing cheaper products than Intel, we should expect the same to apply here. What About Gaming? AMD showed some live demonstration of RyZen when it comes down to video games, and it's quite impressive. If you're the type of person who loves to play video games and stream to Twitch TV or Beam at the same time, then RyZen might be right up your alley. Here's the thing: many streamers tend to use two computers. Basically, one computer for playing the game and the other for streaming and encoding. This could be the end of this major problem, and despite the demonstration, we'd rather see this in action with our own eyes. The Core i7-6700K was also shown doing the same thing, but it fails in this regard, as the game being streamed on Twitch TV was dropping frames all over the place. It should be noted that the Core i7-6700K was running at an overclocked frequency of 4.5GHz. Vega, Anything About That? Yes, but not much was shown, and that's a bit of a disappointment. The newest Star Wars: Battlefront was shown running in 4K. Apparently, the hardware the game was running on consists of RyZen and Vega in a single machine. No word on when Vega will hit the market, but at least we have an idea of when RyZen is coming. TAG AMD RyZen, Intel, Star Wars: Battlefront © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

AMD is expected to release the Ryzen in a groundbreaking event called the New Horizon Event, next week. If this was a decade ago, somebody would easily encourage Intel to hold their peace, AMD products are just a bluff.  But today, of all days, Intel has every reason to get worried. To begin with, almost 60% of computers that are entering the market today, run on the cheaper AMD CPUs. Secondly, the world is aware of the simple fact that AMD CPUs include an addition Radeon Graphics Chipset deep within their morphology. According to PC Gamer, big companies like Lenovo, HP and Microsoft are gloriously embracing AMD chipsets. So how do you convince such big corporations that are only interested in profits, to buy your less performing yet expensive products? As a matter of fact, from the look of things, Intel's next generation of processors have been left for high end computers like Macs and HP's Envy. But for cheap computers, in the mid and low prices, AMD is the way to go. Advertisement WCCFTech editors published a piece about a certain notable aspect that indicates how fast AMD is growing. The editors argued of how AMD's stock values skyrocketed almost overnight, after Lenovo announced how they will feature the latest AMD 7th generation APUs in their imminent laptops. The only threat to AMD's newly found glory is NVIDIA's long awaited GTX 1080 Ti, (Not really sure if they will call it that way.)  All the same, AMD is doing a fabulous job and if Intel doesn't go back on the drawing board and come up with something cheaper and performing to beat the Ryzen, they might as well let Apple acquire them. The world is really insisting on cheaper, efficient and proficient CPUs. The fact that AMD is selling its chips even to other markets like in gaming consoles, means that Intel is in a tight spot. The freshly launched PS4 Pro console is already throttling an AMD chip beneath its motherboard.

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today After a long while, Intel may finally be facing tough competition this 2017 with AMD's Zen microarchitecture. Now identified with its new brand name, Ryzen, the Zen x86 core processor will be the first chip in the Summit Ridge desktop family that AMD will be focusing on in 2017. According to Trusted Reviews, the Ryzen processor will be unleashed as a 3.4GHz+ chip with eight cores (16 threads), 4 MB of L2 and 16 MB of L3 cache. With its power and features, the Ryzen chip is expected to take on Intel's super-expensive Haswell-E and Broadwell-E Core i7 enthusiast chips. Ryzen, according to AMD, is capable of doing 40 percent more work per clock cycle compared to the previous Excavator core generation. Amazingly, Ryzen is designed efficiently such that power consumption per cycle will remain the same as before. The Zen chip's performance boost is attributed to the new 14nm process. This allowed more transistors to fit onto a piece of silicon, leading to significant improvements in the chip's performance without risking increases in power consumption. The Ryzen chip also supports "Simultaneous Multi-Threading," which bears resemblance to Intel's Hyper-Threading technology. The new Zen architecture allows better distribution and multi-tasking. Although AMD has been generous in sharing details about the development of the Zen microarchitecture to the public, the company has yet to disclose the Ryzen's chip's "boost" speed (or maximum potential) and its price, according to PC World. With the impending launch of the Ryzen chip and the many subsequent products to be launched along the way, AMD's future has never looked as bright as it does at the moment. During AMD's special Ryzen live stream on Dec. 13, Chief Executive Lisa Su predicted a "very, very strong lineup" of motherboards, hardware partners, and system builders for their company. "2016 was a very strong year; we're very pleased with all the progress that we've made," Su said. "But with 2017, the best is truly yet to come," she added.

What do things look like going forward? Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 16, 2016 at 5:21PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had a great year in 2014. Its data-center business surged by more than 18% year over year, and its personal computer revenue grew in what was expected to be yet another down year for the beleaguered personal computer market. Things just generally went well for the chipmaker, which allowed the company's stock to rise from just under $26 per share to just over $36 per share -- about a 40% gain. Since then, though, Intel stock hasn't done all that well. It dropped over the course of 2015 from just over $36 per share to about $34.45 per share. Year to date in 2016, with the year almost over, Intel shares are up nearly 7%, which isn't terrible in absolute terms -- a gain is a gain, after all. However, compared with, arguably, its two most important peers in the semiconductor industry – wireless chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) -- Intel has dramatically underperformed. Qualcomm's up just under 39% year to date, enjoying a healthy recovery after a dismal 2015, and TSMC is up 33.45% year to date after experiencing a roughly flat 2015 in terms of stock price. Image source: Intel.  Taking a longer-term view Looking at a single year's performance in isolation doesn't tell investors the whole story. After all, if a stock dropped 75% in one year and then rose by 100% the following year, investors who had to suffer that 75% drop are still down 50% compared to where they were before that precipitous plunge. That's why it's important to look at how a stock has performed over a longer period relative to its peers. So how does Intel's share price performance stack up to Qualcomm's and TSMC's since the beginning of 2013? Stock Start Price (1/2/13) End Price (12/13/16) % Difference Intel $21.38 $36.80 72.1 Qualcomm $64.75 $69.34 7.08 TSMC $18.10 $30.36 67.73 Taking this longer-term view puts Intel in a far better light compared with Qualcomm and TSMC than this year's results do. If an investor had picked one of these three large-cap chip companies to invest her or his money into at the start of 2013, the highest share price appreciation would have come from Intel, followed by TSMC. Qualcomm would have been, by far, the worst performer of the bunch over that time frame. Peering at the underlying fundamentals Although stock prices are what ultimately matter at the end of the day, it's also important to look at the fundamental revenue and profit performances of each company over that period. Since the beginning of 2013, TSMC's trailing-12-month revenue has grown by 50.54%. Qualcomm and Intel, on the other hand, have seen sub-10% growth over that time. Image source: YCharts. In terms of operating profit growth, TSMC once again has far outperformed its peers, growing at 64.4% over that time, versus declines for both Intel and Qualcomm: Image source: YCharts. Intel's 5.24% operating income decline represents the worst performance of the bunch, followed by Qualcomm's 1.29% decline in operating profit. Both companies saw operating profit decline even as revenues grew, suggesting that both suffered operating margin contraction. TSMC's operating-profit growth has been very robust over that time, up by 64.4% and outpacing revenue growth, meaning that operating margin expanded.  Looking ahead As far as stock price performance goes, Intel underperformed in 2016, but has done reasonably well over a three-year time horizon. In terms of the underlying financial fundamentals, Intel's revenue is up, but nowhere near as much as the stock price is. Operating income is actually down a smidgen.  This fundamental performance is reflective of the fact that the personal computer market -- to which Intel is heavily exposed -- has declined, offsetting the growth that the company has enjoyed in other areas (such as in its data center group and Internet of Things group). It has also boosted its operating expenses to invest in those future opportunities beyond the personal computer market.  Intel is doing what it needs to in order to secure its long-term future, but investments take time, which dents near-term profitability. If the investments that Intel is making ultimately prove successful, we should see both an acceleration in revenue growth as well as growth in operating profit that starts to outpace revenue growth. I think, though, that investors are going to need to be patient, as it might still be a couple of more years before that potential fundamental financial outperformance might happen -- if it happens at all.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Clear Containers, launched last year, represents Intel's effort to combine the isolation provided by virtual machines with the deployment advantages of containers, in conjunction with hardware acceleration. Through KVM stage1, rkt for more than a year has supported virtual machine-based containers. Now CoreOS has given rkt the ability to automatically shut down a container subject to a privilege escalation attack and to restart a new instance of the container. "What we've done is patched the kernel and we trap various important system calls like open and exec," said Brandon Philips, CTO of CoreOS, in a phone interview with The Register. If you're running containers on bare metal, Philips said, "you want increased isolation and an additional layer of privilege separation." As CoreOS security engineer Matthew Garrett describes in a blog post, the modifications to the kernel allow it to notify the hypervisor when processes are created and destroyed. Communication between the two software components allows them to coordinate their respective states. And theses state can be confirmed whenever a process requires permission verification. "For example, when a process requests that a file be opened, the kernel now calls out to the hypervisor," said Garrett. "The hypervisor is then able to examine the process state and ensure that it remains consistent with its internal representation of process state." If inconsistency is detected, if the kernel's state differs from the hypervisor state, that indicates unauthorized modification. When that happens, an administrator can be notified and the compromised container can be discontinued or restarted. Philips said the changes to rkt makes a large class of attacks more difficult. Vulnerabilities that aren't addressed, like "Dirty COW" and attacks within the userspace, may eventually be addressed by other Linux-oriented security efforts like the Kernel Self Protection Project and the GRSecurity project. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Google gently leads Intel into its cloud: This is for your own good All is well, rejoice, rejoice, let's get into the white 'n' fluffy Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll focus on 2-3 broad areas of interest and will work with Mozillians to refine into specific topics: Product topics e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics Emerging Technologies e.g. Internet of Things; Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality; and their implications on Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access People topics e.g. teamwork & collaboration; community-building; communications Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from general “TED”-like inspirational talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS September 1: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 1 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

As ArsTechnica noted, the company “told us repeatedly and emphatically that it had taken no specific steps to improve MacBook Pro battery life” with macOS Sierra 10.12.2. Now, some people have reported seeing improved battery performance after installing the update on their MacBook Pro, but there’s a reasonable explanation for that. Wait, does that mean that reports of new MacBook Pro owners seeing poor battery life of five hours or less are bogus? In a word, no. In a nutshell, users initially saw decreased battery performance because post-install processes put a major strain on the battery. The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple was told the same thing by his own Apple sources. According to Apple’s own data, the new MacBook Pro’s batteries are performing as intended (the firm rates the new MacBook Pro’s batteries at ten hours of web browsing and iTunes movie playback). Like iOS, macOS typically performs resource-intensive tasks following a major software update. Some of those processes can run for hours, if not days, until they complete. The battery is affected by things like initial Spotlight indexing, iCloud sync and the Photos app which performs detailed analysis of the user’s photos and videos to recognize faces, objects and scenes on them and populate the Memories tab with automatically created albums and slideshows. Battery may be sapped until facial recognition, Memories, image analysis and other initial first-run tasks in Photos have completed. macOS also needs to sync your iCloud Drive, Photo Streams and iCloud Photo Library. Because these and other processes can make for a lot of uploading, downloading and CPU usage, battery life in the first day or two may not necessarily be representative of normal battery life once everything has settled down, as Ars notes. “This could also help to explain some of those reports that battery life has improved since the 10.12.2 update landed,” wrote the site. “It could be that the update’s installation coincided with the end of those first-time Spotlight and iCloud operations.” That’s not saying that the new MacBook Pro’s battery is stronger than its predecessor. As Ars explains, 13 and 15-inch Pros come with a 34 percent and 24 percent reduction in battery capacity, respectively: the 13-incher went from 74.9 WHr to 49.2 WHr and its 15-inch counterpart fell from 99.5 WHr to 76 WHr. As for Intel’s Skylake chips in the new Pros, they’re more power efficient but only when your Mac is idling and not running resource-heavy apps such as video editing, having lots of browser tabs open and so forth. Skylake chips in new Pros use around the same amount of power as 2015’s Broadwell in previous-generation 13″ Pro and a little bit less than 2013’s Haswell in 15″ Pro. Intel says Skylake chips are more power-efficient than their predecessors, but it seems that’s only really true when they’re under extremely light load. “The less idle processor time you have, the less Intel’s recent power optimizations can help you,” noted Ars. Another problem lies in the fact that 15-inch Pros have power-hungry discrete GPUs which cannot be disabled to conserve power because the machines must be capable of driving two 5K screens at 60Hz at once. Because there’s no integrated-only GPU option, you’re unable to prioritize battery life over external display output. As for Touch Bar’s impact on Pro’s battery, it’s relatively minor versus the rest of the system thanks to Apple’s power-efficient T1 chip. Plus, the Touch Bar screen uses power-saving OLED technology (versus the notebook’s LCD-based screen) and switches off when you’re not actively using the computer. Other factors are at play here. Some of the apps you use may be real battery hogs, for example, especially if they don’t take full advantage of your computer’s hardware and system APIs like anything Adobe, video players like VLC and media center apps like Plex and Kodi. These and many other third-party media players use the CPU, not the GPU, to render Mac-unfriendly video files like MKV, AVI and DIVX. This is why Apple’s ten-hour battery life claim assumes browsing the web in Safari and playing movies in iTunes. Safari is optimized for low energy consumption while movies imported in iTunes are re-encoded in Apple-friendly H.264 or MP4 format which the GPU handles very efficiently via hardware acceleration. Ars wraps up the article by providing a few power-saving tips. Use Safari over Chrome whenever possible as it takes advantage of macOS’s power-friendly technologies. You should reduce screen brightness and close any unused browser tabs and apps, especially items in the Mac’s menu bar and apps which frequently perform a background sync, like Dropbox, One Drive and Outlook. Lastly, launch the Activity Monitor app within the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder to identify apps that may be using too much power. Energy tab in Activity Monitor can help identify battery hogs. Pro tip: you can check out your battery’s time remaining estimate in Activity Monitor. An earlier version of Apple’s support document about Mac batteries stated that the battery’s time remaining indicator would update frequently and change depending on screen brightness and system workload. The now-removed passage said that some users might see the time remaining “drop significantly” should macOS update the indicator while the user was opening a very large file or starting up an application. “It’s important to remember it’s an estimate based on what your computer is doing at the specific time it updates,” read the now-removed part of Apple’s support document. All mentions of the battery’s time remaining got removed from the document yesterday. Mac notebooks with macOS Mavericks 10.9 or later now display the low battery warning when the battery has approximately ten minutes of power remaining versus earlier macOS versions, which report it at fifteen percent or less, reads the document. Aside from a number of big fixes and performance improvements, macOS Sierra 10.12.2 did address graphical glitches that some customers complained about, as per Apple’s software engineering boss Craig Federighi.

Then when I looked at an animated iMessage the discrete graphics came on (doesn’t ever go off until messages is quit) and time went down faster. I think they need to redesign graphics switching to turn back off when not needed or give an energy prefs to do the opposite of unchecking “use automatic graphics switching does” which locks it to discrete, mobile users want to lock it to integrated! Rolf Bause But hey, it’s thinner tho – and that’s what counts at the end of the day! Get used to it, fanboys! madmaxmedia The 2020 MacBook Pro is going to have 20-hour battery life if you’re doing nothing, but only 20 minutes if you’re doing anything CPU-intensive… Daniel Werner But it will only be 0,01 inches thick!!!!!11111oneone OUsooner08 Guess what my work Surface Pro 4 does the same crap. You can hover over the battery at any given time within a 10 minute period and get wildly different “time remaining” numbers. boosook The problem is not only the unreliability of the indicator. The problem is simply that battery life is much shorter than the previous macbooks, because batteries are much smaller. Apple promised a miracle (same battery life with smaller batteries) that simply did not happen. OUsooner08 Except that’s not true, I’m getting 9-11 hours based on the criteria set in the battery testing standards Apple uses which is web browsing. Watching iTunes movies I got 12 hours on a charge. Apple didn’t promise “up to 10 hours of Photo Shop” or “up to 10 hours of gaming.” Byambaa I am gonna sum up the entire thing from apple inside perspective: We have to show some changes in our new model! – Lets make it thinner. But the batteries have to get smaller then. – Remove the depressing battery indicator and say them, they should do nothing to longer the battery live or close as many programs as possible and at least dim the screen, who cares about iSheep’ eyes. – It may have a negative impact on our mac sales and profit! – Increase the price then. People won’t know about it at first. – Do we improve the battery life in coming updates? – Lets be really quiet and hold the 30 percent battery percentage’ peace we cut off. sorry for my bad english 😀 boosook Lol… The only step they could take is… Put in a bigger battery! Guys deal with it: the batteries in the new Mac books are underpowered. 35% smaller in the 13″ and 25% in the 15″ compared to previous generation. There’s no software update that could fix this. Apple chose to sacrifice everything (battery size, keyboard, ports) on the altar of the “slimmest Mac ever” mantra, and these are the results. These are not pro computers, not anymore.

He has got a few plans for Smartron, which has already released tablets and smartphones in the premium range — to make it a Samsung or Huawei of India. The firm was set up two years ago, but was kept in the stealth mode as it developed products that factor in the advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and artificial intelligence. It launched its initial models about six months ago with Sachin Tendulkar as its brand ambassador. The company has built a team of 200 employees, with 90 per cent of them in the research and design team, and raised ₹100 crore. “We have so far made revenues of ₹50 crore,” he said. “We are planning to enter the next phase of growth. We will initially raise ₹250 crore in the next few months, and later ₹1,000 crore to support our developmental plans for the next 18-24 months.” The start-up plans to grow its team to 500 people.Smart firm “We would like to be known as a good product company. We have filed for 50 global patents in the areas of robotics, artificial intelligence and IoT. We are in the process of building a platform for apps driven by smart technologies,” Lingareddy said. Lingareddy set up Soft Machines in 2006 in the US along with his former colleague at Intel, Mohammad A Abdallah. The firm remained in a stealth mode for about seven years till it developed a chip with high processing power. After facing teething troubles early on, the firm weathered the financial meltdown and went on to raise $100 million from global investors. Reports suggest that Soft Machines’ acquisition size could be in the order of ₹2,000-3,000 crore. The firm, however, remains tight-lipped about the deal size, citing confidentiality terms.

Co. Ltd. If Samsung spins off its contract chip manufacturing business, this Apple supplier might be set to benefit. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 16, 2016 at 11:11AM A report from Business Korea says that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is considering spinning off its contract chip manufacturing business. The report goes on to say that Samsung began mulling this over "after the company lost Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest customer in the sector of application processors" to Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short. Image source: Intel.  It's hard to know if this will ultimately happen, but if it does, it could have some interesting implications for TSMC. Without Samsung Electronics, Samsung Foundry might fall behind Contract chip manufacturers like TSMC generally don't just build chips on the latest whiz-bang manufacturing technology. They build chips on a broad spectrum of technologies, ranging from brand-new technologies all the way to technologies that first began production a decade or more ago. Very few chip manufacturers have been able to deliver those leading-edge technologies at a rapid cadence, with just Samsung, TSMC, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at the forefront (with Global Foundries saying that it will be, too). Other chip-makers, like United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC), or UMC, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (NYSE:SMI), tend to bring technologies to market years after the top players do. There are many chips to be built on older manufacturing technologies, so these smaller, weaker players can still go after a significant portion of the semiconductor market. However, on older generation technologies, a technology leader like TSMC has significant scale and potentially yields advantages over the smaller technology laggards (since its "mature" technologies compete with their "leading edge" technologies). Nevertheless, I think that if Samsung were to spin off its contract chip manufacturer, the stand-alone Samsung Foundry wouldn't be able to afford the substantial R&D and capital equipment investments to stay at the leading edge of technology -- especially if it could no longer count on the captive demand from Samsung's chip design group (which, itself, has plenty of captive demand from Samsung Electronics). In short, I think it would become another UMC or SMIC -- effectively eliminating the foundry competition that TSMC currently has in building leading-edge chips. TSMC already captures much of the leading-edge foundry business out there, but additional share here certainly couldn't hurt. Two potential challengers If Samsung were to effectively be out of the leading-edge technology race, there's still Global Foundries and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) that could potentially step in to take its place as the No. 2 leading-edge contract chip manufacturer. Global Foundries talks quite a big game and has for years suggested that it would deliver leadership technologies alongside the major players, but thus far reality hasn't been so kind to the chipmaker. It couldn't develop a viable 14/16-nanometer generation technology on its own, which forced it to license Samsung's 14-nanometer LPE/LPP technologies, for example. The chip-maker indicates that it's going to be in production on a competitive 7-nanometer technology by late 2018, but I wouldn't bet money on the company delivering on that promise. Intel has the technology to compete effectively with TSMC and it has been making plenty of noise to suggest that it will eventually become a viable leading-edge contract chip manufacturer (right now, Intel primarily builds chips on leading-edge technologies for itself). However, just as Global Foundries has a technology credibility problem, Intel has a contract chip manufacturing credibility problem. Even though Intel Custom Foundry has been around for more than half a decade, it's still not generating revenues that would be considered significant by any stretch of the imagination.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 2, 2017 Harrowing Story of Installing Libreboot on ThinkPad 43 Comments by: Bryan Cockfield December 16, 2016 As an Apple user, I’ve become somewhat disillusioned over the past few years. Maybe it’s the spirit of Steve Jobs slowly vanishing from the company, or that Apple seems to care more about keeping up with expensive trends lately rather than setting them, or the nagging notion Apple doesn’t have my best interests as a user in mind. Whatever it is, I was passively on the hunt for a new laptop with the pipe dream that one day I could junk my Apple for something even better. One that could run a *nix operating system of some sort, be made with quality hardware, and not concern me over privacy issues. I didn’t think that those qualities existed in a laptop at all, and that my 2012 MacBook Pro was the “lesser of evils” that I might as well keep using. But then, we published a ThinkPad think piece that had two words in it that led me on a weeks-long journey to the brand-new, eight-year-old laptop I’m currently working from. Those two words: “install libreboot”. Libreboot is a piece of free software that replaces proprietary BIOS firmware on some modern computers. This has, surprisingly, become increasingly difficult to do as Intel ramps up deployment of the Intel Management Engine. In a nutshell, the IME is a separate processor that can monitor or even take over everything happening in a computer and send that information out over the network to anyone (or any company) that has control of it. It does so without any knowledge of the user and is (obviously) a huge security vulnerability. Since Intel’s competitors do similar things, there’s almost no escape unless you can replace the IME with something like libreboot or coreboot. Not as Easy as You’d Think When I started researching libreboot, I assumed that it would be a simple process: download it and run some installer on my computer that would re-flash the BIOS. It couldn’t take any more than a half hour! Especially since the original article simply said “install libreboot” as if it was something that a child could do in between naps. The reality of what I was about to dive into, however, was much different. First of all, libreboot only works on a handful of older ThinkPads. Newer models have fallen victim to a new strategy by Intel of checking the firmware loaded on the BIOS chip and disabling the computer if an unapproved firmware is discovered. Apparently Intel thinks that fixing security flaws or modifying something that you own is ridiculous and unacceptable. Anyway, I picked up an eight-year-old X200 on eBay for $65 shipped. I’m a simple guy who enjoys simple but reliable things even if they’re getting along in years, so the age of the computer wasn’t too much of a concern for me. Thinking I was doing pretty well for myself, I took a look at the installation instructions for the new firmware. Some Disassembly Required This is a step I probably should have taken before ordering the computer. Not that it would have stopped me from doing this, but it probably would have given me a better idea of what I should expect from this process. First of all, I found out that to flash the chip, disassembly and soldering would be required. The firmware has to be programmed directly. Anytime something like this is done, bricking the device is a real possibility. At least I would only be out $65. The tiny chip to the left of the Intel-branded processor is the source of the problem. Then, I learned that the BeagleBone Black is the preferred device to use to flash the new firmware to the ThinkPad. I have three Raspberry Pis lying around, but I went ahead and suspiciously ordered a BeagleBone for $40. Couldn’t hurt, I told myself, and I’ll have a new tool to use for other stuff in the future. But it did seem weird that there wasn’t an option to use a Raspberry Pi. The next hurdle was figuring out exactly what type of firmware chip I had in my laptop, because there are different SOIC clips for different types of chips, and the only way to find out which sized chip I had was to get the laptop and take it apart. This set me back a few days (and another $10) waiting on the correct clip to arrive. During this process I also learned that there is no free software that will run on Intel’s proprietary WiFi card in these computers, so I also ordered an Atheros card to install ($15) since I had the laptop taken apart already. New Atheros WiFi card installed. Moving along, the BeagleBone had to be configured in a very particular way. I had never interacted with one of these before, and it’s not quite as straightforward as a Raspberry Pi. This process took me a few hours over the course of two days. I also learned through a third-party tutorial that Libreboot actually can be flashed with a Raspberry Pi, but this is one (among many) situations where the libreboot folks will go to great lengths to use free and open source software when they can. The BeagleBone fits their requirements, the Pi does not, and they do not mention this. I could easily have saved myself the $40 and used a Pi, but in the spirit of libreboot (and the fact that I was too far along to switch) I pressed on. Navigating Libreboot’s Install Process Most of the problem I had setting up the BeagleBone is with libreboot’s files and instructions. For example, at one point I had to patch the libreboot ROM file with a MAC address descriptor specific to the Ethernet card in my laptop. It wasn’t immediately clear which script out of the many provided would do this. Even then, the different ROMs that are available were all in a single folder, and unless you realize this immediately you’ll fill the memory of the BeagleBone when you unzip the archive. In general, it felt like I needed multiple degrees in computer science to make sense of their instructions on the first try. This can be a common plague of free software: alienating people through documentation that doesn’t relate to those with less knowledge and experience. And I’m not exactly an amateur, either. I have a degree in electrical engineering and passable knowledge of what’s going on, but even then I felt like I was blindly charging through a dark jungle of jargon. Anyway, the BeagleBone Black I received didn’t have a display output (that I could find; I’ve never used one before and might have been missing something) and I had some difficulty getting it to work over the USB link to my Mac. That meant getting it on the network via Ethernet, and since my router is in the kitchen I set up shop there. After soldering some wires to the SOC clip, I was finally ready to start flashing some firmware. At this point, I’ve had the X200 for almost three weeks, all spent waiting on parts I couldn’t have known I needed and programming the BeagleBone to act as a programmer. My libreboot flashing station in the kitchen. Complete with janky power supply. The actual flashing only took me about an hour and a half, though. Once I figured out which ROM to use and hooked up my 3.3V power supply (luckily I had one of these cobbled together already) it was a fairly simple process to back up the factory ROM, verify it, and start flashing libreboot. There was one major hiccup at this point, though. I attempted this process four times, and each time the new firmware couldn’t be verified. Error messages appeared everywhere, which is not something you’d want to see at this point in the process. The BeagleBone wrote the firmware successfully but afterwards, for some reason, couldn’t verify it. After getting a little anxious that I might have failed after all of this work, I decided to stick the battery in the laptop to see if it would boot up. I saw the picture of Tux and Gnu hanging out on my BIOS screen, and made the executive decision that libreboot was successfully installed. I went ahead and installed Ubuntu to make sure everything would work correctly since I already had an Ubuntu live-USB stick lying around. Even the new WiFi card seems to work well (except it doesn’t have a 5 GHz antenna like the Intel card did, but that’s not too big of a deal). Not an ideal place to get stuck. Free software aficionados will note that Ubuntu isn’t really the pinnacle of the free software movement. It’s been criticized for including proprietary software, binary blobs, and other issues. That being said, after the initial Ubuntu test installation, I did try to install Trisquel (crashed during the install because it got confused that the X200 doesn’t have an optical drive), a version of Arch called Parabola (wouldn’t boot from a USB stick) and another Debian-based distribution called gNewSense (you have to chuckle at the terrible name), but I found all of them to be difficult to install, unusable, or both. For now, I’m happy just to have neutralized Intel’s Big Brother and I’ll probably keep using Ubuntu until the libre distributions have improved a little more (or I get really bored one day and decide to try again). Even though the process to install libreboot was tedious, it is possible. I would recommend having a libreboot computer to anyone who cares about privacy, security, or freedom. Even if you don’t want to throw your Apple in the garbage.

Most of us aren’t worried about an advanced firmware bound rootkit from an adware drive-by. We already have UEFI secure boot to prevent that. If that’s even a likely threat; the cost is very high and targeting is limited. It’s as easy as a single NSL/Court order to Intel/Lenovo/Dell and the NSA/CIA/TLA can get the private keys and bypass Boot guard entirely because its rootkit is “official”. User controlled Secure Boot that provides the same functionality on the other hand uses USER generated/managed keys no one else has, including the OEM.

Buy a (refurbished) T420 Thinkpad from a reputable dealer. Mine comes from A*n (for USD 180.00) and has–compared with “more modern” machines–great specs, including an optical drive, and Win7 for those times when I absolutely, positively must have a win OS. 2. When you turn the computer on, you’ll see a message in the start-up splash screen which states “To interrupt normal start-up, press press the blue “ThinkVantage” button” [on the keyboard]. 3. Install Linux Mint 17.3 from the boot thumb drive or DVD which you’ve created 4. Twenty minutes later, or a little later if you use DVD, you’ll have a dual-boot Linux computer which also, by the way, runs one of the last almost-acceptable versions of windows. Suggestions– 1.Don’t try to use Libreboot if you have an option. I took the route outlined here BECAUSE I read what I needed to do in order to use Libreboot on my existing hardware, and I did NOT have a computer which I wanted to salvage, come Hell or high water; nor do I have the temperament to make a career out of upgrading computers. 2. Do NOT use any version of Mint Linux past 17.3. All reports (from me, too) are that Mint 17.3 is rock-solid and a joy–a real joy–to use, and that later versions are not, due to the builds being associated with the later “buggy” versions of Ubuntu (cf.

Either way, turn Monday I’ll probably find out. Report comment Reply asdf says: December 17, 2016 at 12:58 pm The EC (or Embedded Controller) is a separate microcontroller (Renesas H8S in older models, SMSC/Microchip MEC series in newer ones). Report comment Reply Unferium says: December 20, 2016 at 5:32 am Dunno why I’m replying since this is now an old post…. a day passed before you commented so I missed the main opportunity… However if you do see this thread again: In my Dell, the EC is connected to some interrupt lines and I recall some #reset lines also.(where did I save those schematics?) The EC will interrupt the CPU and call SMM functions when entering a thermal debug mode… Holding Shift and FN then typing 15324 enables EC into a kind of debug mode and FN + R or FN + T pauses Ring 0 (OS Kernel, my mental memory is stale about ring levels though) execution and shoves some payload into the memory (SMBIOS? BIOS-reserved?) area to display the thermal debug pages (EC controls all thermal and SMBUS in the laptop) If the EC is completely seperate and thus has no hypervisor capability then explain this. P.s. works on older Intel architecture where those CPU control lines are exposed between the CPU and the Northbridge (MCH/PCH in some systems). The newer embedded core i# don’t seem to show the pages confirming the missing control lines even though the LED flashes to indicate the EC has entered this mode. A lot can be learnt from schematics (if available for your current model) Report comment asdf says: December 22, 2016 at 1:02 am Systems management mode can be entered via an external pin, but why do you assume that the external controller is injecting code, rather than the functionality being present in the BIOS (which is responsible for setting up the SMM handler in the first place)? Lenovo’s choices of embedded controllers are well documented on sites like ThinkWiki etc. Report comment nob says: December 20, 2016 at 1:23 pm With regards to clock throttling on C2D thinkpads, on some units when plugged into the 65W adapter, will throttle clockspeed when also plugged into a bad battery. Can be forced to full speed with throttlestop, plugging into a 90W adapter instead, getting a good battery, or all three. Cheers Report comment Reply macegr says: December 16, 2016 at 11:16 am The BeagleBone Black does have a display output, but it’s micro-HDMI so you’ll also need a special cable to connect it to a monitor. Report comment Reply erat says: December 17, 2016 at 4:53 am Another method for getting non-graphic output from a BBB is the 6-pin serial header that can output even the OS boot messages through a USB/serial dongle. It’s that thin row of unlabeled (of course) pins near one of the female headers along one side of the BBB. If you don’t need graphics, it’s definitely the way to go. Report comment Reply Richard says: December 16, 2016 at 11:37 am “Apple doesn’t have my best interests as a user in mind” In that case I think that the spirit of Steve Jobs is alive and well at Apple. He show’ed the industry two things. People want form over function and that having a walled garden is a great way to make a LOT of money. Report comment Reply Galane says: December 16, 2016 at 3:17 pm So is taking credit for other people’s work, going back to when Jobs was passing off Wozniak’s hardware wizardry as his own to Atari. Think how different things would be if Woz had gotten fed up with Jobs and split before they started Apple. Report comment Reply asdf says: December 18, 2016 at 4:22 am Without Jobs, Wozniak would likely have remained at his H&P dreamjob for the rest of his career.

Was a pretty simple process, just had to trip the write protect pins on the mobo and it was finished in an hour or two. Report comment Reply nob says: December 20, 2016 at 1:28 pm I’ve been slowly following this same adventure myself for several on/off months. Most of my headache has been the same story – piss-poor documentation that takes great assumptions in the reader’s prior knowledge, linux being linux (awful distro I won’t use, distro I would use won’t install, distro I knew worked stopped working, etc), complete ambiguity of what the next step is at several points. Trying to do it all from within windows before making the jump to linux might well just be a pipe-dream. Glad to see a post about coreboot/libreboot on HAD at least though, thanks for the write-up Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The New Linux 4.10 Kernel Features So Far: AMD Zen, TBM3, More ARM Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 16 December 2016 at 11:08 AM EST. 3 Comments Here is a look at the new features so far of the Linux 4.10 kernel, less than one week into the two-week merge window process. There is a lot of great improvements and additions to Linux 4.10, but we'll see if it ends up being a bigger release than Linux 4.9. Among the Linux 4.10 changes we have covered in the past week on Phoronix, if you're behind on your reading of our 10+ original articles per day, are the following highlights for this next kernel version: DRM / Graphics: - Yet another big DRM update including three new ARM DRM drivers. - Prep work on Intel GVT support coming together. - The i915 DRM driver has scheduler prep work and priority boosting, among many other low-level code improvements. - AMDGPU DRM has power management fixes and RPM fan information along with a new GPU VM manager. - The open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) driver is very exciting this time around with atomic mode-setting, DP MST, preliminary BOOST support for faster performance, a LED driver, and more. - The VC4 Raspberry Pi driver presents ETC1 and fragment shader threading support. - Freedreno MSM has initial support for the Qualcomm Adreno A5xx along with early 3D bits in the Freedreno Gallium3D Mesa driver. - The Linux kernel is now without any FBDEV maintainer as this subsystem continues to lose interest by most Linux kernel developers. Disk / Storage / File-System: - EXT4 DAX iomap support along with other improvements, including fscrypt changes. - DAX iomap for XFS and other improvements. There's also now a new temporary maintainer to the XFS code for the Linux kernel. - UBIFS file encryption support making use of the fscrypt framework. - A RAID5 write-back cache feature for MD along with more AVX2 optimizations. - ATA Command Priority support. - Performance tuning for F2FS. - A variety of block changes. Other Hardware: - Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support! Yes, TBM3 is finally here for benefiting Broadwell-E and future Intel CPUs. - Early support for NVIDIA's Tegra P1 / Parker SoC (Tegra 186). - There's also support for several new ARM platforms with the mainline kernel including the Samsung Exynos 5433, HiSilicon Hip07, Qualcomm Snapdragon 808/810, Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 6X, Pine64, Droid 4, PhooPlug v3, and much more. There's also better mainline support for the Raspberry Pi 3. - HDMI CEC is now mainstream rather than being within the kernel's staging area. - Various x86 laptop quirks. - OpenRISC improvements for those looking forward to this open, royalty-free processor ISA. - A mediated device interface for VFIO as part of Intel's GVT graphics virtualization support and NVIDIA is also using it as part of their vGPU support. - Microsoft Surface 3/4 touch input support. - More AMD Zen (Ryzen) code is being mainlined. Other: - Many power management updates. - The usual work from Ingo Molnar's changes, including some code related to AMD Zen. - 1,000+ staging changes. - EFI now exposes the frame-buffer configuration for localized update strings and more. Stay tuned for more Linux 4.10 coverage as the merge window remains open until right before Christmas. Once the merge window is over and the new features landed, you can begin seeing preliminary Linux 4.10 kernel benchmarks on Phoronix. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel Makes Available BIOS and Drivers for NUC7i[x]BN and NUC7i[x]BK NUC Kits The drivers are only compatible with Windows 10 64-bit Dec 16, 2016 12:55 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Since Intel has recently added a new NUC kit series to its line-up, namely the NUC7i[x]BN and NUC7i[x]BK devices, we have gathered all drivers and BIOS files required by these devices to provide maximum performance and usability. To be clear about the targeted models, the producer has provided installation files for its NUC7i3BNK, NUC7i5BNK, and NUC7i7BNH Next Unit Computing kits (NUC7i[x]BN series), as well as for the NUC7i3BNH and NUC7i5BNH device models (NUC7i[x]BK series). When it comes to the available files, owners of these products can apply Intel’s Management Engine (11.6.0.1196), Rapid Storage (15.2.0.1020), Ready Mode (1.1.70.528), and Thunderbolt (16.2.55.275) chipset packages. In addition to that, Intel has also developed the devices’ Graphics (21.20.16.4541) and Ethernet (21.1) drivers, and takes care of their Bluetooth (19.01.1627.3533) and WLAN (19.20.3) capabilities as well. Last but not least, the newly-released NUC kits benefit from a Consumer IR (5.3.2.0) driver provided by ITE, ALC Audio (6.0.1.7982) and Card Reader (10.0.14393.29093) files developed by Realtek, as well as from devices’ initial BIOS (might turn up useful if future versions include bugs). As far as installation goes, except for the BIOS, to apply the available drivers, simply save and extract them one by one, run the setup.exe, and follow all instructions displayed on the screen for a complete upgrade. However, once finished, don’t forget to perform a system reboot to allow the drivers to take effect properly. If this task isn’t requested automatically, it would be a good idea to perform it manually to make sure no issues are encountered. That said, from the links below, follow the one that best describes your NUC model, apply all drivers, and constantly check our website to be aware when newer versions are available.

 How the hot startup that stole Apple's thunder wound up in Silicon Valley's graveyard Steve Kovach Dec. 17, 2016, 8:00 AM 107,545 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eric Migicovsky Craig Barritt/Getty Images for AOL Inc. For a moment, it looked like the story would have a happy ending. As struggling smartwatch maker Pebble discussed selling itself to Fitbit, a larger competitor in the wearable technology market, the chatter among the Pebble team was that they would continue working on their product under the wing of a new, more stable corporate parent. Fitbit’s co-founder James Park even visited Pebble’s offices and, following a brief introduction from Pebble CEO Eric Migicovsky, talked reassuringly about how excited he was to welcome Pebble into the Fitbit family. But within a month it became apparent that Fitbit’s $40 million acquisition wasn’t a lifeline for Pebble, it was a fire sale. Choice assets and employees were cherry picked, the rest discarded. Most employees out of Pebble's staff of about 100 were laid off, their stock suddenly worthless. It was a sad ending for a company once seen as a brilliant example of Silicon Valley chutzpah, a scrappy startup that had forced tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google to play catch-up. But it also capped a tumultuous year of poor sales, supplier problems, failed acquisition talks, and a general lack of consumer interest in smartwatches, according to several sources that Business Insider spoke to.  "By the time we got into late spring and june of this year, I was like, OK, it does not look good," one Pebble insider said. "I didn't think we were going to make it to 2017. It was dragged out forever." At a time when Silicon Valley is racing towards the next big thing, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars, the demise of Pebble is a stark reminder that even the most promising and buzzed about innovations don’t always survive the harsh realities of the marketplace. Early success According to the sources Business Insider spoke to, the signs of trouble for Pebble began to appear early on, though they were often ignored among the excitement of a nascent smartwatch business that many believed would be as big as smartphones. Pebble burst on to the scene in 2012 after launching what was then the most successful Kickstarter campaign in history, raising $10.2 million to fund the production of the first smartwatch. Pebble proved there was interest in the wrist-worn gadgets, well before Apple introduced the Apple Watch and other big tech companies followed suit. The first Pebble launched in early 2013 to positive reviews. Although it appealed mainly to techies, the product was a solid first attempt at a modern smartwatch. The watch could display notifications like incoming texts and calendar alerts and run a bunch of apps ranging from ESPN to Evernote. Pebble continued to launch new products, including the Pebble Time, the first device with Pebble’s new take on a smartwatch operating system. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider But things started getting hairy in 2015 when Apple, the world's largest technology company, released its long-awaited smartwatch.  Migicovsky was unfazed by the new competition, telling Business Insider shortly after the Apple Watch was announced that he wasn't worried Apple might cut into his sales. "I think it will drive a lot more interest and a lot more volume at Pebble."  The Apple Watch did initially boost interest in Pebble, as consumers viewed Pebble's product as a cheaper, more capable alternative. But sales eventually began to shrink, sources say. Apple's brand was so strong, recalls one insider, that it sucked up all the oxygen.  And Apple's decades of product-building experience gave it another big advantage. Sources familiar with Pebble's supply chain said the company had difficulty paying suppliers building the products in Taiwan throughout 2015, especially payments related to production of the Pebble Time Round. In some cases, these suppliers would call for payments on outstanding purchase orders and get no response from Pebble. Some of those outstanding orders still remained unpaid by the time Fitbit entered acquisition talks with Pebble. Some people close to the company also blamed Pebble's supply chain team for playing favorites, attempting to move a lot of production from Taiwan-based Quanta Computer to Compal Electronics. Pebble continued to raise money through Kickstarter, sales of current products, and other private sources. But it wasn't enough to fund the production of new products.   The expected wave of consumer demand for smartwatches never materialized; even Apple appeared to be having trouble convincing the world that a smartwatch — like the iPhone — was another must-have gadget. The market was not as big as everyone had hoped, and the market was getting crowded. Layoffs and deal talks When Pebble's head of sales sent an email to his team after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend in 2015, there was no more ignoring the magnitude of the problem. Sales during the biggest shopping weekend of the year were down from the year before. If things didn't improve, the email warned ominously, adjustments would have to be made.  Apple CEO Tim Cook unveils the Apple Watch Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Pebble's business never fully rebounded, and internal discussions began after the holiday shopping season about what changes needed to happen so that the company could survive. In March of 2016, Pebble laid off 25% of its staff, as Business Insider first reported. Pebble began searching for more outside investment or a possible buyer. One insider said they were asked to compile internal data about sales, which fueled speculation Pebble was trying to sell itself. By May of 2016, Migicosvky admitted to the staff that the company was trying to sell, but that a deal had recently fallen through. That deal turned out to be from chipmaker Intel, which wanted to buy Pebble for about $70 million. It's not clear why the deal fizzled, although it was Intel that ultimately walked away, not Pebble. (The Pebble side wanted the deal to happen.) One source close to Migicovsky said they were told that Intel's offer was initially higher than $70 million, but was lowered after due diligence. "Something rubbed him the wrong way and he was uncomfortable," the source close to Migicovsky said regarding the failed Intel deal. A high-profile collaboration with Japanese watchmaker Citizen also proved disappointing.  Pebble had hoped to learn from Citizen's expertise building and designing traditional watches. But throughout the development of the Time Round — a version of the Pebble watch with a circular screen that the two companies collaborated on — the Pebble team felt that Citizen lacked the technical chops in software and hardware development to be of much use, according to sources. Plus, Citizen typically took a lot longer to develop and launch products, often a year or more, which didn’t jibe with Pebble’s desire to push out new products faster. In the end, Pebble thought Citizen's designs were too thick and chunky and ultimately went with a design from internal Pebble employees. Pebble did pay Citizen about $50,000 for its work, according to one source with direct knowledge of the deal. Citizen did not respond to a request for comment. While TechCrunch reported that Citizen considered acquiring Pebble for roughly $740 million in 2015, no deal ever happened. One source directly familiar with Pebble's acquisition talks said Citizen never discussed buying Pebble, and accused someone of spreading a false rumor to TechCrunch. The Pebble Time Round, which was designed with help from Citizen. Antonio Villas-Boas/Tech Insider Facing the music Following the failed acquisition talks and the round of layoffs, Migicovsky leveled with his remaining employees late this spring. If they wanted to stay and see Pebble through to the end, their shares in the company would be doubled. If they wanted to cut their losses and leave, they would receive a severance package. While some took the buyout offer, most Pebble employees stuck with the company, hoping new products like the Pebble Time 2 watch and Pebble Core, a tiny device that lets you listen to Spotify music offline, would reinvigorate sales. In fact, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core were on track for their launch at the beginning of 2017. As recently as a week before discussions with Fitbit began, Pebble employees were visiting their manufacturing partners in Asia and finalizing production plans for the new devices, sources say. In a  recent  interview with  Steven Levy of Backchannel , Migicovsky said  he spent the summer months scrambling across the globe, trying unsuccessfully to raise money from private equity funds and other private investing groups.  Pebble was out of time and out of money. In October, at least one bank that gave  money to Pebble called in its loan, unconvinced Pebble would be able to raise more funding or sell enough product to solve its cash flow issues and debt to suppliers. Keep your resumes Once Migicovsky decided to sell the company, sources close to him say that his main goal was to find a buyer that would honor the consumers on Kickstarter who backed the Pebble Time 2 or Core — either by refunding their money or building the product.  The Pebble Core was canceled following Fitbit's acquisition. Pebble Fitbit turned out to be the only suitable buyer willing to do that. While the Time 2 and Core products have been canceled, Kickstarter backers will at least get their money back. Other aspects of the Fitbit deal have not unfolded as expected, however. The original deal discussions had Fitbit, which makes wearable products focused on health and fitness, acquiring all or most of Pebble, including the staff, several sources told Business Insider. But something changed as the deal was negotiated and Fitbit ended up buying only the software technology that runs Pebble's products and hiring certain employees.  One source speculated that Fitbit was worried about its stock price after delivering a disappointing sales forecast for the fourth quarter, which caused its stock to tank about 30%. Taking on all of Pebble could’ve looked extra risky to Fitbit investors. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to comment. On the day Fitbit’s team came to visit Pebble’s office about a month before the acquisition closed, many Pebble employees had concerns about what would happen to upcoming products. One source said Fitbit largely dodged those questions and that their true intentions didn’t come to light until they began interviewing Pebble employees. During the interviews, Fitbit quizzed Pebble employees on their roles at the company, but in the end Pebble employees learned there was no interest in the hardware team. Fitbit didn't even ask for resumes, according to one source, instead just pulling in their LinkedIn profiles. Once it became clear these interviews were going nowhere, Pebble hardware employees were encouraged to apply to open positions on Fitbit's website. By the time it was all over, most Pebble employees were sent home with severance packages. Many others took the Fitbit offer, and several former Pebble employees now list Fitbit as their employer on LinkedIn. As for Migicovsky, he'll be working at the startup incubator Y Combinator next year. Pebble's software may live on within Fitbit products, but it's now up to other companies to prove whether Pebble's pioneering product represents the future of computing or just an interesting footnote in history.

And we are all the time headed towards more multithreaded applications (slowly yes, but still heading). These gametests really show it very well. In games where single threaded performance is the limiting factor, this I5 is even fastest of tested processors. But when game actually has a lot of cpu load which gets spread on multiple threads, it simply chokes. I find it very risky invest to go for such "low" thread counts when investing into new cpu, that you expect to last next couple of years, when already we have games that don't work optimally with 4C/8T cpu. I really would have wished that Intel would have scrapped their current I3 lineup and made 4C/4T their new low tier. I very much think I'm not the only one hoping that.     Dygaza View Public Profile Find all posts by Dygaza   (#9) EdKiefer Maha Guru   Videocard: MSI 970 Gaming 4G Processor: 3570k Mainboard: Asus P8Z77V pro Memory: DDR3 1600 Soundcard: PSU: Corsair XT650 12-17-2016, 14:00 | posts: 1,149 Hi Hilbert I have to disagree with your comment that there has been no IPC changes since sandy bridge. Sure from haswell up there not much change and for sure from broadwell to skylake, it is the same, but from sandy to ivy bridge and from ivy to haswell there "about" 10% on each step. example the CPU-Z single core test ,I can run 4.4ghz and only get 1909 so I am not close to anything 6xxx+. At 4200 i only get 1823 so far from 2135. So while I agree last few not much in IPC, there has been in past after Sandy bridge, not huge but small increase. Anyway, good to see it OC a little better.

SMT should be available on ALL their CPU's no matter what. Their product distribution for consumers should look like: Core i3 - Low Power = 2C/4T perf/w optimized, locked multiplier Core i3 K - Performance = 2C/4T higher boost + unlocked Core i5 - Low Power - 4C/8T perf/w optimized, locked Core i5 K - Performance = 4C/8T higher boost + unlocked Core i7 - Low(er) Power - 6C/12T perf/w, locked Core i7 K - Performance = 6C/12T or 8C/16T unlocked Core i7 X - Performance = 10C/20T unlocked, fastest thing you can buy Current distribution doesn't make any sense anymore after all these years of "the same" BOOO Intel. Doesn't matter how good or bad Zen will be, I will buy one just to clear this stale air coming from Intel.     wavetrex View Public Profile Find all posts by wavetrex   (#11) Hilbert Hagedoorn Don Vito Corleone     Videocard: AMD | NVIDIA Processor: Core i7 5960K Mainboard: X99 Memory: 16GB Soundcard: X-Fi - GigaWorks 7.1 PSU: 1200 Watt 12-17-2016, 14:27 | posts: 27,196 | Location: Guru3D testlab Quote: Originally Posted by EdKiefer Hi Hilbert I have to disagree with your comment that there has been no IPC changes since sandy bridge.

I think in these days Hyper Threading or SMT should be a standard feature on all Core i5 quad core CPUs and the mainstream Core i7s should have minimum 6 cores with SMT enabled. Due to Intel's greed consumers are unable to satisfy their performance requirements. Due to lack of substantial performance upgrade for the same price people won't upgrade their PCs every few years which was the case till 5 years ago.

I mean who in the right mind would upgrade their Sandy i5/i7 to Kaby i5/i7? That's just a waste. Only upgrade path would something like X99 and 5820k or 6850k. Cannonlake will again change nothing in that regard, maybe Coffee Lake. Cant wait to see how Zen finaly changes the future.     Undying View Public Profile Find all posts by Undying   (#15) Amx85 Member Guru     Videocard: MSI R7-260X2GD5/OC Processor: AMD FX-8320 Mainboard: MSI 970A-SLI Krait Ed.

So if they did go i5= 4/8threads and moved i7 to 6/12, they still need clock speed per core or system doesn't feel responsive. For power users and workstation type work (photoshop, 3d rendering , vidio etc) then it shows and paysoff. Now if they can keep core freq up even on 6 or 8 core thats when it will be mainstream type cpu IMO. We are probably getting close to this, maybe 10nm will bring it closer.     EdKiefer View Public Profile Find all posts by EdKiefer   (#20) EdKiefer Maha Guru   Videocard: MSI 970 Gaming 4G Processor: 3570k Mainboard: Asus P8Z77V pro Memory: DDR3 1600 Soundcard: PSU: Corsair XT650 12-17-2016, 15:39 | posts: 1,149 Quote: Originally Posted by Amx85 Since "Bench" marketing optimizes lastest generations is better see real world comparisons were Intel does'nt get more than 5% uplit generation x generation If this continúes AMD will get Kabylake IPC in less than 2 year with Zen+ How's that, you really think AMD will have another new cpu architecture so fast ?

It may not last. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Dec 17, 2016 at 8:06AM Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have soared a staggering 280% year to date. The company is still unprofitable, but investors are betting that AMD is on the verge of a historic turnaround. Polaris, AMD's mainstream-oriented GPU, launched earlier this year, producing growth in the company's core business after a long streak of disappointing results. AMD is set to re-enter the high-end GPU market next year with Vega, and its Ryzen CPU, formerly known as Zen, will look to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) during the first quarter. AMD data by YCharts. AMD has also seen some momentum in an area that has been so far dominated by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alphabet's Google announced last month that it planned to install both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs into its data centers, offering them as part of its cloud platform. While NVIDIA's products are already available through most of the major cloud-computing vendors, AMD has been slower out of the gate, making the Google deal a significant win for the company. Radeon Instinct, a new line of graphics cards aimed at machine learning set to launch in 2017, will put AMD in the running to power artificial intelligence workloads. With such a large gain in such a short period of time, investors are right to ask: Can it last? If everything goes right for AMD next year, the stock could be in for further gains. But it won't take much going wrong for 2017 to be a bad year for the stock, even if it's a relatively good year for the company. Here are three reasons AMD stock could fall next year. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. An optimistic valuation Looking at AMD's stock chart tells a story of extreme optimism followed by disappointment. Shares of AMD have spiked before, in the early 2000s and again around 2006, only to collapse when the company failed to deliver. The company's current market capitalization isn't yet at an all-time high, but it's at the highest level in nearly a decade. AMD Operating Income (Annual) data by YCharts. In AMD's best year in the past 10, the company managed to earn a net income of about $500 million. The market is currently valuing AMD at around 20 times that number. In other words, investors are not only betting that AMD will make a comeback, but that its profits will soar to record levels. That's a bold bet for a company that has a long history of disappointing investors. This time could be different. AMD has a semi-custom business that's producing profits for the company, and it appears that Ryzen could give Intel a run for its money. But if the bull case doesn't unfold exactly as expected, a major correction could sting investors next year. Beating NVIDIA won't be easy Polaris produced some growth for AMD, with its computing and graphics segment revenue jumping 11% year over year during the third quarter. But NVIDIA stole the show, registering 63% growth in its gaming segment, driven by its new Pascal graphics cards. Both companies benefited from strong demand for graphics cards during the quarter, but NVIDIA claimed a bigger piece of the pie. Steam, the dominant PC gaming platform, collects hardware data from its users, and the most recent results suggest that NVIDIA's dominance isn't going away. The only Polaris graphics card to register on the survey is the RX 480, which claimed just 0.37% of Steam users in November. Meanwhile, NVIDIA's GTX 1080, 1070, and 1060, all higher-end cards launched around the same time, were being used by 0.86%, 1.59%, and 1.53% of users, respectively. AMD plans to launch more powerful graphics cards based on its upcoming Vega GPU next year, hoping to challenge NVIDIA in the high-margin high end of the market. AMD is certainly in a better competitive position today than it was in a year ago, but Polaris hasn't been the runaway success that the company needed it to be. Vega will need to be a home run. If it's not, AMD investors could be in for a rough ride next year. Ryzen could disappoint AMD recently provided details on Ryzen, its upcoming line of CPUs formerly known as Zen. Ryzen processors for desktops are expected to be available during the first quarter of 2017, with notebook variants coming during the second half. The company demonstrated that an eight-core version of Ryzen matched or beat Intel's i7 6900K in a few tasks, including image rendering and video transcoding. Ryzen comes with some new features, including improved prefetching driven by learning algorithms meant to minimize bottlenecks, and a refined boost system that allows clock speeds to be adjusted. It's built on a 14-nanometer FinFET process, meaning that the manufacturing gap between AMD and Intel is at its narrowest in years. If Ryzen is competitive on a performance-per-dollar basis with Intel's chips, AMD could gain a meaningful amount of market share. The only benchmarks we've seen so far have been from AMD, and at this point we know nothing about the more mainstream versions of Ryzen or the pricing. Ryzen needs to offer a compelling value proposition to compel Intel users to switch, and we won't know if that's the case until third-party benchmarks and pricing details surface. Even with Ryzen looking like it's going to be a competitive product, anything short of significant market share gains for AMD could send the stock tumbling.

While laptops of this size and weight inevitably end up sacrificing power for portability, the HP Spectre brings us the best of both worlds, packing an Intel-Core i7 (or i5) processor along with up to 8GB of RAM in its slender, solidly built body, making it one of the most balanced laptops in terms of power, portability and design. While the machine inevitably suffers from some of the same issues prevalent in many other ultra-thin laptops -- namely with heat management and battery life -- the experience I had with it was superb, and I'll gladly recommend this machine to anyone looking for a Windows laptop. Design Outwardly, the Spectre trades in HP's usual brand of bland, minimalist design for an elegant gold-and-black aesthetic that makes the device feel like something James Bond would use (that the Spectre shares the same name as 2015's feature film makes this analogy feel even more appropriate). Made mostly from what seems to be a mixture of aluminium and carbon fibre, the Spectre's body looks and feels appropriately solid, unlike many other plastic-made laptops of this size, which I'm fairly sure can be broken in half over my knee. This is further reinforced by the device's tight screen hinges, keeping the screen firmly in place even when moved around. In my experience, ultra-thin laptops of the Spectre's class tend to have looser, even wobbly screen hinges that feel like they could snap apart from the slightest pressure, which makes the Spectre's solid hinges even more significant. With a thickness of 1.4cm and a weight of roughly one kilogramme, the Spectre's portability is unparalleled, even though the difference in weight and thickness is practically unnoticeable next to similarly sized competitors at this stage. The Spectre's 13.3-inch screen is still only capable of displaying up to 1920x1080 full-HD resolutions, compared with the Apple MacBook's 2560x1600. That said, the Spectre's UWVA BrightView WLED-backlit screen is more than up to almost any task you want it to do, providing a crisp, vibrant image in any lighting. The speakers aren't exactly loud (and I've had them inexplicably cease to function completely on more than one occasion), but other than that, the device is great at media playback. Another pleasant feature of the device is its keyboard, which, while still quite shallow (an unavoidable concession), features decently sized and spaced keys that make typing much easier than one would expect on a device this small. Likewise, the trackpad of the device also works without a hitch, and it's made from a tactile plastic that gives a more precise feel when using it to control the cursor. The trackpad and keyboard are good enough to somewhat make up for the device's lack of traditional USB ports to support an external mouse and keyboard, traded in for two USB-C ports on the back (three, if you count the charging dock). HP was considerate enough to provide its users with multiple USB-C converters in the box (including one each of USB, HDMI, LAN and VGA), so it probably isn't as bad as many other USB-C exclusive machines (looking at you, new MacBooks). Function While most smaller laptops tend to come with the less powerful (while generating less heat) Intel-Core M processor, the HP Spectre pulls out all the stops, coming with an Intel-Core i7 processor, and the results are apparent. Booting up the machine and running various programs and games on it is as smooth as can be, with minimal stuttering or performance dips even after a relatively long period of use. That said, the Spectre isn't without its flaws. While the jump from the Core M to the Core i7 processors did wonders for the device's power, the Spectre's thin frame isn't exactly great at expelling the extra heat generated when engaging its more powerful specs. Much like many other laptops of its class, the Spectre can quickly heat up to levels that would make it uncomfortable to place on your lap, especially when running taxing apps or programs that require the device's full power. Letting the device rest for a while solves this problem rather quickly, though. Furthermore, the machine partially dispenses heat through its keyboard, so even users who place the machine on a solid surface will still feel the heat emanating from it. It's not going to burn your fingerprints off anytime soon, but it's a strange quirk that I found amusing at best and mildly annoying at worst. In the testing process, I was able to run smaller games like Minecraft at high-to-maximum settings, while more substantial games will generally get up to about mid-high settings and still run decently. That said, the heat generated while running many of these games will probably discourage many users from using the Spectre for gaming. This is especially true when you consider how taxing these programs can be on the battery, which seems to provide a mere two-and-a-half to three hours of heavy use, at best. Leaving the device on standby can prolong the battery life to a few days; but all in all, the battery is still one of the device's main weak points, though general users who don't regularly run especially taxing programs won't have to deal with this quite as much. Verdict With a price point just shy of 70,000 baht, the HP Spectre is definitely a tempting choice for anyone looking for a Windows alternative to the MacBook (which will most likely retail at similar prices). While the heat problems and poor battery life aren't exactly insignificant, the sheer portability, design and specifications of the device make it one of the most balanced machines in terms of portability and power, and an interesting buy all the same.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 16, 2016December 16, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Isn’t Done Running Yet Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The biggest profits in tech this year went to investors who owned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ). Yes, AMD. The little chip company that ended up under  Intel Corporation ‘s (NASDAQ: INTC ) heel just last year . Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr AMD was a $2 stock as recently as February. It opened for trade Dec. 15 at $10.65. That’s a gain of almost 450% in just 10 months. I wrote about AMD stock two months ago  and since then it is up 58%. You won’t see that kind of success on the company’s income statement, which has accumulated over $450 million in losses over the past three quarters. You may find it hard to justify on the balance sheet, too, which has only recently gotten back below a 50% debt-to-assets ratio. Heck, you won’t even see it in estimates on future earnings, where seven analysts still see losses through most of next year. Instead you will find it in earnings surprises and anticipation of the future. AMD suddenly looks competitive again. Zen Becomes Ryzen Lucy Su, who replaced Rory Read as CEO just over two years ago , has engineered the turnaround  with a processing technology called Zen , coming to market next year as a chip called “Ryzen.” The new chip has a faster clock speed that competes with the best Intel offers . Rather than challenge Intel in the mainstream of personal computing, Ryzen is focused on growing niches like gaming, e-sports and virtual reality, where high performance in the client is key. Tech analysts looking at the new chip’s specs are impressed, saying Ryzen will define the high-end of PC computing in 2017  by running 40% more instructions per clock, without the high temperatures that kept fast chips down in the past. Financial analysts looking at the new chip have been upgrading the stock to “buy”  and this, combined with top-line revenue that grew from $832 million in the first quarter of the year to over $1.3 billion in the third, have justified the upgrades. The result is that AMD is now worth almost $10 billion, not the $2 billion it started the year at, and it now has the financial firepower to at least start competing again. The fact that it no longer owns a foundry means it also has less need for capital and can play suppliers off one another. AMD’s new chips are being produced by GlobalFoundries  and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: TSM ). The company has reportedly been talking with Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) as well . Back in the Data Center AMD has always had a niche in graphics processing, but data centers have spent the past decade focusing on using massive numbers of cheap chips to get more processing power. That is starting to change. AMD got a big boost in October when Alibaba Group Holding Co. Ltd. (NASDAQ: BABA ) said it would use AMD Radeon graphics chips in its cloud offering. Potential in the cloud market is a second factor that is powering AMD stock forward. Bottom Line on AMD Stock There remain AMD bears like Stephen Chu of UBS, who say they’ve seen AMD make big claims against Intel before that turned to dust, and expect the same thing to happen again.  He says the new Ryzen chip is being compared against Intel hardware already on the market, and that the next generation of Intel chips will blow it out of the water.  He has a “sell” rating on the shares and a $5 price target. It’s important to have a bear case when considering a bull investment. Without bears, everyone is in a stock and it is fated to fall in price. Skepticism drives stock prices up a “wall of worry,” often to new highs. AMD remains a speculative buy, but considering how well it did for speculators in 2016, there should be plenty of buyers in 2017. Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

The new DIMMs will be compatible with some of the current as well as upcoming server platforms featuring Intel Xeon and other processors. Announced by Crucial this week are the new DDR4 LRDIMMs, RDIMMs, VLP RDIMMs, ECC SODIMMs and ECC UDIMMs rated to operate at 2666 MT/s interface speed with CL19 19-19-38 timings and at 1.2 V. The modules are available in 4 GB, 8 GB and 16 GB configurations and are aimed at less memory-dense server configurations. All the new DIMMs are powered by Micron’s 8 Gb DDR4 ICs made using 20 nm process technology, just like their DDR4-2133/2400 predecessors. Specifications of Crucial's Server DDR4-2666 Memory Modules   Module Capacity Latencies Voltage Height ECC SO-DIMM 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB CL19-19-19-38 1.2 V 30 mm ECC UDIMM 31.25 mm LRDIMM RDIMM VLP RDIMM 19 mm Increasing DDR4 interface speed from 2400 MT/s to 2666 MT/s amplifies theoretical peak bandwidth by 11% to 42.6 GB/s for a dual-channel memory sub-system, to 85.3 GB/s for of a quad-channel memory sub-system as well as to 127.9 GB/s for a six-channel memory sub-system. In any case, an 11% performance increase in bandwidth-hungry workloads without any rise of power consumption is a tangible benefit for many servers. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that to increase interface speeds to 2666 Mbps, the module maker also had to adhere to JEDEC specifications rise its CAS latency from CL15/CL16 and CL17 (DDR4-2133 and DDR4-2400) to CL19, which diminishes the latency performance benefits of higher clocks. Suppliers of server-class memory announce their products well ahead of their high-volume availability because CPU developers and makers of actual servers have to validate DIMMs before they use them in commercial machines. The situation is a bit different today. Officially, Intel’s current-generation Xeon E5 processors featuring the Broadwell-EP cores are compatible only with DDR4-2400 or slower DIMMs. However some OEMs offer Broadwell-EP machines that can officially support DDR4-2666 for lower memory density servers. Meanwhile, Intel and other manufacturers plan to introduce next-generation server platforms (such as Purley/Skylake-EP) that officially support new DDR4 configurations in 2017 and before those machines hit the market, new DIMMs need to pass a variety of validation process. The new server-grade DDR4-2666 memory modules from Crucial are available for purchase now. Their exact prices depend on volumes and negotiations between Crucial and its customers.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Intel’s 7th Generation Desktop CPU Line Leaked Before CES 2017 Posted: Dec 16 2016, 10:22am CST | by M. Affan, Updated: Dec 16 2016, 10:11pm CST, in News | CES   Credit: Getty Images   Here are all the details of new CPU line up that will be launched at CES 2017. It was assumed for the past many months that a new series of CPUs will be launched by Intel in year 2017. It was being said that the company will reveal the seventh generation Kaby Lake S Desktop processors before the CES 2017 convention. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries The CES 2017 will be held from 4th January 2017. It is said that Intel will announce its processors properly in an official announcement in a press conference which will take place at 4pm PST.  It will be a 45 minutes long conference so we are assuming that we will actually see a long array of products from company. The recent leaks have confirmed the date or launch of these new processors on their respective time and date too. These seventh generation desktop processors that will be announced on 5th January will be accompanied by 200 Series chip sets that will be used as the motherboards of these processors too. The list that was leaked earlier on listing all the models is rather long. There will be 16 CPUs that that will be launched in total. These include E3-1205 v6, three core i7 chips, seven Core i5 models of CPUs, two core i3 units and three Pentium processors. These upcoming CPUs will be the ones that will have the support of Optane storage technology that has the ability to rely on 3D XPoint memory, according to DigitalTrends. Intel claims that it will be 1000 times faster than the currently used NAND technology of processors. The processors will be able to provide enhanced graphics too. The CPUs might take a few weeks to go on sale but CES is a great platform to endorse them. Comments You May Like The Author M. Affan M.

Years in development and based on a grounds-up design, Ryzen, powered by the Zen architecture, is coming to market in the first quarter of next year. AMD will have you believe that a non-optimised Ryzen chip, operating at 3.4GHz, and bereft of any turbo technology, is a good match for an $1,100 Intel Core i7-6900K. It's been a long, long while since AMD has been able to claim performance and power equality with one of Intel's finest chips. A long time. Of course, AMD is showcasing Ryzen in the most positive light possible, but even so, it's not hard to be impressed with the performance potential, particularly for the legion of power users. What is just as interesting is how you view Ryzen. Is simply being as fast good enough, especially as Intel, the incumbent, has a proven platform on which most motherboard guys have multiple boards and to which they have devoted almost all of their resources? The AMD chip will compete at the high end first, then be distilled down to the mainstream four-core flavour later. Given that Intel is rock-solid in both segments and AMD is the relative performance newcomer, do you believe it necessary for the AMD Ryzen to be faster than the Intel Core for it to attract your hard-earned cash? Do let us know in the comments facility below.

At least from the viewpoint of a gamer,any savings on the CPU can be put into the graphics card for example and even from the viewpoint of a photographer the savings can be put into faster storage and more RAM. Posted by lumireleon - Fri 16 Dec 2016 16:56 being at the same speed as the 8 core but cheaper by $500 is worth killing intel for their high noncompetitive prices Posted by Biscuit - Fri 16 Dec 2016 16:57 It depends what you mean by faster; what are the metrics? Gaming? Productivity? Media work? Mathematics and Science? AI? I don't see AMD completely dethroning Intel and running away with the performance king of all possible metrics at all price points, but as long as they trade blows in enough of them, I think they should be back in the game. As long as the figures for gaming and media work are solid, I may well be tempted. Posted by flearider - Fri 16 Dec 2016 16:58 that's like asking is hexus better than the reg ? my 8350 does what it needs to @5ghz and in real terms plays anything out there like an intel chip would .. but i'll be getting a zen and a vega ..and have change left over to buy the wife something :P and if lasts as long and overclocks as my 8350 has money well spent .. Posted by kingpotnoodle - Fri 16 Dec 2016 17:03 To be credible Ryzen needs to be around the same performance in most benchmarks with Core chips at a similar price, without using much more power or having any strange quirks. Most benchmarks means not just heavily multithreaded benchmarks but day-to-day average user type stuff where single thread performance matters. If Ryzen can exceed performance in a few useful benchmarks, offer some sort of value add or just be straight up better value for money when the whole platform is taken into account then AMD might have some chance of selling them in good numbers.

Rhonda Schaffler Dec 16, 2016 11:25 AM EST Apple ( AAPL) , Cisco ( CSCO) , Microsoft ( MSFT)  and Intel ( INTC)  will be winners in the technology space in 2017, according to Scott Kessler, an equity analyst with CFRA.  Kessler believes a big theme next year will be the repatriation of foreign earnings, which may lead to additional domestic development, stock buybacks, and dividend increases. He adds one potential loser is Accenture ( ACN) , since it holds only a quarter of its revenue overseas. Kessler notes the ten largest technology sector companies in the S&P by market cap had $709 billion in cash and investments as of late November, and 74% of that was held overseas.

Float64 Support For Intel's Vulkan Driver Is Almost Here Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 16 December 2016 at 10:36 AM EST. 5 Comments While it took a long time for Intel's Mesa driver to begin supporting the ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 extension for double-precision floating-point data types in shaders, fortunately it looks like Intel should soon land the Float64 support in their Vulkan driver soon. The latest patches from Igalia this morning are their revised set of 25 patches for supporting the Float64 capability in the Intel Vulkan driver. The shaderFloat64 capability signifies 64-bit floats (doubles) support within the shader code. Adding Float64 support to the Intel Vulkan driver required changes to NIR as well as their SPIR-V code. The Float64 support for the Intel ANV Vulkan driver is being enabled currently for Intel's Broadwell "Gen8" hardware and newer, with Mesa Git not yet supporting ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 yet for Haswell. These new Float64 patches for the Intel Vulkan driver can be found via this patch series. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Dec 16, 2016 at 9:16AM Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump don't exactly see eye to eye. The two clash strongly in one particular area: global warming. Trump has openly disagreed with global warming and Musk has embarked on an ambitious vision to help put an end to it. The election of Trump to president, therefore, has prompted some uncertainty surrounding how the presidency will impact Tesla, which aims to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by building and selling electric cars, energy storage, and solar products. Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors. But Musk may have been encouraged recently when he was invited to President-elect Donald Trump's Tech Summit in New York City at Trump Tower. Musk goes to Trump Tower The invitations for Trump's Tech Summit went out earlier this month to executives of major tech companies. Beyond Musk, attendees of the event this week included prominent names like Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and Intel's Brian Krzanich. With less than a dozen tech leaders attending, invitations were scant, limited only to the tech elite. "I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting," said Trump in his opening remarks. Based on the sentiment expressed by Trump in the short portion of the meeting made public, the future President said he wanted to help things go smoothly for the companies represented. I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well. ... we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There's nobody like you in the world. ... And, anything we can do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you. You'll call my people. You'll call me, it doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here. We're going to do fair trade deals, we're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade. As Electrek pointed out, Musk's inclusion in the tech summit meeting is particularly notable considering the visionary entrepreneur is the only one leading a company with a market capitalization below $150 billion. Tesla is currently valued at about $32 billion, and Musk's privately held SpaceX's recent funding valued the company at about $15 billion. So Musk is arguably lucky to be able to represent his companies. And Musk apparently received some special attention. Notably, Trump's transition team's communication director Jason Miller said Apple's Cook and Musk were going to stick around after the tech summit event for a private meeting with Trump, according to AppleInsider.  Musk has also been honored with a spot on Trump's Strategic and Policy forum. A press release about the forum says it includes "some of America's most highly respected and successful business leaders" who "will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda." Musk, as well as Uber's Travis Kalanick and Pepsi's Indra Nooyi were added to the forum a few weeks after the Trump administration announced 16 other names, including influential business leaders like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Walt Disney's Bob Iger. What Musk and Trump have in common If the only remarks from Musk during the meeting at Trump Tower were any indication of the foot the CEO plans to put forward with the president, Musk seems like he wants to emphasize Tesla's vision for manufacturing job growth in the U.S. -- an area Trump has said he will focus on. Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley Fool. "Building rockets and cars and solar stuff in the U.S. -- actually really excited about expanding our manufacturing footprint in the U.S.," Musk said when he introduced himself at the meeting. Tesla alone has created about 30,000 jobs, most of which are in the U.S. and are manufacturing related. And Tesla also recently announced an expansion to its car factory in Fremont, California, and said it plans to add another 3,000 jobs there. Going further, the company plans to eventually employ about 9,000 people at its under-construction battery factory in Nevada and 1,000 people at its solar-panel factory in Buffalo, New York. Further, Tesla has inspired auto, defense, and solar companies all over the world to step up their games.  With Trump clearly willing to give Musk his ear, and considering Musk's important role in U.S. manufacturing job creation, Musk's companies are off to a good start with the president-elect.

Miller December 15, 2016 10 Comments Personal computers will probably never again be as hot a category as they were a decade or two ago, but that doesn't mean they have to be boring. In the course of this year, we've seen a number of very interesting new PC designs and in the past few weeks, Microsoft and its partners have made strides toward making Windows and the PCs that run it more exciting. On the hardware side, I've been impressed by many of the 2-in-1s, particularly those aimed at executives, as well as at how we've started to see relatively inexpensive 2-in-1s for the consumer market. Touch, in general, is a great feature: once you've used a touchscreen on a laptop, you may wonder how you ever did computing without it. That doesn't seem to be enough to make the PC market exciting. So Microsoft has created some new form factors, notably the Surface Studio, with its large display that can be laid flat, as well as receive input from a pen or the new Surface Dial. On the software front, next year's version of Windows will be called the Creators Edition. (In some respects, this reminds me of Lenovo's Horizon but with newer technology and with Windows 10 better tuned for this environment.) And Microsoft's Surface Hub seems to be getting some attention as a collaboration solution in a few big organizations. Earlier this month, Microsoft teamed up with long-time partner Intel to try to move PCs forward with what the pair call Project Evo, designed to add mixed reality, better voice activation, and better security to PCs. On mixed reality headsets, this includes not only Microsoft HoloLens but a variety of other headsets at lower price points. For voice, this means support for far-field communications (such as that popularized by the Amazon Echo) and having such communication integrated with Microsoft's Cortana assistant, so you'll be able to wake the computer by speaking alone. Other hardware features discussed include better support for 4K monitors with High Dynamic Range (HDR) and spatial audio, as well as improved security features. It's not just Intel, which for the past few years has had the processor market for high-end PCs pretty much to itself. AMD looks to be much more competitive in the year ahead, with the launch of its Ryzen desktop processors based on the new Zen architecture. Both AMD and Nvidia have some terrific new GPUs, able to power more immersive games and virtual reality experiences. Perhaps most interesting, Microsoft also announced a partnership with Qualcomm to bring Windows to Qualcomm's ARM-based processors. This has been tried before—Windows RT and Windows Phone are both cautionary tales—but this time, Microsoft is adding an emulator designed to let such machines run legacy Windows desktop apps in addition to new "modern" or "Windows store" applications. That's important, because most of the great Windows apps are still most powerful in their desktop versions, from Office to Photoshop. There are limitations here—it seems limited to 32-bit, and thus won't be available on the more powerful 64-bit versions—and it's hard to know how well such applications will perform. But the concept of emulation has worked in the past. Apple famously emulated the PowerPC environment to run old apps when it first moved to Intel a decade ago. It's an open question whether this will prove to be successful in the market. After all, if you want a really inexpensive Windows machine, you can already find Intel-based machines (usually running a Pentium or Celeron Atom variant) for under $200. Instead, the real excitement should be around better battery life and an integrated modem, two areas where Qualcomm's chips—originally aimed at the mobile phone market—have excelled. (I'm still surprised that Intel has yet to release a laptop chip with an x86 processor and an integrated modem almost six years after it acquired Infineon's wireless division. The company did create a few chips with Infineon modems and Atom cores for phones and tablets, but they weren't built in Intel fabs and aren't prevalent.) Meanwhile, Microsoft is promising a number of important security and other enhancements for enterprise users in the Windows Creators Edition, including a new security center and new and improved mobile device management. This adds to a number of new security enhancements, including Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) that the company discussed at its recent Ignite conference. All of this is crucial for getting enterprises to more quickly adopt Windows 10. Nearly every CIO I've talked to says they are planning to move to Windows 10, but the migration has been slower than Microsoft would like.

CINEBENCH utilizes all of your system's processing power during the GPU test and renders a photorealistic 3D scene ("No Keyframes" animation by AixSponza) making use of multiple algorithms that will thoroughly stress all available processor cores - it can accurately measure systems that have up to 256 processor threads. You can then jump over to the Graphics Card performance test which relies on a myriad of factors to produce results such as GPU processor and drivers. It will be tasked with displaying a 3D car chase (created by renderbaron) that includes a massive amount of geometry, textures, and complex effects to fully measure your graphics card performance in OpenGL mode. Once you have run the either of the two benchmark tests on your machine you will be able to see how yours stacks up against other systems and platforms. CINEBENCH supports the following processors: Intel Pentium 4 D, Intel Pentium 4, Intel XEON, Intel Core i7, Intel Core i5, Intel Core i3, Intel Core 2, Intel Celeron, Intel Celeron D, AMD Athlon 64, AMD Sempron, AMD Phenom, AMD FX, AMD Ontario, AMD Opteron, AMD Zacate, AMD Kabini, AMD Beema, AMD Mullins, AMD Temash, AMD Llano, AMD Richland, AMD Trinity, and AMD Kaveri.

Or is his bark worse than his bite? Saif Shahin Not Losing Sleep Indian techies at the Facebook head office in California Photograph by Getty Images Sujata Tibrewala, 41, is a networking evangelist for Intel Corp, one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip makers. Her job is just as funky as it sounds: “I manage the open-source community for Intel,” she says, referring to the global network of technology aficionados who help develop a company’s open-source software. A graduate of IIT Kharagpur and IISc, Bangalore, Tibrewala moved to the US six years ago with her family and worked as a consultant for several technology companies before joining Intel at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Her husband, too, works as a manager for a technology firm; their daughter is a senior at a local school and is applying for admission to college next year. They have recently bought a house in the Silicon Valley, investing $90,000 from their own pockets, besides taking a sizeable bank loan. Advertisement But if Donald Trump has his way, Tibrewala and her family may soon be without a job and on their way back to India. The president-elect announced earlier this month that he won’t allow US workers to be replaced by foreigners. During his jingoistic campaign, Trump adopted a vehemently anti-immigration stance and spoke often against the influx of Muslims and Mexicans. The rhetoric resonated well with the constituency of white, rural voters he courted and it propelled him to victory in the November 8 election. Since then, highly skilled foreign workers such as Tibrewala, who are here on H-1B visas, have also come in the businessman-turned-politician’s cross-hairs. Targeting such workers is as easy as it is senseless: they are very few in number and often do jobs for which enough US workers aren’t available. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services issues only 85,000 H-1B visas every year, meant for foreigners with specialised knowledge—such as scientists, engineers and computer programmers. Of these, 20,000 visas are reserved for workers with a Master’s degree from a US university. As the number of applicants is three to four times above the cap, awardees are chosen through computerised lottery. Advertisement Indian-born workers are highly favou­red by technology companies as they bring specialised skills, knowledge of English, and a willingness to work at lower salaries compared with American employees. They corner the lion’s share of H-1B visas awa­rded every year. So, if Trump does follow up on his promise and curtails the H-1B programme, they would be the worst affected. “Multi-nationals can move their workers to Europe or Canada; they won’t stop their work. They will relocate their workers,” says post-doc scholar Gurpreet Singh. “My sister warned me against buying the house because of her fear that Trump would win,” Tibrewala says. “But I never thought this could happen.” She still doesn’t think it would. “Trump is a businessman. He will not do this because this doesn’t make business sense. Ninety per cent of workers in the Bay Area are Indians or Asians. These companies will shut down. They won’t have people to work on anything,” Tibrewala says. Advertisement Vishal Sanghai, a Mumbai-born engineer now working for San Diego-based Peregrine Semiconductors, agrees with Tibrewala. “Trump says a lot of things and later backtracks,” he says. There are many reasons why US companies prefer Indian-born workers, he says. “Most Americans enter the job market after getting undergraduate (Bachelor’s) degrees. But Indians who are working here often have Master’s degrees, which make them more qualified.” Some 1,66,000 Indian students enrolled in US universities in 2015-16, of which more than 60,000 were graduate—mostly Master’s—students. Sanghai, 31, himself earned a Master’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2010. He worked for companies in Portland, Oregon and Austin, Texas before moving to California. He says even if Trump curtails the H-1B programme, foreign workers who are already here won’t be affected. “It may affect those who are studying right now or hope to come here in the next few years.” Advertisement Among them is Gurpreet Singh, 32, at the Institute for Computational Engi­neering and Sciences, University of Texas at Austin. Gurpreet expects to complete his post-doctoral research and start working for a technology company in the next six months. Like Sanghai and Tibrewala, he doubts if Trump would follow up on his threat and scrap the H-1B programme. Even if he does, businesses would find a way around it. “Companies that hire such workers are mostly multi-nationals,” Gurpreet says. “They can move their workers to Europe or Canada. The companies will not stop their work. They will simply relocate their workers.” Attempts to speak with technology company representatives went unanswered. For a long time, Silicon Valley technologists have demanded that their companies be allowed to hire more workers under the H-1B programme. Alan H. Fleischmann, the founder-president and CEO of business advisory firm Laurel Strategies, recently wrote in an op-ed for Fortune magazine that the H-1B cap “may have been sufficient 30 years ago, but it’s just a drop in the bucket compared with today’s demand for high-skilled workers”. He reminded Trump of a bipartisan bill to double the annual cap and urged him to push it forward. Advertisement A 2012 US Chamber of Commerce report said each H-1B employee creates 2.62 new jobs for American workers because of the boost she provides to the economy. While Trump may not listen to people like Fleischmann and raise the cap, few Indian workers believe the new president will do away with the H-1B programme. Gurpreet, who has been studying in the US since 2007, remembers outgoing president Barack Obama had issued similar threats against outsourcing of US jobs when he was taking office—but never followed up on them. But he fears statements such as Trump’s could themselves undermine foreign workers’ confidence in the stability of US jobs and act as a deterrent. “People coming here from India are looking at the US as a long-term option. They are thinking about settling down here. If you take that option away, they will no longer be as keen,” he says. Those with families, especially kids, will be particularly concerned. “They have to think not just about jobs but many other things as well,” Gurpreet says. “There will be distrust. In the long term, people might be unwilling.” By Saif Shahin in Ohio READ MORE IN: Saif Shahin USA Ohio Citizenship, Visa & Residency International Next Story : Misplaced Optimism?

Over the past number of months, 4th, 5th and 6th class students from across Ireland have been getting hands on with science and showcasing their big ideas as they took part in the annual Intel Mini Scientist competition. The two Kildare projects chosen were Good vision is good for sport from Scoil Phadraig, Clane, and Pollution Solution from St. Laurence’s NS, Sallins. The competition, which kicked off in September, gives young students the chance to explore science through project based learning and exhibitions. The first phase of the program involves students participating at exhibitions in their own schools which are visited by Intel employees who judge the first round of exhibitions and select from each school a winning project to go forward to a regional final. Regional finals were then held on Thursday December 8 and Friday December 9 at the Intel campus in Leixlip. The 2016 competition saw more than 4,000 students from 101 schools in 15 counties across Ireland taking part and the Regional Finals in Leixlip brought together almost 250 students from 80 different schools to take part and exhibit their work. At the Regional Final events the participants exhibited their projects for a panel of judges, which was made up from Intel employees, who had the difficult task of choosing the winning projects from the very creative variety. The winning projects will go forward to the Helix at Dublin City University on February 3 2017 at the Mini Scientist National final which will bring together 24 different projects from around the country, all of which are being selected at Regional Final events.   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition Deaths in Kildare - January 2, 2017 Kym Owens Maynooth student Kym Owens' injuries could have arisen from single blow Late burst takes Lilies over the line Revamp on the cards for Newbridge's Dunnes Stores Tony Egan, who is missing from Portarlington Appeal to find man (32) missing from Portarlington Leixlip residents angry at prospect of 2,000 new houses Kildare County Council resists call for caravan bye-law Monasterevin search called off, as body found Kildare man waiting 20 months for methadone treatment PHOTO GALLERY: The 'O Holy Night' Christmas Concert in Newbridge Newbridge Trolley dash win makes it a Happy Christmas for local woman Deaths in Kildare, December 30, 2016 Tweets by @leinsleadernews   Home News Sport Whats On Deaths About us Contact us Rss Privacy Policy Cookie policy This website and its associated newspaper are full participating members of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman.

Reuters/Stringer A Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 leak has created quite a furore on the Internet. Due to some newly uncovered promotional material, the handset has been leaked in China. The leak has revealed that the Mi Pad 3 will sport a 9.7-inch display with a screen resolution of 2,048 x 1,536 pixels. Thus, it will be bigger than both its predecessors and also match Apple’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro in both resolution and size. In terms of size, dimensions and weight too, the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 is a bit thinner, lighter and narrower than the Apple device. It is powered by Intel's 7th Gen Core m3-7Y30 processor, 8GB RAM and integrated Intel HD Graphics 615 GPU. Xiaomi fans will get a choice with respect to the storage variant. The Mi Pad 3 is available in 128GB and 256GB internal storage variants, reports GSMArena. Details about the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor are not yet known. Other top features include USB Type-C port for fast charging and data transfer, a mega 8,290 mAh battery and Windows 10 operating system. It has a 16MP rear camera with dual-tone LED flash and an 8MP front camera. The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 leak does not mention an Android version of the device. Hence, it is unclear whether there will be one anytime soon. Having said that, the Mi Pad 2 did have two OS versions and therefore, the same can be true for Xiaomi Mi Pad 3. The device comes in a full-metal build and the dual speaker grilles are at the bottom. As per the leak, the Mi Pad 3 will release on Dec. 30 costing ¥1,999 (AU$400) for the 128GB storage and ¥2,299 (AU$450) for the 256GB version. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more information on the Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 specs & features.

Disney’s “Rogue One” tells the story of just how those death star plans made their way from Imperial Intel to become a massive plot point in “A New Hope.” Despite the #dumpstarwars alt-right online movement, claiming the film is the first shot of a new culture war against President Elect Donald Trump, some estimates have the film earning over $300 million globally this weekend. Then talk about air mail. Amazon’s drone delivery service made it’s maiden voyage in merry ol’ England. The automated flying robot delivered an amazon fire streaming device and bag of popcorn to a customer in Cambridge 13 minutes after it was ordered. Service is limited to folks near their British base, but they plan to expand it in months, not years. Also, the internet is a-buzz over two leading ladies. First, Sonequa Martin-Green of "The Walking Dead" is announced as the lead in the new “Star Trek: Discovery” TV drama.   Don’t worry Sasha fans, she doesn’t plan to abandon Rick and the crew. Then there’s a rumor that Megan Fox is being sized up to play Poison Ivy in the suicide squad spinoff, “Gotham City Sirens.” Sure she’s hot, but DC fans have some pretty high standards when it comes to acting. And finally, Mario’s run begins today! Nintendo’s hopes lightning will strike twice after Pokémon Go’s summer success.   The new app Mario Run is partially free to play — but $9.99 for full access. On the upside: no in game purchases. So you won’t go broke feeding your phone game addiction. Bumming out half the mobile market though, for now - it’s only available on Apple devices.

A partnership with Qualcomm means that we’ll soon see a range of Snapdragon-powered Windows 10 PCs with integrated cellular connectivity that run x86 Win32 and universal Windows apps. SEE ALSO: Microsoft and Intel’s Project Evo will 'raise the bar for what’s possible with Windows PCs' Microsoft says, "For the first time ever, our customers will be able to experience the Windows they know with all the apps, peripherals, and enterprise capabilities they require, on a truly mobile, power efficient, always-connected cellular PC". The first of these always-connected PCs are expected to debut next year. You can see Windows 10 running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon Processor in the video below. What do you think about this news?

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Not this time. Hillary Clinton's victory in the popular — but not the electoral — vote and uncertainty about Donald Trump have generated unusual interest in an event that is usually a political footnote. Under the Constitution and federal law, the real presidential election takes place this year on Dec. 19, when presidential electors meet in the 50 state capitols and Washington, DC. As the electors vote, many say they have been besieged by phone calls and e-mails. One already elector resigned. Another said he won't vote as his state did. And electors in three states went to court seeking authority to vote as they please. Related: Drama-Filled Electoral College Vote a Fitting Ending to 2016 Election Meanwhile, a petition targeting "conscientious electors" has nearly 5 million signatures. Martin Sheen, who played a president on The West Wing, and a cadre of other actors have a YouTube appeal to electors asking them give them to Hillary Clinton or anyone else other than Donald Trump. Filmmaker Michael Moore published an impassioned plea to the Electoral College's GOP members "to vote your conscience" and has vowed to pay the fines of electors who are penalized by their states for not keeping the pledge to vote for Trump.

As Arizonans went to the polls Nov. 8, 49 percent of them may have thought they were voting for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, but they actually elected Bruce Ash, Walter Begay, and 10 other people.

It takes 270 votes to win because the 12th Amendment requires a candidate to get a majority. As the president of the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden will preside over the joint session and announce the results. It sometimes happens that a vice president ends up announcing his own defeat. It happened to Richard Nixon in 1960, reading the votes for John F. Kennedy, and most recently to Al Gore in 2000, declaring the votes for George W. Bush. This year, members of a group calling itself The Electors Trust, including Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, say they've been contacted by dozens of electors seeking legal advice. Many are asking, must they vote as their states did? Related: Why We Have the Electoral College A total of 29 states have laws that bind the electors, requiring them to cast their votes for whichever candidate won that state's popular vote. But the laws are weak, providing only nominal penalties. The Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote. But the justices have never said whether it is constitutional to enforce those pledges. Courts in Colorado and Washington state have rejected pleas from electors to be released from requirements to vote as their states did, although the electors in Colorado appealed the lower court ruling, according to The Associated Press. The state Supreme Court will have until Monday at noon, when electors cast their ballots, to decide. In California, a federal judge held a hearing on Friday morning on a similar request from an elector, Vinzenz Koller, who said he cannot vote for Hillary Clinton. Elsewhere, Christopher Suprun, a Texas paramedic, said he will not vote for the candidate who won his state's election. "Donald Trump lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief," he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Another Republican elector from Texas, Art Sisneros, resigned in late November. A vote for Trump "would bring dishonor to God," he said. Eighteen actors and other artists, including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing, urged Republican electors in a video that went viral to "go down in the books as an American hero" and vote for anyone other than Trump. In a letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, 68 presidential electors from 17 states asked for a briefing on why the U.S. believes Russia was behind cyberattacks intended to influence the election. However the intelligence community said it will not discuss the Russian hacks until a review ordered by President Obama is completed in January. On Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said they won't brief Electors or Congress until the review is done. Related: U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack While the electors are generating an usual amount of attention, it is unlikely to have much effect. Republican officials say party lawyers have been in contact with the 306 Republican electors and believe only a few may vote for someone other than Donald Trump. A survey by the AP reached a similar result. After interviewing 330 of the 538 electors, the AP found "widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the hustle of anti-Trump maneuvering can derail him." Asked during a Friday news conference about the fairness of the electoral college, President Obama stopped short of saying it should be phased out but called the system "a vestige, or a carryover, from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work." "There are some structures in our political system as envisioned by the Founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats," he said.

New Delhi: Venture capital firm Epsilon Venture Partners and an Australian private equity group have invested around Rs154 crore in Pi Datacenters Pvt. Ltd, a provider of cloud computing services. Pi Datacenters will use the funds to roll out its first few datacenters across the country, adding to the one it already has. The name of the Australian group was not disclosed. “As more users go digital in India, lower latency is paramount for better user experience, which is possible only if the digital infrastructure is located within the country,” said Kalyan Muppaneni, founder and chief executive of Pi Datacentres. The funding round was led by Epsilon’s India-based General Partner Mahesh Vaidya, who will join Pi as a director. Epsilon will be actively involved in building Amaravati-based Pi. “This sizeable deployment of capital in such a quality company and team helps further demonstrate our sourcing and execution capability, and our ability in making decisions based on potential financial returns, as an independent fund manager,” said Sudheer Kuppam, managing partner of Epsilon and former head of Intel Capital Asia. Kuppam left Intel in August last year to set up Epsilon Venture Partners. Singapore-based Epsilon Venture invests in companies that are doing product innovation in North Asia and service innovation in South Asia. “India is poised for an explosion in digital data with the numerous technology initiatives adopted by the government of India and the various state governments,” Muppaneni said. “Data is integral to a nation’s security and datacenters are the key building blocks for a nation’s infrastructure.” Intel Capital, along with International Finance Corp., the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, and Axon Partners, invested $13.5 million (Rs 86 crore) in IT infrastructure services provider NxtGen Datacenter and Cloud Technologies Pvt. Ltd in July 2015.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 16, 2016December 16, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Allot Communications Launches Allot Secure Service Gateway, Delivering Integrated Network Visibility, Security and Control to Enterprises Powerful and cost-effective appliance series blends the capabilities of Allot’s Service Gateway platform with advanced network and web security FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Powerful and cost-effective appliance series blends the capabilities of Allot’s Service Gateway platform with advanced network and web security Allot Communications Ltd, a leading provider of security and monetization solutions that enable service providers and enterprises to protect and personalize the digital experience, has unveiled the Allot Secure Service Gateway series, a first-of-its-kind product series that combines application-based visibility and control with web security and DDoS protection in a single, scalable appliance. With mobility and cloud migration, enterprises need to ensure that employees and customers connect securely and work productively with mission-critical applications at all times and from any location. The new solution goes further than traditional WAN Optimization Controllers (WOC) and Secure Web Gateway (SWG) solutions, enabling midsize to large enterprises to enhance productivity and protect their networks and users at scale with significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO). The Allot Secure Service Gateway platform provides: Complete visibility and control, utilizing real-time application-based traffic monitoring and analytics to deliver granular application level visibility and ensure higher user quality of experience (QoE). Flexible policy tools enable network managers to align IT resources with business priorities, reduce the enterprise cyber-attack surface and increase productivity. Powerful web security, maximizing the business value of cloud applications by detecting malware, phishing and other web threats, and blocking attacks before they harm application performance and user productivity. Scalability and lower Total Cost of Ownership, integrating multiple functions in an Intel-based platform with high port density that scales from 1,000 to 100,000 users in a single appliance. High performance and reliability, allowing the same carrier-class level performance that Allot brings to many of the world’s largest network operators. Allot SSG offers flexible redundancy configurations plus passive bypass with automatic port failover, maximizing uptime and availability. Robust DDoS Protection, combining application-based traffic management alongside behavioral based DDoS mitigation engine to provide rapid anomaly detection and swift attack mitigation before they are able to disrupt network services and availability. “The migration to mobility and cloud applications has introduced Quality of Experience, security, and shadow IT challenges for enterprise networks,” said Ronen Priel, Vice President Product Management & Marketing at Allot Communications. “Allot Secure Service Gateway helps businesses overcome these challenges in a more holistic way and at much lower TCO.

Voke, a virtual reality company recently acquired by Intel, installed equipment in Houston's NRG Stadium on Saturday ahead of the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It will offer in-game and postgame highlights through its Voke VR mobile app, compatible with a Samsung Gear VR headset and several Samsung phones. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., partnered with the National Football League earlier this month to capture virtual reality snapshots of four games during the final weeks of the season. It shot games in Jacksonville and Tampa Bay earlier this month and will finish in Seattle when the Seahawks face the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 1. To show game highlights, the company placed four cameras in the end zones and on the sidelines. The cameras hold 12 lenses each, positioned like six sets of eyes on the edge of a rounded platform, allowing viewers to switch between vantage points. "It gives them the choice of where they want to be on the field," said Voke CEO and co-founder Jay Jayaram. Texans season-ticket holder Jorge Esparza doesn't have much need for virtual highlights at this point - he hasn't missed a home game in four years, he said. But if he couldn't make one, he would consider using the technology to catch what he missed. "That would be cool," he said. Voke first tested its virtual reality technology in Houston during the NCAA Final Four championship game played at NRG Stadium in April. The company collaborated with Oculus, another virtual reality company, to create a 180-degree live stream. Eventually, the company hopes to cover more live events, Jayaram said. He added that he expects more venues to use the technology next year as sporting leagues become more confident in its appeal. "This is not just a flash in the pan," he said. Ken Hicks, a Houston barber and Texans season-ticket holder, has a virtual reality headset that he hasn't yet used. That would change if he had the chance to watch game highlights regularly, he said. "I'd do it in a minute," Hicks said. "It would feel like I was in the game." Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Ethan Baron. Updated December 17, 2016 7:42AM SHARE ALSO SEE Artificial Intelligence Innovation Silicon Valley Siri Digital Assistant Self-Driving Car Bots Alexa Virtually everywhere you look, Bay Area tech businesses are running into walls. Smartphones were revolutionary and lucrative, but the U.S. market is saturated, and Apple's iPhone sales have fallen for three quarters. The "app economy" has matured, with more people using existing apps than downloading new ones. And Facebook, which has filled users' news feeds with so many ads it can barely add more, is predicting its revenue growth will slump next year. Silicon Valley needs its next big thing, a focus for the concentrated brain power and innovation infrastructure that have made this region the world leader in transformative technology. Just as the valley's mobile era is peaking, the next frontier of growth and innovation has arrived: It's Siri in an Apple iPhone, Alexa in an Amazon Echo, the software brain in Google's self-driving cars, Amazon's product recommendations and, someday, maybe the robot surgeon that saves your life. It's artificial intelligence, software that can "learn" and "think," the latest revolution in tech. "It's going to be embedded in everything," said startup guru Steve Blank, an adjunct professor at Stanford. "We've been talking about artificial intelligence for 30 years, maybe longer, in Silicon Valley. It's only in the last five years, or maybe even the last two years, that this stuff has become useful." Achievements that were "unthinkable only a few years ago" are being made possible by artificial intelligence, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. "The last 10 years have been about building a world that is mobile-first, turning our phones into remote controls for our lives," Pichai said. "But in the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first." Experts say AI will play an increasingly large role in our lives, transforming how we work, how we live -- and even, perhaps, whether we work or whether we live. Inclusion of AI into virtually every area of computing -- and life -- will bring both progress and upheaval to the Bay Area tech industry, Blank said. "The valley has gone through waves of innovation," Blank said. "We were the semiconductor valley, then we were the PC valley, then we were the web 1.0 valley. Each of those waves was built on a new set of technology and created a whole new set of companies." Already, entire new industries are arising from AI technology, while robot-aided manufacturing surges, opening up opportunities in nearly every area of business, said Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. "It's going to be completely transformative, but at the same time it's going to take time," he said. Major industry players are betting big on "bots," interactive virtual assistants that learn from user inputs. Among the ever-expanding bot army we find Siri and Alexa, Google's Assistant and the many "chatbots" created by companies to facilitate customer transactions, such as Taco Bell's "TacoBot" which understands spoken language to take customer orders via smartphones. "People are suckers for a more efficient way to do things," Etzioni said. "We will see rapid advances in the usefulness of bots." As consumers see AI creep into their devices, the technology is also beginning to play an increasingly expansive role in business. Amazon and Google both offer AI-powered services that can be applied to the data that firms store on those companies' storage clouds. On Wednesday, the Washington Post announced it will use Amazon's AI-based "Polly" text-to-speech software -- which can produce 47 different voices and convert 24 languages -- to create audio versions of articles. And in September, San Francisco's Salesforce unveiled "Einstein," artificially intelligent software that can ingest all of a client company's data and offer solutions for a given problem, such as predicting which sales leads are likely to pan out. Pursuit of AI technology has fueled acquisitions, with established firms globally buying almost 140 AI-focused companies since 2011 -- with 40 deals last year alone -- according to market research firm CB Insights. Intel has rapidly built up its AI offerings through the purchase of Saffron, Movidius and Nervana, which Intel CEO Brian Krzanich referred to in a blog post as "leading-edge accelerants required for the growth and widespread adoption of AI." Although AI has been around since the 1950s, its trajectory started angling upward with the advent of "big data," the enormous information sets made possible by storage technology, large-scale data collection and advances in computing power. This year AI got a poster boy, of sorts. Google's AlphaGo AI software ingested 30 million moves from world-class games of Go, the ancient Chinese strategy board game, and laid waste to 18-time world champion Lee Sedol in three straight games. Teaching software to play games advances technology that can be applied to more serious endeavors. On Tuesday, another Google division, Verily, published results of its successful use of an AI image-analysis algorithm to identify a diabetes-related eye disorder. Verily in 2015 announced a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to develop AI-guided surgical robots, an enterprise spun off into Mountain View-based Verb Surgical. The startup has 200 engineers, some from Verily, working on the software and devices, training the AI by having it "watch" videos from hundreds of surgeries. AI's burgeoning ability to make and learn from decisions is accelerating its impact, said UC Berkeley computer sciences professor Sergey Levine. It is decision-making that sets sophisticated AI programs apart from pattern-recognition AI software, which gets trained to perform tasks on a specific data set, as with photo-identification processes, but then remains "static" without learning on its own, he said. "That's the part that's going to change," Levine said. "It's going to be something that continuously interacts with the environment it's deployed in, and continuously improves itself through its own experience." AI-based products such as household-chores robots or self-driving cars can be networked together, so that what each device learns can be applied across all the devices through "collective learning," Levine said. He foresees "systems that interact with humans using natural language." As AI improves and spreads, it will increasingly replace human labor, taking on tasks and jobs previously done by people, experts say. "I'm very worried about jobs," Etzioni said. "Of all the concerns that float around about AI, AI and jobs is the one to focus on." Lisa Spelman, vice president of Intel's data center group, takes a more optimistic view, noting that AI-powered image recognition, for example, has created many jobs for software engineers. "I see this as similar to many other innovation cycles and technological transformations where there has been that concern," she said. "In the end, it has turned into more opportunities, just different ones." © 2017 San Jose Mercury News syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

She first glimpsed the power of open source while at SGI in the '90s and has been building bridges between hardware developers and the open source community ever since. » More about me Learn how you can contribute Open source diversity efforts gain momentum in 2016 Efforts to increase diversity in open source aren't new, but they are starting to show positive results. We look at the 2016 landscape. Posted 16 Dec 2016 Nithya RuffFeed 19up Image by :  Internet Archive Book Images. Modified by Opensource.com. CC BY-SA 4.0 If software is pervasive, shouldn't the people building it be from everywhere and represent different voices? The broadly accepted answer is yes, that we need a diverse set of developers and technologists to build the new digital world. Further, when you look at communities that thrive, they are those that evolve and grow and bring in new voices and perspectives. Because much of the software innovation happening today involves open source software, the open source community can be an entry point for new people in technology roles. This means that the open source community must evolve to stay relevant. There has never been a better time for the open source community to welcome new community members from under-represented groups than now, and the community is rising to the challenge. Efforts to increase diversity in open source are showing results, so let's look at a few examples: 1. Foundations and organizations are increasing outreach efforts. Over the past few years, new foundations have been created to support open source projects. For example, multiple projects fall under the umbrellas of big foundations, such as the Linux Foundation and OpenStack Foundation. Besides being a home for projects, foundations are embracing their roles in curating and sharing best practices, creating on-ramps, and supporting new people in project communities. The Linux Foundation and OpenStack Foundation provide scholarships, travel assistance, training, mentorships, childcare, affinity groups, and more as part of their events and services. (I'm involved in the Linux Foundation-sponsored Women in Open Source events and the Women of OpenStack [WOO] group.) Since the WOO group started in 2014, more women have been attending and speaking at OpenStack-related events and contributing to OpenStack projects. More than 11% of attendees at both LinuxCon North America and OpenStack Summit in Austin in 2016 were women. The Linux Foundation, in partnership with the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), is developing inclusive speaker orientation course for events to ensure that all speakers go through training in what it means to be inclusive. Many tech organizations are addressing the role their company cultures and policies play in increasing diversity. For example, Google launched its Summer of Code program in 2005, and Red Hat launched its Women in Open Source award in 2015. By 2016, many organizations and events were regularly sponsoring networking opportunities for women, such as the LinuxCon North America Women in Open Source Lunch, sponsored by Intel; and the Women's Leadership Community Luncheon at Red Hat's annual summit. 2. Mentorships, scholarship programs, and training are scaling. Software Freedom Conservancy's Outreachy, which was founded in 2010, provides internships to women and members of under-represented groups through mentors and work experience on a specific project. Contributions from Outreachy interns is impressive: The Outreachy organization ranked #9 for kernel contributions in Linux 4.4 and #6 for Linux 4.6 releases. Read the 2016 Kernel Internship Report (PDF) for more detail. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is another successful initiative that has been matching students to open source projects and volunteer mentors for more than a decade. More than 1,200 students and 178 organizations participated in GSoC 2016. Hopefully the success of these programs will help inspire more mentorship programs in 2017. In 2016, annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) attracted around 15,000 from more than 80 countries. The GHC annual Open Source Day is an all-day hackathon that brings attendees together to network, contribute to good causes, and build their GitHub profiles in a safe environment. 3. Conferences are improving diversity among speakers and attendees. Conferences such as OSCON, LinuxCon, PyCon, SCaLE, and OpenStack Summit play a big role in showcasing and supporting diversity. The impact of seeing women and under-represented minorities on stage and hearing new perspectives is powerful in changing our perception of who is part of the open source community. O'Reilly's OSCON is showing noticeable improvement in the diversity of its speakers and talks. I spoke with Rachel Roumeliotis, Strategic Content Director and OSCON Chair for O'Reilly about how OSCON raises the bar every year to showcase amazing new voices. She says organizers actively seek out new voices and perspectives, and they want to reflect the changing community and perhaps project what it could look like. (Read Opensource.com's OSCON article collection for examples.) Conferences are also investing in the next generation of programmers and contributors through dedicated co-located events. One great example of this is SCALE: The Next Generation, a track hosted at the Southern California Linux Expo, an annual community event. I love how SCaLE helps teach kids about programming and technology. Young community members, such as Keila Banks, Justin King, and Schuyler St. Leger, have spoken at this event. Often the kids at conferences have relatives working in technology who are highly involved in encouraging and championing young people. Keila, for example, is the daughter of Phillip Banks, one of the SCaLE event organizers. She got her start speaking at SCALE when she was 11, and she gave a keynote at OSCON in 2014, at the ripe old age of 13. When I talked to Keila, she found programming to be as natural as other subjects at school, and she loves the Python language, including its community. Young people are learning open source technical skills from programming, animation, video editing, digital drawing, and picture editing, and conferences are rapidly embracing and catering to this new generation of community members. 4. The data confirms progress. Without data, determining whether we are making progress is difficult. We need to measure the percent of contributions from women and members of under-represented groups, learn about projects successfully attracting and retaining a diverse group of contributors, and then share what we learn across projects. Spain-based Bitergia's Chief Data Officer Daniel Izquierdo took the initiative to do this for OpenStack and for the Linux kernel and shared the results in 2016. (Read Rikki Endsley's recent interview with Daniel, Analyzing gender diversity in the OpenStack community.) Bitergia plans to do gather diversity metrics for Apache Software Foundation projects in the near future. The data Bitergia has been collecting on the diversity of contributions and community growth over time shows trending in the right direction. We still need a new way to measure the overall health of an open source project, which means that, in addition to measuring the number of contributors, downloads, and issues resolved, we should track how diverse communities are and how welcoming they are to new contributors. These measurements could help us recognize projects that have great on-boarding and retention practices and that have built diverse and vibrant communities. Learn more about Bitergia's work in gender diversity metrics on their blog. 5. The definition of 'contributions' is expanding, and on-boarding is improving. Historically non-code-related open source contributions haven't been recognized as contributions. Measuring code contributions and code reviews has been easier than measuring other types of contributions, such as documentation, marketing, legal representation, and graphic design. Increasingly open source projects and organizations are recognizing, encouraging, valuing, and supporting contributions in all areas of the open source ecosystem, and they are making it easier for new contributors to join communities. GitHub has become the tool of choice for internal development in companies changing their culture to be collaborative and agile. I asked Brandon Keepers, head of open source at GitHub, about their initiatives. He explained that GitHub launched a survey to help them understand their changing community and its needs. His team is also working to provide best practice frameworks for project leaders to help them run better projects, which includes sample codes of conduct and README templates. 6. Allies are taking more active roles in improving diversity. From its beginning, the Ada Initiative founders recognized the roles male allies play in increasing diversity in technology. The organization was formed in 2011 by Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner and worked on making technical conferences harassment-free, providing training on how to overcome impostor syndrome, and provided practical skills training for male allies. Many men want to support diversity efforts and create a more inclusive culture, but may not know how to help. The Ada Initiative and NCWIT skills training are examples of practical approaches to showing male allies how they can support gender equality and build inclusive cultures. What will 2017 bring? As 2016 comes to a close, we're seeing real progress in how we welcome new people and encourage them to stay in the open source community, but there is still much to be done.

 Tech titans are meeting with Trump today Rob Price Dec. 14, 2016, 4:29 AM 10,786 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook is one of the expected attendees. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Some of the most powerful and high-profile leaders from the technology industry are scheduled to meet with US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday. The meeting has the potential to be a tense affair: Silicon Valley was overwhelmingly opposed to the Republican president-elect before the election, and during the campaign he repeatedly railed against the business practices of the industry. The discussion is likely to centre on jobs and immigration — issues on which the tech community and Trump seem likely to clash. The meeting, due to be held at Trump Tower in New York, has a star-studded guest list: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt from Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla's Elon Musk, IBM's Ginni Rometty, and Brian Krzanich from Intel are among the attendees, according to a roundup from The New York Times. (Sidenote: Jack Dorsey, the cofounder and CEO of Twitter — a social network beloved by Trump — was not invited.) It's all about jobs A key issue on the table will be jobs and immigration. Silicon Valley is heavily reliant on immigrant workers, hiring engineers and other employees from all over the world — but Trump ran his campaign in opposition to immigration, promising to build a wall along America's southern border and to halt Muslim immigration altogether. Trump has been critical of the H-1B skilled-worker visa program, which the tech industry uses heavily, saying in a statement in March: "I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions." Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has expressed concern that there are too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley. The attendees will be hoping that Trump is prepared to be more pragmatic about the issue than his rhetoric on the campaign trail might have suggested. The tech industry and Trump do not get along Several of the attendees at the meeting have previously been the subject of Trump's ire. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly went after Bezos, the Amazon CEO who also owns The Washington Post, which aggressively reported on Trump during the campaign. President-elect Donald Trump. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trump said Bezos had "a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much," while Bezos countered that Trump's strategy of targeting the news media "erodes democracy." (Bezos later promised to keep an "open mind" after Trump's election.) Trump attacked Apple over its refusal to help unlock an iPhone for the FBI in February, asking, "Who do they think they are?" and calling for a boycott. He has also targeted the company for building its iPhones in China. One of Trump's few backers in Silicon Valley is Peter Thiel, the Paypal cofounder turned billionaire investor and Facebook board member. Thiel supported Trump's candidacy, speaking at the Republican National Convention in the summer. He now sits on the president-elect's transition team, and he helped organise Wednesday's meeting. In November, Trump sat down for a similar off-the-record meeting with media executives. It was reportedly an awkward affair, with Trump attacking the assembled execs over their coverage of his campaign and their failure to anticipate his victory.

The data, sourced from the Firefox Telemetry system, is aggregated and anonymized then published on the report website. While I’m sure that data is helpful to developers, it also provides a detailed look at the current state of the dwindling PC market (among those that use Firefox, anyway). To say that it’s sad would be an understatement. According to the latest data, Intel processors are found in 86 percent of machines although nearly 70 percent of processors only have two physical cores and clock speeds are most commonly in the 2.3GHz to 2.69GHz range. As for memory, a third of all users only have 4GB of RAM with 2GB being the next most common amount (in 18.74 percent of systems). At this point, it should come as little surprise that the majority of PCs – 44.86 percent – are running Windows 7. Microsoft’s latest OS is only found on 25.67 percent of machines while Windows XP, an operating system released more than 15 years ago, accounts for 10.36 percent of the share. The predominant display resolution, meanwhile, is 1,366 x 768 with Intel-branded (integrated) GPUs being the most popular. The data may be difficult for hardware enthusiasts to process but it’s very much a reality. With consumers now utilizing smartphones and tablets as their primary devices, there is little reason for them to spend money on a new PC.

Marsha Blackburn said. "We're not talking about the outcome of the election," the Tennessee Republican, an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, told Wolf Blitzer on CNN. "We're talking about the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's G-mail account. "What we do know is that there was a hack — and let's leave it to the House and Senate Intel committees to decide exactly who was behind what. "We know Russia is a bad actor," Blackburn added. "We know they're not an honest actor many times. "My hope is now that we're going to see some legislation passed through Congress that will put some more tools in place that both the public sector and the private sector need in dealing with these hits." Blackburn denied that the Republican Party was being "dismissive" in denying Russia's role in the hackings. "I don't think anyone is being dismissive," she told Blitzer. "No one that I have visited with, talked with or spoken with regarding this issue has been dismissive of the Russians and their intentions. "They are quite concerned about the increase in propaganda that they have out there, not only in the U.S., but also the global marketplace. "You have to get in behind this situation and address it."

Not this time. Hillary Clinton's victory in the popular — but not the electoral — vote and uncertainty about Donald Trump have generated unusual interest in an event that is usually a political footnote. Under the Constitution and federal law, the real presidential election takes place this year on Dec. 19, when presidential electors meet in the 50 state capitols and Washington, DC. As the electors vote, many say they have been besieged by phone calls and e-mails. One already elector resigned. Another said he won't vote as his state did. And electors in three states went to court seeking authority to vote as they please. Related: Drama-Filled Electoral College Vote a Fitting Ending to 2016 Election Meanwhile, a petition targeting "conscientious electors" has nearly 5 million signatures. Martin Sheen, who played a president on The West Wing, and a cadre of other actors have a YouTube appeal to electors asking them give them to Hillary Clinton or anyone else other than Donald Trump. Filmmaker Michael Moore published an impassioned plea to the Electoral College's GOP members "to vote your conscience" and has vowed to pay the fines of electors who are penalized by their states for not keeping the pledge to vote for Trump.

As Arizonans went to the polls Nov. 8, 49 percent of them may have thought they were voting for Donald Trump and Mike Pence, but they actually elected Bruce Ash, Walter Begay, and 10 other people.

It takes 270 votes to win because the 12th Amendment requires a candidate to get a majority. As the president of the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden will preside over the joint session and announce the results. It sometimes happens that a vice president ends up announcing his own defeat. It happened to Richard Nixon in 1960, reading the votes for John F. Kennedy, and most recently to Al Gore in 2000, declaring the votes for George W. Bush. This year, members of a group calling itself The Electors Trust, including Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, say they've been contacted by dozens of electors seeking legal advice. Many are asking, must they vote as their states did? Related: Why We Have the Electoral College A total of 29 states have laws that bind the electors, requiring them to cast their votes for whichever candidate won that state's popular vote. But the laws are weak, providing only nominal penalties. The Supreme Court ruled in 1952 that states do not violate the Constitution when they require electors to pledge that they will abide by the popular vote. But the justices have never said whether it is constitutional to enforce those pledges. Courts in Colorado and Washington state have rejected pleas from electors to be released from requirements to vote as their states did, although the electors in Colorado appealed the lower court ruling, according to The Associated Press. The state Supreme Court will have until Monday at noon, when electors cast their ballots, to decide. In California, a federal judge held a hearing on Friday morning on a similar request from an elector, Vinzenz Koller, who said he cannot vote for Hillary Clinton. Elsewhere, Christopher Suprun, a Texas paramedic, said he will not vote for the candidate who won his state's election. "Donald Trump lacks the foreign policy experience and demeanor needed to be commander in chief," he wrote in a New York Times op-ed. Another Republican elector from Texas, Art Sisneros, resigned in late November. A vote for Trump "would bring dishonor to God," he said. Eighteen actors and other artists, including Martin Sheen and Debra Messing, urged Republican electors in a video that went viral to "go down in the books as an American hero" and vote for anyone other than Trump. In a letter to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, 68 presidential electors from 17 states asked for a briefing on why the U.S. believes Russia was behind cyberattacks intended to influence the election. However the intelligence community said it will not discuss the Russian hacks until a review ordered by President Obama is completed in January. On Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said they won't brief Electors or Congress until the review is done. Related: U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack While the electors are generating an usual amount of attention, it is unlikely to have much effect. Republican officials say party lawyers have been in contact with the 306 Republican electors and believe only a few may vote for someone other than Donald Trump. A survey by the AP reached a similar result. After interviewing 330 of the 538 electors, the AP found "widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the hustle of anti-Trump maneuvering can derail him." Asked during a Friday news conference about the fairness of the electoral college, President Obama stopped short of saying it should be phased out but called the system "a vestige, or a carryover, from an earlier vision of how our federal government was going to work." "There are some structures in our political system as envisioned by the Founders that sometimes are going to disadvantage Democrats," he said.

Tech Industry by Stephen Shankland December 16, 2016 1:28 PM PST @stshank Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Enlarge Image Tech execs including (left to right) Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg met with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, President-elect Donald Trump and investor Peter Thiel on Wednesday. Photo by Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Most of this week's meeting between President-elect Donald Trump and top technology industry executives was behind closed doors, but issues discussed included parental leave and business issues like hiring skilled immigrants, according to one report. The meeting was a high-visibility gathering including Trump, his family members and advisers, and top executives from Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and Intel. The tech execs and Trump often had been sharply critical of each other during the campaign, but the meeting offered an opportunity to mend fences. A short public portion of the meeting didn't tackle any meaty issues, but several arose after the press was shooed away, said a Thursday report from tech insider site Recode. Among the views from tech execs, according to the report: Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella discussed immigration and specifically H-1B visas to hire outsiders for skilled jobs in the US. Apple CEO Tim Cook pushed for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education efforts. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also pushed for STEM efforts for women and minorities and brought up the issue of parental leave, one aspect of a general Silicon Valley push to attract and retain more women. Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt called US government computing technology old and unsafe. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said it was hard for US businesses to operate in China. And Elon Musk, CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla Motors, brought up the issue of global climate change. SpaceX and Oracle declined to comment. IBM, Intel, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Ahead of the meeting the RIAA and an A to Z of music groups have written an open letter to the president-elect, pressing him over piracy and the protection of intellectual property rights. In a matter of weeks the United States will have a brand new president, so it’s now time to resign a bitter election battle to history and make plans for the future. This afternoon, representatives of some of the most significant technology companies on the planet will meet with President-elect Donald Trump for a round-table discussion in New York. Heading to Trump Tower will be Larry Page and Eric Schmidt of Google parent Alphabet, Tim Cook of Apple, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Satya Nadella of Microsoft. According to the New York Times, the companies are keeping a low profile about the event, but with giants like IBM, Intel and Cisco also in attendance, flying under the radar just isn’t possible. The meeting today clearly hasn’t gone unnoticed by America’s music industry either. Despite some attempts at building bridges with companies such as Google, there is a gaping chasm of understanding due to the manner in which platforms like YouTube are said to utilize music without properly compensating artists. The industry feels that Trump has a role to play in solving this problem. In an open letter to president-elect Trump congratulating him on his election, the RIAA and an A to Z of music groups make it clear that he should keep them in mind when he meets with the technology giants this afternoon. Protection of their intellectual property is paramount, they argue. “Congratulations on your election to serve as the 45th President of the United States. We look forward to working with you and your Administration on behalf of American music – one of our nation’s most valuable forms of art and intellectual property, and a powerful driver of high – quality U.S. jobs and exports,” they begin. Pointing to a statement Trump issued earlier this year when he described intellectual property as “a driving force in today’s global economy of constant innovation” while calling for its protection, the groups paint themselves as sharing the president-elect’s goals. “So much of what you wrote in your platform this summer about intellectual property and private property rights resonated with many of us,” they write, adding that they share the desire to take strong action to enforce intellectual property laws against infringers. Noting that they’re aware of the meeting today, the music groups lay out the significance of their industry, claiming a $1.2m trillion contribution to the economy while supporting the jobs of 5.5 million Americans. However, they also remind America’s forthcoming new leader that some of the companies he will meet with today owe a great debt to the music industry. “Indeed, many of today’s popular technology platforms owe much of their growth and success to music. Music is responsible for the most-followed accounts on Facebook and Twitter, the most-watched videos on YouTube, and is one of the most popular draws for phones and other personal devices,” they note. The music groups say that such platforms thrive by delivering the work created by artists and many deserve to be commended for valuing and protecting the music industry. But while some have developed systems to “deter theft”, much more needs to be done. “Search engines, user upload content platforms, hosting companies, and domain name registrars and registries should follow others’ example to effectively stop theft and assure fair payment,” they say. “Further, there is a massive ‘value grab’ as some of these corporations weaken intellectual property rights for America’s creators by exploiting legal loopholes never intended for them – perversely abusing U.S. law to underpay music creators, thus harming one of America’s economic and job engines. “Surely the world’s most sophisticated technology corporations can do better – by helping to prevent illegal access and paying fair market value for music with prices set by or based on the free market.” All of these issues were covered by the Joint Strategic Plan for Intellectual Property Enforcement released by the Obama administration this week. At this point (and despite political differences) it seems unlikely that Trump will deviate far from its key goal of protecting American interests both domestically and overseas. However, as the SOPA debate of almost five years ago brought sharply into focus, technology companies and the content industries might need each other to progress, but agreement on IP issues are usually tough to come by, especially when that involves holding tech companies responsible for the infringements of others. Trump certainly has a balancing act up ahead, but the music groups know which way they want him to go. “Strong protection for intellectual property rights will assure growth in both creativity and technology, benefiting the American economy as a whole. We hope you will lead the effort to assure American creativity is encouraged, invested in, protected and fairly compensated in a manner that carries out the exclusive rights guaranteed in the Constitution to those who, with the genius of their mind, form the cultural identity of our great nation,” they conclude.

ARM servers are devalued partly because many applications don't work with the chips. But ARM has acquired Allinea Software with the hope of partially resolving the compatibility issue. Allinea provides software development, debugging, and porting tools, which should make it easier for people to write applications for ARM-based servers and supercomputers. The acquisition will "provide a channel to thousands of developers using supercomputers and give us better first-hand knowledge of the issues being addressed as software is ported to new ARM-based systems," Javier Orensanz, general manager of the development solutions group at ARM, said in a blog entry. The development tools will also be used for ARM chips in deep-learning systems, which require large-scale server deployments for analytics. ARM's competition will come from deep-learning and HPC software tools offered by Intel, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and more recently, AMD. ARM designs chips and licenses them to third-party chipmakers like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel. The company is aggressively chasing markets like supercomputing and IoT and is in the process of being acquired by Softbank for US$32.4 billion. Fujitsu is making the first ARM-based supercomputer called Post-K, scheduled to be deployed in Japan by 2020. The supercomputer will have 64-bit chips based on a new microarchitecture called ARMv8-A Scalable Vector Extension, which has vector processing abilities for complex calculations. With the Allinea deal, ARM realized its software weakness and is acting on it. It is acquiring customers and a shortcut to get more developers to write applications for ARM processors. Allinea tools are used by many organizations with some of the fastest computers in the world using other chip architectures. Allinea's team will become a part of the ARM's HPC development solutions team. ARM's acquisition won't affect Allinea's product roadmap. ARM did not reveal how much it paid for Allinea Software.

Which RMM Software is Best in Industry? December 16, 2016 Red Hat Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the availability of Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10, the company’s massively-scalable and agile cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution. Based on the upstream OpenStack ‘Newton’ release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 drives new features that increase system-wide scalability, ease infrastructure management, and improve orchestration, while also enhancing network performance and platform security. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduces a new software life cycle, with optional support up to 5 years. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 drives the enterprise-readiness of OpenStack by delivering a stable, reliable and open foundation for cloud deployments, delivering new innovations like composable services and roles while retaining our commitment to enterprise stability, highlighted by our new Long Life support model. RADHESH BALAKRISHNANGENERAL MANAGER, OPENSTACK, RED HAT Hundreds of customers rely on Red Hat OpenStack Platform to power their hybrid and private clouds for a variety of mission-critical deployments, including BBVA; Cambridge University; FICO; NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Paddy Power Betfair; Produban; Swisscom; UKCloud; and Verizon. Additionally, Red Hat OpenStack Platform is backed by a robust ecosystem of certified partners, including Cisco, Dell EMC, Fujitsu, Intel, Lenovo, Rackspace, and NetApp for enterprise businesses, as well as Ericsson, Nokia, NEC, Huawei, Cisco and others from the telecommunications industry. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 delivers a reliable cloud platform built on the proven, enterprise-grade backbone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Integrated with Red Hat’s hardened OpenStack community code, Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides the agility to scale and more quickly meet customer demand without compromising availability, performance, or IT security requirements. Also included in Red Hat OpenStack Platform is Red Hat CloudForms, a hybrid cloud management and monitoring platform to oversee not only OpenStack infrastructure components but also the workloads running on a given OpenStack cloud. Additionally, 64 TBs of storage capacity is provided with Red Hat Ceph Storage, enabling users to better evaluate the flexible, massively scalable properties of Ceph’s leading storage solution for OpenStack environments. New enhancements and updates to Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 include: A more streamlined user experience driven by an easier-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) reduces the complexities of installation and management. Designed for production use, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director GUI provides several newly integrated functions, such as automatic upgrades and updates (including Ceph), advanced networking configuration, high availability, and the option to deploy file sharing via the Manila service, using the integrated drivers available from NetApp and Red Hat Ceph Storage. Improved flexibility for greater scalability through the introduction of customizable services and administration roles using Red Hat OpenStack Platform director. Cloud operators are now able to control their OpenStack environment at a more granular level by customizing OpenStack services to run and scale independently of each other. This offers greater flexibility when deploying services to match individual organizations’ unique workload requirements. Greater data assurance through new security-related enhancements, such as improved high availability (HA) for large scale deployments. Additionally, optional object storage encryption and ephemeral security tokens improve security measures and lower risk of data access due to theft. Improved performance for network-intensive workloads through the new data plane developer kit (DPDK) component of Open vSwitch, and single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV), results in network performance that is comparable to bare metal. Additionally, network routing is now more flexible and faster, allowing customers to choose between centralized routing or distributed routing (DVR). A new “ready state” hardware certification program, based on OpenStack Ironic. While Red Hat already supports certified hardware plug-ins for several OpenStack components, the new program is designed to expand the ecosystem of hardware options for automated bare-metal configuration. Dell EMC is the first Red Hat partner to be certified for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 ready-state, with several more coming soon. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 also introduces distributed continuous integration (DCI) to key partners, such as Dell EMC, NEC, and Rackspace. This collaborative approach to testing can help partners more effectively prepare for new Red Hat OpenStack Platform releases, and provide customers with greater stability and higher quality cloud solutions that have been tested many times over with their uniquely integrated cloud system than previously offered. New lifecycle offers up to 5 years support To help customers achieve long-term stability required by their specific workload requirements, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 introduces a dual support life cycle model that offers greater subscription flexibility for mission-critical operations. This new model gives customers the option of standardizing on a new “Long Life” version of Red Hat OpenStack Platform, offering a three year product lifecycle and optional two additional years of extended life cycle (ELS) support available for purchase. Customers can also choose to focus on consuming new feature functionality by using rolling upgrades to follow the latest releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform every six months to one year. Long Life versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform will be offered every third release, starting with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10. Versions in between will include one year of life cycle support. Supporting Quotes Radhesh Balakrishnan, general manager, OpenStack, Red Hat “In just a few short years, OpenStack has moved from simply being an ‘innovation’ for proofs-of-concept and R&D testbeds to a foundation for mission-critical private cloud deployments, used by hundreds of enterprises and major telecommunication providers alike to power production operations.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS I chose MacBook Pro with Touch Bar over Surface Book By Joe Wilcox Published 3 weeks ago 69 Comments Tweet Water smacked the windshield -- a torrent of heavy droplets -- as my wife struggled to feed money into the tollbooth machine. Pelting rain is uncommon during November in San Diego, but we had purpose for driving 36 km through the downpour to Chula Vista and the Otay Ranch Apple Store, where I had never been before. The shop was the only one around that had the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in stock. Eleven days earlier, Nov. 15, 2016, I received the 13.3-inch model that was ordered on October 27th. While first impressions were wow, the laptop felt slow compared to my previous MBP, and the battery drained in about half the time as specs stated. I worried that Apple produced a defective unit. No store in the area had the smaller laptop in stock, should I want to take advantage of the 14-day return policy. Deadline approached, so I considered as alternative my first 15-incher in more than a decade, tempted in part by quad-core processor and discreet graphics. If Not One, The Other Fast-forward to the present, briefly: In recent days I've seen some stories about shorter-than-expected MBP battery life; customers complain. Hardware is suspected (when isn't it in click-bait news stories). Following a fresh macOS Sierra install on the 13.3-inch laptop and transferring my wife's settings and software from an older MBP, battery life is workday-long-plus. Perhaps the computer had bad factory-installed image or, more likely, despite my sleuthing around for a culprit, something in my setup sucked CPU cycles and energy. (I did investigate!) So if your new MacBook Pro burns the candle quick, check the wick! Returning to weltering November 26th, I stood over the larger MacBook Pro, in awe and despair. The thing felt fast -- almost mind-reading AI-fashion, anticipating keystrokes before I made them. But the screen was huge. Even 13.3 inches is larger than my preference; gimme a laptop that's easily grab-and-go. But the longer time I spent touching and adjusting, perhaps 45 minutes, the more comfortable the laptop became. Decision: Understanding that the computer could be returned within 14 days and recognizing replacement MBP 13 order wouldn't ship, according to Apple Store online, for 4 weeks or more, I made the purchase. My initial angst dissipated within hours after returning home and setting up MBP 15. I have no regrets. Size Matters The 13.3-inch MacBook Pro I had ordered from Apple Store online was a custom config: 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. The laptop replaced my early 2015 model, with 3.1GHz Core i7 chip, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD. My college student daughter accepted the hand-me-down, replacing her somewhat banged and scratched 2013 Apple laptop, with 2.6GHz Core i5 processor, 8GB memory, 256GB SSD. I was surprised how the newer laptop seemed slower than the old. Granted, the comparison was i5 and i7, but also different generation Intel processors. If not MBP 15, I was ready to return the 13.3-incher for refund. Considering how much I had already spent on the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro, a few extra hundred for a lot more computer wasn't a mental (or budgetary) stretch. But I would never spend so much without first experiencing the thing. Understanding: I would return the smaller notebook for refund. Hence, the rainy road trip. Config: 2.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon Pro 455 graphics, 512GB SSD. The CPU is quad-core, and the difference is quite noticeable compared to MBP 13's dual-core processor. This beauty is a multi-tasking maven like nothing groped by my grubby paws. This also marks the most money I have spent on a laptop. Ever. The custom-configured 13-incher totaled $2,199,  and the larger $2,799. Why MBP? By now you must wonder: "Why?" Well, it ain't for the Touch Bar, which isn't as useless as I expected. The brighter (500-nit), more color accurate screen checks one box.  More significantly, I've pined for Apple's butterfly keyboard since its debut on the 12-inch MacBook, which is way, way underpowered for my daily computing requirements. MBP 15 doesn't disappoint. Typing experience on the second-generation butterfly is absolutely fantastic. While the keys are noisy, they deliver great feel and responsiveness. But in choosing to spend so much more, I also opted for other benefits: greater default, native screen resolution (2880 by 1800); quad-core processor; discreet graphics; and expansive, capable touchpad, among them. Features are meaningless without benefits, and I have some in mind. In late October, I fully returned to work after a forced summer sabbatical related to eye surgery that lets me wear glasses to read but frees me from them for distance. I’m ready to write, write, write, and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar feels -- figuratively -- like the tool to do just that. I am doing more photography and video production, and producing a podcast. I need a laptop that can keep up with several projects open and ongoing simultaneously, without stutters and stops that interrupt my workflow and more importantly disrupt my attention. I'm an older writer now, and interruption can leave a crater where my creative flow was. The bigger screen, and even physical size, better suit my needs than the 13.3-incher. How strange; I thank Apple's supply shortages for putting me in position to challenge my preconceptions and go larger when the market trend is smaller laptops. The other mental barrier: Cost, as I couldn't have ever proactively conceived spending so much on a laptop -- and, honestly, wouldn't if not for bent-up desire to produce content following the summer sabbatical. I feel happy typing on the new MBP, for its dazzling beauty and also for how the Touch Bar contextually changes depending on application or what I’m doing. (You’ll have to wait for my full review for more on the feature.) Joy is a benefit often overlooked by high-tech product designers. Scratching the Surface Surely other laptops could do as much for the same cost, or even less. Yup, I seriously considered Surface Book, about which Microsoft's Brian Hall raved two days ago: "The innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro -- especially among professionals -- is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface". He then linked to PC Mag story "Why I Left macOS for a Surface Book", which begins "The Mac is in trouble". Sascha Segan's experience with the butterfly keyboard differs from mine: "I just couldn't get with the super-flat keyboards. I pound out words all day, and getting rid of almost all the throw on the keys was pretty much a deal breaker". As I writer, I understand the sentiment but, as previously mentioned, have much different experience than does the PC Mag analyst. There is much to like about Surface Book, which I see as the only meaningful competitor to either size MacBook Pro. The design is delightful eye candy, and the 3:2 screen ratio is much better suited to writing and researching content in a web browser (MBP is 16:10). Maximum resolution of the gorgeous 13.5-inch screen, which is fully touch-capable: 3000 by 2000 (MBP 13 is 2560 by 1600 and 2880 by 1800 for the larger). Touch is a bonus if you need it, then there is the stylus. I'm a terrible artist and handwriter. I started using a typewriter at age 14 -- during the mid-1970s -- because my penmanship is so terrible. As such, the stylus has little appeal, while the touchscreen is a nice-to-have that I learned from using Chromebook Pixel and other Windows laptops isn't a necessity. For me. As a middle-aged typist writer, keyboard matters much, and the MBP Touch Bar promises to expand what my fingers can do across the plane where they are constantly active. If I were another person, with different priorities and (artistic) capabilities, Surface Book might be the thing. Apple offers one port-type on new MacBook Pros: USB Type-C (aka Thunderbolt 3), whereas Microsoft serves up the smorgasbord of connection options most people will want. Sixth-generation Intel Core chips are standard from both companies. Cost Comparisons Surface Book pricing is similar or close between comparable configurations for either size MBP. That is when I purchased either. Microsoft is sale crazy during the holidays (don't ever expect deals from Apple). For example: $1999 for MBP 13 or SB with Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Of course, Microsoft serves up stylus and touchscreen instead of Apple's tiny Touch Bar -- and the display converts into a tablet (that is too large for my tastes). With i7 chip and double the RAM: $2,499 for the Apple and $2,699 for the Microsoft, but currently discounted to $2,299. While screen sizes mis-match, here's Surface Book with Performance Base compared to MBP 15: Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD -- both for $2,799. SB has touchscreen and stylus, but the MacBook Pro packs quad-core processor. For my needs, speed, professional graphics, and bigger screen matter more. And something else that strangely is the opposite of Sascha Segan's deal-breaker: I find typing on the Surface Book keyboard troubling in manner similar to his complaints about MacBook Pro's butterfly; there's too much travel. Ha! Hey, this is why companies can compete: Different priorities and tastes among potential users. Fanboys, don't get into a pissing match about which is better. Because both matter right now, and Microsoft gets good bang from the competition between them. Earlier today I asked Stephen Baker, NPD vice president and primary hardware analyst, about MacBook Pro and Surface Book sales. They are "key parts of the turnaround in the consumer PC market in terms of pointing it in a more premium direction", he says. "While they aren’t the share leaders, the advertising being spent and the marketing have helped lift all the Windows boats—and it of course hasn’t hurt that all the Windows brands have stepped up their premium product development". Wrapping up, the best laptop is the one with the benefits that matter most to you. That's how I came to choose 15.4-inch MacBook Pro -- and love it. Hehe. Who knows, maybe in an alternate universe, heavy rains led my wife and I to drive to closer-distance Fashion Valley Mall, where there is Microsoft Store, inside which an irresistible Surface Book offer hypnotized me.

Gen. Michael Flynn's business activities, which "could conflict sharply with his government role" by Deirdre Fulton, staff writer 0 Comments Retired Army general Michael Flynn is founder of the Flynn Intel Group consulting company. (Photo: US Naval War College/flickr/cc) Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn's "deep ties to defense contractors," explored Friday by Bloomberg, raise additional questions about his potential ethical conflicts as President-elect Donald Trump's national security advisor. According to Bloomberg: Just last week, he was re-elected to a paid position on the board of a surveillance drone company with Department of Defense contracts, federal filings show. And while taking part in the classified briefings for Trump last August, he revamped his consulting company—Flynn Intel Group, or FIG—by adding one senior executive whose firm does extensive cybersecurity work for government agencies and another who was soliciting defense department aviation contracts. Public records, government contracts and documents posted online by Flynn and his partners show that they have vied in recent months for federal contracts to supply overseas military bases, fly diplomats in and out of conflict zones, and provide cybersecurity and technology for defense and intelligence agencies. These business activities, writes reporter David Kocieniewski, "could conflict sharply with [Flynn's] government role," which will involve daily handling of classified information and input on global military, diplomatic, and intelligence issues—but does not require Senate confirmation.  Yet Kocieniewski reports that "neither Flynn, his partners, nor the Trump transition team responded to repeated questions during the past week about how he plans to comply with federal ethics rules that forbid executive-branch employees from having a financial interest in companies that do business with the agencies they lead." Just Wednesday, Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) wrote to top U.S. intelligence officials to ask that they review Flynn's security clearance, citing both his ownership of FIG as well as this week's revelations that he mishandled classified information while serving as the top military intelligence officer in Afghanistan. "Based on public reports," the senators wrote, "his conduct in positions that require access to national defense information, and his subsequent private practice, appears inconsistent with the professionalism such access requires." The "ongoing business relationship of Flynn Intel Group, owned by General Flynn and operated by his son, creates the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents," they continued. "In addition, any share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution." The latest scrutiny comes on the heels of a letter sent earlier this month from 50 organizations to Trump, demanding he rescind Flynn's appointment "immediately." That missive pointed to Flynn's "history of bigoted and deceitful statements," opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement, penchant for "regime change," and his "alarming ties to foreign governments" as evidence that he is "a completely inappropriate choice to serve in the most senior national security position in the White House."

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. ARM's office in Hsinchu, Taiwan focuses on hardware and software development. Credit: ARM More like this ARM has a new weapon in race to build world's fastest computers Qualcomm awakens and hopes to crush Intel at its own game With ARM server market fading, Qualcomm's new chip may be too late Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware ARM has a big problem -- it rules in smartphones and tablets but hasn't broken into servers and supercomputers. ARM servers are devalued partly because many applications don't work with the chips. But ARM has acquired Allinea Software with the hope of partially resolving the compatibility issue. Allinea provides software development, debugging, and porting tools, which should make it easier for people to write applications for ARM-based servers and supercomputers. The acquisition will "provide a channel to thousands of developers using supercomputers and give us better first-hand knowledge of the issues being addressed as software is ported to new ARM-based systems," Javier Orensanz, general manager of the development solutions group at ARM, said in a blog entry. The development tools will also be used for ARM chips in deep-learning systems, which require large-scale server deployments for analytics. ARM's competition will come from deep-learning and HPC software tools offered by Intel, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and more recently, AMD. ARM designs chips and licenses them to third-party chipmakers like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel. The company is aggressively chasing markets like supercomputing and IoT and is in the process of being acquired by Softbank for $32.4 billion. Fujitsu is making the first ARM-based supercomputer, called Post-K, scheduled to be deployed in Japan by 2020. The supercomputer will have 64-bit chips based on a new microarchitecture called ARMv8-A Scalable Vector Extension, which has vector processing abilities for complex calculations. With the Allinea deal, ARM realized its software weakness and is acting on it. It is acquiring customers and a shortcut to get more developers to write applications for ARM processors. Allinea tools are used by many organizations, with some of the fastest computers in the world using other chip architectures. Allinea's team will become a part of the ARM's HPC development solutions team. ARM's acquisition won't affect Allinea's product roadmap. ARM did not reveal how much it paid for Allinea Software.

In this Nov. 17 file photo, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn gestures as he arrives with his son Michael G. Flynn, left, at Trump Tower in New York. (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press) By David Kocieniewski Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS NEW YORK – Donald Trump’s selection of Michael Flynn as national security adviser caused concern last month when it was revealed that Flynn represented a business with ties to the Turkish government while getting classified briefings during the campaign. He promised to sever those ties before Inauguration Day. But Flynn has other potential conflicts. Just last week, he was re-elected to a paid position on the board of a surveillance drone company with Department of Defense contracts, federal filings show. And while taking part in the classified briefings for Trump last August, he revamped his consulting company – Flynn Intel Group, or FIG – by adding one senior executive whose firm does extensive cybersecurity work for government agencies and another who was soliciting defense department aviation contracts. Public records, government contracts and documents posted online by Flynn and his partners show that they have vied in recent months for federal contracts to supply overseas military bases, fly diplomats in and out of conflict zones, and provide cybersecurity and technology for defense and intelligence agencies. Flynn’s recent moves at FIG – as well as his partnerships with companies and private-equity executives who have military and intelligence contracts – could conflict sharply with his government role. Ethics experts say that as the president’s top military-security aide, he will handle classified information on a daily basis and help lead the country’s military, diplomatic and intelligence response around the globe. Visits to two of Flynn’s offices in Virginia suggest they are reducing their activities: One was empty and being repainted. But neither Flynn, his partners, nor the Trump transition team responded to repeated questions during the past week about how he plans to comply with federal ethics rules that forbid executive-branch employees from having a financial interest in companies that do business with the agencies they lead. The transition team also hasn’t provided information about Flynn’s business dealings in response to congressional requests. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who sits on the House Oversight Committee, wrote to Vice President-elect Mike Pence last month asking for details of Flynn’s business ties and steps he intends to take to avoid a conflict. A Cummings aide said none have been provided. On Dec. 14, two Democratic senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, sent a letter to the nation’s top intelligence officials arguing that Flynn’s ongoing ownership of his consulting company “creates the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents.” The letter said FIG is now run by Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who was removed from the Trump transition team earlier this month after spreading false internet conspiracies that led to a shooting at a Washington pizzeria. Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general who was fired from his post as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Barack Obama in 2014. His nomination as Trump’s national security adviser offers him a key White House role requiring no Senate confirmation. He has been widely scrutinized for his brashness in the two years since leaving the military. He made a paid speech for RT, a news agency run by the Russian government, sat at a table with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a 2015 dinner celebrating RT’s anniversary, shared internet conspiracies on social media and last February tweeted that “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” But little has been publicly disclosed about the path Flynn has forged in the business world. Like many retired officers, he leveraged expertise he developed in the service into a private-sector career. Rather than join a big defense company, however, he set up his own. “I didn’t walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrop Grumman or Booz Allen (Hamilton) or some of these other big companies (like) Raytheon,” he told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. “I’m very independent, and it’s very liberating actually.” He added, “I’m not going to be a general that just fades away.” In 2014, he founded his company with Bijan Kian, a prominent Iranian-American banker who served on the board of the Export-Import Bank, was a senior fellow at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and a member of the White House Business Council. Federal ethics rules say that executive-branch employees who are in partnerships must avoid potential conflicts with businesses owned by fellow partners. Kian is a principal at Global Capital Markets, a mergers-and-acquisitions firm that has brokered deals involving an assortment of military contractors, and chairman and chief executive officer of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology company that sells secure communications chips and computers designed for military and intelligence agencies. Kian didn’t respond to numerous attempts to reach him. FIG positioned itself as an elite operation with the state-of-the-art skills to protect global businesses and government agencies. Flynn hired a handful of cybersecurity experts who worked under him in the Defense Intelligence Agency and other military posts. Much of their business centered around providing training and information-technology design advice to corporate executives concerned with protecting their companies from hacks. By late 2015, Flynn had raised his public profile through an assortment of speeches and media appearances critical of the Obama administration’s anti-terror strategy, and he started advising several Republican presidential candidates. He also began to expand his own circle of business associations and his company’s portfolio. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) FIG brought in Phil Oakley, who ran Quaestor Federal Consulting, a contractor that provides training and advice to military and intelligence operations. FIG was hired by Levyx, a data-storage startup, which announced that the partnership was intended to help it win government and defense contracts. Flynn also joined the advisory board of Patriot Defense Group, the military-contracting subsidiary of Patriot Capital LLC. In May 2016, Flynn took a paid position on the board of a company that makes surveillance drones, which grew out of a business that President-elect Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., represented until 2014. As a board member of Drone Aviation Inc., he has been paid $3,000 per month and also received 100,000 shares of restricted stock, now valued at more than $275,000, which will become fully vested next spring. Flynn continued to hold his seat after he began receiving classified intelligence briefings on August 17. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and federal-contract databases show the company was awarded one Department of Defense contract in late August and two more in October. FIG worked as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a Dutch company with close ties to Turkish President Recep Erdogan. When that arrangement was reported last month by The Daily Caller, Flynn responded by having FIG leave the field of lobbying and said he would “sever ties” with his company. But it isn’t clear whether he will retain an ownership stake. Because Flynn is a partner in the closely held business, and his son Michael is its chief of staff, he and his family would stand to gain financially from any business it does with the government. He also was re-elected to his paid position on the board of Drone Aviation on Dec. 6, according to SEC filings. Ethicists urge Flynn to end such arrangements and sell his company. Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, said even severing ties isn’t enough. People in such positions “still know the company and how its business works, so they would know how a policy decision would affect it,” he said. “The only way to avoid that is for them to sell their interest and make a totally clean break.” Published: Dec. 16, 2016, 9:24 a.m.  Tags: Conflict of interest, defense contracts, Donald Trump, Mike Flynn, military, politics, top news ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Co. Ltd. If Samsung spins off its contract chip manufacturing business, this Apple supplier might be set to benefit. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 16, 2016 at 11:11AM A report from Business Korea says that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is considering spinning off its contract chip manufacturing business. The report goes on to say that Samsung began mulling this over "after the company lost Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest customer in the sector of application processors" to Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short. Image source: Intel.  It's hard to know if this will ultimately happen, but if it does, it could have some interesting implications for TSMC. Without Samsung Electronics, Samsung Foundry might fall behind Contract chip manufacturers like TSMC generally don't just build chips on the latest whiz-bang manufacturing technology. They build chips on a broad spectrum of technologies, ranging from brand-new technologies all the way to technologies that first began production a decade or more ago. Very few chip manufacturers have been able to deliver those leading-edge technologies at a rapid cadence, with just Samsung, TSMC, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at the forefront (with Global Foundries saying that it will be, too). Other chip-makers, like United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC), or UMC, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (NYSE:SMI), tend to bring technologies to market years after the top players do. There are many chips to be built on older manufacturing technologies, so these smaller, weaker players can still go after a significant portion of the semiconductor market. However, on older generation technologies, a technology leader like TSMC has significant scale and potentially yields advantages over the smaller technology laggards (since its "mature" technologies compete with their "leading edge" technologies). Nevertheless, I think that if Samsung were to spin off its contract chip manufacturer, the stand-alone Samsung Foundry wouldn't be able to afford the substantial R&D and capital equipment investments to stay at the leading edge of technology -- especially if it could no longer count on the captive demand from Samsung's chip design group (which, itself, has plenty of captive demand from Samsung Electronics). In short, I think it would become another UMC or SMIC -- effectively eliminating the foundry competition that TSMC currently has in building leading-edge chips. TSMC already captures much of the leading-edge foundry business out there, but additional share here certainly couldn't hurt. Two potential challengers If Samsung were to effectively be out of the leading-edge technology race, there's still Global Foundries and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) that could potentially step in to take its place as the No. 2 leading-edge contract chip manufacturer. Global Foundries talks quite a big game and has for years suggested that it would deliver leadership technologies alongside the major players, but thus far reality hasn't been so kind to the chipmaker. It couldn't develop a viable 14/16-nanometer generation technology on its own, which forced it to license Samsung's 14-nanometer LPE/LPP technologies, for example. The chip-maker indicates that it's going to be in production on a competitive 7-nanometer technology by late 2018, but I wouldn't bet money on the company delivering on that promise. Intel has the technology to compete effectively with TSMC and it has been making plenty of noise to suggest that it will eventually become a viable leading-edge contract chip manufacturer (right now, Intel primarily builds chips on leading-edge technologies for itself). However, just as Global Foundries has a technology credibility problem, Intel has a contract chip manufacturing credibility problem. Even though Intel Custom Foundry has been around for more than half a decade, it's still not generating revenues that would be considered significant by any stretch of the imagination.

Neowin Login Sign up News Features Forums Deals More Subscribe Store Chat on IRC Send Tip Write for Neowin About Us Advertising Facebook Twitter Follow @neowinfeed Google+ 7 Days: A week of Microsoft updates, more Yahoo hoohah, and Apple Watch wah-wah-waaahhh By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · Dec 17, 2016 with 0 comments 7 Days is a weekly roundup of the Editors' picks of what's been happening in the world of technology - written with a dash of humor, a hint of exasperation, and an endless supply of (Irish) coffee. Christmas is just a week away, but if you were expecting things to slow down across the tech industry with the festive break approaching, you couldn't have been more wrong. This will be the last edition of 7 Days for the year, but there's plenty to get through, so let's get on with it! Our journey this week begins with another massive security disaster for Yahoo. In September, the firm admitted to a data breach that occurred in 2014, which compromised the data of over 500 million users. This week, it confessed to another breach, affecting up to one billion accounts - and it looks like Verizon is now thinking of abandoning its $4.83 billion Yahoo acquisition as a result. Note-taking platform Evernote got itself into a dreadful mess of a very different kind on Wednesday, as details emerged of its new privacy policy, allowing some of its employees to read users' notes. Unsurprisingly, many users were furious about this, and it didn't take long for the company to reverse course and issue an apology. Microsoft co-founder and celebrated philanthropist Bill Gates launched a $1 billion fund to stimulate research and development of clean energy technology. The fund is also being backed by other investors that include Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Europe is taking on America's GPS and Russia's GLONASS satellite navigation systems with its own Galileo system, which went live this week. Galileo promises even greater accuracy than existing systems, and will be compatible with many newer smartphones via a software update. Last week, Nokia heralded the return of its brand to mobile devices, announcing that new Android smartphones are on the way. The first Nokia-branded handset to emerge from its new partnership was unveiled on Tuesday... but it's not an Android device. Back in October, Apple unexpectedly announced the delay of its "magical" AirPods, the new wireless earbuds that no-one asked for, but which it decided to launch as a result of its unwelcome decision to remove the headphone jack from its newest iPhones. On Tuesday, the company finally opened pre-orders for the AirPods, priced at $159. If you lose one of your AirPods - and let's face it, you probably will - Apple will charge you $69 for a replacement. For some similarly magical/stupid reason, Apple won't be launching its new BeatsX wireless headphones - which it announced in September - until February. On the software side of things, it's been a busy week for Apple, with plenty of updates released: iOS 10.2 rolls out, including new TV app and delicious bacon emoji iOS 10.2.1, macOS 10.12.3 and tvOS 10.1.1 betas available for developers iOS 10.2.1 and macOS 10.12.3 Public Betas released Apple also rolled out the general release of tvOS 10.1 and watchOS 3.1.1 on Monday. However, it soon pulled watchOS 3.1.1 after widespread reports that the update was permanently bricking Apple Watches. Oh dear. In September, Google delayed the launch of Android Wear 2.0 until next year. On Tuesday, it released its fourth Developer Preview of the new smartwatch OS, bringing a wide range of improvements and new features. Intriguingly, Google also bought Cronologics, the company that launched the first smartwatch with support for Amazon's Alexa digital assistant. Originally developed as 'Project Brillo', Google announced the launch of its Internet of Things platform this week. Appropriately named 'Android Things', it also released its first Developer Preview, promising regular updates, security fixes and patches. Rarely does a week go by without details of some ghastly new security issue being highlighted on Android devices. This week, it emerged that a load of Android handsets - including two from Lenovo were found to have trojans embedded in their firmware. While Google has already released Android 7.1.1 Nougat, most manufacturers haven't even started to upgrade their devices to Android 7.0. Some have, though, while others are testing their Nougat updates; here are the latest arrivals: Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus (no, seriously, this time) Sony expands Nougat rollout to Xperia X and Xperia X Compact OnePlus releases new Android 7.0 preview - but only for the OnePlus 3 OnePlus 3T gets OxygenOS 3.5.4 update... based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow Huawei launched a new Android 'concept' phone, the Honor Magic, designed to help the company "pre-evaluate uncertain future technologies". Curiously, the device has some pretty conventional specs, although it does include some interesting and distinctive features, but rumors that it would have a curved-edge display proved to be unfounded. Meanwhile, it looks like Samsung will be going all-in on curved displays with its next Galaxy flagship. A report claims that the Galaxy S8 will only be offered with a dual-curved screen, with no 'conventional' flat display option. Last week, Verizon foolishly stated that it had no plans to release an update to block network access for the Galaxy Note7, despite its US carrier rivals stating that they would do so. Verizon said that it didn't want to prevent users from making calls during the holiday season or in an emergency situation - even though Samsung's fiery flagship has already been responsible for creating emergency situations, leading to its ban from all flights in the US. This week, Verizon finally saw sense and reversed its position. Let's hope Samsung's future flagships don't have similar overheating problems, or things could get very uncomfortable while wearing its new Gear VR 2 headset, which the company confirmed this week. Samsung is also working on a mixed-reality 'holographic' headset, similar to Microsoft's HoloLens. You can now ask Google to play Netflix videos and search through your Photos, thanks to a new update available for its voice-activated Home speaker hub. But Google's plans to build its own self-driving cars have reached the end of the road - for now, at least. Google's parent firm Alphabet has suspended development of its own purpose-built autonomous vehicles, and has instead spun off its efforts into a separate company, Waymo, which will develop self-driving technology for use by other manufacturers. Dozens of technology firms of all sizes have signed a pledge against the creation of a database of Muslim Americans, proposed by US President-elect Donald Trump. Microsoft made a public statement on the matter too, saying that such a database would be discriminatory, and against its values, and that it "wouldn't do any work to build a registry of Muslim Americans." Microsoft's struggles in the mobile space have been well documented - and with its global smartphone market share dropping to 0.4%, you might well be wondering if the company even plans to show up at the next Mobile World Congress. Don't worry, though - Microsoft will "do great things" at MWC 2017. Coship voiced serious concerns about the future of Windows 10 Mobile in October, and questioned the value of continuing to invest in the platform. It said that it would crowdfund its next Windows phone to gauge the level of public interest in its devices - but that crowdfunding campaign ended today with just 30 backers worldwide, reaching only 2.6% of its $100,000 goal. Microsoft added the two newest Windows 10 Mobile flagships - the Alcatel IDOL 4S and HP Elite x3 - to its Windows Device Recovery Tool on Monday, raising some interesting questions. It included a reference to an "Open Market" version of the IDOL 4S, a device that is currently available exclusively on T-Mobile in the US. Alcatel later confirmed that the handset will be made available in "various markets in Europe". The release notes also mentioned an "Elite x3 Telstra" model, hinting at a variant of the device locked to Australian carrier Telstra. However, HP confirmed to Neowin that it refers to an unlocked Australian model of the phone with compatibility for Telstra's network. The Elite x3 is now available with a chunky discount in the US. Microsoft has cut $150 (19%) off its price, as well as slashing the Lumia 950 XL's price by $200 (40%), reducing it to $299. Over in the UK, Surface Book and Pro 4 buyers can now get 10% off, as well as a free Xbox One S, from the Microsoft Store. Another UK retailer is offering the same deal, along with 10% off many other premium Windows 10 PCs, including a free three-year guarantee. Back in the US, Microsoft has launched its Holiday Super Sale, offering huge savings on its Surface devices, along with discounts and freebies on the Xbox One S, up to $1,100 off Windows 10 PCs, and lots more deals on wearable devices, drones, speakers, mice, keyboards, monitors, and more. On Monday, Microsoft announced launch plans for its new Surface Book with Performance Base in eight new markets. Microsoft also declared its Surface Hub collaboration device a resounding success, revealing some interesting details about sales, and announcing a new 'Try-and-Buy' program for companies thinking about making a purchase. Chinese manufacturer Chuwi revealed its new Windows 10 LapBook, with a 14.1-inch display and Intel's new Apollo Lake processors. The company told Neowin that it expects the device to launch for under $300. And it looks like fellow Chinese firm Xiaomi may be preparing to launch a Windows 10 version of its new 9.7-inch Mi Pad 3 tablet, with an Intel Core m3 processor and 8GB RAM. This week was Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, which meant there were plenty of updates available: Windows 10 build 14393.576 for PC and Mobile (Version 1607 / Anniversary Update) Windows 10 build 10586.713 for PC (Version 1511 / November Update) Windows 10 build 10240.17202 for PC (Version 1507 / original GA release branch) Six critical security flaws patched in Windows, Internet Explorer, Edge and Office However, one update recently pushed to Windows 10 PCs caused more harm than good, disrupting DHCP functionality, and preventing systems from connecting to networks. However, Microsoft has since issued a fix to resolve that problem. Microsoft released Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14986 to PCs in the Slow ring, just one week after its Fast ring rollout. ISOs for build 14986 will be coming next week - but Microsoft has confirmed that there won't be any more preview builds until 2017. On Tuesday, Microsoft revealed the Cortana Skills Kit and Devices SDK - a major announcement. Third-parties will now be able to connect with the digital assistant more easily, greatly expanding its usefulness, while the Devices SDK will allow manufacturers to bring Cortana to their own hardware. One of the first devices to be powered by Cortana was teased in a video this week; a high-end speaker built by Harman Kardon, coming next year. Cortana, Bing, and other Microsoft services will continue to benefit from HERE location data, after the two companies signed a multi-year agreement, which will include real-time traffic information and live public transit data in Bing Maps. Microsoft's Edge browser will begin blocking Flash content by default with the arrival of the Windows 10 Creators Update next year. However, a security researcher discovered a bug within Edge's SmartScreen feature, which could allow scammers to create legitimate-looking warning messages and block reputable websites. There were a few problems for Microsoft's Skype Preview app earlier this week too, as many users reported that the app was crashing on start-up - but Microsoft fixed the issue a day later. The company is now looking to the future of its communications platform, and - like it or not - Skype's future will be filled with bots, bots, and more bots. On Android, the future may well be Skype Mingo, which is now available as an alpha release. The new app aims to be a single communications hub, including support for native calling, SMS and contacts management. Meanwhile, on iOS, Microsoft updated Skype to clear unseen messages from the notification panel after the app is opened, along with various other features. A new fly-out menu is being tested for OneDrive, offering an improved user experience. The first public beta of Adobe XD also arrived on Windows 10 - but despite being a UWP app, it's not being offered through the Windows Store. Microsoft announced this week that it's bringing Dolby Atmos audio support to its Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs next year. And Microsoft rolled out a new update to the Xbox One and Xbox One S this week, bringing dramatic improvements in download speeds, better performance with wireless controllers, and enhancements to background downloads and audio. After passing the 300-game milestone last week, Microsoft added six more Xbox 360 titles to the list of those playable on the Xbox One on Thursday. Just in time for the final festive shopping frenzy, Microsoft has slashed $50 off its Xbox One S bundles, reducing them to as little as $249. If you buy from the Microsoft Store, you'll also get an additional free game, plus a $30 gift code. Minecraft's expanding universe is growing again this month as Microsoft is releasing the Fallout Mash-Up Pack for console versions of the blocky world-building game. Nintendo sold almost 200,000 of its coveted NES Classic consoles in the US alone last month. But if you were one of those who wanted the new NES but couldn't get your hands on one, this $59 console might just satisfy your retro desires. If you're already quivering with excitement at the thought of buying Nintendo's new console, there's some good news for you... if you're in North America. The company will be giving people the opportunity to try out its new Switch console in multiple cities before its launch. But of course, Nintendo's biggest news this week was the release of its new mobile game on iOS, Super Mario Run. The game shot straight to the top of the App Store charts within just a few hours of its release - but don't worry, Android fans; it'll be coming to you next year as well. As for Windows phone users... well, just keep praying for a miracle. Our odyssey across the tech world this week - and this year - is drawing to a close, but before I head off to deck the halls, don some gay apparel, and drink a gallon of eggnog, let me first share the extraordinary sight of Android 7.1 Nougat running on the Nokia Lumia 520 and Lumia 525 Windows phones. You can check out the full videos here. Miracles do happen, after all. But our journey ends in Japan, where a company has created a device that can project a holographic companion for lonely people, misanthropes, or those who have had enough of their families over the stress-inducing festive season. Happy holidays! Bonus content Before I disappear to gorge myself on Christmas pudding, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Vlad Dudau thoroughly tested the new flagship OnePlus 3T in his review - and... well, let's just say he was pretty impressed it with it. Vlad also published a mini-review of the dodocool foldable Bluetooth headphones, and given that they cost just $18, they certainly sound pretty good - especially considering that he consistently got over eight hours of audio playback from them before the battery ran out. Apple's $159 AirPods can only manage five! Our readers can also get a 20% discount - click through to the review to pick up your code! Robbie Khan reviewed the Mpow multimedia projector, a low-cost solution with 1080p video support and 1200 lumens of brightness.

ARM servers are devalued partly because many applications don't work with the chips. But ARM has acquired Allinea Software with the hope of partially resolving the compatibility issue. Allinea provides software development, debugging, and porting tools, which should make it easier for people to write applications for ARM-based servers and supercomputers. The acquisition will "provide a channel to thousands of developers using supercomputers and give us better first-hand knowledge of the issues being addressed as software is ported to new ARM-based systems," Javier Orensanz, general manager of the development solutions group at ARM, said in a blog entry. The development tools will also be used for ARM chips in deep-learning systems, which require large-scale server deployments for analytics. ARM's competition will come from deep-learning and HPC software tools offered by Intel, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and more recently, AMD. ARM designs chips and licenses them to third-party chipmakers like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel. The company is aggressively chasing markets like supercomputing and IoT and is in the process of being acquired by Softbank for US$32.4 billion. Fujitsu is making the first ARM-based supercomputer called Post-K, scheduled to be deployed in Japan by 2020. The supercomputer will have 64-bit chips based on a new microarchitecture called ARMv8-A Scalable Vector Extension, which has vector processing abilities for complex calculations. With the Allinea deal, ARM realized its software weakness and is acting on it. It is acquiring customers and a shortcut to get more developers to write applications for ARM processors. Allinea tools are used by many organizations with some of the fastest computers in the world using other chip architectures. Allinea's team will become a part of the ARM's HPC development solutions team. ARM's acquisition won't affect Allinea's product roadmap. ARM did not reveal how much it paid for Allinea Software. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

hypebot digital music and the music business Home D.I.Y. Music Tech Social Media Music Biz More News MusicThinkTank Never Miss A Beat! Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « Music Drives Top 3 Most Wanted Tech Gifts Of 2016 [CHART] | Main | Obamacare In Trouble, Musicians Should Sign Up Anyway » The Most Important Music Business Trends Of 2016 [Bas Grasmayer] This week as part of his Projecting Trends series, Bas Grasmayer looks back on some of the most import music industry trends of 2016, including blockchain tech, virtual reality, streaming exclusives, and bots. _____________________________ Guest post by Bas Grasmayer from the Synchblog What a rollercoaster 2016 has been.  Without even considering the passing away of so many legends, it was an important year for the music business. 2016 was filled of optimism and innovation, with many looking forward and trying to understand the music industry in the years to come. Many of this year’s most important developments need more time in order to meaningfully contribute to a better industry, but that means 2016 has been a foundational year. In review, some of the year’s most important trends that we’ll see more of in 2017 and the years to come. Virtual reality The start of the year already had people buzzing about the possibilities of VR. People are particularly interested in what VR can do for live performances. We’ve seen VR platform TheWaveVR raise millions of dollars to help artists get on stage in a virtual reality environment. Boiler Room, which you may know from the filmed DJ sets with an audience behind the performers, is in the process of opening a VR venue in London. NextVR teamed up with Live Nation to record real-world concerts so fans can experience them in VR. And Universal and iHeartMedia launched a similar initiative for VR concerts. While this trend is set to continue, things are not moving as fast as some anticipated. There’s a chicken and egg problem: the consumer hardware is expensive and if there’s not a lot of great content out there, then people will not buy the hardware… and if they won’t buy the hardware, why create content for it? VR set manufacturers have had to cut their sales projections in half in some cases. The challenge is bringing parties together early to find ways to develop the market. One of these ways is the Khronos VR Standards Initiative which includes the likes of Valve, ARM, Google, Intel, NVIDIA, Facebook-owned Oculus and others. Benji Rogers, who started Dot Blockchain Music, sees an opportunity in making the music business more transparent through VR, as VR will bring new file formats that could adopt new standards for metadata integration. Blockchain There have been A LOT of discussions about how the music business can utilize blockchain this year, and there will be many more in the years to come. The idea is that by moving rights data onto a distributed ledger, in which all changes are recorded and amended, it will be a lot easier to figure out who to pay for what, and as a result payments will be more timely and less money will enter a black box. The problem with some of the discussions is that we’re talking about how it can be implemented industry-wide… Which means that blockchain can’t solve the music industry’s problems, before the industry figures out how to solve them themselves. It’s reminiscent of the (failed) Global Rights Database. Luckily, Berklee has managed to get a lot of people into the same room for the Open Music Initiative, which is still rapidly growing. It will also be interesting to see what happens at the grassroots level. We don’t need to develop industry-wide solutions, necessarily. Small experiments to make things more efficient, for now, are a great start. Meanwhile there are many interesting developments in this space, with people building decentralized content registries for the decentralized web, and the teams around superstar DJs launching blockchain experiments to see how they can make the tech work. Augmented and mixed reality With all the things that have happened since, it’s easy to forget the Pokémon Go hype that was the topic of the first Projecting Trends piece. It allowed the team of Landmrk, an app where people can unlock songs in a similar way to catching Pokémon, to double down on their augmented reality tool for music. They did a spectacular project with the Latin American boyband CNCO, where fans had to collaborate in the real world to unlock virtual goods. Meanwhile, the web was buzzing about Mark Zuckerberg’s demo at Oculus Connect, which showed how Facebook imagines the physical and digital world can be layered together. Troy Carter, who managed Lady Gaga and now heads up Creator Services at Spotify, talked about how ‘mixed reality’ in which the virtual interacts with the physical, will transform our music experience. A trend heavily intertwined with VR and it shows the promise virtual reality has once taken back into the real world. Streaming services competing with labels The year has also been interesting for streaming exclusives. It’s a phenomenon that was boosted by Tidal’s content strategy and after Apple Music enabled Frank Ocean to go indie, the head of Universal Music Group, Lucian Grainge, banned streaming exclusive deals. It’s logical. After all: for a long time music streaming services marketed themselves as all the music you want, for a fixed fee per month. Getting additional subscriptions is not a viable long-term option for most consumers, and instead they could go back to piracy. After all, they feel that they’re already paying for it - even when they’re not. We also see streaming going mainstream, with the Wall Street Journal dubbing 2016’s summer “the summer streaming took over”. Certainly true for Warner, Sony, and UMG - all seeing light at the end of the tunnel and healthy growth. Spotify, in the meantime, has started funding music creation in multiple ways. A passionate plea from a former Apple Music employee argued that Apple’s streaming service works more closely with artists than their labels do. It will be interesting to see whether streaming services will go full Netflix and will truly start competing for talent with labels. New price points in streaming? It’s long been argued that the music streaming landscape needs more price points to cater to different types of consumers. And while we talk about $10 / month being the standard price point, research by MIDiA revealed this year that the average monthly spend of newly acquired Spotify subscribers in Q2 was $3.09. This is due to discounting and particularly Spotify’s $0.99 for 3 months promotional offer. It helped fuel growth and boosted Spotify’s free-to-premium conversion figures. A major player in the streaming space, Pandora, launched a new service priced at $5 / month to cater to mid-tier consumers. Another example of a lower-priced service is MTV Trax, which charges about $1 / week in countries like Spain. And a service named POPPED is experimenting with a $5 / month subscription app in The Netherlands. Spotify’s heavy discounting shows that they have a need for a lower price point. Perhaps spinning off one of their features as a standalone product could be a realistic scenario. And while they may not be buying Soundcloud after all, expect further consolidation in streaming next year, and new price points. Bots and automation The culminating outrage against ticket scalping bots that snag tickets before fans can, only to resell them at higher price points, finally led to governments banning the practice in the US, UK, and Italy. Then there’s the other bots... If you’re deep in tech, it seemed like everyone and their mother had a chatbot this year. Facebook launched their Messenger platform, and saw the likes of Hardwell, Laidback Luke, Christina Milian, and Robbie Williams all getting in on the action. In India, music streaming service Gaana created a bot that let people stream music from Gaana via the Messenger interface. Record Bird, a service that lets you stay up to date on releases, also launched a relatively popular music bot. In China, the messenger WeChat has already become an app platform, and now Facebook’s trying to turn Messenger into an app platform of their own. So when looking at chatbots, try to see them as apps. Some are gimmicky, while others are thoughtful and well-executed. It’s an important trend because now, finally, messaging apps will become platforms of their own and step out of the shadows of social networks.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Michael Liedtke. Updated December 16, 2016 7:51AM SHARE ALSO SEE Yahoo Data Breach Password Encryption Hacker Cybercrime Cyberattack Election Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon -- massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack -- one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government -- that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign -- not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. "The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government Attackers Of course, it's not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments." Yahoo's security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion -- a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two Hacks, More than a Billion Accounts Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the "new development before reaching any final conclusions." Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses "definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price," Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. "We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon," the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. © 2017 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

SK Hynix showed a 72-layer 3D NAND, a research prototype that was a step ahead of 64-layer devices that Samsung announced in August. Separately, SK Hynix and Toshiba described a 4-Gbit MRAM chip. At a side event, a Qualcomm researcher said that the company is exploring monolithic 3DICs that stack logic and memory transistors. A Stanford group presented work on a new machine-learning algorithm run on a novel 3D device that it claims could leapfrog today’s approaches. In process technology, researchers said that FinFET transistors still have a lot of life. They also showed work in gate-all-around nanowires that are expected to replace them eventually. And an Intel expert gave a tutorial on lessons learned in interconnect. Mildred Dresselhaus, a veteran materials researcher who studied under Enrico Fermi, set the tone, accepting an award as a celebrated IEDM member. “This conference is a good place to do something about the electronics world and what happens after the end of Moore’s law,” she told the gathering of more than 1,600 engineers.  At some point, “there will be no more Moore’s law and we will have to do something else,” she said, pointing to promising new materials such as chalcogenides. Dresselhaus joined the MIT faculty in 1967. “At the time, devices were mostly based on vacuum tubes, and I was one of the early people working on semiconductors — that turned out to be a fruitful field,” she quipped. “Silicon was too hard, so we started with germanium; then we moved to silicon because it was going to be important, but we had to understand the physics of germanium first,” she recalled. “Now, instead of going from vacuum tubes to electronics, we will go to something else. I don’t know what that will be, but a lot of people in this room will contribute to it,” said the 86-year-old, who told EE Times that she still goes into MIT daily and reads doctoral theses.  “I enjoy thinking about these things and anyone who wants to join me is welcome,” she added.

Meet The Publisher Meet The Team Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Home Mobile Gadgets Trending Business Women & Tech Contests Gift guide: Notebooks and 2-in-1 devices By: Gadjo Sevilla December 16, 2016 By Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla Notebooks are still the preferred tool to get work done as well as entertain users on trips. 2-in-1 devices are the most versatile devices made for multi-touch and which can also pull their own weight as standalone notebook replacements. Here are some of the best we’ve seen this year. Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base Surface Book is being lauded as the best notebook in the market right now, the new Intel Core i7 version with a Performance Base (which has a full-spec GPU for the heavy lifting), makes it a portable powerhouse ideal for crunching graphics, video editing and even some gaming. While this is a stunning notebook with a high-resolution display (3000 x 2000 with 267 Pixels Per Inch), it can also serve as a detachable clipboard, a drawing tablet, as well as a presentation notebook. All this power comes with excellent battery life (Microsoft says 16 hours, with an i7 processor!) and an abundance of USB 3.0 ports. Microsoft has evolved the Surface line into the gold standard of multi-touch 2-in-1 devices that can deliver performance as well as that elusive coolness factor. Apple Retina MacBook It’s easy to dismiss Apple’s 12-inch Retina MacBook as an odd duck, it only has one USB Type-C port, comes in lavish gold, rose gold, silver and space grey colours and is nearly flat even when closed. This, however, is the future of personal computing and the second revision of Apple’s smallest notebook earns a lot of respect for offering great battery life, adequate performance and a stunning 12-inch Retina Display. Looking at the newer MacBook Pros, the ones with the Touchbar feature, shows the importance of the smaller MacBook which really dictates the design (USB Type-C, Force Touch trackpad, new keyboard, thinner display). The MacBook is my go to notebook for covering events, for traveling while needing to write, make videos, edit photos as well as manage email and blog software. If you’re a macOS devotee and travel a lot, this MacBook is worth considering. ASUS ZenBook 3 For those who prefer Windows but lust after the MacBook’s size and style, the next best thing it the ASUS ZenBook 3. The slightly roomier ASUS ZenBook 3 could pass for the MacBook’s doppelganger, it has very similar tapered wedge design. It also flaunts a single USB Type-C port, which makes the use of third-party dongles, for an added expense, an inescapable reality. ASUS does bundle a mini-dock in the box, which takes away some of the pain of the single port fixation but also makes the ZenBook 3 more useful out of the gate. Windows 10 users who have MacBook envy can now quell that green monster with a similarly portable but seriously more powerful notebook that features even newer processors than what’s on the new MacBook Pros. Pricing of the ASUS ZenBook 3 ranges depending on the specs. The Core i7 model we reviewed (with 512MB SSD and 8GB of RAM) costs CAD $1999. HP Spectre If notebooks had a beauty contest, the HP Spectre would definitely be a finalist. The HP Spectre is simply the most inspired design we’ve seen from HP and is also the most compelling Windows 10 notebook I have had the chance to test this year. Out of the box, the HP Spectre looks and feels like a high-end machine. The thinness and lightness is truly remarkable, it feels more like a Sony VAIO than it does an HP notebook in terms of the level of detail and the materials. The Dark brown carbon fibre and aluminum casing with gold accents is definitely luxurious and the nuanced lattice design on the speaker grilles on the side represent an impressive and cohesive design with other premium HP devices. It is less ostentatious than pure gold or rose gold but is still stylish while communicating a very professional look and feel. Few devices have really pushed the Ultrabook class to such a degree that HP is attempting with the Spectre. not only is it the thinnest notebook you can buy today, it also comes with an Intel Core processors and not the power-strapped core m processors. HP also boasts 9-hour battery life which is remarkable for a device in this class. Apple iPad Pro Apple’s always positioned the iPad as a Post PC device and the heir apparent to personal computing. Larger than the iPhone, yet smaller than a MacBook, the iPad’s evolved thanks to a supportive ecosystem of applications and accessories as well as Apple’s quest to consistently make it thinner, lighter and more powerful. With the iPad Pro, Apple’s actually managed to make their tablet’s performance match that of a PC’s and even surpass some PCs in terms of display quality, 4K video capture and editing right on the device. The new iPad Pro is now also more versatile, the single Lightning port is good for charging and connectivity but a Smart Connector opens up a whole new opportunity for Apple-made and third party accessories that can really push the ‘pro’ functionality out of this latest iPad. People have been trying to turn the iPad into a 2-in-1 device or a notebook, ever since it first came to market. I am one of those persons that’s accompanied each of my iPad purchases with a Bluetooth keyboard case with the hope that I could finally leave laptops behind and embrace the power and portability of my post-PC device. While I love Apple’s notebooks, I can clearly see the future of the iPad evolving and eventually becoming the go-to portable productivity device for some users.

Gabby has personally been a target of repeated online harassment since her history making All-Around gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics as a 16-year-old. Today, she joins Hack Harassment, an initiative launched by Intel, Vox Media, Recode and Lady Gagas Born This Way Foundation, to share her story with millions of people. Gabbys compelling story and firsthand experience with the consequences of online harassment make her a uniquely well-positioned spokesperson for Hack Harassment, says Chris Loo, director of Hack Harassment. We are so thankful to have Gabby as a Change Ambassador and look forward to our work together as we raise awareness of the issue and begin cultivating real solutions to creating a safer and more inclusive online experience for all. Online harassment is pervasive.  According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 40 percent of all internet users report experiencing online harassment. Young people are disproportionately affected, with 70 percent of those ages 18 to 24 reporting that they have experienced harassment online. While the severity of these incidents varies, nearly a third say the experience made them fear for their lives and 15 percent say it affected their reputation. About Hack Harassment: Hack Harassment is a collaborative initiative launched by Intel, Vox Media, Recode and Born This Way Foundation with the goal of promoting safer, more inclusive online experiences by reducing the frequency and prevalence of online harassment. To accomplish this goal, Hack Harassment is working to raise awareness of the issue, foster cross-sector collaboration and cultivate solutions for users. To learn more, visit HackHarassment.com.

Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Chris Griffith Technology reporter Sydney https://plus.google.com/116849779175391500455 @chris_griffith If you think this year was exciting for personal tech, wait for 2017, when technology becomes mind-bogglingly clever as artificial intelligence and machine learning use escalates and the bot revolution takes hold. It’s when the communication between humankind and devices becomes even easier as computers and mobiles gain increasingly accurate natural language skills. It’s a year when virtual and augmented reality use flourishes. Here are six trends in consumer technology for next year. Virtual and augmented reality. This year, virtual reality became accessible to the public with Oculus Rift, HTC and Sony headsets coming to market. Consumers also got a taste of augmented reality through Pokemon Go, which superimposed Pokemon creatures in the real world. More technically capable versions of augmented and mixed reality await us next year. Microsoft Holo­Lens and Intel’s Project Alloy headsets are signs of what is to come. Last week Occipital announced a mixed-reality headset for iPhone, to be available in March. In augmented and mixed-real­ity environments, goods stored in warehouses can appear to be labelled even where no labels physically exist. In gaming, kids can play with cartoon characters in their lounge rooms. In 2017, Microsoft will release its Xbox Scorpio and join the VR gaming revolution. Controllers that let us grip objects in virtual reality will give us control over our individual fingers in VR, not just overall hand control. You even may be able to touch type in virtual reality. We’ll see much better position sensing when walking around virtual environments. Instead of needing several cameras or infra-red light beams to track you, the headset will do the job. There will be more opportuni­ties to share virtual environments with family and friends. We’ve seen early examples of people meeting in the same virtual space, using the service AltSpaceVR. Expect more instances of friends across the world meeting in the same virtual theatre to watch Netflix or a virtual concert together. What will bots be able to do next? Bots. We’re increasingly encountering pop-up windows with an assistant ready to answer questions when we shop online. In the past that person was a human, but increasingly it will be a “bot”. Bots are set to transform online retailing from passive web surfing to the equivalent of being served in a shop. We recently reported Kmart in Australia using a bot called Buddy to help choose a Christmas gift. Erik Hallander from Isobar Australia, which built the Kmart chatbot experience, says it’s just the start. For example, airline bots will guide customers through a complete booking experience. Personal assistants such as Siri, Cortana and Google assistant also will let you talk to bots through them. Microsoft gives the example of a customer blocking time in Dublin on their calendar and Cortana knowing their previous preference for the Westin Hotel there. Cortana then contacts the hotel bot so you can make a booking. The use of bots will explode on platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Skype, Apple iOS and iMessage, Slack and Android next year. The Google Home speaker soon will let you speak to other bots by speaking through it. A computer learns the concept of horror with machine learing and reproduce the concept. Photo: http://nightmare.mit.edu/ Machine learning. The ability of computers to learn by making sense of huge amounts of data is making them incredibly clever. Take a seasonal pest that destroys crops. A computer now can analyse years of daily data, everything from wind speeds and direction, moisture levels, general weather, soil condition and time of year, and work out whether now is a good time to spray. Supercomputers, unbelievable amounts of cheap storage and the accumulation of years of data make such applications possible. Agriculture is an obvious beneficiary, but there’s also population face recognition, and traffic control by machine learning is looming. Recently, a computer trans­formed pictures of buildings into horror movie-like scenes. It has no aesthetic understanding of horror but learned its characteristics computationally by processing vast amounts of image data. Machine learning in sport. Machine learning applied to team sports can collect millions of pieces of data about player and ball positions and, with the right software, look at outcomes and predict more successful gameplay. This year AFL premiers the Western Bulldogs toyed with machine learning and next year intends conducting a hackathon for supporters wanting to build apps to process the data. Machine learning can help manage athletes by collecting data about their performances, physical state and likelihood of injury. This year Manchester City held a hackathon where the winner was an in-game decision-making tool that used player data tracking. The National Basketball Association similarly held a hackathon in New York City in September. Sport is a promising application of machine learning but we’re yet to see whether the application lives up to the hype. A driverless car takes to the road during a test run near Adelaide. Driverless car technology. Self-driving cars won’t be zigzagging everywhere along the world’s highways in 2017. The big insurance issues involving autonomous cars are yet to be sorted out. But we’ll see significant new pilots of driverless cars on public roads. Volvo has been testing driverless cars in Sweden and next year customers will test 100 self-driving cars on Swedish roads. To get around insurance ambiguities, Volvo will pick up the tab for any accidents that take place. We’ll see other pilots around the globe. In Pittsburgh in the US, Uber has been letting customers order self-drive vehicles from its smartphone app but a driver is in the car just in case. Singapore is trialling self-drive taxis. In Australia, Bosch is involved in a trial in Victoria. Google meanwhile is continuing its US driverless car project but its cars require extensive mapping of any new environment they enters. As for Uber, while it has disrupted the taxi industry, its own future is far from certain as it has yet to make a profit. In fact it lost $US1.2 billion in the first half of this year. It may be manufacturers that build their own fleets of hire cars that take the profits, with outright ownership of cars predicted to decline in years ahead. Uber itself sees autonomous cars as the long-term goal and its human driver base a transitory business. Next year we’ll see more autonomous bus systems. We’ll also see wider availability of electric car fast-chargers with the wider rollout of Teslas and other electric vehicles. We’ll hear more, too, about hydrogen-powered vehicles, with Toyota and Hyundai keen to sell them here. Samsung will be out to make up for lost ground after the disaster of exploding batteries with the Galaxy Note7. New phones. We’ll see another round of competition between Apple and Samsung to produce the phone of the year. Next year will be the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, so expect something different. Rumours include an iPhone with a wraparound OLED screen, an all-glass design, no physical home button and wireless charging. Samsung will be out to make up lost ground after the disaster of exploding batteries with its Note7. It is rumoured to be building two designs for Galaxy S8, one with a wraparound screen on the front and back with a bezel-less design. And there are rumours of another phone with a foldable OLED display. The S8 is expected to have Samsung’s digital assistant. While these are exciting advances, a digital landscape of billions of sensors, together with cheap and fast computing and boundless storage puts personal privacy at risk like never before. The Internet of Things looms as a haven for hackers seeking access to your data at home and work. And the potential for artificial intelligence to be adapted to machine warfare needs close monitoring. Then there is the continued disruption to industries and unemployment. We bask in the new and wonderful, but we need to be mindful of its impacts. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

Register for an Exam Today> Yahoo's Big Breach Helps Usher in an Age of Hacker Anxiety By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: DECEMBER 16 2016 Yahoo has become the worst-case example of an unnerving but increasingly common phenomenon -- massive hacks that steal secrets and other potentially revealing information from our personal digital accounts, or from big organizations that hold sensitive data on our behalf. On Wednesday, Yahoo disclosed a gargantuan breach affecting more than a billion user accounts, the largest such attack in history. The company said that attack happened in August 2013, although Yahoo only discovered it recently. Worse, the company's announcement followed a similar announcement last September of a 2014 hack -- one Yahoo ascribed to an unnamed foreign government -- that affected 500 million accounts. Neither Yahoo breach has yet been linked to online fraud or any specific repercussions for Yahoo users. But their disclosure closely follows U.S. intelligence concerns about Russian hacking of Democratic emails during the presidential campaign -- not to mention other recent attacks on a major health insurer, a medical lab-test company and the government office that manages millions of federal employees. "The lesson is clear: no organization is immune to compromise," said Jeff Hill, director of product management for cybersecurity consultant Prevalent. And since most of us are dependent on big organizations that hold our digital lives in their hands, in a broad sense that effectively means no one is safe. Government Attackers Of course, it's not that simple. The most sophisticated break-ins are likely the work of digital burglars working for foreign governments that are mostly interested in manipulating their enemies, not emptying your bank account. In the past few years, hackers tied to foreign governments are believed to have stolen emails to embarrass celebrities and Hollywood moguls (recall the Sony Pictures break-in during 2014) and possibly even to influence the 2016 presidential election. "Espionage has gone digital like so many other things our world," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "We're increasingly seeing data being used as a weapon, where leaked or fabricated information is being used to intentionally damage individuals and governments." Yahoo's security breakdowns could turn into expensive deal breakers for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion -- a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations. Two Hacks, More than a Billion Accounts Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion. Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks. In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected. But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled by a cryptographic technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases. That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password since September.) Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals. That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security. Questions for Verizon News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business. After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the "new development before reaching any final conclusions." Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions. At the very least, the security lapses "definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price," Gartner analyst Avivah Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms. "We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work toward integration with Verizon," the company said. Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Cybercrime is continually growing as more traditional business migrates online, with e-commerce providing an enormous target for criminals looking to siphon off money from unwitting victims across the web. Everything from unsolicited emails to socially engineered and targeted attacks are constantly emerging, with security professionals continually banging the ‘Be safe’ drum. True, not everyone is listening all the time, but the immensity of the problem can no longer be ignored. Ransomware was 2016’s cyberattack of choice, with 2017 gearing up to be no different. Last month, Intel’s McAfee Labs cybersecurity predictions showed 14 trends coming down the line, covering everything from hacktivism to internet of things (IoT) as a risk. Though it was ransomware, as always, that first drew the eye. Expecting an increase in attacks up to the mid-point of next year, an actual fall-off is expected after this, as defence networks catch up, fast. However, over the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, vigilance should remain high. With that, Mark Kellett, CEO of Magnet, walks us through his 10 tips for Christmas ‘cybercare’: Emails: “The biggest threat to you throughout the year will come in the form of emails. The unscrupulous cyber-criminal will try to pull on the Christmas heartstrings, and may use well-known charitable campaigns to try to draw you in. It is important that staff are aware of such emails and that they do not accidentally welcome hungry hackers into the network.” Capabilities: “Staff training is also extremely important so that everyone is aware of what a phishing email can look like. As well as knowing what threats look like, staff should know that they should never share their passwords internally or via email, and passwords should be changed on a regular basis, ideally every 30 days.” Strong passwords: “Longer, more complex passwords will make it harder for criminals to breach your system. Use symbols instead of letters, such as: Rud@€ph or $@nt@C!@u$. If you have a website that provides a portal or information to your customers like orders or invoices, you should ensure that they choose strong passwords to access your website.” Don’t store sensitive customer data: “If you use a payment processor like Stripe or Paypal, customer credit card data is not stored on your website, so that removes one significant headache of data storage. However you will still have customer address data for deliveries, email addresses and perhaps a password to access your website’s order system. It’s crucial that you keep this database of customer details safe and secure, by ensuring your website is on a reputable, secure web hosting company.” Online selling – install verification systems: “All of the credit card gateways commonly used by Irish businesses fit into this secure category, so don’t be tempted by low commission rates elsewhere. Use a familiar, proven name to get your website trading online.” Minister of State Regina Doherty, TD, and Mark Kellett, CEO of Magnet at October’s Cybercrime Awareness Day. Image: Maxwells Set up system alerts for suspicious activity: “Many shopping cart systems have built-in features to monitor events like multiple orders placed by the same person using different credit cards, phone numbers that are from markedly different areas than the billing address, and orders where the recipient name is different than the cardholder name. If you sell online via your own website, learn about your shopping cart system and enable security features that will alert you to suspicious transactions.” Layer your security: “Website security isn’t reliant on a single solution, but on layers of security that keep unwanted visitors at bay. If you’re hosting your own website on a server, install a firewall. If you have a shopping cart, make sure users need to log in with a validated email address, and use CAPTCHA on forms and orders to minimise the number of automated, or ‘bot’, requests made to your website.” Monitor your site regularly. Make sure whoever is hosting it is, too: “You can’t watch your website day and night, so use automated tools and analytics to do the work for you. It’s the equivalent of having security cameras in your shop. Make sure whoever is hosting your website monitors for malware, ransomware, viruses and other harmful software, as well as unwelcome visitors.” Make sure you or whoever is hosting your site has a disaster recovery plan: “You may have a plan if there were a physical break-in, but it’s also necessary to put together a strategy to recover following a security breach.

That way, they will know that the website and their details are encrypted and secure. It is also best to advise your customers not to make purchases over public Wi-Fi as they can be prone to electronic eavesdropping.” Related: privacy, data, cyberattacks, Magnet Gordon Hunt is a journalist at Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Enterprise Europol claims growth of cybercrime “relentless” 29 Sep 201649 Shares Hiring Now Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share Help develop the future of sales and trading Life-changing career opportunities for you Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Enterprise Kaspersky’s ransomware fight gains international support 19 Oct 201612 Shares Enterprise State-sponsored hacking to open floodgates in 2017 27 Oct 201612 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Here are just 100 of them. Image: Rosana Ayza/Shutterstock Our Sci-Tech 100 for 2016 is complete, with 100 Irish people based in countries across the globe drawn together in a celebration of their accomplishments in science, technology and business. In our first edition of the Sci-Tech 100, we were struck by the number of Irish people advancing science and technology around the world. The Irish diaspora is a force to be reckoned with in all sectors and, this year, our focus has shifted entirely to the emigrants who are building Ireland’s global reputation. Though these leaders, influencers and innovators have left our shores, they are helping to put this small country at the top in terms of science and technology. Some on our list are working at the world’s most recognised sci-tech organisations, but the overall picture shows a diverse spread across a variety of sectors and businesses. Many crossed the Atlantic to find success, some flew east, and others kept their talents within the broader European community. As always, our lists are representative, not definitive. There are far more Irish people the world over worthy of attention, and we hope this celebration of their pioneering peers reaches them and honours them too. Check out the complete list below, and click the banners to read more about these remarkable people and their accomplishments.   Click to read more about the people representing Ireland at the world’s biggest names in science and technology.

Define your site main menu Where to Download Unix Free derivatives of Unix can be easily downloaded via the Internet. This sets Unix apart from other proprietary operating systems like Microsoft Windows. The different Unix versions and Unix-like operating systems available for download include FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Red Hat Fedora Linux, Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, and Sun Solaris. Those who are new to Unix or Linux can still try these operating systems by using virtual machines, without worrying about existing data or OS being affected. The user can install his/her preferred Unix version inside the virtual machine to get a separate “computer” running inside the existing OS. These virtual machines can be set up with software such as Sun Microsystems’ VirtualBox, which is available as a free download. Download FreeBSD Unix The FreeBSD operating system is meant to be used on the following architectures: x86 machines, with Pentium or Athlon cores AMD64 compatible machines, which include Athlon 64, Opteron, and EM64T Alpha/AXP IA-64, PC-98 UltraSPARC FreeBSD is an offshoot of BSD, the Unix version that was developed at the University of California, Berkeley. Download FreeBSD Unix Download OpenBSD Unix The OpenBSD project developed the free, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like system. This system has the benefits of portability, standardization, and integrated cryptography. Binary emulation of programs from SVR4 (Solaris), FreeBSD, SunOS, Linux, BSD/OS and HP-UX is possible with OpenBSD Unix. Download OpenBSD Unix Download Solaris Unix The Solaris OS exhibits good scalability, performance, and security on SPARC, Opteron, AMD, and Intel Xeon-based systems. The latest Solaris Unix version used exceptional technologies for facilitating robust computing infrastructures. The Solaris operating system integrates many popular open source applications, including Apache, Tomcat, and Secure Shell. Open source packages are available on this platform, cutting down the time needed for porting. Download Solaris Unix Download Ubuntu Linux Ubuntu is good for laptops, desktops, and servers. It contains all essential programs, from word processors to compilers for various programming languages. Users interested in Ubuntu can download, use, and share Ubuntu with friends or associates free of cost. Download Ubuntu Linux Download Fedora Linux The Fedora Project builds versions of a general purpose operating system made exclusively from free software. Fedora Linux is quite popular among open source software development enthusiasts. Download Fedora Linux Download Debian Linux Debian uses the Linux kernel and many of its basic tools are derived from the GNU project. Debian GNU/Linux has more than 8710 packages and pre-compiled software bundled conveniently for easy installation. Download Debian Linux Download Gentoo Linux Users can quickly and easily customize Gentoo Linux. Among the highlights of the Gentoo Linux experience are easy configurability and good performance. Also, ample developer support is available via the communities. Many users call Gentoo a meta-distribution because of its easy adaptability. Download Gentoo Linux Download Slackware Linux Slackware Linux is a UNIX-like system. It contains an easy to use installation program, extensive online documentation, and a menu driven package system. A complete installation of Slackware provides the X Window System, C/C++ development environments, an ftp server, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, Netscape Communicator, and other key features.

I have an i3 processor laptop with Window 7, 64 bits. Can I download one of the above programs and use it on my laptop. Than you very much Justino AccurateFilms @ Justino Jimenez Yes, Ubuntu is probably the best choice. It is not a “program”, it is an entire operating system, easy to use and free. It can be installed side-by-side with Windows, and it will let you choose between them on startup. Dom Ubuntu is the best 😀 rogue_spider to the noob who started the thread linux is not unix. as stated by all linux. Linux is an operating system that was initially created as a hobby by a young student, Linus Torvalds, at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Linus had an interest in Minix, a small UNIX system, and decided to develop a system that exceeded the Minix standards. He began his work in 1991 when he released version 0.02 and worked steadily until 1994 when version 1.0 of the Linux Kernel was released. The kernel, at the heart of all Linux systems, is developed and released under the GNU General Public License and its source code is freely available to everyone. It is this kernel that forms the base around which a Linux operating system is developed. There are now literally hundreds of companies and organizations and an equal number of individuals that have released their own versions of operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Daniel Memenode You’re right rogue_spider, of course, though the article does at least mention FreeBSD and OpenBSD which really are UNIX. Also, Linux is an UNIX derivative even if it’s not UNIX itself, and people looking for the UNIX experience will likely find going with Linux the easiest. Kannan, try Cygwin. Baljit Singh I have XP Pro sp3 with an old 32bit tower PC. I want to download the closest easiset most useful version of UNIX for someone(me) who is also interested in learning the Visual C++/ C#/ Basic languages. I know BASIC from my teens. Ok with MS DOS. V.good with XP Pro & MS Server Technologies & Cisco Routing/Switching. Will.Spencer Originally posted by Baljit Singh: “I want to download the closest easiset most useful version of UNIX for someone(me) who is also interested in learning the Visual C++/ C#/ Basic languages.” I’d say that Ubuntu is the easiest most useful desktop Linux distribution at this time, with Fedora running a close second. However, Visual C++ is a Microsoft product and will not run under Unix. You can run it if you install Windows in a virtual machine solution such as VirtualBox. savitha hi, i want unix os inside my windows xp os…. can u pls guide me to download unix os through BSD… i couldnt understand when i followed above instructions Daniel Memenode Originally posted by savitha: “hi, i want unix os inside my windows xp os…. can u pls guide me to download unix os through BSD… i couldnt understand when i followed above instructions” You can download FreeBSD here. It’s probably best to choose amd64 or i386, click on ISO, and in the list that follows choose the file that ends with disc1.iso. Once it downloads you can run it in virtualbox. You can download Virtualbox for Windows here. Once you install and run it click on New, then Continue, give it a name like “BSD” and under “Operating System” choose BSD. Under version leave it at “FreeBSD” or if you downloaded amd64 version just select “FreeBSD (64 bit)” and click continue. On the next step chose the amount of memory you wish to assign to running FreeBSD. If you have 2GB of memory or more assigning about 512MB is probably gonna be good. Otherwise at least 128MB should do. Next step is to create a virtual Boot Hard Disk. Just leave as is and press continue twice. In the next screen set “Dynamically expanding storage” so that the virtual disk will take only so much space on your real hard drive as virtualized FreeBSD requires. Just click continue and done till the dialog disappears. Now you just need to add the downloaded FreeBSD iso file so it is booted when you start this virtual machine. To do that, select the virtual machine (BSD), click settings, and in the window that appears click on Storage in the toolbar. In the Storage Tree to the left click “Empty” and on the right under “CD/DVD Device” click on the folder icon with a green up arrow. This will bring up a Virtual Media Manager window. In it, click Add and navigate to your downloaded iso file, select and open it. Select that in the Virtual Media Manager window and click “Select” to choose it. Now you can exit the settings window and press the “Start” button in the toolbar to start the virtual machine. It will boot up the installation process of FreeBSD onto your virtual hard drive. If you’re completely new to UNIX however I would suggest you download and try Ubuntu instead. Just replace BSD and FreeBSD above with Ubuntu, and as an OS instead of BSD select Linux. savitha @mememode thanks for the reply… i have successfully done with that, as per ur instructions . i need this to work on with unix for one of my subjects in my academics. one more question, to work on commands of unix every time should i have to “start” virtual machine? i mean ,how to work with this? Daniel Memenode Originally posted by savitha: “@mememode thanks for the reply… i have successfully done with that, as per ur instructions . i need this to work on with unix for one of my subjects in my academics. one more question, to work on commands of unix every time should i have to “start” virtual machine? i mean ,how to work with this?” Yes, starting it is like turning on a virtual computer which is running UNIX. It isn’t installed anywhere else in Windows, that is, it makes no changes to Windows. Everything is inside that virtual machine. So basically, when you want to work with it, run Virtualbox, click on your virtual machine (BSD or Ubuntu, whichever you installed), click start in the toolbar and wait for it to boot. Once it boots you should be able to start a terminal where you can run the commands, if the OS is installed. The program should be called either a gnome-terminal or konsole, but it might be in the menus as just “Terminal”. If you haven’t installed the OS yet to your virtual machine (just ran it) here’s a video tutorial for BSD and one for latest Ubuntu (really easy). This is the process that starts when you boot the downloaded .iso in your virtual machine. savitha @memenode what is vm workstation is all about? my instructor showed me to run unix using vm workstation but it is not freeware… can u kindly help me. Daniel Memenode Originally posted by savitha: “@memenode what is vm workstation is all about? my instructor showed me to run unix using vm workstation but it is not freeware… can u kindly help me.” That’s vmware workstation. Vmware is the most popular software for virtualization. You can apply to get a free VMWare Player in which I think you can run other OSs, but I still think Virtualbox (which is what I was describing above) is the simplest solution. It’s free and it doesn’t require registration. Both serve pretty much the same purpose though. You can mention Virtualbox (from Virtualbox.org) to your instructor. He may be familiar with it or otherwise he may find it useful too. savitha @memenode ,i have installed the virtual box as per the first response . i have encountered the problem as i run the uploaded freebsd software its starts the installation process as it proceeds at terminal it shows list of commands and displays [ok] , what should i have to do at this stage? how do i complete the installation? Daniel Memenode Originally posted by savitha: “@memenode ,i have installed the virtual box as per the first response . i have encountered the problem as i run the uploaded freebsd software its starts the installation process as it proceeds at terminal it shows list of commands and displays [ok] , what should i have to do at this stage? how do i complete the installation?” Have you tried the FreeBSD Install Tutorial? I never actually installed FreeBSD myself, though I installed a bunch of Linux operating systems over the years. If it’s a more advanced issue someone more experience with FreeBSD specifically should be more helpful. Otherwise you can try Linux, even Ubuntu would do fine if all you need is a bash prompt for UNIX commands. Alternatively, you can try PC-BSD, a user friendly variant of FreeBSD. 🙂 Sawb Hello i’m about to work as a system admin and i’d like to practice in Unix/Linux enviroment,so i’d like some opinions on which version should i download?Or does anyone know what versions companies use? savitha thanks Daniel Memenode, thanks for all your reply’s. Daniel Memenode Originally posted by Sawb: “Hello i’m about to work as a system admin and i’d like to practice in Unix/Linux enviroment,so i’d like some opinions on which version should i download?Or does anyone know what versions companies use?” In the corporate world it’s mostly RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or otherwise SuSE Linux Enterprise Edition (SLED). Elsewhere Debian and its derivative Ubuntu Server is used often. I think if it’s a relatively big company they might go for RHEL for the beefy support service they get, though Canonical entered that field lately with Ubuntu which some medium companies might prefer.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Dec 16, 2016 at 9:16AM Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump don't exactly see eye to eye. The two clash strongly in one particular area: global warming. Trump has openly disagreed with global warming and Musk has embarked on an ambitious vision to help put an end to it. The election of Trump to president, therefore, has prompted some uncertainty surrounding how the presidency will impact Tesla, which aims to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by building and selling electric cars, energy storage, and solar products. Elon Musk. Image source: Tesla Motors. But Musk may have been encouraged recently when he was invited to President-elect Donald Trump's Tech Summit in New York City at Trump Tower. Musk goes to Trump Tower The invitations for Trump's Tech Summit went out earlier this month to executives of major tech companies. Beyond Musk, attendees of the event this week included prominent names like Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, and Intel's Brian Krzanich. With less than a dozen tech leaders attending, invitations were scant, limited only to the tech elite. "I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting," said Trump in his opening remarks. Based on the sentiment expressed by Trump in the short portion of the meeting made public, the future President said he wanted to help things go smoothly for the companies represented. I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well. ... we want you to keep going with the incredible innovation. There's nobody like you in the world. ... And, anything we can do to help this go along, and we're going to be there for you. You'll call my people. You'll call me, it doesn't make any difference. We have no formal chain of command around here. We're going to do fair trade deals, we're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade. As Electrek pointed out, Musk's inclusion in the tech summit meeting is particularly notable considering the visionary entrepreneur is the only one leading a company with a market capitalization below $150 billion. Tesla is currently valued at about $32 billion, and Musk's privately held SpaceX's recent funding valued the company at about $15 billion. So Musk is arguably lucky to be able to represent his companies. And Musk apparently received some special attention. Notably, Trump's transition team's communication director Jason Miller said Apple's Cook and Musk were going to stick around after the tech summit event for a private meeting with Trump, according to AppleInsider.  Musk has also been honored with a spot on Trump's Strategic and Policy forum. A press release about the forum says it includes "some of America's most highly respected and successful business leaders" who "will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda." Musk, as well as Uber's Travis Kalanick and Pepsi's Indra Nooyi were added to the forum a few weeks after the Trump administration announced 16 other names, including influential business leaders like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Walt Disney's Bob Iger. What Musk and Trump have in common If the only remarks from Musk during the meeting at Trump Tower were any indication of the foot the CEO plans to put forward with the president, Musk seems like he wants to emphasize Tesla's vision for manufacturing job growth in the U.S. -- an area Trump has said he will focus on. Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. Image source: The Motley Fool. "Building rockets and cars and solar stuff in the U.S. -- actually really excited about expanding our manufacturing footprint in the U.S.," Musk said when he introduced himself at the meeting. Tesla alone has created about 30,000 jobs, most of which are in the U.S. and are manufacturing related. And Tesla also recently announced an expansion to its car factory in Fremont, California, and said it plans to add another 3,000 jobs there. Going further, the company plans to eventually employ about 9,000 people at its under-construction battery factory in Nevada and 1,000 people at its solar-panel factory in Buffalo, New York. Further, Tesla has inspired auto, defense, and solar companies all over the world to step up their games.  With Trump clearly willing to give Musk his ear, and considering Musk's important role in U.S. manufacturing job creation, Musk's companies are off to a good start with the president-elect.

Gen. Michael Flynn (AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke, File) Friday, 16 Dec 2016 07:00 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Donald Trump's selection of Michael Flynn as national security adviser caused concern last month when it was revealed that Flynn represented a business with ties to the Turkish government while getting classified briefings during the campaign. He promised to sever those ties before Inauguration Day. But Flynn has other potential conflicts. Just last week, he was re-elected to a paid position on the board of a surveillance drone company with Department of Defense contracts, federal filings show. And while taking part in the classified briefings for Trump last August, he revamped his consulting company — Flynn Intel Group, or FIG — by adding one senior executive whose firm does extensive cybersecurity work for government agencies and another who was soliciting defense department aviation contracts. Public records, government contracts, and documents posted online by Flynn and his partners show that they have vied in recent months for federal contracts to supply overseas military bases, fly diplomats in and out of conflict zones and provide cybersecurity and technology for defense and intelligence agencies. Flynn's recent moves at FIG — as well as his partnerships with companies and private-equity executives who have military and intelligence contracts — could conflict sharply with his government role. Ethics experts say that as the president's top military-security aide, he will handle classified information on a daily basis and help lead the country's military, diplomatic and intelligence response around the globe. Visits to two of Flynn's offices in Virginia suggest they are reducing their activities: One was empty and being repainted. But neither Flynn, his partners, nor the Trump transition team responded to repeated questions during the past week about how he plans to comply with federal ethics rules that forbid executive-branch employees from having a financial interest in companies that do business with the agencies they lead. The transition team also hasn't provided information about Flynn's business dealings in response to congressional requests. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who sits on the House Oversight Committee, wrote to Vice President-elect Mike Pence last month asking for details of Flynn's business ties and steps he intends to take to avoid a conflict. A Cummings aide said none have been provided. On Dec. 14, two Democratic senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, sent a letter to the nation's top intelligence officials arguing that Flynn's ongoing ownership of his consulting company "creates the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents." The letter said FIG is now run by Flynn's son, Michael Flynn, Jr., who was removed from the Trump transition team earlier this month after spreading false internet conspiracies that led to a shooting at a Washington pizzeria. Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general who was fired from his post as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Barack Obama in 2014. His nomination as Trump's national security adviser offers him a key White House role requiring no Senate confirmation. He has been widely scrutinized for his brashness in the two years since leaving the military. He made a paid speech for RT, a news agency run by the Russian government, sat at a table with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a 2015 dinner celebrating RT's anniversary, shared internet conspiracies on social media and last February tweeted that "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL." But little has been publicly disclosed about the path Flynn has forged in the business world. Like many retired officers, he leveraged expertise he developed in the service into a private-sector career. Rather than join a big defense company, however, he set up his own. "I didn't walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrop Grumman or Booz Allen [Hamilton] or some of these other big companies [like] Raytheon," he told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. "I'm very independent, and it's very liberating actually." He added, "I'm not going to be a general that just fades away." In 2014, he founded his company with Bijan Kian, a prominent Iranian-American banker who served on the board of the Export–Import Bank, was a senior fellow at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, and a member of the White House Business Council. Federal ethics rules say that executive-branch employees who are in partnerships must avoid potential conflicts with businesses owned by fellow partners. Kian is a principal at Global Capital Markets, a mergers-and-acquisitions firm that has brokered deals involving an assortment of military contractors, and chairman and chief executive officer of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology company that sells secure communications chips and computers designed for military and intelligence agencies. Kian didn't respond to numerous attempts to reach him. FIG positioned itself as an elite operation with the state-of-the-art skills to protect global businesses and government agencies. Flynn hired a handful of cybersecurity experts who worked under him in the Defense Intelligence Agency and other military posts. Much of their business centered around providing training and information-technology design advice to corporate executives concerned with protecting their companies from hacks. By late 2015, Flynn had raised his public profile through an assortment of speeches and media appearances critical of the Obama administration's anti-terror strategy, and he started advising several Republican presidential candidates. He also began to expand his own circle of business associations and his company's portfolio. Win Contracts FIG brought in Phil Oakley, who ran Quaestor Federal Consulting, a contractor that provides training and advice to military and intelligence operations. FIG was hired by Levyx, a data-storage startup, which announced that the partnership was intended to help it win government and defense contracts. Flynn also joined the advisory board of Patriot Defense Group, the military-contracting subsidiary of Patriot Capital LLC. In May 2016, Flynn took a paid position on the board of a company that makes surveillance drones, which grew out of a business that President-elect Trump's son, Donald Trump. Jr., represented until 2014. As a board member of Drone Aviation Inc., he has been paid $3,000 per month and also received 100,000 shares of restricted stock, now valued at more than $275,000, which will become fully vested next spring. Flynn continued to hold his seat after he began receiving classified intelligence briefings on Aug. 17. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and federal-contract databases show the company was awarded one Department of Defense contract in late August and two more in October. Ownership Stake FIG worked as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a Dutch company with close ties to Turkish President Recep Erdogan. When that arrangement was reported last month by The Daily Caller, Flynn responded by having FIG leave the field of lobbying and said he would "sever ties" with his company. But it isn't clear whether he will retain an ownership stake. Because Flynn is a partner in the closely held business, and his son Michael is its chief of staff, he and his family would stand to gain financially from any business it does with the government. He also was re-elected to his paid position on the board of Drone Aviation on Dec. 6, according to SEC filings. Ethicists urge Flynn to end such arrangements and sell his company. Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, said even severing ties isn't enough. People in such positions "still know the company and how its business works, so they would know how a policy decision would affect it," he said. "The only way to avoid that is for them to sell their interest and make a totally clean break." © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

(Credit: Picasa) The Microsoft Surface line of convertible tablet PCs has created an entirely new consumer technology product line. So much so that even Apple was forced to roll out an imitation in the form of the iPad Pro. Microsoft’s accomplishment took time, however. That was partly because the first two Surface tablets ran a stripped-down version of Microsoft’s operating system called Windows RT that was designed for improved battery life. It couldn’t run most PC applications, however, because they were powered by a different microprocessor that wasn’t compatible with the Intel CPUs that have been the brains behind PCs for decades. Windows RT was a sales flop and Microsoft’s manufacturing partners ditched it after a single hardware generation. Four years later, the software giant is trying its hand at ARM processors a for a second time, with the help of mobile chip manufacturer Qualcomm. This time around, Microsoft seems to have learned from its error. The software maker announced this month that the new laptops and tablets powered by Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 835 processor, set to be released in mid-2017, will be able to run pretty much every regular Windows program while also sporting much better battery life and portability. The compatibility comes thanks to an emulation software layer Microsoft has developed that translates Intel instructions into ones that will work with the Snapdragon’s ARM code. The company has released several videos demonstrating the feature. They’re not particularly flashy, because they essentially show what looks just like a regular Windows session, including one running the full version of Adobe Photoshop: The Windows return to ARM is a move of necessity for Microsoft after Intel announced earlier this year that it was essentially exiting the market for smartphones and tablets by canceling its Atom processor line. The company had struggled for years to reduce CPU power usage, and had difficulty attracting tablet and smartphone manufacturers to purchase its CPUs. The Microsoft partnership with Qualcomm is noteworthy because the CPU manufacturer is by far the most popular maker of processors for smartphones with nearly a 50 percent share in a very crowded market. Locked in a fierce struggle with Apple and Google for the mobile market, Microsoft can’t afford to wait for Intel to get its act together, especially since laptop and tablet sales are declining and its Windows Mobile smartphone OS has struggled to gain traction. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor for which Microsoft developed the full Windows compatibility layer is designed to run both tablets and smartphones. That could come in handy for the software giant, since Microsoft has already released a feature it calls Continuum, which allows consumers to connect a Windows smartphone to a desktop mouse and keyboard for full productivity. The feature also works on specialized laptops that are essentially a trackpad, keyboard and display. The hitch for people interested in Continuum is that so far, it isn’t compatible with most Windows desktop software, severely limiting what could be an otherwise useful option. Microsoft hasn’t officially announced the Intel compatibility layer for phones, but executive vice president Terry Myerson told ZDNet, “We’re not drawing a sharp distinction between phone and desktop” in terms of which version of its Windows software manufacturers can use. At present, the company does not charge any licensing fee for mobile hardware that ships with a screen size of less than nine inches. If Microsoft can get Continuum working and fully integrated with the existing desktop Windows software catalog, that offers a chance for the company to close the “app gap” that’s plagued Windows Phone from its release in 2010. Last year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hinted that convertibles were the company’s future. That vision now is starting to become clear for everyone else. But has Microsoft simply taken too long to get there? Will tech consumers and businesses care? We’ll find out next year. More Matthew Sheffield. Comments Loading Comments...

He made a paid speech for RT, a news agency run by the Russian government, sat at a table with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a 2015 dinner celebrating RT’s anniversary, shared internet conspiracies on social media and last February tweeted that “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” Leveraged Experience But little has been publicly disclosed about the path Flynn has forged in the business world. Like many retired officers, he leveraged expertise he developed in the service into a private-sector career. Rather than join a big defense company, however, he set up his own. “I didn’t walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrop Grumman or Booz Allen [Hamilton] or some of these other big companies [like] Raytheon,” he told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. “I’m very independent, and it’s very liberating actually.” He added, “I’m not going to be a general that just fades away.” In 2014, he founded his company with Bijan Kian, a prominent Iranian-American banker who served on the board of the Export–Import Bank, was a senior fellow at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and a member of the White House Business Council. Federal ethics rules say that executive-branch employees who are in partnerships must avoid potential conflicts with businesses owned by fellow partners. Kian is a principal at Global Capital Markets, a mergers-and-acquisitions firm that has brokered deals involving an assortment of military contractors, and chairman and chief executive officer of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology company that sells secure communications chips and computers designed for military and intelligence agencies. Kian didn’t respond to numerous attempts to reach him. Cybersecurity Experts FIG positioned itself as an elite operation with the state-of-the-art skills to protect global businesses and government agencies. Flynn hired a handful of cybersecurity experts who worked under him in the Defense Intelligence Agency and other military posts. Much of their business centered around providing training and information-technology design advice to corporate executives concerned with protecting their companies from hacks. By late 2015, Flynn had raised his public profile through an assortment of speeches and media appearances critical of the Obama administration’s anti-terror strategy, and he started advising several Republican presidential candidates. He also began to expand his own circle of business associations and his company’s portfolio. Win Contracts FIG brought in Phil Oakley, who ran Quaestor Federal Consulting, a contractor that provides training and advice to military and intelligence operations. FIG was hired by Levyx, a data-storage startup, which announced that the partnership was intended to help it win government and defense contracts. Flynn also joined the advisory board of Patriot Defense Group, the military-contracting subsidiary of Patriot Capital LLC. In May 2016, Flynn took a paid position on the board of a company that makes surveillance drones, which grew out of a business that President-elect Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., represented until 2014. As a board member of Drone Aviation Inc., he has been paid $3,000 per month and also received 100,000 shares of restricted stock, now valued at more than $275,000, which will become fully vested next spring. Flynn continued to hold his seat after he began receiving classified intelligence briefings on August 17. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and federal-contract databases show the company was awarded one Department of Defense contract in late August and two more in October.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter FIG worked as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a Dutch company with close ties to Turkish President Recep Erdogan. When that arrangement was reported last month by The Daily Caller, Flynn responded by having FIG leave the field of lobbying and said he would “sever ties” with his company. But it isn’t clear whether he will retain an ownership stake. Because Flynn is a partner in the closely held business, and his son Michael is its chief of staff, he and his family would stand to gain financially from any business it does with the government. He also was re-elected to his paid position on the board of Drone Aviation on December 6th, according to SEC filings. Ethicists urge Flynn to end such arrangements and sell his company. Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, said even severing ties isn’t enough. People in such positions “still know the company and how its business works, so they would know how a policy decision would affect it,” he said. “The only way to avoid that is for them to sell their interest and make a totally clean break.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The addition of Musk and two other notable business personalities was announced Wednesday by Trump's transition team, shortly before a meeting between the President-elect and several Silicon Valley executives, including Musk. The group Musk was named to is called the "President's Strategic and Policy Forum," and is scheduled to meet for the first time in early February. DON'T MISS: Tesla CEO Musk, other Silicon Valley execs, to meet Trump Wednesday Members "will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge," a statement from Trump's transition team said. The forum will be chaired by Stephen A. Schwarzman, CEO and co-founder of private-equity firm Blackstone. When the forum was announced December 2, General Motors CEO Mary Barra was named to it, along with the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Wal-Mart, and Disney, as well as a former CEO of Boeing.

That same day, Musk was among a group of tech executives that met with the President-elect in New York City. As well as Musk, the CEOs of Alphabet (formerly Google), Amazon, Apple, Cisco, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Oracle, and the chief operating officer of Facebook, were also in attendance.

Topics discussed reportedly included vocational education, trade with China, immigration, and a request by Trump that the executive find ways to use data analysis to eliminate government waste. The meeting with "more than a dozen of the greatest tech leaders in the country," the transition team said in a statement, was to "begin a conversation and partnership in order to spark innovation and create more jobs in the U.S., particularly for working Americans."

With the exception of noted Libertarian venture capitalist Peter Thiel, most technology executives did not back Trump in his successful quest for the presidency. During his campaign, Trump also chided Apple for manufacturing products in China. MORE: Trump's EPA head Pruitt: climate-science denier who sued the EPA many times Virtually all of the executives summoned for the Wednesday meeting accept the scientific consensus that human activity has contributed to climate change. This would seem to put them at odds with several of Trump's campaign promises, and recent cabinet nominations. During the campaign, pledged to unlock and deregulate exploration for fossil fuels, assist in the construction of new oil refineries, and "bring back coal," among other promises. Coal, by Flicker user oatsy40 (Used Under CC License)Enlarge Photo Trump has named Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, which Pruitt repeatedly sued to prevent it from enforcing its regulations. Rick Perry, his pick to lead the Department of Energy, is a fossil-fuel supporter who once vowed to eliminate that agency. Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, is Trump's nominee for secretary of state. All three question the scientific validity of climate change, while Pruitt and Perry have explicitly fought against the agencies they are being tapped to lead.

The entrance of the Christmas Market in Ludwigshafen, Germany. Uwe Anspach / EPA The explosive device was found near the Town Hall in Ludwigshafen earlier this month. Hubert Stroeber, a spokesman for the local prosecutor's office, told NBC News that it would "turn down an investigation in the case" due to the fact the boy is aged under 14. However, Stroeber confirmed that Germany's Federal Prosecutor had been informed about the incident. The suspect was born in Germany but is of Iraqi heritage. Local officials said they had found a black bag in a waste container on Dec. 5, according to a police report. Investigators said that the material found in the glass container was believed to be "pyrotechnical material that is used in fireworks." A map showing Ludwigshafen, Germany. Google Maps Germany's FOCUS magazine reported that a controlled explosion was carried out after the device was spotted by a member of the public. It added that the boy had tried to detonate explosives at the Ludwigshafen Christmas market on Nov. 26. "A backpack included a glass container with a drilled hole, through which a wire was pulled. It was filled with explosive powder … and prepared with nails," the magazine reported. Related: Kids Will 'Torture and Kill' for ISIS, German Intel Chief Warns It is not clear at this stage whether this was a separate device to the one found nine days later. FOCUS quoted investigators as saying the "strongly radicalized" youth was likely "incited and instructed" by an "unidentified member of ISIS." He also had hoped to travel to Iraq to join ISIS last summer, it reported. Due to the country's laws regarding the age of criminal responsibility, the 12-year-old was not arrested but instead reportedly taken into foster care. German security officials confirmed to NBC News' partner ZDF that the details reported by FOCUS were correct. Authorities also told ZDF that the boy had been radicalized via social media and the Internet.

The incident follows warnings that teenagers are being turned into "weapons" by ISIS. The head of the Germany's domestic intelligence service told NBC News in May that children aged as young as 13 who had left for ISIS territory or who were "prepared to stage attacks" had been identified. "When you know how ISIS treats children ... then you have to assume that you are dealing with people who are willing to unconditionally torture and kill for ISIS," said Hans-Georg Maassen, who is in charge of Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV). Last month, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to exercise caution at holiday festivals, events and outdoor markets in Europe due to credible terrorist threats.

Editor's note: Through a sponsorship by Fujitsu, Cadalyst editors bring you this feature, part of a special series of articles designed to educate CAD users and managers about the benefits of professional workstation technology. When it comes to the size and shape of deskbound workstations, the workstation industry hasn't given professional users much to choose from. Buyers could pick either a full-size tower or a mini-tower, and either way had to clear out some space beneath or beside their desks. Those who sought workstation performance but were constrained by tight space limits had only two choices: Bite the bullet and deal with a machine more cumbersome than desired, or perhaps step down to a laptop and sacrifice the benefits of a deskside machine, like the ability to configure and expand with the widest range of options available. Workstation users needed another option — and now they have it, in the small–form factor (SFF) workstation, which offers a dramatically smaller footprint than a traditional tower. Sales of SFF workstations have very quickly gone from essentially zero to nearly a quarter of all deskbound workstations shipped, according to Jon Peddie Research. For many professionals, the SFF machine's more compact footprint, as well as reduced heat and noise profile, win out. These advantages have particular appeal in financial markets and space-constrained offices in urban areas, but you will find customers eager to downsize in virtually every workstation application. Shrinking Size, Not Performance With its CELSIUS J550, Fujitsu has taken the SFF workstation to new levels of performance and ergonomics. At approximately 10 liters in volume, the CELSIUS J550 is one-third the size of a typical mini-tower — it fits in tight environments where a conventional workstation can't. Its weight is also small: a nominal 19.8 lbs that makes moving, configuring, and installing the machine far less taxing. The CELSIUS J550 SFF (left) is one-third the size of the W550 micro-tower. Of course, a desirable package means nothing if what's inside can't deliver the application-focused performance workstation users expect. Highly configurable, the CELSIUS J550 offers best-in-class workstation-caliber components, starting with quad-core Xeon E3-1200 v5 and Core i7-6000 series processors (to 3.7 GHz) from Intel. Supporting that CPU horsepower is up to 64 GB of high-speed DDR4 memory, and storage capacity of up to 13.5 TB. In addition to ample capacity, the CELSIUS J550 offers the ultimate in storage performance with NVMe-compliant solid-state drives (SSDs), including M.2 options that leave precious PCI Express card slots free. The highest-performing 3D graphics in its class. Deeply rooted in the genes of any true workstation is professional-caliber 3D graphics, performance-tuned to applications from CAD to media and entertainment to education and finance. And true to that DNA, the CELSIUS J550 offers a range of AMD FirePro and NVIDIA Quadro GPU options, up to the FirePro W5100 and Quadro M2000. You won't find another SFF workstation offering a GPU with the performance of the Quadro M2000 GPU (or comparable), and for good reason: Among leading workstation manufacturers, the CELSIUS J550 is the only workstation in its class to provide the full-height PCI Express slots that a GPU like the Quadro M2000 requires. Reliability in a Cool, Quiet Package Designing a capable workstation configuration with a footprint like the CELSIUS J550's is no trivial feat. The obvious challenge is finding the room to fit a system's worth of workstation-caliber components into 66% less volume than comparable machines. But beyond the practical issues of limited space, there are the thorny challenges of managing system heat and noise. Packing the same performance-driven components into a smaller volume places a far higher burden on the machine's ability to dissipate the heat those components generate. The workstation can't be allowed to run too hot, as excessive heat stresses components and is the root cause of most hardware failures. And if a system builder were to simply brute-force the cooling by maxing out system fans, then you'd end up with a machine so noisy, nobody would want go near it. Fujitsu tackled this challenge with precise whole-system thermal and acoustic analysis, thoroughly considering the effects of the chassis's internal layout and system fan speed and location on thermal footprint, airflow, and noise. Components, including the highly efficient 280-watt power supply, were selected and combined to reduce thermal output wherever possible. The result? Designers mitigated potential hot spots and maximized air-cooling efficiency, retaining a compelling balance of performance and power consumption. Even better, Fujitsu engineers were able to limit the J550's noise to 21 db — comparable to a whisper or rustling leaves. The SFF Workstation Done Right Given a choice between a bigger office workstation and a smaller one, if all else is equal, few would ever choose the former. But all else is not equal. Engineering workstation-caliber performance and reliability into a small–form factor chassis is a far more daunting challenge than it is with a conventional tower or mini-tower. Do it wrong, and you're left with a hot, noisy machine that can't deliver on the demanding expectations of a workstation. Do it right, and you end up with the CELSIUS J550 — a precision-crafted workstation, designed and engineered exclusively in Germany, and built in Europe's most advanced computer manufacturing facility. Fujitsu's holistic approach to precision design results in a small–form factor machine that offers everything one expects in a workstation: mission-critical Intel Xeon processors, ample high-speed memory, and extreme-performance storage, topped off with best-in-class graphics capability. The CELSIUS J550's diminutive 10-liter chassis brings a true workstation into places it literally couldn't fit before. And it does so in a cool, reliable package that's so quiet, users probably won't even notice it's on. Workstation users without a lot of room to spare owe it to themselves to consider Fujitsu's CELSIUS J550 — it's the small–form factor workstation done right.

December 16, 2016 -- IC Insights has just released its new Global Wafer Capacity 2017-2021—Detailed Analysis and Forecast of the IC Industry’s Wafer Fab Capacity report. Shown below is a brief excerpt from that report. Prior to 2008, the 200mm wafer was used in more cases for manufacturing ICs than any other wafer size. However, since 2008, the majority of IC fabrication has taken place on 300mm wafers. Rankings of IC manufacturers by installed capacity for each of the wafer sizes are shown in Figure 1. The chart also compares in a relative manner the amounts of capacity held by the top 10 leaders. Figure 1 Looking at the ranking for 300mm wafers, it is not surprising that the list includes only DRAM and NAND flash memory suppliers like Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix, and Toshiba/Western Digital; the world’s five largest pure-play foundries TSMC, GlobalFoundries, UMC, Powerchip, and SMIC; and Intel, the industry’s biggest IC manufacturer (in terms of revenue). These companies offer the types of ICs that benefit most from using the largest wafer size available to best amortize the manufacturing cost per die, and have the means to continue investing large sums of money in new and improved 300mm fab capacity. The leaders in the 200mm size category consist of pure-play foundries and manufacturers of analog/mixed-signal ICs and microcontrollers. The ranking for the smaller wafer sizes (i.e., ≤150mm) includes a more diversified group of companies. STMicroelectronics has a huge amount of 150mm wafer capacity at its fab site in Singapore, but the company has been busy converting this production to 200mm wafers. Another STMicroelectronics 150mm fab in Catania, Italy, is also undergoing a conversion to 200mm wafers, with plans for that project to be completed in 2017. A significant trend regarding the industry’s IC manufacturing base, and a challenging one from the perspective of companies that supply equipment and materials to chip makers, is that as the industry moves IC fabrication onto larger wafers in bigger fabs, the group of IC manufacturers continues to shrink in number (Figure 2). Today, there are less than half the number of companies that own and operate 300mm wafer fabs than 200mm fabs. Moreover, the distribution of worldwide 300mm wafer capacity among those manufacturers is becoming increasingly top-heavy. Figure 2 Report Details: Global Wafer Capacity 2017-2021 IC Insights’ new Global Wafer Capacity 2017-2021—Detailed Analysis and Forecast of the IC Industry’s Wafer Fab Capacity report assesses the IC industry’s capacity by wafer size, minimum process geometry, technology type, geographic region, and device type through 2021. The report includes detailed profiles of the companies with the greatest fab capacity and gives comprehensive specifications on existing wafer fab facilities. Global Wafer Capacity 2017-2021 is priced at $4,290 for an individual user license. A multi-user worldwide corporate license is available for $6,990.     Contact IC Insights, Inc.

Prominent attendees included the leaders of Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, Tesla, as well as Trump family members and other administration appointees. There was speculation prior to the meeting as to what the tone would be given most of Silicon Valley openly supported Hillary Clinton. The lone voice on the other side of the isle was Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal. The meeting comes just one day after hundreds of tech workers pledged never to help build Trump's proposed Muslim Database. Trump had also been a vocal opponent of many of the attendees during his campaign. He described Jeff Bezos's purchase of the Washington Post as a conflict of interest, among other things. While Silicon Valley may have frowned at his election, the meeting was all business. The previous tension of the election was forgotten at the door with the meeting holding a lighthearted and respectful tone. Trump told the 13 executives he was there to help them do well and make it easier to trade across borders. Other topics included infrastructure, tax cuts, Chinese competition, repatriation of foreign assets, and various US laws surrounding the global tech market. The technology industry under the Obama administration saw record growth. Trump hopes to continue this trend with more rigorous policies on trade and jobs. Net neutrality was reportedly not discussed and continues to be in question as the two administrations have very different stances on the issue. Overall the summit was widely viewed as productive by the various executives. Innovation and global trade look to be the key pillars of Trump's administration going forward.

Initial services, free to users worldwide, are available only on smartphones and navigation units fitted with Galileo-compatible microchips. Some devices may need only a software update to start using the service, according to the European Commission, which funds the 10 billion euro project. "After years of intense work, we are ready to declare the initial services of Galileo," EU Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska announced in Brussels. "We are joining the closed club of providers of navigation services." With 18 satellites in place so far, Galileo's signal will be intermittent at first, requiring a boost from satellites in the American GPS system.   But it will grow more reliable and independent over time as orbiters are added to the network circling 23,222 kilometres above Earth. Its proud parents, the commission and European Space Agency, said Galileo should be fully operational by 2020, providing time and positioning data of unprecedented accuracy. More videos can be found on our video page People have become increasingly reliant on geo-localisation for anything from finding bars, pharmacies or the shortest holiday route to tracing parked cars or lost Alzheimer's patients. Ultimately, Galileo's free Open Service will be able to pinpoint a location to within a metre (just over three feet), compared to several metres for GPS and Russia's GLONASS. A paying service will provide even more precise data, to within centimetres. Strategic priority Such precision would  be invaluable for safer driverless cars and nuclear power plants, for example. "When fully operational, Galileo's Search and Rescue service will reduce the time it takes to detect a person lost at sea or in the mountains from three hours to just 10 minutes after a distress beacon is activated," the Galileo website says. Its signal will eventually reach areas where none is possible today -- inside traffic tunnels and on streets where high buildings shield radio waves from satellites flying low on the horizon.

Photo: AFP For now, free use is only for owners of two Galileo-compatible cellphones (BQ's Aquaris X5 Plus and Huawei's Mate 9), and about a dozen types of Galileo-ready chips produced by Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel, Mediatek and u-blox. A list of Galileo-enabled products can be consulted at www.useGalileo.eu. "We need the businesses to invest in and innovate with Galileo. To create new applications, new services," said Bienkowska.  The civilian-controlled service is of great strategic importance for Europe, which relies on two military-run services -- GPS and GLONASS, which provide no guarantee of uninterrupted service. Named after Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, the project was first approved with an initial budget of around three billion euros and plans to be operational by 2008. It suffered several technical and budgetary setbacks, including the launch of two satellites into the wrong orbit in 2014.  Its total cost until 2020 is now calculated at about 10 billion euros. The European Commission expects the project will ultimately be an important commercial venture, adding some 90 billion euros to the EU economy in its first 20 years. Almost 10 percent of Europe's gross domestic product is thought to depend on satellite navigation today -- a figure projected to grow to about 30 percent by 2030. The system's groundbreaking accuracy is the result of the best atomic clocks ever flown for navigation -- accurate to one second in three million years. Galileo will also have stronger signals carrying more information, its makers say. Get the latest news by signing up to our newsletter, following us on Facebook or Twitter.

Business Energy California adopts nation's first energy efficiency rules for computers CA leading the way in computer efficiency CA leading the way in computer efficiency CA leading the way in computer efficiency Rob NikolewskiContact Reporter The California Energy Commission (CEC) on Wednesday passed sweeping energy efficiency standards for computers and monitors in an effort to reduce power costs, becoming the first state in the country to adopt such rules. The regulations promise to reduce energy consumed by computers by about one-third, saving ratepayers some $373 million in utility bills by 2027, and figure to have impacts far beyond California’s state lines.  Computers and computer monitors in the state use an estimated 5,610 gigawatts-hours of electricity, representing up to 3 percent of residential electricity use and 7 percent of commercial use. “"Such efficiency improvements are good for consumers, good for the electric system, good for the environment and frankly good for the green credentials of the manufacturers," said Andrew McAllister, a CEC commissioner who helped guide the new rules through a four-year process of consultations with industry that culminated in Wednesday’s 5-0 vote in Sacramento. “There's a lot of substance to like here.” The first tranche of the new standards will start Jan. 1, 2018, to be completed in stages by July 1, 2021. One of the rules’ chief targets is desktop computers, which use about four times as much power as a typical laptop (or notebook) computer. Sometimes called “energy vampires” by efficiency experts, desktops are switched on 77 percent of the time but sit idle for 61 percent of those minutes, according to a recent study from a University of California Irvine research team. Under the new rules, desktops must reduce their power-draw by about 30 percent when idle by the beginning of 2019 and nearly 50 percent by mid-2021. Most computer monitors will also be affected, with the new rules establishing thresholds for the amount of power a monitor or display can consume, even when they are in sleep mode. The standards also apply to laptops but it’s estimated about 73 percent of notebook computers on the market already meet the rules’ requirements. By 2021, the CEC estimates the new rules make the cost of each desktop about $14 more expensive but said consumers will save more than $55 over five years in reduced energy bills. Monitors will cost about $5 more but are expected to lead to $30 in savings over seven years. Laptops will cost about $1 more but energy savings in four years, the CEC said, is about twice that amount. The Consumer Federation of America praised the regulations and said the percentages in cost savings more than make up for the increase in prices. “Believe me, the average consumer who can barely get 2 percent on his CD today, that’s a pretty darn good investment,” said Mark Cooper, the federation’s director of research in a teleconference after the commission passed the rules. Representatives from Intel and HP Inc. also took part in the teleconference, with HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford calling the energy limits “ambitious but achievable.” The CEC has emphasized that manufacturers will have flexibility to meet the standards.  “It’s been a very good process that has led to, I think, a very good rule,” Ford said. The rules apply only to computers in California but the sheer size of the state’s share of the computer market is so formidable — California by itself accounts for 25 million computer monitors, 23 million laptops and 21 million desktops — the new standards will have ripple effects across the country and beyond.  “It will have a global impact and significantly change the way future energy-efficient desktops and all-in-one computers are designed and manufactured,” said Andrea Deveau, vice president of state policy and politics for Tech Net,  a trade group that counts Cisco and Microsoft among its members. “It was never taken lightly and it is definitely an historic rule-making.” But Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank based in Los Angeles, questioned the CEC’s cost savings estimates and said consumers already have a built-in incentive to buy energy-efficient computers in order to keep their utility bills low. “It's always easy to say, hey, this is a really cheap way for people to save a lot of money but for some reason, (consumers) just aren't doing it,” Moore said. “So we, the energy commission being all wise and powerful here in Sacramento, can make this happen for them. Because we know as the energy commission, we know far more about computer markets than dumb old computer makers, much less dumb old computer consumers.” The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an environmental group, worked closely with the CEC to develop the new standards. Pierre Delforge, the group’s director of high-tech sector energy efficiency, said the savings estimates are “relatively conservative” and said the rules will lead to huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, helping California meet its aggressive climate goals. “The standards are strong and they will lead manufacturers to design significantly more efficient products than they would have otherwise,” Delforge said. “When advocates work together with industry to reduce the energy use of their products, save consumers money while cutting pollution and carbon emissions, what’s not to like?”  By CEC estimates, the efficiency standards will save 2,332 gigawatt-hours per year — the equivalent of the power used by households in San Francisco and San Luis Obispo counties combined.

Since our last report, it looks like another busy week hit the development team behind openSUSE Tumbleweed, a Linux-based operating system that follows a rolling release model, which means that users are always getting the latest software versions without the need to download a new ISO image and reinstall/upgrade their systems. Seven snapshots for Tumbleweed means that there wasn't a single day without a new snapshot release, and they introduced updates for multiple components. For example, python3-setuptools was updated to version 30.2.0, the GStreamer packages to version 1.10.2, and the FFmpeg multimedia framework to 3.2.2. "The beginning of the week started with snapshot 20161208 that had a change that affects Python users. The update of python3-setuptools to version 30.2.0 dropped support for Python 3.2, which was released in February of 2011. The snapshot also provided an update to Kernel firmware 20161130 with patches affecting Intel Bluetooth," said Douglas DeMaio. Wine 2.0 RC1 and Linux kernel 4.8.13 are now available Among other updated packages that landed in the software repositories of openSUSE Tumbleweed, we can mention the Linux 4.8.13 kernel, Wine 2.0 RC1, GNOME Software 3.22.4, KIWI 7.04.21, python-packaging 16.8, yast2-installation 3.2.11, yast2-network 3.2.16, HarfBuzz 1.3.4, Vala 0.34.4, and NetworkManager-openconnect 1.2.4. Vim 8.0.130, python3-setuptools 30.3.0, libvirt 2.5.0, GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) 6.2.1-r243481, and notmuch 0.23.3 are present as well, along with the latest GTK+ 3.22.5, which prepares the GNU/Linux distribution for the major GTK+ 4 GUI toolkit. Therefore, you should update your openSUSE Tumbleweed installation as we speak to receive all the goodies mentioned above, and then some. #openSUSE Tumbleweed#GTK+ 4#Wine 2.0#GStreamer 1.10.2#FFmpeg 3.2.2 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Eleven Collabora Developers Have Contributed 37 Patches to Linux Kernel 4.9 CentOS-Based Rockstor 3.8-16 Btrfs-Powered Open Source NAS Solution Is Out Now GNOME 3.24 Desktop Environment Getting Improvements for the Notification Applet Linux Mint 18.1 Cinnamon & MATE Are Coming Out This Week, Says Clement Lefebvre New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    openSUSE Tumbleweed gets seven new snapshots Other Linux Distros Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Netrunner Rolling Edition / Desktop: A special edition of the Netrunner Linux distribution based on Arch Linux and designed as a rolling-release operating system Reader comments Nexus 5 Now a Fully Working Ubuntu Phone, Fairphone 2 Gets Voice Call Support more on: Nexus 5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Donald Trump’s tech meet ignored Twitter for being ‘too small’; is a dispute with Jack Dorsey over ‘crooked Hillary’ emoji the reason? Donald Trump ignoring Twitter is an irony. When the who's who of the world of technology met with President-elect Donald Trump, there was the conspicuous absence of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. By: FE Online | Published: December 16, 2016 11:19 AM Donald Trump’s team had replied by saying that Twitter ‘is not big enough’ to be a part of a technology meeting. (Reuters) Donald Trump ignoring Twitter is an irony. When the who’s who of the world of technology met with President-elect Donald Trump, there was the conspicuous absence of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. There were reports in RECODE which suggested that Jack Dorsey was excluded from the invitation list, even though he is the founder of the platform which the President-elect used to polarise the American people to rise in popularity during elections. Interestingly, according to a Reuters report, Donald Trump’s team had replied by saying that Twitter is too small to be a part of a tech meeting. Now, according to a report in Politico, this story goes back pre-elections. The report said that Trump’s team had ‘bounced’ Twitter in retaliation for a dispute over an emoji advertising deal. Trump’s tea has, however, denied the report by Politico. A spokesman for Trump’s transition team told Reuters, “They weren’t invited because they aren’t big enough.” Politico, however, claimed that source had told them that Twitter’s exclusion from the highly anticipated conference inside Trump Tower started from CEO Jack Dorsey’s ‘role in rejecting the anti-Clinton emoji’. This rejection reportedly got public complaints from Donal Trump’s campaign. The meeting was attended by Apple’s Tim Cook, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Alphabet’s Larry Page, Cisco’s Chuck Robbins, Intel’s Ginni Rometty, Oracles’s Safra Catz and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. Though a few companies were omitted from the list, but Twitter’s exclusion was highly surprising as the President-elect, with more than 17 million followers on the website has already made it like a press channel. Jack Dorsey, at an event called Code Commerce, told RECODE that he was not invited as of now. At the event, Dorsey also said, “Having the president-elect on our service, using it as a direct line of communication, allows everyone to see what’s on his mind at the moment. I think that’s interesting, I think it’s fascinating, I haven’t seen that before. Donald Trump’s campaign director of digital advertising and fund raising, Gary Coby, wrote in a Medium post in November that Jack Dorsey had personally blocked the Trump operation from using the custom emoji, which would have depicted, in many forms where bags of money getting stolen or being given away. Apparabtly, this emoji was supposed to be a replacement for the #CrookedHillary hashtag. Many people claim that Trump had a rapid rise in popularity and eventually the polls, riding on the back of Twitter which was made by Jack Dorsey. Trump used the platform to persistently polarise, praise and criticise individuals to organisations with sharp words and eventually became so popular that he won arguably the most powerful seat in the world, and still he keeps tweeting. But now, it appears that he is ignoring the man who indirectly helped him in his ascend to the throne. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Said to be Asia’s largest science and technology festival, Techfest is patronised by Unesco and Unicef with a footfall of more than 165,000 people comprising mainly youth from across India and an outreach of more than 2,500 colleges across the nation. To be held in the leafy, sprawling campus of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in suburban Powai, from December 16-18, “We have included several thrilling and exciting shows, competitions as well as lectures by national as well as world’s most eminent personalities,” Hardik Patil, media-co-ordinator, Techfest, told Gulf News. “One of the main attractions will be the Mind Controlled Drone by Puzzlebox Orbit, USA,” he says. “It is a drone that is controlled by the neuro senses of one’s mind and can be used by paralysed patients in order to communicate with us or alter the way they work.” Techfest will also include exhibitions of world’s most advanced robots and humanoids from Switzerland, Russia, USA and other countries. This year’s event also incorporates the Beacons Technology by which the user will be able to obtain offline notifications. Meanwhile, Isro, India, will present the scaled versions of the launch vehicles and satellites which were used to accomplish different space missions like Chandrayaan and Mars Orbiter Mission. Lectures at Techfest are usually known for their informative and interactive sessions between speakers and the enthusiastic audience and one of the speakers this time include Gordon Gill, the architect of Burj Khalifa, UAE. Others include Bedaprata Pain, Indian scientist turned film director, Jeff Demain, former director of Intel Labs and Salil Shetty, secretary general, Amnesty International. Perhaps, the unique element will be the international summit on internet of Things (IoT), a platform for students to interact with the corporate world. Competitions evoke widespread interest, says Patil, and in this field, the International Robotics Challenge, a combat between robotic gladiators for the survival of the fittest; Robowars, a platform to showcase one’s talent by building robots for the battle and Full Throttle, a competition between miniature version of IC engine cars, are expected to draw major crowds. And to showcase their own abilities, Techfest is organising Techconnect to highlight the technologies created in IIT Bombay, the foremost being: Formula Racing Car and Underwater Vehicle made by students and the Live Data Receiving microsatellite developed by IIT Bombay and launched by Isro in September this year.

Yankee Analysts Home Earnings Finance Global Markets About Us Privacy Policy Investor Alert & Price Target Update on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) By Yankee Staff Writer - December 16, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter The Wall Street analysts who cover Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) shares are providing price target projections on the company. They project that the shares will move to $45.368 within the upcoming year. The number they've arrived at is calculated by Zacks.com, long known as a provider of top-notch investment research. From the analysts polled by Zack's Research, the highest estimate stands at $52 and the lowest is at $40 for the stock. This number may be different from what First Call has published for the consensus target estimate. Analysts that routinely cover the company may use varying techniques in order to create a future target price. Because of the different methods that analysts can use, targets may differ greatly between analysts. Analyst Ratings In View Zacks provides the average brokerage recommendation (ABR) for thousands of stocks for institutions and retail investors alike. This the calculated average of the actual recommendations (strong buy, hold, sell etc.) made for a given stock. The ABR is typically displayed with decimals (e.g. 1.52) versus the Zacks Rank, which is only shown in whole numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.). This simplifies brokerage recommendations, which can become complicated. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)'s shares currently have an ABR of 1.96. A 1 rating would point to a Strong Buy, and a score of 5 would signify a Strong Sell rating. The average broker rating assists investors by providing them with a general feel for analyst sentiment on company shares.  The success of analyst predictions can be tracked for institutional investors through First Call.  Retail investors can use tools such as TipRanks or Marketbeat in order to track analyst performance.  During this fiscal period, Street analysts are projecting $0.55 earnings/share. This represents the current Zacks consensus EPS. For the period which closed on 2016-08-31, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) dialed in an EPS of $0.49, creating a Surprise Factor of -7.55% (the difference between analyst projections and actual numbers). Curious investors will be awaiting 2016-12-15, the date when Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release their quarterly results.  A surprise factor in either direction may result in significant stock movement immediately and in the days following the release.  Firms that consistently miss expectations can experience a downtrend over time.  Whereas stocks that consistently outperform analyst expectations, can often see positive stock movement.  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are trading +0.66% thus far today and have traded in the range of 36.53 – 37.16 during the current session. In order to take a look at where the stock might headed longer term, we can also look at different sets of data. Sell-side research firms currently have a consensus one year price target of $39.89 on the stock according to First Call. This number can often vary from the Zacks or FactSet mean targets. The sell-side analysts are projecting earnings per share of $0.61 for the next fiscal quarter. For the current year, analysts are predicting earnings of $2.67 per share according to First Call. Stock Technicals in Focus In looking at where the stock is trading on a technical level, the stock is trading +5.09% away from its 50 day moving average of $35.01. Based on the most recent available data, the equity is -4.09% off of its 52-week high of $38.36 and +32.91% away from its 52-week low which is $27.68. In taking a look at the company’s valuation, the firm’s price to earnings ratio stands at 17.26. This is a crucial indicator investors watch as higher ratios compared to peers, would suggest higher future earnings growth potential for the stock. The price to current year EPS estimates from research analysts currently stands at 13.78. In looking further ahead, potential investors should note that the company’s price to next year’s EPS estimates is 13.09. Today, the stock opened at $36.74 and the last bid at the time of writing stood at $36.79. During the session thus far, the equity dipped down to $36.53 and touched $37.16 as the high point. Intel Corporation has a market cap of 174.35B and has seen an average daily volume of 22349500 over the past three months.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14986 for PC arrives on the Fast ring, introduces many new features By Wayne Williams Published 4 weeks ago 74 Comments Tweet New Insider Preview builds of the forthcoming Windows 10 Creators Update have been arriving on the Fast ring on a weekly basis. There was a gap over thanksgiving (naturally), and last week a blocking bug on the PC version meant that Build 14977 was only made available for Mobile. This week it’s back to normal, with a new build for PC rolling out on the Fast ring, and the wait has definitely been worth it as Build 14986 comes packed with lots of new features and improvements. This is the most exciting new build in quite some time. Windows Insider Chief Dona Sarkar uses her Twitter account to tease new build numbers, and this week our very own Brian Fagioli provided the all important clue. #WIndowsInsiders: I love this pic of @brianfagioli, one of our own AND writer at @BetaNews with his shiny new @Alcatelmobile featuring VR! pic.twitter.com/PC1x9RNc3e — Dona Sarkar (@donasarkar) December 7, 2016 SEE ALSO: Windows 10 Creators Update will offer more advanced security features Build 14986 adds some big new features to Cortana, including the ability to control your PC with your voice. You can now use the personal assistant to shut down, restart or lock your PC and raise or lower the volume. Cortana can also control music playback on iHeartRadio and TuneIn Radio apps (only available in US English for now). The new build introduces music recognition support to Chinese (Simplified), and a smart full screen mode for Cortana. When your PC is unlocked and idle, saying "Hey Cortana" will open and after a few seconds (with no further input from you) switch to this mode which is designed for far field viewing. It's a handy addition as you'll now be able to use Cortana from across the room. Windows Ink gains new functionality in this build -- you can resume previous screen sketches, the flyout visuals have been improved, and the cursor will no longer be shown while you’re inking. Elsewhere in the new build there’s a new Enterprise Cloud Printers discovery UI for business users (you'll find this under Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners), and improved full-screen support for the Windows Game Bar. The Anniversary Update added support for six full screen games, and this build adds support for 19 more, including Battlefield 1, Fallout 4, Overwatch, Tom Clancy’s The Division, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Edge gains three new extensions -- Ebates, Intel TrueKey, and Read & Write -- improvements have been made to the Narrator, the Windows Defender dashboard has been given a makeover, and new keyboard shortcuts have been added to the registry editor. Microsoft has also improved the update process, giving users greater control over when updates are applied, and made it easier to free up space on a nearly full disk in order to download and install updates. SEE ALSO: How to change Windows 10's taskbar color, but leave the Start menu and Action Center untouched Other changes, improvements, and fixes for PC include: Improved the Windows Hello face which may require you to "Improve Recognition" to get recognized again. To do this go to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in Options and under "Windows Hello" and "Face Recognition", select "Improve Recognition" to go through the Improve Recognition wizard. Updated the Taskbar’s context menu settings entry to now explicitly be called "Taskbar settings", as that is where it pointed. Fixed an issue where the Virtual Touchpad’s left and right buttons might not work on some devices. Also fixed an issue where the Virtual Touchpad wouldn’t launch if the primary monitor was non-touch, and added the Virtual Touchpad icon to the Taskbar settings where you can Turn system icons on or off. Fixed the issue where apps such as Store, Photos, and People might launch on their own after your PC had been inactive for a period of time. Fixed the issue where navigating to Settings > System > Battery would crash the Settings app. Changed the default state of the Handwriting Panel to be floating next to the text field, rather than docked at the bottom of the screen. If you prefer docked-mode, you can still select it by tapping the icon in the top right corner of the Handwriting Panel. Fixed an issue where using ~ to switch languages using the Thai keyboard when typing in Office apps, such as Outlook or Word 2016, might sometimes result in a hang. Updated the migration logic, so that going forward from 14986 the default user’s numlock setting will now be preserved across upgrades. Fixed an issue where double-clicking on an Excel document to open it from File Explorer would crash Microsoft Excel. Fixed an issue where Windows Hello might get stuck "Looking for you". Fixed an issue Insiders with Surface Dial may have experienced recently where rotating the Dial could result in unexpected beeps. Moving some things around in Storage Settings. For this flight, you’ll notice that the settings to change save locations has moved to its own page. Fixed an issue where the PowerShell entry in File Explorer’s File menu would sometimes be unexpectedly grayed out. Fixed an issue where the Clock and Calendar flyout in the taskbar wouldn’t launch when the display language was set to Chinese (Traditional) and the system was using the phonetic sorting method. Updated the full screen Settings search results to now use smaller icons. Fixed an issue where some notifications might draw too high or too low, and then be seen moving itself to the correct position. Fixed an issue where the outline incoming notification toasts could still be seen if notification banners as a whole for that particular app had been turned off. Fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the Favorites bar on desktop might appear empty, despite having items in the Favorites folder. Fixed an issue that could result in CPU throttling when idling on certain webpages with many GIFs or looping videos in Microsoft Edge. Fixed an issue that could result in Alt + D sometimes not being able to set focus to the address bar in Microsoft Edge. For Insiders with PCs that upgraded to builds 14926-14959, some default power settings may have been lost and not recovered on subsequent upgrades. The effect of this causes devices to potentially use more power, change the power button behavior on tablets, etc. Starting with 14986, an attempt to detect this issue and re-apply the power settings will be made during upgrade. This attempt is a temporary process to help address this issue for Insiders, and will be removed when closer to the Creators Update release. Updated the Windows Error Reporting logic so that uploading crash data should no longer interfere with online game play, video streaming, Skype calls, or other network-intensive activity. Fixed an issue resulting in Microsoft Studios games like Microsoft Sudoku, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and Treasure Hunt potentially freezing at the splash screen on launch. Fixed an issue where, if the taskbar location was set to be on top, it was visible on the Welcome screens after upgrading. Known issues for PC include: Using keyboard monitor hotkeys to adjust brightness won’t work as expected. Desired brightness change could be done via the Action Center or by going to Settings > System > Display. You may see a popup "Catastrophic Error" dialog when opening OneDrive folders. If you do, the workaround is to open an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell window and enter "attrib -O <path to OneDrive failure that resulted in the error dialog>". Microsoft is currently investigating reports that DirectAccess isn’t working for some Windows Insiders. When using Microsoft Edge with Narrator, you may hear “no item in view or silence when tabbing or using other navigation commands. You can use Alt + Tab when this happens to move focus away from and back to the Edge browser and then Narrator will read as expected. Hey Cortana, play <blah> on <AppName> doesn’t work immediately after installing the app. Wait 5 minutes for indexer to kick in and try again.

Eleven Collabora Developers Have Contributed 37 Patches to Linux Kernel 4.9 GO Most of their work was in the DMABUF and DRM subsystems Dec 16, 2016 00:35 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Linux kernel developer Gustavo Padovan working for Collabora reports on the latest contributions he and ten other developers have made to the recently released Linux 4.9 kernel, which appears to be the biggest kernel release ever. Collabora's developers are known to contribute a lot of great work to various open-source projects, including Linux kernel, Mesa 3D Graphics Library, GStreamer, or Collabora Online, and for the Linux 4.9 kernel they pushed no less than 37 patches contributed by a total of eleven devs, which is another important milestone for them and their project. "This time we contributed 37 patches by 11 different developers, our highest number of single contributors in a kernel release ever," said Gustavo Padovan. "Remember that in the previous release we had our highest number total contributions. The numbers show how Collabora have been increasing its commitment to contributing to the upstream kernel community." Here's what Collabora's developers have contributed to Linux kernel 4.9 If you're curious to know what patches the Collabora developers have contributed to the massive Linux 4.9 kernel release, we can tell you that most of their contributions were made to both the DRM and DMABUF subsystems, starting with bug fixes to the AMDGPU and Intel i915 drivers, and the addition of the missing install of sync_file.h uapi. Explicit fencing was implemented to the DRM subsystem, the virtio_gpu driver got some fixes as well, Sync File testing was improved thanks to the de-staging of the SW_SYNC validation framework, drm_bridge support was added to imx-ldb and RockChip’s analogic-dp devices, along with firmware upload support to the ziirave watchdog device. Thanks to Collabora's contributions, it also looks like the validation of the DRM subsystem is now fully documented, DMA support was improved and it's now enabled for i.MX53 UARTs, and the VME driver development was advanced with the implementation of a fake VMEbus (Versa Module Europa bus). Some errors were patched for cdc-wdm USB devices, as were some SCO connections on the Bluetooth subsystems. #Linux kernel 4.9#Collabora#Linux 4.9#Linux kernel#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news CentOS-Based Rockstor 3.8-16 Btrfs-Powered Open Source NAS Solution Is Out Now GNOME 3.24 Desktop Environment Getting Improvements for the Notification Applet Linux Mint 18.1 Cinnamon & MATE Are Coming Out This Week, Says Clement Lefebvre Wireshark 2.2.3 Open-Source Network Protocol Analyzer Released with 19 Bug Fixes New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Collabora's contributions to Linux kernel 4.9 New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Opera Celebrates 20 Years of Activity, Opera 42 Adds Built-In Currency Converter more on: Opera 42 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Taken from an online presentation by Civiq, the company that makes them, this shows a user looking at an interactive screen featuring a message from Mayor Carlos Gimenez. The kiosks show digital advertising as well as information a government wants to share with residents, including transit schedules. Civiq i By Douglas Hanks dhanks@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Digital ads could spread across Miami-Dade bus stops under a deal to install high-tech kiosks with Wi-Fi hot spots throughout the county’s transit system. The company behind New York’s celebrated transformation of old pay phones into high-tech digital way stations has negotiated a 15-year deal with Miami-Dade officials to install up to 300 of the kiosks at bus stops and Metrorail stations across the county. Civiq also would take over the transit system’s current Wi-Fi network on all of its trains, expanding the service to all buses at no charge. The Massachusetts company pays for the equipment and operating expenses through digital advertising on the kiosks, and sees enough profit potential in Miami-Dade that it has pledged to spend $20 million in the county to get started. This is the concept of creating this seamless canopy of connectivity in a city. Brad Gleeson, Civiq’s chief commercial officer Executives tout the kiosks as a no-cost way for local governments to bring interactive information stations to their streets and transit centers — as well as an opportunity to use the equipment’s sensors to track everything from litter to gunshots to traffic. “We call it the civic mobility experience. This is the concept of creating this seamless canopy of connectivity in a city,” Brad Gleeson, Civiq’s chief commercial officer, said in a presentation posted on the company’s website this month. The kiosks “make a city more aware and more efficient.” The kiosks themselves provide free Wi-Fi service within 200 feet, offering people waiting for a bus the chance to use the internet without tapping into their phone’s data plan. Critics see the Civiq arrangement as a way to circumvent county restrictions on digital ads, which are strictly regulated and the bane of public-space activists. “It’s pure visual pollution,” said Peter Ehrlich, a founder of Scenic Miami, a group that fights digital billboards. Dusty Melton, a Miami-Dade lobbyist who has urged strict enforcement of the county’s sign ordinance, said Civiq’s digital kiosks could be considered roadside ads if installed at bus stops. “This contract appears, quite clearly, to be in blatant violation of the county’s very own sign code,” Melton said. Along with a requirement that digital signs be limited to properties larger than 10 acres, Melton noted the current law requires the electronic ads only advertise things available on the property with the sign itself. Bus-stop screens, he said, would seem to violate the rules “in hundreds of locations.” This contract appears, quite clearly, to be in blatant violation of the county’s very own sign code. Lobbyist Dusty Melton Civiq executives were not available for interviews. A mock-up of a kiosk included in the draft contract shows it would stand about 9 feet tall, with a 55-inch screen — on the larger end of the scale for most big-screen televisions. A mock-up of the device in Gleeson’s presentation features an image of Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez on the main touch screen, with readouts on county weather and transit information below. Alice Bravo, Miami-Dade’s transportation director, said at a recent committee meeting that county staff did not feel the county’s signage rules applied because the kiosks’ screens are designed for pedestrians. “These are small, isolated screens,” she said. “They’re not designed for viewing by vehicular traffic.” Bravo and other administrators negotiated the no-bid Civiq deal under a provision in county law that allows marketing arrangements to be signed without soliciting other proposals. No Civiq executives registered to lobby county officials during the talks, avoiding a step that can draw public attention to a potential deal. The kiosks themselves provide free Wi-Fi service within 200 feet, offering people waiting for a bus the chance to use the internet without tapping into their phone’s data plan. Gimenez recommended the Civiq contract in a Dec. 14 memo, and it won unanimous approval from the County Commission’s Transit committee on Wednesday. The deal, which includes revenue-sharing for the county from ad sales, is now awaiting a final vote before the 13-member Commission. Bravo said the talks spun out of Miami’s annual eMerge Americas technology conference, which Civiq executives attended. The company is in the midst of replacing New York’s 7,500 pay phones with the smart kiosks. They offer gigabit Wi-Fi, significantly faster than most networks, along with charging stations for cellphones, a button that automatically connects with a 911 operator, free phone calls from Vonage, and an interactive screen showing public announcements and information on city services. Civiq is pitching its services to local governments across the country, but a company publicist said the closest example to Miami at the moment is New York. Miami-Dade has the 14th largest transit system in the country, and the proposed deal gives Civiq the ability to install at least 150 stations in the county’s more than 40 rail stations and in a tiny portion of its more than 8,000 bus stops. Civiq would need local permission to install them at stops within city limits, a key barrier given the appeal of high-traffic areas in Miami and Miami Beach to advertisers. In its online presentation, an executive with Civiq’s kiosk partner, Intel, described the use of cameras on advertising displays that can track a viewer’s gaze for interest and customize displays to match a passerby’s niche. “If a woman is looking at a screen,” Intel’s Karthik Murugan said, “you don’t want to show men’s clothing.” Murugan also said three-dimensional cameras in the devices can help decipher whether an advertiser’s message is connecting. Along with “gaze tracking,” new technology allows emotion detection. “Are they happy? Are they frustrated with the content that’s being shown?” Murugan said. “The 3-D camera will help with that analysis.” The Massachusetts company pays for the equipment and operating expenses through digital advertising on the kiosks, and sees enough profit potential in Miami-Dade that it has pledged to spend $20 million in the county to get started. The presentation also said Civiq raises revenue from cellular companies that can utilize the kiosks for help in boosting phone reception. Taking over Miami-Dade’s existing free Wi-Fi network in all trains and some buses could prove lucrative, too. Bravo said Civiq would have the ability to inject advertising into a Wi-Fi system that’s currently ad-free. But while ads may come to transit’s Wi-Fi offerings, Civiq would also expand the service beyond the roughly 200 buses that have it now to the entire 850-vehicle fleet. And Miami-Dade could stop paying Wi-Fi providers for the current service, since Civiq would pick up the tab. Gimenez’s Dec. 14 memo said the 15-year deal would save Miami-Dade about $2 million in existing costs, with the county collecting between 3 and 4 percent of Civiq’s ad revenue (and up to 5 percent if the deal is renewed). Bravo said a central advantage comes from the convenience a high-tech kiosk can provide transit users — especially new passengers who aren’t familiar with how the system works. “We’re looking for things that help improve access to transit, that help improve the reliability of transit,” she said. “I think that’s how we get more and more people to take public transit.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Miami-Dade County Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:15 Witness speaks about shootout on South Beach Pause 1:33 Feds break up largest Medicare scam in U.S. history 0:56 Community leaders urge against celebratory gunfire on NYE 7:30 Plundering a small town 1:26 Miami says goodbye to Jose Fernandez 2:23 Jose Fernandez's last interview 5:48 Dave Barry's 2016 Holiday Gift Guide 1:20 The United States of Powerball 57:11 Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen talk politics, Florida and a presidential bid at the Miracle Theatre 1:28 The day Cassius Clay and The Beatles shared the ring Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 3 days ago West Perrine fatal shooting 2:03 3 days ago West Perrine fatal shooting 0:30 3 days ago Former Opa Locka commissioner Santiago leaves federal court 1:15 6 days ago Witness speaks about shootout on South Beach View more video Miami-Dade County Suspects remain on loose in Miami New Year’s drive-by shooting that injured seven Expect cooler temperatures in Miami later this week Seven people injured in New Year’s Day drive-by shooting South Florida’s first baby of 2017 was a surprise all the way A fraudster, a tax avoider, a subpeona ignorer and a powerful lawyer who just wanted to be cool Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Miami Herald Rewards Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us NewsMedia in Education Public Insight Network Reader Panel Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Google+ Mobile Apps & eReaders Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Media Kit Commercial Printing Public Notices Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Miami Herald Rewards Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us NewsMedia in Education Public Insight Network Reader Panel Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Google+ Mobile Apps & eReaders Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Media Kit Commercial Printing Public Notices Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Dec 17, 2016 at 1:45PM Image Source: Getty Images. As we hurdle toward the finish line, 2016 will go down as a uniquely active year in the semiconductor market. Spurred on by the onset of several generational tech trends -- the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and the like -- major semiconductor companies have gone on a buying spree to prepare them to cash-in on this growth. Two such names that sit smack dab in the middle of these growth markets are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), whose shares have handily outperformed their benchmark over the past five years. AVGO data by YCharts. Both NIVIDIA and Broadcom are attractive in their own right, but which semiconductor stock is the better buy today? In this article, we'll run both stocks through a three-part gauntlet to see if one is more deserving of investors' attention.  1. Financial fortitude The first prism through which we'll analyze these semiconductor stocks is the strength of their balance sheets. Though their investment theses lie in their revenue and profit growth stories, investors need to understand a given company's financial strength in any investment scenario. In looking at NVIDIA and Broadcom, though, both companies appear fine for the most part. A few important distinctions emerge, however. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio NVIDIA $6.6 billion $2.9 billion $7.4 billion 4.1x Broadcom $2.0 billion $15.0 billion $3.4 billion 2.3x Data Source: NVIDIA & Broadcom Investor Relations, Yahoo! Finance. To get this out of the way, NVIDIA is the clear winner in every category here. NVIDIA has more cash and liquid assets on hand, carries less debt, and generates more cash flow from its core business. There's really no way around this or disputing it. However, the important nuance in comparing the two companies is that Broadcom's financial position isn't a negative either, especially given the company's intelligent acquisition strategy (see Part 2 below). Simply stated, Broadcom, along with its pre-merger counterpart Avago, has been one of the most prolific acquirers of semiconductor companies, a part of the broader trend of rapid consolidation we've seen within the chip industry. In fact, Avago funded part of last year's transformational merger with Broadcom by issuing $9 billion in fresh debt. The combined company is undeniably stronger as a result of the Broadcom-Avago merger and other recent acquisitions, so Broadcom's current debt burden is most appropriately viewed as the cost of the company's transformation into a company poised to dominate the Internet of Things chip market in coming years. Winner: NVIDIA. 2.  Durable competitive advantages Unlike the above section, it's far harder to determine which company holds stronger competitive advantages. Simply said, both companies are enviably positioned to dominate their markets for years to come. Broadcom's area of focus is connectivity. The company operates four reporting segments -- wired infrastructure, wireless communication, enterprise storage, and industrial and other -- that help make our increasingly connected world tick. Its chips appear in smartphones, cellular base stations, Internet of Things devices like smart appliances, data centers, and more. The company's semiconductors touch multiple points of the connectivity value chain, as well, which is fantastic news given the unprecedented growth opportunity the IoT presents. According to Ericsson, the number of IoT connected devices is set to grow from 4.2 billion to 14.2 billion by 2021, and Broadcom's offerings will be selling directly into this trend from a place of market leadership. As such, there's little doubt that investors should love Broadcom's competitive stance at present. As enviable as Broadcom's competitive positioning is, though, graphics chip leader NVIDIA's competitive advantages are every bit as compelling. Akin to Intel's dominance of the CPU microprocessors that power PCs, NVIDIA is the undeniable leader in the high-end graphics chips that lie at the heart of growth markets like self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In fact, NVIDIA's chips power the budding AI or cloud platforms for Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, IBM, and Microsoft. Its chips also underpin the self-driving car efforts of Tesla, Audi, Baidu, and many more. It's for this reason that analysts see NVIDIA's earnings per share compounding at a 28% annual clip over the next five years, and there's a legitimate case to be made that Wall Street still underappreciates NVIDIA's growth story. Winner: Tie. 3.  Valuation When it comes to valuation, the case becomes somewhat more clear cut. As you can see below, NVIDIA is priced for meaningful growth, deservedly so as we learned from the section above. However, Broadcom's valuation multiple is more appealing, though a bit harder to gain a sense of as the result of some merger-related accounting. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA NVIDIA 63.0x 35.8x 25.9x Broadcom 15.7x 12.5x 16.3x Data Source: S&P CapIQ. In the past three quarters, Broadcom has booked $1.5 billion in non-cash merger-related charges, which has artificially depressed its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings. In backing those charges out, the company's normalized earnings per share for 2016 come to $10.84 per share, a very reasonable price for a company with Broadcom's positive growth outlook. Winner: Broadcom. Putting it all together Both NVIDIA and Broadcom sit at the middle of some of the most important growth markets in tech today. As such, each company should experience impressive sales and profit growth in the coming years. If we're splitting hairs here, you can make a plausible case that Broadcom's lower valuation makes it the better bet. However, the more important big-picture takeaway is that both NVIDIA and Broadcom are fantastic options for investors looking to participate in the next wave of semiconductor market growth.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:30 AM, December 17, 2016 OTTAWA - Canadian marijuana firms, facing potential limits on advertising for recreational pot, are selling health food products and cultivating a lifestyle image to win customers in an anticipated multibillion dollar market. Canada is set to become the first G7 country to legalize recreational marijuana nationally when it introduces legislation next spring. Medical marijuana is already legal. If the government incorporates an expert panel's recommendations, outlined on Tuesday, it could strictly limit advertising and require plain packaging on products. That means companies will need to be creative to set themselves apart from the competition, with the advantage going to those who have already established a name, said Aaron Salz, founder of Stoic Advisory Inc, a cannabis advisory firm. "If you've been able to build a brand presence ahead of potentially more restrictive rules on advertising, you're going to have a leg up." Alternatives could include sponsoring events or companies putting their name on products other than cannabis, he said. Medical marijuana producer Peace Naturals has a line of food products, such as hemp hearts, sold in health food stores. It is a strategy that owner Cronos Group, which is changing its name from PharmaCan Capital Corp, might consider for its other brands, said Chief Executive Officer Michael Gorenstein. Gorenstein plans to use British Columbia-based In The Zone, which is licensed for medical marijuana cultivation, to appeal to the outdoor crowd when recreational use is legalized, with a focus on hiring like-minded employees to connect with customers. "If you build a culture and recruit a group of people that really represent what your brand is, you don't need to advertise," said Gorenstein. "The brand recognition will follow." Wholesaler Supreme Pharmaceuticals Inc is putting its focus on the quality of marijuana it grows. The end product is sold under other companies' names, but Supreme gets a producer's mark and is betting on customers recognizing where their marijuana came from and coming back for more. "A good analogy would be Intel chips," said Chief Executive John Fowler. "Whether you're buying an Apple or a Dell, you're looking for Intel inside as a mark of quality." Canopy Growth Corp, which operates Bedrocan and Tweed, plans to use the potential plain packaging to educate customers about the strength and strain of marijuana they are buying, said Chief Executive Bruce Linton. "We were not going to be using swirly, psychedelic colors," Linton said. "We're going to be using the chance to put the name 'Tweed' on the package." Executives said education through events or customer service will be key. It is a strategy Olivia Mannix, chief executive of Colorado-based cannabis marketing agency Cannabrand, recommends. "Be professional, that's really the best advice," said Mannix. "Have education and information behind your brand."

The live showcase is an important milestone for the SoC because it proves that the part is functional and is on track for commercialization in the second half of next year. Qualcomm announced plans to enter the server market more than two years ago, in November 2014, but the first rumors about the company’s intentions to develop server CPUs emerged long before that. In fact, being one of the largest designers of ARM-based SoCs for mobile devices, Qualcomm was well prepared to move beyond smartphones and tablets. However, while it is not easy to develop a custom ARMv8 processor core and build a server-grade SoC, building an ecosystem around such chip is even more complicated in a world where ARM-based servers are typically used in isolated cases. From the very start, Qualcomm has been rather serious not only about the processors themselves but also about the ecosystem and support by third parties (Facebook was one of the first companies to support Qualcomm’s server efforts). In 2015, Qualcomm teamed up with Xilinx and Mellanox to ensure that its server SoCs are compatible with FPGA-based accelerators and data-center connectivity solutions (the fruits of this partnership will likely emerge in 2018 at best). Then it released a development platform featuring its custom 24-core ARMv8 SoC that it made available to customers and various partners among ISVs, IHVs and so on. Earlier this year the company co-founded the CCIX consortium to standardize various special-purpose accelerators for data-centers and make certain that its processors can support them. Taking into account all the evangelization and preparation work that Qualcomm has disclosed so far, it is evident that the company is very serious about its server business. From the hardware standpoint, Qualcomm’s initial server platform will rely on the company’s Centriq 2400-series family of microprocessors that will be made using a 10 nm FinFET fabrication process in the second half of next year. Qualcomm does not name the exact manufacturing technology, but the timeframe points to either performance-optimized Samsung’s 10LPP or TSMC’s CLN10FF (keep in mind that TSMC has a lot of experience fabbing large chips and a 48-core SoC is not going to be small). The key element of the Centriq 2400 will be Qualcomm’s custom ARMv8-compliant 64-bit core code-named Falkor. Qualcomm has yet has to disclose more information about Falkor, but the important thing here is that this core was purpose-built for data-center applications, which means that it will likely be faster than the company’s cores used inside mobile SoCs when running appropriate workloads. Qualcomm currently keeps peculiarities of its cores under wraps, but it is logical to expect the developer to increase frequency potential of the Falkor cores (vs mobile ones), add support of L3 cache and make other tweaks to maximize their performance. The SoCs do not support any multi-threading or SMP technologies, hence boxes based on the Centriq 2400-series will be single-socket machines able to handle up to 48 threads. The core count is an obvious promotional point that Qualcomm is going to use over competing offerings and it is naturally going to capitalize on the fact that it takes two Intel multi-core CPUs to offer the same amount of physical cores. Another advantage of the Qualcomm Centriq over rivals could be the integration of various I/O components (storage, network, basic graphics, etc.) that are now supported by PCH or other chips, but that is something that the company yet has to confirm. From the platform point of view, Qualcomm follows ARM’s guidelines for servers, which is why machines running the Centriq 2400-series SoC will be compliant with ARM’s server base system architecture and server base boot requirements. The former is not a mandatory specification, but it defines an architecture that developers of OSes, hypervisors, software and firmware can rely on. As a result, servers compliant with the SBSA promise to support more software and hardware components out-of-the-box, an important thing for high-volume products. Apart from giant cloud companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft that develop their own software (and who are evaluating Centriq CPUs), Qualcomm targets traditional server OEMs like Quanta or Wiwynn (a subsidiary of Wistron) with the Centriq and for these companies having software compatibility matters a lot. On the other hand, Qualcomm’s primary server targets are large cloud companies, whereas server makers do not have their samples of Centriq yet. During the presentation, Qualcomm demonstrated Centriq 2400-based 1U 1P servers running Apache Spark, Hadoop on Linux, and Java: a typical set of server software. No performance numbers were shared and the company did not open up the boxes so not to disclose any further information about the CPUs (i.e., the number of DDR memory channels, type of cooling, supported storage options, etc.). Qualcomm intends to start selling its Centriq 2400-series processors in the second half of next year. Typically it takes developers of server platforms a year to polish off their designs before they can ship them, normally it would make sense to expect Centriq 2400-based machines to emerge in the latter half of 2H 2017. But since Qualcomm wants to address operators of cloud data-centers first and companies like Facebook and Google develop and build their own servers, they do not have to extensively test them in different applications, but just make sure that the chips can run their software stack. As for the server world outside of cloud companies, it remains to be seen whether the server industry is going to bite Qualcomm’s server platform given the lukewarm welcome for ARMv8 servers in general. For these markets, performance, compatibility, and longevity are all critical factors in adopting a new set of protocols.

POST A COMMENT 87 Comments View All Comments witeken - Friday, December 16, 2016 - link "and it is naturally going to capitalize on the fact that it takes two Intel multi-core CPUs to offer the same amount of physical cores." These chips will compete against Skylake-EP, which will be launched mid-17, which will have up to 32 cores, so at best Qualcomm has 1.5x as many. But core count on its own is just as worthless as frequency. Performance also depends on the architecture. Reply prisonerX - Friday, December 16, 2016 - link Actually you're entirely wrong. Because maximum frequencies have long plateaued and there is an upper limit on how much heat, ie power, you can output from a square mm of silicon, going forward core count and attendant low-power archs will win. Have a look at graphics cards for the future. You're right when you say "Performance also depends on the architecture" but you have the wrong performance in mind. Power consumption is the key performance metric because it determines density and therefore overall throughput. Single thread performance as an absolute measure is meaningless in this scenario, it's all relative to how much space and power it takes to deliver it. Intel's legacy architecture can't compete in this respect. You'll note that frequency decreases in Intel processors are core count increases. Intel lost on mobile becuase they can't compete on low, low power, and they'll also lose in the high core count future becuase they've wedded themselves to their old and inefficient architecture.

I recently read some quote that people who are *sure* someone is wrong, are usually actually wrong themselves. And that is here entirely the case. ISA has little to zero impact. Process technology is so many order of magnitude more important. Please read following article from AT: The x86 Power Myth Busted: In-Depth Clover Trail Power Analysis: http://www.anandtech.com/show/6529/busting-the-x86... Reply Krysto - Friday, December 16, 2016 - link That article was SO SO wrong. I don't know whether he did it on purpose (Anand was showing himself to be a pretty big Intel fanboi at the time) or whether he simply missed it, but it's strange that he would've missed something so obvious. Here's the thing: Anand compared a 32nm planar process for the ARM chips, with Intel's 3D Trigate 22nm process. Not only was the 22nm vs 32 an entire process generation ahead on its own, but so was the Trigate process vs planar (Intel essentially jumped 2 process generations in terms of performance gains when it moves from 32nm planar to 22nm Trigate). So Intel was not one, but TWO process generations ahead for Atom compared to the equivalent ARM chips, and yet it could still BARELY compete with those ARM chips - yet Anand's conclusion was "x86 myth busted" ?! If anything it proves the myth was NEVER busted if the ARM chips could still hold their own despite being two process generations behind. Another very important point, that Atom chip was still significantly more expensive than than those ARM competitors. It's why Intel had to lose $1 billion a quarter to keep subsidizing it and make it remotely attractive to mobile device makers, and why it eventually licensed the Atom design to Rockchip and Spreadstrum, thinking they could build it cheaper. But it was always going to be a losing strategy because by the time those Rockchip Atom chips came out at 28nm planar, ARM chips were already at 20nm. And as explained above, Atom was only competitive when it was two process nodes ahead. So Intel never had a chance with Atom. Reply witeken - Friday, December 16, 2016 - link Lol, have you actually looked at the article? As of 2012, Intel did not have mobile finfet devices, which makes your entire rant obsolete. And if I may add another truism: people who invent facts, can argue for anything (and it doesn't matter if this is because of ignorance, i.e. not having enough information). So I will simply ignore all your falsities. Reply witeken - Friday, December 16, 2016 - link Anyway. I would say the burden of proof is on your side. Please scientifically explain why ARM is more power efficient. If you can't, that could be because you are wrong. The world does not run on magic. Reply name99 - Saturday, December 17, 2016 - link The issues are not the technical ones that are being thrown around. The issues that matter are (a) design and validation time. We know it took 7 years to design the Nehalem class of CPUs. This appears to have stretched out to eight years with Kaby Lake. Meanwhile we know it took Samsung 3 years to design their fully custom Exynos, so Apple and QC are probably on a similar (perhaps four year) schedule. Obviously a server is more complicated (look how Intel servers ship two years after their base cores) and we don't know how much of that extra validation would affect QC. But everything points to QC and others having an easier job, and being able to respond faster to market changes and possible new design ideas. (b) prices. Intel finances its operation by extracting the most money from their most captive buyers. Once QC and other ship chips that are at an acceptable performance level, Intel can certainly respond with lower prices, like they have with Xeon-D; the problem is that doing so throws their whole financial structure into chaos. Reply Gondalf - Sunday, December 18, 2016 - link Na my friend, a brand new x86 cpu takes 3 years to develop more like an ARM cpu/SOC, nothing is different with actual sw tools Intel has, the little add that Intel does in development (1 year) is because Intel cores are fully Server Space validated and ready for a 24/7 utilization without elettromigration for at least 10 years. Please take some proof before post on Anandtech. Reply Wilco1 - Sunday, December 18, 2016 - link If developing new x86 CPUs is so easy, then explain how is it possible that a small company like ARM is able to release new microarchitectures much faster? There have been just 3 Atom microarchitectures in 8 years despite spending $10+ billion on mobile. ARM produced more than 10 different A-class cores since 2008 for a tiny fraction of Intel's cost. Please get a clue before posting on Anandtech. Reply Gondalf - Sunday, December 18, 2016 - link They are only cores not implemented in a SOC cores, the strong cost of SOC implementation is on licensee balance sheet. About costs of ARM and Intel for the development of the architecture only without the hard implementation of it on a real chip....we have not real figures but sure they are comparable at a certain level of complexity and debugging. Decoders are standard building blocks only in Intel/AMD sw. About Atom, it was an Intel choice to stay a lot on a single arc refining the uncore instead, you know Intel way to think, pretty strange to look you doing these reasonings......pretty strange indeed.

Canada is set to become the first G7 country to legalize recreational marijuana nationally when it introduces legislation next spring. Medical marijuana is already legal. If the government incorporates an expert panel's recommendations, outlined on Tuesday, it could strictly limit advertising and require plain packaging on products. That means companies will need to be creative to set themselves apart from the competition, with the advantage going to those who have already established a name, said Aaron Salz, founder of Stoic Advisory Inc, a cannabis advisory firm. "If you've been able to build a brand presence ahead of potentially more restrictive rules on advertising, you're going to have a leg up." Alternatives could include sponsoring events or companies putting their name on products other than cannabis, he said. Medical marijuana producer Peace Naturals has a line of food products, such as hemp hearts, sold in health food stores. It is a strategy that owner Cronos Group, which is changing its name from PharmaCan Capital Corp, might consider for its other brands, said Chief Executive Officer Michael Gorenstein. Gorenstein plans to use British Columbia-based In The Zone, which is licensed for medical marijuana cultivation, to appeal to the outdoor crowd when recreational use is legalized, with a focus on hiring like-minded employees to connect with customers. "If you build a culture and recruit a group of people that really represent what your brand is, you don't need to advertise," said Gorenstein. "The brand recognition will follow." Wholesaler Supreme Pharmaceuticals Inc is putting its focus on the quality of marijuana it grows. The end product is sold under other companies' names, but Supreme gets a producer's mark and is betting on customers recognizing where their marijuana came from and coming back for more. "A good analogy would be Intel chips," said Chief Executive John Fowler. "Whether you're buying an Apple or a Dell, you're looking for Intel inside as a mark of quality." Canopy Growth Corp, which operates Bedrocan and Tweed, plans to use the potential plain packaging to educate customers about the strength and strain of marijuana they are buying, said Chief Executive Bruce Linton. "We were not going to be using swirly, psychedelic colors," Linton said. "We're going to be using the chance to put the name 'Tweed' on the package." Executives said education through events or customer service will be key. It is a strategy Olivia Mannix, chief executive of Colorado-based cannabis marketing agency Cannabrand, recommends. "Be professional, that's really the best advice," said Mannix. "Have education and information behind your brand."
