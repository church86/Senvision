One of the key elements of this new architecture is the opening of its McAfee data exchange layer (DXL), and the introduction of a software development kit (SDK) that anyone can use to "gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defense lifecycle," as Intel Security explains in its press release. Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) bought McAfee in 2010. Most of the new security architecture is based on use of McAfee products, but not everyone is an Intel Security customer. Intel Security says it will open DXL to the industry. DXL provides a standardized application framework to integrate technologies from different vendors with each other and with in-house developed applications, Intel Security said. The OpenDXL Initiative will adopt an open source strategy; the new SDK is in beta. Barbara Kay, senior director of strategic marketing for Intel Security, explains to Light Reading that opening DXL means that organizations will be able to connect their security solutions in standardized way. "If you're able to go through an abstraction layer, it means no more one-to-one integrations," she says. "It will be more frictionless." The approach is already getting buy-in. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP) and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. recently joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance, and are integrating security products through DXL. (See Intel Security Expands Alliance Ecosystem, Adds BT) Intel Security's announcements were pinned to its annual conference, Focus16, but also happen to follow some notable escalation in the perpetual cat-and-mouse game of network security. A week ago Friday, there was a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack that took down several prominent websites for hours and hours. Prior to all that, there were security experts who thought companies like Dyn (the central target of that attack) were well prepared to fend off such assaults. A month prior to that, there was a lesser-known but equally troubling DDoS attack aimed at Brian Krebs, a prominent journalist who covers network security; that assault set a record for DDoS size -- 665 Gbit/s. (See Attacks Have Major Internet Sites on the Ropes) Meanwhile, more and more critical systems are being networked, and when those defenses are breached -- as they inevitably will be -- the potential damage gets more and more severe. We are, Intel accurately says, "in a world where more than money is at stake and where private and public sectors are fighting against time and working to justify trust." The security "architecture" is unified inasmuch as it attempts to stitch together a web of security coverage that encompasses endpoints, data center/cloud, data itself, and security operations, based on the full range of McAfee products. Want to know more about how to secure data, networks, and services? Check out our security channel here on Light Reading. It used to be that an organization could establish adequate security at the gateway. "Well, the perimeter doesn't exist anymore," Kay notes. Intel is expanding endpoint security through the latest versions of McAfee Endpoint Security (rev 10.5) and McAfee Active Response (rev 2.0). These products bring together a set of capabilities that include Patient Zero Protection, which protects against patient zero and ransomware threats, Machine Learning for malware classification; Integrated Web and Endpoint Protection designed to check the spread of malware; and Real-Time Advanced Threats Protection which uses the cloud to accelerate investigations into attacks. Intel Security's approach to pervasive data protection is to unify software-as-a-service (SaaS) security so that organizations can manage access to sensitive data. The approach relies on two existing products: McAfee DLP 10.0, which introduces unified policies and incident management for both endpoint and network DLP, and on McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Service. The company also has in beta test its new McAfee Cloud Data Protection. It features Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) technology, to provide an integrated view of risky endpoint and cloud events, including the ability to perform a real-time endpoint health check, ensuring only trusted devices are able to access sensitive information. Intel Security's Data Center and Cloud Defense solution combines server security, network security and threat intelligence sharing to enable a single view of security across data center environments. The commercial application of machine learning is new in general, and new in the security area, and only going to accelerate. Kay tells Light Reading that machine learning will help security systems get more predictive about security breaches. When it comes to behavior on the network, "we're getting beyond known bad and known good -- we're getting to where there's a lot of gray. We have to learn to recognize attributes of suspicious behavior. That will allow us to pay more attention when something looks unusual. "The more beyond normal it is, the closer you should look. The more beyond normal it is with more valuable assets, the faster you should look," Kay adds. That's what machine learning is particularly good at. Simultaneously, Atos, a digital services company based in Europe, announced a new managed security service provider (MSSP) partnership with Intel Security. Atos will provide the first ever managed offering built to deliver the McAfee Threat Defense Lifecycle as a cloud, on-premises, or hybrid service. — Brian Santo, Senior Editor, Components, T&M, Light Reading (3)  |  Comment  |  Print  |  RSS Comments Newest First  |  Oldest First  |  Threaded View        ADD A COMMENT [close this box] Login 50% 50% Mitch Wagner, User Rank: Lightning 11/7/2016 | 9:12:01 PM Re: Togetherness Linux drives an awful lot of x86 sales.

McKinsey & Company says women experience pipeline leakage at three primary points: being unable to enter, being stuck in the middle or being locked out of the top. Each pipeline pain point presents its own challenges, but also opportunities to stop the leak. Wireless operator Sprint is making a conscious effort to improve its own pipeline from new recruits to the C-suite, and it wants the rest of the industry to do the same. In this Women in Comms radio show, WiC Board Member and Sprint Vice President of Enterprise Sales Nelly Pitocco will give us her take on the industry's pipeline challenges. Pitocco, who joined Sprint in May and has spent 20 years in the comms industry, will also offer solutions, share how Sprint is tackling the challenge within its own organization and take your questions live on air.

The Good The Yuneec Typhoon H offers features that are above its price, such as a 360-degree rotating 4K camera, retractable landing gear and the option to control the drone and camera separately. It has sonar-based object detection, but is also available with Intel Realsense obstacle avoidance. Replacement parts are easy to find, and you can service it yourself for the most part. The Bad The hexacopter is not sturdy, especially its flimsy camera mount. Controller size and layout are not the most user-friendly. Not as user-friendly as similarly priced models. The Bottom Line The Yuneec Typhoon H is a well-equipped prosumer camera drone, but its build quality and lackluster user experience keep it off our short list. 6.5 Overall Design 5.0 Battery 7.0 Features 8.0 Ease of Use 6.0 Review Sections Review Prices User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Sport and Outdoors Drones Yuneec Typhoon H When the Yuneec Typhoon H showed up at CES 2016 it stood out from the horde of other flying machines at the gigantic electronics show (the Ehang 184 being a notable exception). Its six-rotor design and sonar sensors in front for obstacle detection give it the look of a flying insect, while its removable 360-degree rotating gimbal camera and retractable landing gear are things you can only really find on the $2,000 DJI Inspire 1. But the ready-to-fly Typhoon H was just $1,300 when it shipped in April and is currently $1,000 (AU$2,100, £1,000). To top it all off, the Typhoon H is available in a Pro version for $1,500 (£1,550, AU$3,000) which adds Intel's Realsense technology for advanced obstacle avoidance and downward-facing optical flow sensors to help you fly it if a GPS connection isn't available or is lost. (This Intel demo at CES shows just a bit of this system's capabilities.) Naturally, I had high expectations for the Typhoon H. I mean, I really like the Inspire 1, but it's simply not practical for anyone but professionals and enthusiasts with deep pockets. The Typhoon H offers comparable features (so much so DJI filed a lawsuit for patent infringement) in a more compact body and for a whole lot less money. You're getting a lot more drone for the price of DJI's top consumer drone, the Phantom 4. View full gallery Joshua Goldman/CNET Up, up and aw-hey, come back! For the first couple flights the Typhoon H performed really well. It handled wind with no issues and everything functioned as promised. There are two modes you can fly in, Angle and Smart. Angle moves the drone in the direction the control stick is pushed relative to the nose of the aircraft. Smart mode move it in the direction the right-hand control stick is pushed relative to the pilot and no matter which way the nose is pointed. Its Android-based ST16 Ground Station controller is somewhat unwieldy, takes seemingly forever to boot up and is not the most thoughtfully laid out or labeled, but it's great to have a 7-inch touchscreen built right in so you don't have to worry about attaching a phone or tablet. All the controls are at your fingertips for both the drone and camera. Transmission range for both video and control is rated at up to 1.6 km or 1 mile. Then it happened: While it was hovering in place (during a video shoot), it began to drift. When I went to correct it, the Typhoon H didn't respond to the controls, and sent itself into a tree. It didn't hit hard, but it was enough to snap one of its carbon-fiber arms in half and bust the camera mount, though the camera itself was fine. View full gallery Mark Licea/CNET Yuneec sent a second drone to test, but honestly, it took me awhile to attempt the retest because I was afraid of a repeat performance. Anyone who's experienced a flyaway knows how gut-wrenching it is to watch the drone uncontrollably crash or disappear into the distance. The fact is, though, flyaways happen. It's not unique to Yuneec and, in fact, on my DJI reviews you'll probably find at least one commenter asking me to do a web search for "DJI flyaway." But my Typhoon H problem was not an isolated incident: Yahoo's David Pogue and Videomaker.com's review of the Typhoon H point to flyaway problems similar to what I experienced.

Lattice is not consistently profitable going forward. 2004: Lattice restates financial results amid an accounting probe. 2005: Tsui and another executive are fired following shareholder allegations of excessive bonuses and lavish corporate spending. Steve Skaggs is named CEO. Lattice lays off 140. 2008: Skaggs is fired and replaced by Bruno Guilmart. 2009: Lattice posts its first profitable quarter in nearly three years. 2010: Guilmart quits unexpectedly, replaced by Intel veteran Darin Billerbeck 2015: Lattice moves from longtime Hillsboro headquarters to The U.S. Bancorp Tower (Big Pink) in downtown Portland, pays $600 million for California-based Silicon Image, and lays off roughly 200 workers in two rounds of job cuts. Portland’s biggest tech company, Lattice Semiconductor, sold Thursday to an obscure California investment firm that says its funding comes from China. Canyon Bridge Capital Partners said it will pay $1.3 billion for Lattice, or $8.30 per share. The offer represents a 30 percent premium over Lattice’s closing stock price Wednesday. Lattice’s shares shot up more than 18 percent on news of the deal, to $7.54. That’s well below Canyon Bridge’s offer price, though, reflecting skepticism about whether the little-known investment firm will be able to complete the deal. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland left his price target on Lattice at $7.50 despite the $8.30 offer, writing in a note to clients that he’s unsure Thursday’s deal will close given the uncertainty about Canyon Bridge’s ties to China and the firm’s track record. Canyon Bridge did not immediately respond to an inquiry about its background, portfolio or funding. Lattice’s sale would not be a surprise — the chip industry is undergoing a massive wave of consolidation — and the Portland company had topped the lists of takeover targets for more than a year. But the decision to sell to a unknown investment firm, instead of another chip company, is unexpected. California-based Canyon Bridge could be looking for opportunities to improve Lattice’s results before putting it on the market again. Just last week, Rolland said that Lattice would be an attractive acquisition for Xilinx, Qualcomm, Marvell or even Apple, which apparently is already a Lattice customer. On Thursday, though, Rolland told clients the Canyon Bridge deal faces uncertain prospects because of murky information around the investment firm. He noted that Canyon Bridge identifies its funding as coming from “limited partners in China.” In his note, Rolland said he believes the Chinese government is seeking to buy chip companies in other countries to integrate with a Shanghai-based company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. Lattice would be a neat fit, he wrote, because its chips are made by contractor manufacturers based on older technology of the kind SMIC uses. Additionally, Rolland said, Lattice is small enough, and its technology sufficiently low-tech, that a sale to Chinese investors would probably pass muster with United States regulators who review such deals for national security implications. For its part, Lattice said Thursday it expects business as usual under its new ownership. Historically, the company has had about 200 employees in Oregon, split between its Portland office and its former headquarters in Hillsboro. Lattice employed 1,146 worldwide at the start of the year. “Importantly, we will operate as a standalone subsidiary after the acquisition and do not expect any changes in our operations or our unwavering commitment to continued innovation for our customers,” Lattice chief executive Darin Billerbeck said in a written statement. The company told employees that its headquarters will remain in Portland. Lattice is the smallest of three companies that dominate the market for a kind of chip called a field programmable gate array. The programmable chips play supporting roles in everything from telecommunications networking equipment to digital cameras and TVs. Last year, Intel paid $16.7 billion for another programmable chip company, Altera. And Lattice had made deals of its own, paying $600 million last year for a California company called Silicon Image. Lattice reported $406.0 million in revenue last year, up from $366.1 million in 2014, before the Silicon Image deal. Lattice lost $159.5 million in 2015, including $93 million in restructuring, accounting and acquisition-related expenses. Founded in 1983 by alumni of Tektronix and Intel, Lattice literally trademarked the term “Silicon Forest.” It has never had an easy path, though. Lattice filed for bankruptcy in 1987, revived the business, then withstood a formidable downturn following the dot-com crash. It endured an accounting scandal in 2004 and fired longtime CEO Cyrus Tsui a year later amid shareholder accusations of lavish corporate spending. The company’s business rebounded somewhat in recent years by focusing on the low-end of the programmable chip business, but results were uneven and Lattice laid off workers in 2012 and twice last year. The buyer, Canyon Bridge, has no public track record and its website identifies no other companies in its portfolio. The firm lists a Palo Alto address and two partners, including former Cadence Design Systems CEO Ray Bingham. Lattice’s sale is the latest in a long string of deals for Oregon’s biggest tech companies. Earlier this year, Beaverton-based Cascade Microtech sold for $352 million and FEI Co. sold for $4.2 billion. Wilsonville-based Mentor Graphics, the state’s largest pure tech company, is under pressure from investors and has reportedly hired an investment bank to put itself on the market. All three of those companies serve the chip industry, which is consolidating as maturing businesses look to expand their markets and reduce costs by acquiring peers in related fields. Oregon tech, with no really big companies of its own, tends to be on the selling end of those transactions.

Big changes that the channel should already be aware of are coming in 2017, however. Intel channel chief Richard Steranka LAS VEGAS – Intel Security announced major achievements in its product integration strategy on Wednesday here at its Focus Security Conference. No channel announcements were made, but the channel strategy will follow the same course as the product one, along lines which have already been telegraphed to the channel. The company is emphasizing that independence as a separate company next spring will bring consistency rather than change on the channel front. “From a channel perspective, as Intel Security we operated the same way we operated before we integrated into Intel,” said Chris Young, SVP and GM of the Intel Security Group. “It has been the same group of channel partners throughout. We built in new leadership last year with Richard Steranka – and Ken McCray runs North American channels today. As we become an independent company, we don’t want to introduce any disruptions.” That doesn’t mean that significant channel change won’t appear at the new McAfee next spring. Those changes, however, are the continuation of actions that have already been in motion throughout 2016. The channel has already come a long way from the days when it was largely endpoint-centric, said Steranka, Head of Global Channel Operations at Intel Security. Some further steps are still required to keep the channel transformation in line with the company’s transformation from being focused on product to today’s focus not just on solutions, but on broadly integrated solutions. “This has been a 18 month evolution in product development, where tying them together has required some ground-up redevelopment,” Steranka said. “We are at the onset of stages where partners can begin to deploy the vision that we shared 18 months ago. That will require a skillset around architecting and deploying those solutions. The vision of where we are taking the platform lends itself to those channel priorities. Steranka said that this restructuring is also necessary to attract and retain top partners at a time when they are restructuring their own practices to focus on fewer, more strategic vendor partners. “The channel program is following the same direction that our strategic partners are already going in, where they are consolidating, going from having many vendors to having as few as five,” he said. “We want to be one of those strategic vendors. We have been reshaping the channel program as a result – not just around sales capabilities, but service capabilities and managed services capabilities based on our platform.” This will mean that compulsory alignment around services competencies, in line with sales ones which have already been implemented, will be coming. “We started with sales competencies, and the next iteration will be services competencies, and we will – be doing that in 2017,” Steranka said “Service capabilities exist today. We have 100 partners who have them authorized already. The difference is that 2017 will see it made compulsory. Today, Platinum partners need to have three of our sales competencies, and Gold partners need to have one. The services competencies will be aligned to this in the same way.” One change that was announced early this year will kick in at the end of Q4, the change in definition of the Platinum Tier from volume-based to value-based as defined by sales competencies. Another change which was related to partners at the start of Q3 for Q4 – but which was not announced publicly – is a new Platinum incentive rebate program. It applies only to that tier, about 5 per cent of Intel Security’s total partner base. The new rebate has three objectives, Steranka said. “We wanted to make it more rewarding for partners to drive new business growth, and this rebate is for new paper,” he said. “We also wanted to be simple. Partners told us that in the past, you needed a math degree to figure out our payouts. Finally, we also wanted partners to have more visibility to see where they were in the quarter in order to maximize the payouts.” Another change is that more professional services resources – 19 per cent — have been added in the calendar year. 11 per cent more will be added in the next couple of months. “We want the channel more heavily involved in professional services, and these resources will be a key part of our strategy there,” Steranka said. Steranka indicated the vendor is looking for more MSP partners. “More is better there,” he said. Intel Security has a focus on very large enterprises, where they have significant share there, and the mid-market, which has a partner-led strategy, is also very significant. The SMB sector is covered in some cases by Intel Security’s consumer group selling upmarket. MSPs are likely to become more critical to this segment going forward however, as the more complex integrated solutions become the dominant purchases. “These integrated solutions are aimed at a reasonably sophisticated and dedicated security team,” said Brian Dye, vice president in the Intel Security Group and general manager of the group’s global security products. “At the lower end of the market, customers will consume them through service providers. The most effective route to market for things like Dynamic Endpoints are through a MSP. That’s how we think about it.” Steranka also pointed to Intel Security’s decision to open source DXL, which they announced Wednesday at Focus, will be a big plus for partners. “With DXL structure moving to an even more open world, you don’t have to be a big tech vendor to do customized development with it,” he said. “By providing SDKs to be able to do it, we’ve opened doors for partners to be able to participate more fully. Their ability to add their own IP to the platform, especially around analytics orchestration and event management will all them to build in significant differentiation.” “There is a clear partner solution focus to DXL,” Dye said. “They can see a clear line of sight to a happy customer and more margin, just as they see benefit in us moving from a point product player to a solutions player.” Share the Buzz: Tweet More Email Print Share on Tumblr Related Also Buzzing on this topic: Intel Security to revamp program, incentives around new strategy Intel Security boosts requirements for top tiers New Intel Security channel chief Steranka aims to stay the course Intel Security channel chief sees channel partners becoming alliance partners Intel Security renames, revamps McAfee Partner Program Tags:Brian Dye Chris Young DXL Intel Security professional services Richard Steranka Post navigation ← Expanding Intel Security Innovation Alliance sees momentum in Open DXL Cisco joins the endpoint security fray → Add your own buzz: Comment Below Cancel reply Subscribe to the daily e-mail newsletter from ChannelBuzz.ca and get the latest Canadian channel news delivered to your desktop every weekday morning.

Not just one of the best Game Sevens, one of the best games period. If you’re an Indians fan, my condolences. The team had an amazing season, and the comeback last night was stirring. I did not foresee Rajai Davis hitting a home run off of Aroldis Chapman when he was choking up on the bat, and just trying to make contact. As a former denizen of the Windy City, I’m thrilled for Cubs fans. They waited 108 years! The last time the Cubs won a World Series, the Ottoman Empire was still around, the world’s tallest building had 47 floors and Henry Ford had just unveiled the Model T. As for the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was around 60. It’s now at 17,964. At least Cubs fans got paid while they waited… Going Virtual Sticking with the sports theme, Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) today announced the acquisition of Voke, a maker of special cameras that capture sports action from many angles, allowing broadcasters to bring fans into the action with immersive, 360-degree “virtual reality” experiences. The technology can also be used for concerts and other live events. It’s cool stuff. Based in Santa Clara, Intel’s home town, Voke is a small firm (15 employees), but its technology already has been used by the Sacramento Kings and at the NCAA Final Four and international soccer tournaments. This move expands Intel’s aggressive move into virtual reality sports experience, which also can be translated into video games. By promoting VR technologies, Intel hopes both to create new markets for its specialty semiconductors and further diversify its revenue stream beyond chips. And today Linda McDonough, chief strategist for Profit Catalyst Alert, is recommending another camera company that will cash in on drones and the virtual reality systems hitting shelves this holiday season. Friday’s Jobs Report The October jobs report, to be announced tomorrow, is expected to show a rebound in hiring after two solid but somewhat disappointing months. The consensus estimate is 175,000 jobs created. This will be the last jobs report before the election, and it could have an impact if it’s significantly better or worse than expected.   Economists also will be watching the workforce-participation number for a continued return of workers to the job market. If it’s strong enough, that actually raises the unemployment rate, but it would be considered a healthy sign that companies are continuing to hire. Unless jobs really tail off, all signs are go for the Fed to raise interest rates in December. (As expected, yesterday’s Fed meeting was a non-event; officials didn’t want to do anything to interfere with the election.)   Stock Talk — Post a comment Comment Guidelines Our Stock Talk section is reserved for productive dialogue pertaining to the content and portfolio recommendations of this service.

The $2 billion acquisition of Oculus by Facebook in 2014 lent the neo-futurist hobby a decidedly shortened timeline for consumer adoption. To the tech titans operating alongside it, the purchase was a signal. Mobile’s most prominent success story was setting its eyes on what could possibly be the next platform shift. To the companies that had been burned by mobile, this was a signal to act on virtual reality. It’s ironic, if not unsurprising, that so many of the companies investing heavily in VR and AR are the ones that screwed up the mobile revolution or lost control of it. HTC is actively positioning itself to turn VR into a core business as its handset sales collapse. Nokia, once the mobile phone market king, is building high-end virtual reality capture systems. Microsoft, which never seemed to strike a chord with Windows Mobile, is working heavily to build up Windows Holographic OS for headsets. Intel’s past decade has in many ways also been defined by its failure to capitalize on the demands and opportunities of the mobile platform shift. Decisions to cling to the past in terms of system architecture made it difficult for the company to keep up with companies like Qualcomm, Apple and Samsung. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to lay off nearly 12,000 employees and kill development on some of its Atom mobile chipsets. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich will be the first to tell you that his company’s mobile woes are its own doing. He sees his company’s virtual reality initiatives as very early-stage projects that could end up becoming a critical business for the nearly 50-year-old Intel, where he’s worked since joining as an engineer in 1982. That year, VR was mostly a futuristic dream captured by movies like Tron. VR has arguably arrived in 2016, yet there’s still a growing cynicism that current VR efforts are nothing more than a host of PR stunts for many wayward companies to feign innovation with modest R&D dollars. All of this was on my mind as I traveled to Intel’s Santa Clara headquarters to take an exclusive first look at the company’s virtual reality lab where it’s researching how to virtually replicate our sensory experiences. This research into how we see, hear and feel the world is feeding into the company’s first major head-mounted display initiative, Project Alloy. It’s a wireless standalone VR headset optimized for its own brand of VR — something it calls “merged reality.” The Mantra If Intel’s early tease of its Project Alloy wireless HMD brought gasps, the announcement that the headset would highlight a new type of interaction called “merged reality” ushered groans. When it comes to terminology, we already have virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality and, I think, real reality (though I’m growing less sure of that everyday). I’m not going to say that merged reality is a term that needs to be added to the dictionary, but the philosophy behind it is notable. Merged reality is basically a fusion of VR and computer vision that gives a virtual reality headset the ability to understand the context around it, including the people, places and things that are unique to the environment. The technology heavily relies on Intel’s RealSense computer vision camera arrays, which the company has also been using to power robots, drones and autonomous cars. When it comes to merged reality, RealSense enables the headset wearer to seemingly gaze through the display and see parts of the real world (like your body and other people) in a wholly virtual environment. Intel hopes that this technology will be able to let you seamlessly merge the impossible environments of VR with the physical complexities of reality. The Lab Intel’s Santa Clara campus is a machine at work. The mouse-clicking and mechanical keyboard-clacking of engineers offered a light hum as I marched down the hallways with a team of Intel execs and employees guiding me through increasingly strict levels of security access. The first thing I noticed on the first floor section of the lab was its emptiness. The lab was largely cleared of employees while I was there touring the facilities, and certain areas were cordoned off. The click-clack hum had also hushed; this section of the lab contained a state-of-the-art 3D sound chamber where Intel is studying dynamic audio for merged reality environments. The first friendly figure to greet me was a robotic arm encased in a sensor-adorned open cage. This is where Intel does much of its work related to studying hand movements and building the algorithms to let the company’s RealSense sensors track the gestures. While VR compatriots like Oculus, HTC and Sony have introduced motion-tracked controllers for interacting with VR content, Intel is hoping to bring its hand-tracking tech to a level of finesse that makes interaction seamless, though many experts see some major challenges ahead for building this as a primary input method. After waving goodbye to the tireless robo hand, I ventured up to an even emptier sixth floor where Intel was designing the inside-out tracking technologies that allow its Project Alloy headset to be completely wireless. Right now, most good VR is tethered, meaning that you have a very long cord running from the back of your headset off to an expensive computer pushing high-end graphics. These systems are also positionally tracked by external sensors so that the system knows exactly where you are as you move about. Conversely, Project Alloy relies on a pair of RealSense sensor arrays to track your position based on your relative proximity to objects within your environment. You don’t have to set anything up or drill anything into your walls; you just walk into a room and toss on the headset. Speaking of which… The Project After spending a bit of time with an insanely creepy-looking misshapen robotic head with camera eyes that Intel uses to test head-tracking on RealSense, I was prepped for my exclusive demo with Project Alloy. I first got a few new details on the hardware specs that the first-generation headset is running. The kit positionally tracks its location with a pair of DS4 RealSense cameras and relies on a Skylake chipset for application processing with an Intel Atom tackling the computer vision. Though it’s still in development, the next generation (dubbed “Alloy 2”) will gain a new RealSense 400 camera and will see an upgrade to a Kaby Lake processor, but most interestingly the headset will ditch the Atom and move to a visual processing unit from Movidius, one of Intel’s latest acquisitions. After a bit of geeking out, I resized the surprisingly comfortable headset and balanced it gently on my head. Though I played around with the headset for about 15 minutes, my impressions were immediate. Building headsets that need high-end PCs would seem like a fairly natural plan for a company that builds chipsets for high-end PCs.   Certain things were very crude, others were very sharp but overall it felt like a decidedly different VR device, if not more of an aspirational concept. The inside-out tracking on the prototype certainly worked but the precision of the DS4 RealSense cameras left more than a bit to be desired. The next-generation model will thankfully see the resolution of the depth camera triple which will allow for more precise tracking, giving everything a considerably more crisp feel. Ultimately, the overall hardware experiences that arrive next year from OEMs will be the more critical take. Intel was quick to point out that consumer hardware isn’t really its forte; it’s focusing more on throwing something together to showcase the underlying tech. “At Intel we specialize in the hardware and experience, but we’re not by any stretch of the imagination best at building physical devices,” Intel exec Tim Parker told me as he walked me through the demo. Alloy 2 will ultimately still be a reference design, albeit one that Intel will team up with “Microsoft and other partners” to refine the build on. Intel isn’t planning to move into the consumer hardware business anytime soon, but Krzanich hopes that the headset can establish these Intel technologies into the DNA of next-gen VR devices. “By the middle of next year, we’ll have Alloy done, open-sourced. That’s really our goal, you know. You open source this thing and allow everyone to build on it, kind of like the old Microsoft PC business,” said Krzanich. What I remain very curious about is how Intel will choose to move its tech into tethered merged reality experiences. It’s important to note that Intel already boasts a strong connection to tethered virtual reality thanks to those fancy desktop chipsets that it seems to make a few of. Interestingly, the executives I spoke to largely seemed to downplay the wireless nature of Alloy. In fact, the conversation often seemed to drift back to tethered VR pretty organically. “We could unfree you of the cord because we can put all of the compute in [the headset] and we can do all of the mapping, but if you really want the low-latency, high-end gaming, then [tethered VR] is always going to be the leading-end system,” Krzanich said. A major decision for Intel will come down to deciding whether merged reality is important enough to make the investment in producing a VR-specific chipset. Otherwise, building headsets that need high-end PCs would seem like a fairly natural plan for a company that builds chipsets for high-end PCs. Parker did not directly comment on whether the company was currently looking at VR-focused chipsets. The Vision With the demo under my belt, the only thing I could think of was where Intel goes from here. Alloy is, at its heart, an internal development kit, but there are so many directions open for the company to take it thanks to RealSense and Movidius. Through the course of several sit-downs with RealSense and Movidius executives, it became clear that Intel may have the virtual/augmented reality space a bit more figured out than it’s letting on. In a slightly cramped room, Achin Bhowmilk, VP of Intel’s Perceptual Computing Lab, showed me an advanced demo of the company’s latest RealSense model in a merged reality setting. The sensor array was not just mapping the space but identifying the objects within the multi-room environment. A feed of the capture session ran as the sensor identified a table and four chairs within the space to varying percentages of certainty. “The idea behind this product was to build in the ability to sense and understand the world,” Bhowmilk told me. This system is a far cry from the RealSense tech I’ve used on PCs. RealSense’s first incarnations were a bit of a mess. What was dreamed up as a new method of human computer interaction was introduced to consumers in the form of a clunky, if not largely useless, PC input system that simply was not ready for primetime. With virtual reality, RealSense has earned a computing platform more deserving of its computer vision agility. Krzanich told me that one day he hopes to have this tech be able to identify people from your contacts for you while you’re strolling about and then bring up the appropriate notifications in your field-of-view. “RealSense was originally thought up in our labs; we were trying to think about how the keyboard and the mouse have been around for 20 years now—how it’s been the same way we interact with computers—and so we thought that maybe we could release peoples’ hands from them,” Krzanich said. “Then a bunch of us were just playing with virtual reality over the last year and started to realize that you were kind of limited by those setups.” At Intel we specialize in the hardware and experience, but we’re not by any stretch of the imagination best at building physical devices. — Tim Parker, Intel exec   RealSense gives spatial and contextual awareness to headsets, and Alloy gives hardware manufacturers a more accessible reference to integrate the tracking tech into their own products. The thing is, a great deal of these headset makers will already be using Intel tech, in the form of chips belonging to Intel’s soon-to-be-acquired Movidius. Movidius’s low-power Myriad 2 visual processing unit has become an industry standard amongst HMD manufacturers for its computer vision chops. Movidius was an early partner for Google’s Project Tango smartphone AR system and has announced partnerships with Lenovo to collaborate on VR devices. Myriad 2’s early ubiquity is certainly to Intel’s advantage as it looks to bring RealSense to more devices. RealSense and Movidius will undoubtedly be growing cozier, but Krzanich insists that Movidius will still be sold as a standalone product though it’s clear that both sides hope to see the products integrate quite closely. “We’ll continue to drive enhancements to the Movidius architecture, and what we’ll try to do moving forward is understand how that architecture can best be merged or connected to Intel architecture,” Krzanich said. Movidius CEO Remi El-Ouazzane also sees his product becoming more optimized for the RealSense platform, which he noted he’s been excited to closely integrate and “use the hell out of.” “Today, the truth is [the Movidius platform] is entirely agnostic,” the Movidius CEO told me. “I think that could change, I think we need to develop, with Intel, the competitive edge that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.” The Future Many of the biggest proponents of virtual reality only see it as a holdover technology for augmented reality tech that will overlay digital images onto the world around us. Intel seems to be rather interested in observing how VR eventually morph into AR. Augmented reality is an exciting—if not suspiciously secretive—space. Developers have access to Microsoft’s HoloLens headset at the moment and the Meta 2 development kit will start shipping soon despite delays, but details are still scant regarding some of the other heavily hyped head-mounted display manufacturers. Magic Leap, which has raised nearly $1.4 billion from investors including Google and Alibaba, has yet to show off so much as a prototype of their upcoming headset. And though sources close to the company have told me that Apple is currently building multiple “mixed reality-type” headset prototypes based on different display technologies, there has been no official word from Cupertino regarding an actual product. Many of these headsets may have one item in common however, that being Movidius. “I’ll say very humbly that there is no big AR platform out there not using Movidius,” El-Ouazzane told me. He also detailed that Movidius technology was enabling its partners to miniaturize the head-worn glasses on many of these augmented reality systems by moving compute to pocket devices. He believes that inconspicuous form factors will help improve reception of the devices. “At the end of the day we should all have learned our lesson from the ‘glasshole syndrome.’ AR glasses will have to be devices that weigh 25 and 30 grams and will be fairly interesting devices to wear,” he detailed. “The vision, no pun intended, is to have as low electronics as possible so it will be a vision processor and a variety of components in terms of display with all the compute being taken care by what you have in your pocket which most likely will be your smartphone. That’s where all the AR engagement we have is.” There is no big AR platform out there not using Movidius. — Remi El-Ouazzane   Though Krzanich stressed in our conversations that the industry is “a year or two away from getting the optics tech needed for augmented reality,” he hinted that Intel already has “all kinds of development” going on in the AR space currently. Merged reality is a fascinating venture into closing the gap between VR and AR. While Project Alloy is an early venture with apparent shortcomings, it’s clear that Intel is laying out plenty of runway for the company’s VR efforts. These efforts will continue to build out the computer vision and visual processing acuity necessary for more robust augmented reality devices and experiences. Intel is taking its time. Neither Movidius or RealSense are going entirely all-in on VR/AR headsets; each of them is also focusing its talents on other, more imminent, tech platforms as well, such as autonomous driving, security systems and drones. Project Alloy and merged reality give the company a clear product and product class to begin building up its efforts in the broader space across VR and AR. Predicting the next computing platform or distinguishing fad from future has never been an exact science, but Intel understands what’s at stake here with AR/VR and is setting itself up well to ensure that it doesn’t lose touch with these realities.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | November 3, 2016 -- 17:34 GMT (10:34 PDT) | Topic: Virtual Reality Voke's TrueVR platform. Intel is buying virtual reality startup Voke VR in an effort to build out a portfolio of services for its new immersive sports business. The end goal for Intel is to have the ability to broadcast live events in VR. What's Hot on ZDNet Why Samsung's Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now Nintendo announces release date for Super Mario Run on iOS Why automation is finally revolutionizing quick service restaurants and what it means for jobs Major Linux security hole gapes open Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it includes Voke's technology and platforms, talent, and clientele. Founded in 2004 and headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., Voke is a strong player in the virtual reality segment. The company was previously backed by Intel and the Sacramento Kings, the latter of which used the investment to offer VR live streams of its NBA games. Voke's platform includes a proprietary paired lens and stereoscopic capture system that make its VR streams look more realistic in terms of depth and proportion. Voke's videos can be viewed on multiple platforms including PCs, tablets, smartphones, and VR headsets. According to Intel, Voke's platform was designed for simple integration into existing broadcaster and league channels -- something the chipmaker highlighted as one of the key factors in buying the startup. "Together, we can innovate and scale our new immersive sports business faster to bring fans the most personalized, fully immersive VR experience ever imagined and change the way networks, sports leagues and teams engage with their audiences," said James Carwana, GM of Intel Sports Group. Intel's new sports division also includes the freeD technology team, which came to Intel after the company acquired Replay Technologies in March. Both Replay and Voke help round out Intel's portfolio of VR technology, as the chip giant works to expand beyond its legacy business.

Click here to register and download your free 30-day trial of Intel® Parallel Studio XE. Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) is a performance library for data analytics that provides optimized building blocks for data analysis and machine learning on Intel® platforms. The functions in Intel DAAL cover all the stages of data processing in machine learning, from preprocessing, transformation, analysis, and modeling to decision-making. For each stage of processing, Intel DAAL includes functions and utilities that are optimized for Intel® architecture, including Intel® Atom™, Intel® Core™, Intel® Xeon®, and Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors. Intel DAAL supports batch, online, and distributed processing modes, and it supports three programming APIs: C++, Java*, and Python*. Here, we’ll explore a C++ example of the Intel DAAL application in handwritten digit recognition—a classical type of machine learning problem. Several application algorithms are relevant. Support vector machine (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), Naïve Bayes, and neural network can all be used to tackle this problem with different prediction accuracy. Intel DAAL includes most of these algorithms. We have chosen SVM to demonstrate how a library algorithm in Intel DAAL can be used in handwritten digit recognition. Loading Data in Intel DAAL In handwritten digit recognition, recognition is essentially the prediction or inference stage in the machine learning pipeline. Given a handwritten digit, the system should be able to recognize or infer what digit was written. For a system to be able to predict the output with a given input, it needs a trained model learned from the training data set that provides the system with the capability to make an inference or prediction. The first step before constructing a training model is to collect training data. For our sample application, we are using public data downloadable from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, where there are 3,823 preprocessed training data and 1,797 preprocessed testing data. Intel DAAL supports several data formats (CSV, SQL, HDFS, and KDB+), as well as user-defined data formats. In our example, we’ll use the CSV format. Let’s assume we store the training data in a file named digits_tra.csv and the testing data in a file named digits_tes.csv. Intel DAAL provides some utilities to help load data into memory from the data source. Here, we first define the object trainDataSource, which is a CSVFeatureManager that can load the data from a CSV file into memory. Inside Intel DAAL, data in memory are stored as a numerical table. With CSVFeatureManager, a numeric table is automatically created. To load the data from the CSV file, simply invoke the member function loadDataBlock(). Now the data are loaded into memory as a numeric table that is ready for further computation. The core parts of the C++ codes for loading the training data from the CSV file are shown in Figure 1. /* Input data set parameters */
    string trainDatasetFileName = "digits_tra.csv";
    string testDatasetFileName = "digits_tes.csv";

/* Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve input data from .csv file */
    FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> trainDataSource(trainDatasetFileName,
    DataSource::doAllocateNumericTable, DataSource::doDictionaryFromContext);

/* Load data from the data files */
    trainDataSource.loadDataBlock(nTrainObservations); Figure 1 - C++ codes for loading training data Training SVM-Based Handwritten Digit Recognition Model Now that the training data are loaded into memory, it is ready to learn from the data and build a training model. We pick the SVM algorithm for training. In this example, since the training data set is small, data can be fit into memory all at once. We’ll use batch processing mode for our demonstration. After an algorithm is defined, set the related parameters needed for algorithm, such as the number of classes (in this case, 10). Then the training data is passed to algorithm via the training data numeric table trainDataSource.getNumericTable(). By invoking algorithm.compute(), the SVM computation is active. After that, training is complete. The trained model is embedded in the object trainingResult, which is obtained by invoking algorithm.getResult(). The sample codes of the training process are shown in Figure 2. services::SharedPtr<svm::training::Batch<> > training(new
    svm::training::Batch<>());

/* Create algorithm object for multi-class SVM training */
    multi_class_classifier::training::Batch<> algorithm;
    algorithm.parameter.nClasses = nClasses;
    algorithm.parameter.training = training;

/* Pass training dataset and dependent values to the algorithm */
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::training::data,
    trainDataSource.getNumericTable());

/* Build multi-class SVM model */
    algorithm.compute();

/* Retrieve algorithm results */
    trainingResult = algorithm.getResult();

/* Serialize the learned model into a disk file */
    ModelFileWriter writer("./model");
    writer.serializeToFile(trainingResult->get(classifier::training::model)); Figure 2 - Sample process training codes Intel DAAL also provides serialization functions that can read out the trained model from memory into a file and deserialization functions that can load the trained model file into memory. As shown in the last two lines of codes in Figure 2, we define a ModelFileWriter that writes to a file named model. By invoking writer.serializeToFile(), the trained model embedded in trainingResult is written to the file named model. This serialization/deserialization utility is useful in a case where, after training, a server can port the trained model to a client, and the client can do the prediction or inference using the trained model without training. We will see how this model file is utilized in the section "Handwritten Digit Recognition Application." Testing the Trained Model With the trained model, we can do testing. As we did for training, we store the testing data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in a CSV file and load it with testDataSource. loadDataBlock(). We still need to define the SVM algorithm object algorithm for prediction. We have two inputs for algorithm: the testing data and the trained model. Testing data are passed by testDataSource.getNumericTable(). In batch testing, the trained model is passed by a pointer of trainingResult->get(). (In the section "Handwritten Digit Recognition Application," we will see how to pass the trained model by a file.) After setting up algorithm inputs, calling algorithm.compute() will complete the testing process. The sample codes for testing are shown in Figure 3. The predicted results after testing are retrievable by calling algorithm.getResult(). services::SharedPtr<svm::prediction::Batch<> > prediction(new
    svm::prediction::Batch<>());

/* Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve the test data from .csv file */
    FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> testDataSource(testDatasetFileName,
        DataSource::doAllocateNumericTable,
        DataSource::doDictionaryFromContext);
    testDataSource.loadDataBlock(nTestObservations);

/* Create algorithm object for prediction of multi-class SVM values */
    multi_class_classifier::prediction::Batch<> algorithm;

    algorithm.parameter.prediction = prediction;

/* Pass testing dataset and trained model to the algorithm */
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::data,
        testDataSource.getNumericTable());
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::model,
        trainingResult->get(classifier::training::model));

/* Predict multi-class SVM values */
    algorithm.compute();

/* Retrieve algorithm results */
    predictionResult = algorithm.getResult(); Figure 3 - Sample codes for testing Intel DAAL also includes functions to calculate the quality metrics, such as the confusion matrix, average accuracy, error rate, etc. With SVM, for the test data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the quality metrics are shown in Figure 4, where 99.6 percent average accuracy is achieved for the whole test data. Figure 4 - Quality metrics SVM Performance Comparison between Intel DAAL and scikit-learn* The SVM algorithm is a classic algorithm that many machine learning frameworks or libraries have in their packages. scikit-learn* is a popular Python library for machine learning. In the scikit-learn SVM classification example, the same training and testing data are used for a handwritten digit application. We compared the SVM performance between Intel DAAL and scikit-learn for both training and prediction. The results are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 - SVM performance boosts using Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL) versus scikit-learn* on an Intel® CPU The comparison is done on a system with two-socket Intel® Xeon® processors E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50 GHz, 24 cores, 30 MB L3 cache per CPU, 256 GB RAM. The operating system used is Red Hat Enterprise Linux* Server release 6.6, 64 bit. The versions of libraries used are Intel DAAL 2016 Update 2 and scikit-learn 0.16.1. As shown in Figure 5, for both training and testing, SVM in Intel DAAL outperforms scikit-learn. In training, SVM in Intel DAAL is 6.77x faster than scikit-learn, and in testing or prediction, SVM in Intel DAAL is 11.25x faster than scikit-learn. Handwritten Digit Recognition Application As mentioned earlier, the trained model learned in a server can be ported to a client for its application. Here we have a simple handwritten digit recognition application where the trained model is ported. There is only prediction or testing in this interactive application. The snapshot of the interface of the application is shown in Figure 6 as a Doodle Frame. In the Doodle Frame, there are two white panel boxes. The left big white box is where a digit from 0 to 9 can be written one at a time; the right small white box displays the digit that the system believes is written on the left panel. In Figure 6, the number 3 is handwritten in the left box, and the system recognizes that number and then displays the inferenced result, 3, in the right box. Figure 6 - Digital recognition application For this application, we are only testing or predicting one digit at a time. For any written digit, a test CSV file is generated that contains the features that are extracted from the handwritten digit by using some preprocessing techniques. (The preprocessing is beyond the scope of this article and will not be covered.) Now that we have the test data, we still need a trained model for the object algorithm as inputs. As mentioned above, we have already built a trained model, and have actually written the model in a file named model. Now it is time to load that trained model from the file, which means deserializing the model into memory. We define a ModelFileReader to read from the file named model by calling reader.deserializeFromFile(pModel). The trained model is loaded into memory, where pModel is the pointer to the model. The C++ codes are shown in Figure 7, where most of the codes are the same as in Figure 3. After algorithm.compute(), we get the prediction result predictionResult1, which contains the label, or the predicted number, for the given input digit. services::SharedPtr<svm::prediction::Batch<> > prediction1(new
    svm::prediction::Batch<>());

/* Initialize FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> to retrieve the test data from .csv file */
    FileDataSource<CSVFeatureManager> testDataSource(testDatasetFileName,
        DataSource::doAllocateNumericTable,
        DataSource::doDictionaryFromContext);
    testDataSource.loadDataBlock(1);

/* Create algorithm object for prediction of multi-class SVM values */
    multi_class_classifier::prediction::Batch<> algorithm;

algorithm.parameter.prediction = prediction1;

/* Deserialize a model from a disk file */
    ModelFileReader reader("./model");
    services::SharedPtr<multi_class_classifier::Model> pModel(new
multi_class_classifier::Model());
    reader.deserializeFromFile(pModel);

/* Pass testing dataset and trained model to the algorithm */
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::data,
testDataSource.getNumericTable());
    algorithm.input.set(classifier::prediction::model, pModel);

/* Predict multi-class SVM values */
    algorithm.compute();

/* Retrieve algorithm results */
    predictionResult1 = algorithm.getResult();

/* Retrieve predicted labels */
    predictedLabels1 = predictionResult1->get(classifier::prediction::prediction); Figure 7 - C++ codes Summary Intel DAAL provides the building blocks for the whole pipeline in machine learning. With the SVM C++ code snippets, we’ve shown how to use Intel DAAL in an application: specifically, how to load data from a file, how to build the training model, and how to apply the trained model in the application. Since the functions in Intel DAAL are optimized for Intel architecture, developers can get the best performance by using the building blocks in Intel DAAL on Intel platforms for machine learning applications. As we’ve seen, SVM in Intel DAAL outperforms SVM in scikit-learn.

Editorial Note This article is in the Product Showcase section for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Click here to register and download your free 30-day trial of Intel® Parallel Studio XE. Java* has long been a favorite developer language—one that is gaining traction with enterprise, embedded, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Intel® VTune™ Amplifier power and performance profiler (part of the Intel® software tools suite) has been profiling managed code like Java and .NET for quite some time. Python* has also become a popular programming language due to its ease of programming and ability to integrate systems more efficiently. With the growth in popularity of these two different programming languages, it’s important to make sure applications are effectively using the available CPU capabilities. In response to these demands, Intel VTune Amplifier has extended its profiling capability to both Java- and Python-based applications. Here we explore using Intel VTune Amplifier to gain more understanding about how an application is performing. What is Intel VTune Amplifier? Intel VTune Amplifier is a performance and power profiler that can help you discover the specific modules/processes that are taking more CPU time (hotspots). It can also help catch issues at the microarchitectural level (e.g., cache misses, page walks, TLB issues, and others) through a sampling technology with minimal overhead. Why Application Performance Profiling? Application performance profiling is necessary to figure out the various code blocks that are consuming more CPU clock cycles. This kind of information can be retrieved by manually inserting timing APIs. But manual inspection and discovering the module that is causing problems takes more time when your project has many modules. Intel VTune Amplifier offers many profilers that can help drill down to the issue. Intel VTune Amplifier Features Intel VTune Amplifier has various features that make it intuitive and easy to use. It: Uses sampling technology, which has a minimal overhead compared to instrumentation used for profiling. Is an easy-to-use profiler with various grouping/filters/caller-callee options, which can help to focus on the problematic code. Can provide the information at source level and assembly level. Can provide various types of microarchitectural information about the application. Profiling a Java Application There are four steps to profiling a Java application: Create an Intel VTune Amplifier Project. Select the Application/Process to Profile. Select the type of analysis. Collect the results and interpret. Create an Intel VTune Amplifier Project on a Windows* System First, set up the environment variables with the amplxe-vars batch file. For example, if you installed Intel VTune Amplifier using the default directory, type: C:\[Program Files]\IntelSWTools\VTune Amplifier XE\amplxe-vars.bat The batch file displays the product name and the build number. Next, launch Intel VTune Amplifier. For a standalone GUI interface, run the amplxe-gui command. Or, for command-line interface, run the amplxe-cl command. Create an Intel VTune Amplifier project (standalone version only): Click the menu button in the right corner and go to New > Project. Specify the project name and location in the Create Project dialogue box. Note: If you are working on a Linux* platform, see Getting Started with Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE 2016 for Linux* OS to learn how to create a new project. Select the Application/Process to Profile In the Analysis Target tab, select a target system from the left pane and select an analysis target type from the right pane. You can: Launch an application to be profiled using Launch Application. Attach the profiler to an application that is already running using Attach to Process. Observe an application’s interaction with system calls by selecting Profile System. If you select Launch Application, provide the path to the java.exe file in the Application field and a set of parameters like "Java options" or "prop files" in the Application parameters (Figure 1). Additionally, you can give the set of environment variables that your application might need to run in the User-Defined Environment variables field. Alternatively, define a *.bat file with the various environment variables, java.exe binary, and parameters and provide this *.bat file in the Application field rather than the java.exe file. Figure 1 - Choose target and analysis type Select the Type of Analysis Switch to the Analysis Type tab, select the Basic Hotspots analysis type, and click Start. Collect the Results and Interpret We have used the SPECjbb2000 benchmark for this example. Once the data collection and finalization are done, a Summary tab opens showing the various metrics. Let’s interpret some of the metrics here: In the first section of the Summary Tab (Figure 2), we see the Elapsed Time of the application (wall clock time from start to stop of an application), CPU Time (time during which the application was actively utilizing the CPU), Total Thread Count (number of threads that were deployed in our application). Figure 2 - Elapsed time The second section of the Summary tab (Figure 3) shows Top Hotspots, which are the functions that account for the most CPU time. In our example, we have the top five hotspots, with the first hotspot accounting for 13.165 seconds. However, we can observe that we have both [Dynamic code] and [Compiled Java code] under the Module column, which are Java methods that cannot be attributed to any module in terms of native binary. All Java user methods are attributed to the [Compiled Java code] module. Also, JVM can generate some methods for its internal usage and report them to the Java profiler. Such methods are attributed to the [Dynamic code] module. Figure 3 - Top hotspots The third section of the Summary tab (Figure 4) includes the CPU Usage Histogram, which visualizes the number of logical cores being used to run the application. The color coding signifies how Intel VTune Amplifier classifies the number of cores used by the application as Idle, Poor, OK, and Ideal. Figure 4 - CPU usage histogram We can retrieve more details by looking at the Bottom-Up tab (Figure 5), where we have the timeline view to visualize the workload on the threads with various groupings and filters and focus on a specific time interval. We can further drill down to the sources by double-clicking on the function/module of interest. Figure 5 - Bottom-Up tab To quickly start optimizing code, it is helpful to drill down to a specific source file location. In addition to the source, we can also see the highlighted the corresponding assembly generated for a given source line (Figure 6). Figure 6 - Assembly generated for a source line Besides knowing the modules that are consuming most of the CPU resources using the Basic Hotspots analysis type, we can find the context switches and transitions between threads using the Concurrency Analysis type (Figure 7). The yellow lines signify the transitions between threads. Figure 7 - Concurrency analysis Use the General Exploration analysis type to perform an architectural analysis to deep dive and understand the various issues related to caches, TLBs, page walks, false sharing, and many more. Profiling a Python Application Python profiling is a new feature in the 2017 version of Intel VTune Amplifier. See the article, "Getting Your Python* Code to Run Faster Using Intel® VTune™ Amplifier XE," in Issue 25 of Parallel Universe magazine to learn how to get started with Intel VTune Amplifier for profiling Python applications. The article focuses on mixed-mode profiling, resolving symbols of *.pyd modules, and setting up the compiler and linker flags for Cython* compilation. Mixed-Mode Profiling Python is an interpreting language and doesn’t use a compiler to generate binary execution code. Cython is also an interpreting language (but a C-extension), and it can be built to native code. Intel VTune Amplifier 2017 can fully support reporting hotspot functions in both Python and Cython code. Cython works in a two-step process: Convert a *.pyx (Cython) file into a *.c file Compile this *.c file into a *.pyd file (equivalent of a .so on Linux) The sample being used for this example is a matrix multiplication of 512*512 size. Below are the steps for generating the *.pyd files and using VTune Amplifier to resolve the symbols: Set up the setup.py file with extensions and compiler and linker flags, which allows you to use Cython to convert the *.pyx source code from Python to C. #setup.py
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
from distutils.extension import Extension
from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

setup(
    cmdclass = {'build_ext': build_ext},
    ext_modules = [Extension('Matrix_mul', sources=["Matrix_mul.pyx"],
        extra_compile_args=['/Z7'],
        extra_link_args=['/DEBUG']),
    ],
) In the setup.py file above, extensions were created with compiler flags /Z7 and linker flags /DEBUG to generate the debug symbols. Including flags is important if we want to drill down to the source level in Intel VTune Amplifier. If you are working on Linux platforms, use -g both in extra_compile_args and extra_link_args. Call Python with the following command to convert it to C using Cython: python setup.py build_ext This command generates the corresponding *.c and *.pyd module. In our case, we should see Matrix_mul.c and Matrix_mul.pyd. Since we have also requested the generation of symbolic information, we should see a *.pdb file as well. Create a Python script importing the Matrix_mul.pyd module as shown below : #simple.py
import Matrix_mul
Matrix_mul.func(); Use the Basic Hotspots analysis type in Intel VTune Amplifier 2017 to analyze the application with simple.py as the parameter to the Python interpreter (Figure 8). Figure 8 - Choose target and analysis type Once the Basic Hotspots analysis completes, the modules/functions can be seen on the Bottom-Up tab (Figure 9). Figure 9 - Modules/functions In this example, the Matrix_mul.pyd module (converted module) is one of the top hotspots that is consuming most of the CPU time. In the Filter section at the bottom of the page, we have selected "Only user functions" as we were interested in analyzing/profiling the user code alone. To view the user- and system-level functions and their interaction, select "User/system functions." We can further drill down into each of these source files to figure out the issue at the specific source line of these modules. We can also see the corresponding assembly for the C code being generated. By double-clicking the first user-function hotspot above, we get the corresponding source file as shown in Figure 10. Figure 10 - Clicking the first user-function hotspot Using the Source View, we can relate the generated C code for a corresponding Python code (Line 1052-1058, corresponds to Python code). Using this data, a user can focus on a problematic piece/module of Python code identified by Intel VTune Amplifier and begin optimization. Use the Caller/Callee tab to see the caller-callee for the selected function/module (Figure 11). Figure 11 - Caller/Callee tab Summary Intel VTune Amplifier can be used to narrow down performance analysis to the specific code that is consuming more CPU time (hotspots) in Java or Python applications. This is possible for both pure Python application as well as mixed Python/Cython code.

Check Point, Huawei and other industry leaders have joined the partner ecosystem aimed at providing an integrated, connected security ecosystem that maximises customer investments in security infrastructure. The number of partner companies that already have or are developing technology integrations with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL) has doubled in the past year, according to Intel Security.   The announcement comes just a day after Intel Security announced that it would be opening up DXL for any organisation to use to enable real-time threat intelligence sharing between different point products in their infrastructure. McAfee DXL provides a standardised integration and communications fabric for products regardless of underlying proprietary architecture. This open security architecture enables organisations to integrate their security systems and gain visibility across their IT environment, analysing data more efficiently and yielding more available and actionable intelligence, said Intel Security. “In today’s quickly evolving threat landscape, security products that do not interact with each other not only increase operational cost, they increase risk,” said DJ Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “By joining forces with industry leaders, the alliance is providing a truly integrated, unified security ecosystem, enabling rapid deployment, simplified management and maximised protection,” he said. The integration between McAfee DXL, McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and Check Point firewall products is aimed at enabling intelligence sharing and workflow optimisation. Read more about Intel Security Intel Security has detailed a wave of product innovations at Focus 2016, with more to come when it is spun out as an independent company under the McAfee banner. Pure-play cyber security has real value, says incoming McAfee head Chris Young. Intel Security adjusts its channel strategy in response to a market shift towards services-based security. According to the alliance, real-time communication between these products allows customers to scale and automate their security environment to save time and resources. Huawei and Intel Security will work to provide indicators of compromise (IOC) data alerts to McAfee DXL and McAfee TIE, providing dynamic behaviour analytics and intelligence sharing to customers. The alliance also announced that Intel Security products McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) now integrate with Intel alliance partner HPE Aruba’s ClearPass product. This cross-supplier integration covers threat intelligence sharing, and automatic detection and remediation, the alliance said. In the past year, the alliance said Intel Security and alliance partner MobileIron have integrated systems to solve the key challenges of extending data protection to mobile devices, addressing mobile threat protection and unifying admin workflows and user experience between mobile and endpoint devices. It said partner customers will now have the added capability of user behaviour analytics (UBA) to accelerate attack detection and incident response, and to pinpoint anomalies in real time. UBA automates the detection of attacks and risk behaviours inside an organisation and can dramatically reduce the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events, the alliance said. Through their integration with McAfee ESM, alliance partners now providing UBA include CyberArk, Exabeam, Fortscale, Gurucul, Interset, Niara and Securonix.   CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Young focused on his vision for the new company, its roadmap for achieving that, the need for rapid innovation and the importance of cross-industry collaboration. “One of the things I love about this conference is that we all come together to find ways to win, to work together,” he said. First, Young highlighted the publication of the book The Second Economy – the race for trust, treasure and time in the cyber security war. The main objective of the book is to help chief information security officers (CISOs) communicate the battles facing everyone to others in the c-suite. “So that we can recruit them into our fight. We need to enlist others on our journey if we are to be successful,” he said. Challenging assumptions The book is also aimed at encouraging information security professionals to challenge their own assumptions. “I plan to send two copies of this book to the winner of the US presidential election, because cyber security is going to be one of the most important topics they could possibly face,” said Young. “The book is about giving more people a view of the dynamism of what we face in cyber security, which is why we have to challenge our assumptions continually,” he said. “That is why we challenge our assumptions in the book as well as our assumptions about what we do every day.” Young said Intel Security had been asking thousands of customers to challenge the company’s assumptions over the past 18 months so it can improve. “This week, we are going to bring a lot of that feedback to life in the delivery of a tremendous amount of innovation across our entire portfolio,” he said. Young then used a video to underline the message that the McAfee brand is built on the belief that there is power in working together, and that no one person, product or organisation can provide total security. Read more about Intel Security There is real value in being totally focused on cyber security, according to incoming McAfee chief executive Chris Young. Intel Security adjusts its channel strategy in response to a market shift towards services-based security. Intel to raise $3.1bn by spinning off security business. Security industry needs to do more, says Intel Security head Chris Young. By enabling protection, detection and correction to work together, the company believes it can react to cyber threats faster. By linking products from different providers to work together, the company believes the security of networks becomes better. By bringing companies together to share threat intelligence, better ways can be found to protect each other. The company said cyber crime is the greatest challenge of the digital age, and this can only be overcome by working together. It revealed a new tagline: “Together is power”. The video also revealed the new independent company’s logo, which Young called a symbol of its new beginning and a visual representation of what is core to the company’s strategy. “The shield means defence, and the two interlocking components are a symbol of the togetherness we are about in the industry,” he said. “The red colour is a callback to our legacy in the industry.” Three main reasons for independence According to Young, there are three main reasons behind the decision to become an independent company. First, is to be completely focused on cyber security at a company level, solving customers’ cyber security problems and dealing with customers’ cyber security challenges. Second is innovation. “Because we are committed and dedicated to cyber security alone at company level, our innovation is centred around it,” said Young. Third is growth. “Our industry is moving faster than any other sub-segment of IT. We have to grow as quickly, if not more quickly than everything that is happening in our space,” he said. The new company will have 7,500 employees and more than $2bn in revenue with a growing profit base. “Because we are committed and dedicated to cyber security alone at company level, our innovation is centred around it” Chris Young, Intel Security “The challenges in our industry have moved on and so must we,” said Young. “We are looking forward, and will accelerate what we are doing as a new organisation so we can be better at solving security challenges in the future.” He added that in the past year, the company has invested more than $500m in research and development. Record numbers According to Young, the company also has 21% more engineers than at the start of 2016, as well as 25% more product managers and 19% more professional services staff, with another 11% to come in the next few months. “This week, we are announcing 18 new product and partner innovations – a release across every single part of our product portfolio, in addition to the integration of new partners. It is a record number of solutions and innovations for any year in this company’s history,” he said. He detailed some of these innovations, before announcing the company’s decision to make the McAfee data exchange layer (DXL) available to everyone in the industry for real-time threat intelligence sharing between different point products in their infrastructure. “We are doing this because it is the right thing for our industry in order to move forward,” he said, calling on attendees to challenge every supplier they do business with to integrate with DXL. “There are no more excuses. In the past, suppliers said they could not integrate with DXL because they first had to become members of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. But there is no excuse now. It is open. Everybody can use it,” said Young. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Intel acquires Voke VR as it moves into immersive sports tech Posted Nov 3, 2016 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden), Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story YouTube upgrades its comments system to give creators more control Intel has made another acquisition to build out its virtual reality strategy and business: the chip giant has acquired a startup called VOKE, which specialises in immersive sports video experiences, and counted both Intel and the Sacramento Kings among its investors. Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed but Intel tells me that it is acquiring VOKE’s technology, talent and existing business, which included broadcasting NBA games in the U.S. and Kabaddi tournaments in India. Voke will become a part of a new division called Intel Sports Group, the company tells me. The core of VOKE’s business is a product it markets as TrueVR, which is based around a special stereoscopic camera that is used to record experiences, as well as software to then deliver it to various devices. (The camera is pictured above.) In Intel’s view, it’s the special lens and capturing system, along with the fact that the final product can be viewed on a range of devices and through different channels (Internet, broadcast, etc) that is what attracted Intel. “VOKE’s technology lets fans be where the action is without ever leaving their living rooms,” said James Carwana, GM of the Intel Sports Group, in a statement. Notably, the VR experiences can be delivered live, which opens up an interesting market for how VR could be used in a number of real-time, mass market use cases. Sports, with its focus on action and close-up visuals, is an obvious end point for VR technology, and Intel has been positioning itself as a large player in the latter market as it looks to find a place in newer, emerging areas to offset declines in its legacy business. So it’s no surprise to know that Intel has been wedging itself into a number of sports-related activities in recent times. They have included the X-Games in Aspen and the NBA All-Star Weekend. The new Intel Sports division will also include its freeD technology team, which joined Intel when the company acquired Replay Technologies earlier this year. “We’re making great progress bringing innovative technology and amazing experiences to the world of sports, but there’s more to come,” Carwana notes. Intel has some pretty ambitious goals when it comes to bringing immersive sports entertainment to people’s living rooms. VOKE and Replay Technologies will be a big part of that. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich spoke to TechCrunch recently about his goals for taking the massive amount of 3D data from Replay and turning it into an immersive live sports experience for fans. “Right now we have about a two-minute delay between when the [Replay data] comes off the field and when we can finish the stitching,” Krzanich told TechCrunch. “We think in two, maybe two-and-a-half years, we can get it down so that there’s milliseconds of latency and we can compress the files such that it’s more easily managed.” With that in mind, he says, you could create an entire 3D stitch of the stadium, and a viewer could capture the perspective of the game from anywhere. Companies like NextVR are already setting up stereoscopic camera rigs on the sidelines to give viewers points-of-view they wouldn’t normally have, but with this tech Krzanich hopes viewers can one day jump right into the play or watch the game straight from the players’ bench. Voke, which was founded back in 2004, had only disclosed $12.5 million in funding, with other investors in addition to Intel and the Kings including A&E Television Networks LLC, Nautilus Ventures, F50 and the Cowles Company. Other recent Intel acquisitions in the VR space have included computer vision specialists Itseez and Movidius. The company has acquired some 83 companies to date. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase VOKE Founded 2012 Overview VOKE is at the forefront of Virtual Reality based viewing of real events and on-demand media.

By Liam Tung | November 3, 2016 -- 13:26 GMT (06:26 PDT) | Topic: Mobility The Eve community has designed its dream Window 10 machine, the Eve V. Image: Eve The makers of the community-designed Eve V have detailed more specs for its forthcoming Windows 10 2-in-1. The Finnish company's latest spec sheet for the Eve V promises a 12.3-inch display hybrid tablet-laptop powered by Intel's seventh-generation core processors. Last month Eve said its Eve V project had received backing from Intel and later this month it will kick off a campaign on Indiegogo, seeking backers to help pay for manufacturing costs. The device will be configurable with 8GB or 16GB RAM, and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage. It will also feature a fingerprint sensor built into the power button that is compatible with Windows Hello biometric authentication. According to Eve, this design decision is to allow the fingerprint reader to function when the tablet is detached. Better than Microsoft's Surface Pro? Here's the Windows 10 2-in-1 being built on public opinion Canvassing users for their feature wishlist before you build a machine is an unusual step -- but it's at the heart of the approach adopted by Finnish startup Eve Tech. Read More Eve initially aimed for Intel's sixth-generation CPUs, but following Intel's investment it has upgraded the design to accommodate the latest generation. These chips include the Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor with a clock speed of up to 2.6GHz, the Core i5-7Y54 with a speed of up to 3.2GHz, and the Core i7-7Y75 offering up to 3.6GHz. Other sensors that Eve plans to add to the convertible include a Hall proximity sensor, gravity sensor, light sensor, and gyroscope. While it also intends to add GPS, it's concerned the aluminum body will impact GPS functionality. "Since Eve V has aluminum unibody enclosure, we can't say yet for sure will the GPS work properly in the Wi-Fi model. What we can promise is that in the LTE model it would work. We just don't know when the LTE model would be available," the firm writes. While it is postponing the LTE version, Eve says some telcos have shown interest in that model. Eve is still hashing out the exact design for the LTE model, again due to the metal frame's impact on antennas. "We need to create a new aluminum enclosure to introduce the LTE model. It has to house an additional plastic area for the LTE antennae to pick up the signal efficiently. Naturally, the casing would also have to feature the extra slot for the sim card," it explains. Only a small batch of 500 Eve V laptops will be available during the fund-raiser, which kicks off on November 21.

Check Point*, Huawei* and other industry-leading companies have joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance to provide a truly integrated, connected security ecosystem that maximizes the investment customers are making in their cybersecurity infrastructure. One year ago, at its FOCUS 15 event, Intel Security unveiled a new strategy emphasizing an integrated, open security system powered by a connected architecture across Intel Security and third-party products alike. Since that time, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance has executed on that strategy, doubling the number of partner companies that have existing, or are developing, technology integrations with McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL). McAfee DXL provides a standardized integration and communications fabric for products regardless of underlying proprietary architecture. This open security architecture enables customers to integrate their solutions and gain visibility across their IT environment, analyzing data more efficiently and yielding more available and actionable intelligence. “In today’s quickly evolving threat landscape, security products that do not interact with each other not only increase operational cost, they increase risk,” said D.J. Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “By joining forces with industry leaders, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance is providing a truly integrated, unified security ecosystem, enabling rapid deployment, simplified management and maximized protection.” Key new Intel Security Innovation Alliance highlights include: Check Point – The integration between McAfee DXL, McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and Check Point firewall products enables intelligence sharing and workflow optimization. Real-time communication between these products allows customers to scale and automate their security environment, thereby saving time and resources. HP Enterprise Aruba * – Intel Security products McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) now integrate with Intel Security Innovation Alliance partner HPE Aruba product ClearPass*. This cross-vendor integration covers two dimensions in the latest advanced security protection paradigm: threat intelligence sharing, and automatic detection and remediation. Huawei – Together, Huawei and Intel Security will work to provide indicators of compromise (IOC) data alerts to McAfee DXL and McAfee TIE, providing dynamic behavior analytics and intelligence sharing to customers. MobileIron * – FOCUS 16 marks the one-year anniversary of the Intel Security and MobileIron partnership through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. In the past year, the companies have integrated solutions to solve three key issues facing the enterprise today: extending data protection to mobile devices, addressing mobile threat protection, and unifying admin workflows and user experience between mobile and endpoint devices. Through the Intel Security Innovation Alliance customers will now have the added capability of user behavior analytics (UBA). Security professionals now can deploy a new wave of UBA products to accelerate attack detection and incident response and pinpoint anomalies in real time. UBA automates the detection of attacks and risk behaviors inside an organization and can dramatically reduce the time and skill needed to investigate and respond to security events. Through their integration with McAfee ESM Intel Security Innovation Alliance partners now providing UBA include CyberArk*,Exabeam*, Fortscale*, Gurucul*, Interset*, Niara* and Securonix*.

Appealing to women’s “help gene” could be very helpful in attracting them to cyber security, said Celeste Fralick, adding that it is important to engage girls as young as possible on the opportunities that exist. “Schools have an important role to play in ensuring that girls feel comfortable taking subjects traditionally regarded as being mainly for boys, such as maths and science,” said Lisa Depew. “When there are only one or two girls in a maths class, schools need to ensure that they do not feel isolated and alone, and it can be challenging to get girls through that at a time in their lives when they are going through so many changes. But if we lose them at that point, it is difficult to get them back,” she said. Educating girls and women is only part of the solution, said Depew. “We also have to change security culture in organisations to ensure that there are incentives for women to join and that it is easier for women to see and take up the opportunities,” she said. “Generally there is no obvious incentive, and the perception again is that cyber security is purely technical, but we have to show that it is also about working creatively and working collaboratively in teams to solve problems, said Depew. Grindstaff advised recruiters to use their professional networks to raise the awareness of the profession and to identify potential candidates in other professions or other parts of the business. Inclusive environments Even when women are able to overcome the barriers to working in cyber security, the panel said another common problem is ensuring that they remain in the profession. Retention is almost as great a challenge as attracting them in the first place, they said. Once again, it is a cultural challenge inside organisations, said Depew. “Many organisations are failing to understand what motivates the people in their cyber security teams and consequently failing to keep them because they are not made to feel as if they are valuable members of the team,” she said. Organisations need to pay more attention to creating a more inclusive environment, said Grindstaff. “It is not only important to manage external perceptions of the profession, but also to work internally to change people’s ideas of what kinds of people can do well in cyber security,” she said. For example, Fralick said she had been recruited into cyber security by Grindstaff who saw her potential because of her skills in analytics. “I have a PhD in biomedical engineering, but Lynda [Grindstaff] helped me to realise that my skills were portable and that I could learn everything I needed to know about cyber security,” she said. Read more about women and information security Women remain under-represented in the information security workforce, yet represent a talent resource that the industry should tap into, a report has revealed. At RSA Conference 2015, Cloudmark’s Angela Knox discussed how she started a career in InfoSec and how the security industry can appeal to women like her. Female information security professionals say the industry needs to do more to not only encourage women to pursue infosec careers, but also help mentor them along the way. Facebook’s director of security operations says women can have successful careers in information security, and more diversity can help shift the playing field toward security defenders rather than attackers. On the question of skills retention, Fralick said it is important – particularly with younger recruits – to ensure that they have the freedom they need so that they do not become bored or frustrated. “There is so much to learn and to explore, but we need to think about giving young recruits the freedom they need to keep them interested,” she said. Fralick said although the gender bias is beginning to fade, she said it is still mainly up to women to take the first step to becoming accepted by their male colleagues. “I still read the sports page simply so that I can keep a dialogue going with my male colleagues. I still need to be mindful of being inclusive of them and not to expect them to be inclusive of me,” she said. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

By: Bloomberg | Published: November 3, 2016 4:33 PM The move shows how the Swiss have battled back against Apple Inc.’s encroachment into the market for fancy timepieces. (Source: Reuters) TAG Heuer will open an office in Silicon Valley, marking the first time a big Swiss watchmaker has expanded into the cradle of the U.S. technology sector and cementing its smartwatch alliance with Google and Intel Corp.The office, which opened Nov. 1 and is located on Intel’s campus in Santa Clara, California, will house about a dozen research and development employees, according to Chief Executive Officer Jean-Claude Biver. TAG Heuer also hired Intel’s Tom Foldesi to lead its smartwatch program, tasked with setting up labs and product teams. The move shows how the Swiss have battled back against Apple Inc.’s encroachment into the market for fancy timepieces. TAG Heuer sold out all of the 60,000 smartwatches it produced this year, at $1,500 a pop. The LVMH unit plans to sell some 150,000 pieces of an advanced smartwatch that should go on sale in April. “We want to have our finger on the pulse,” Biver said in an interview. “In Switzerland, we’re where everything is happening in the traditional watchmaking industry. We believe in the future of connected watches, so we have to go where they’re being developed.” The Silicon Valley office also makes it easier to recruit smartwatch specialists and be close to startups that the company might acquire, he added. Early concerns that the Apple Watch’s arrival in 2014 would threaten the Swiss watch industry as a whole didn’t materialize, though it has hurt sales of lower-priced timepieces. Brands such as Montblanc and TAG Heuer went on the offensive by introducing electronic functions of their own. TAG Heuer’s model gives consumers the option of paying a fee to trade it in for a mechanical version once it’s out of date. “The connected watch will definitely be a permanent part of the TAG Heuer brand,” Biver said. The label is selling a $9,900 18-carat rose gold version of its smartwatch for the Christmas season and is working on offering a collection with various sizes, materials and price segments. The announcement comes just two months after Apple discontinued its $17,000 18-karat gold version of the Apple Watch. Failing to gain much of a foothold in the luxury watch segment, Apple has now pushed more into fitness functions. Still, Apple was the second-best selling watch brand in the world by revenue last year, behind Rolex, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in September. Foldesi will report to Guy Semon, TAG Heuer’s head of research and development. He previously held various executive positions at Intel, where he also helped develop wearables.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 9:38PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) operates in many different product segments, spanning personal computers to data centers to different types of Internet of Things devices. And within those segments, the company builds several products to serve a range of customer demands. That's why it can be quite difficult to single out an Intel product line -- generally a processor or family of processors -- as being the company's "best" release each year. However, within the company's broad portfolio of products, there are clearly those that are much more important to its financial results today and its prospects tomorrow. Of all the product families that Intel launched in 2016, there was one that was noteworthy -- the 10-core Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition processor. A $1,723 processor for gamers and enthusiasts The Core i7 6950X chip arrived as part of a family of processors commonly referred to by their code name, Broadwell-E. The Broadwell-E family of chips is targeted at what Intel refers to as the high-end desktop market, which consists of gamers and other personal-computer users who want as much processor power as they can get. Image source: Intel.  Intel priced this chip at an eye-popping $1,723, making it one of the most expensive consumer-grade processors the company has released in recent years. Looking back to 1997, Intel's 300MHz Pentium II processor was priced at $1,981 -- or just shy of $3,000 today, adjusted for inflation. The launch of this chip, particularly at its price point, smacked of putting out a "feeler" for whether there would be much of a market for such an expensive consumer-grade chip. Going by comments from CEO Brian Krzanich in July, sales of the 10-core chip in the months following its launch were "much better than what even [Intel] anticipated." So it would appear that there is, indeed, real demand for such a processor.  Why this product was so important It's hard to imagine that the revenue impact from this single product would be enough to move the needle for a behemoth like Intel. Even at very high average selling prices and probably excellent margins, the absolute volumes are just too low to have a big impact. Nevertheless, the success of this product relative to Intel's expectations probably has the company seriously considering putting more effort into building high-end products specifically tailored for gamers and other personal-computer enthusiasts. For some context, Intel has made it clear that its sales of gaming and enthusiast-related processors continue to enjoy "double-digit" percentage year-over-year growth rates. By focusing on this market more, the company might be able to accelerate unit growth there through even better products -- as well as revenue and average selling prices -- by introducing even higher-end processors within a given gaming-focused product line. Runner-up? Knights Landing A very close second to the Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition gaming chip was Intel's second-generation of Xeon Phi processors, commonly referred to by their code name, Knights Landing. These chips were targeted at high-performance computing and deep-learning applications. Intel's prior-generation Xeon Phi processors saw some traction in the marketplace, but the second generation of products launched early in 2016 look much more competitive. That hypothesis is seemingly verified by the fact that Krzanich told investors back in July that during the first half of 2016, shipments of its second-generation Xeon Phi processors were up eight times relative to the total number of first-generation Xeon Phi chips that Intel sold during the full year of 2015. But just like the Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition, robust sales of the second-generation Xeon Phi processors won't dramatically move the needle for Intel, as the revenue base from which sales growth is occurring is quite low. However, that early success should give the company more confidence to invest in future iterations of the product line. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Intel, Netflix, Apple And The Power And Influence Of Sonic Branding Forbes 03/11/2016 Jordan Passman, Contributor © Provided by Forbes Media LLC (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) Twenty-two years ago, three seconds of audio comprised of five musical notes was written to help a tech brand with its marketing. Today, you can’t think of Intel without hearing the iconic “Intel Inside Bong.” You’ve heard it so many times, even with different variations, but the core five note progression is always the same. How can something so simple be so effective? Well, when you really examine Intel’s use of the mnemonic, you realize that it’s hugely associated with its brand, and its success. What you hear are adjectives that the company wants you to associate with Intel: A modern, trustworthy, sleek, intelligent, simple and efficient brand. According to Walter Werzowa, the composer of the Intel theme, the mnemonic is worth millions of dollars, which shouldn’t be surprising to anybody. Werzowa worked closely with Intel to craft the theme in 1994 - today, it’s older than most college students! I reached out to Yogiraj Graham, Director of Production for Intel Global Production Labs, who explained, “The Intel bong is one of the most powerful assets we have. We’re always looking for ways to showcase the amazing experiences that Intel enables, and the Intel bong sound helps keep our messaging consistent.” Apple is another brand that has prioritized crafting beautiful sounds for their users to associate with their experience. Whether you are scrolling through the soothing sounds of your Apple TV on a lazy Sunday, rebooting your computer at work or receiving a highly-anticipated text message, you are met with pleasant and carefully thought out sonic branding. Netflix has also done an amazing job with their logo mnemonic, which I’ve heard is a nod to Frank Underwood’s infamous double table knock in House of Cards. There are so many more–AOL’s “You’ve Got Mail,” the McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’ It,” Nationwide’s “Nationwide is on your side,” the THX “Deep Note,” NBC’s “Chimes”—all are powerful examples of logo branding. With a mention of the name, you can hear the brand. According to the Harvard Business Review, research presented at the 2012 Audio Branding Congress showed that “congruent sound cues can increase the speed of a visual search for products (a key for success in both online and retail settings), as well as improve the perceived taste of food and wine.” In addition, “the strategic use of sound can play an important role in positively differentiating a product or service, enhancing recall, creating preference, building trust, and even increasing sales.” In a world where every company feels the mandatory importance of visual logos, you have to wonder why there are still plenty of brands that don’t take advantage of this incredible branding tool. One hurdle is that the process of creating your own sound and logo mnemonic can be challenging and expensive for brands. If you’re not confident with music/sound direction, it may be much easier to pick apart what isn’t working, rather than creating your own brief for a composer to work with. This is why industry leaders attempt to simplify the process. If you can speak in your native language about the general marketing strategy for your company and how you want to be portrayed, a great sonic branding firm can translate that into sound. Experts in the industry close deals up to the high six figures for their professional services. A package often includes the core melody (let’s use the five notes from Intel, for example) and then additional versions with various instrumentations for different moods (an acoustic version, an electronic version, a full version, a simplified version etc.). The mnemonic must be built to scale, from massive stadiums or to a mobile device, the quality must be exceptional. So how can you keep a long-standing mnemonic fresh? Earlier this year, in collaboration with ad agency mcgarrybowen (music production by Jerry Krenach & Jean Scofield), Intel launched a global TV spot using an inventive musical adaptation created by the mnemonic legend himself, Werzowa.  According to Graham, “With a mixture of pride and humility, [Werzowa] once said to me, ‘The Intel bong is the emperor of Mnemonics.’  I think he’s right.  We hold it dear and recognize its power.  The piece of music he created for our campaign brought together Beethoven’s  5th symphony and the sound of the Intel bong.  The desire was for people to hear those 5 notes in a completely new way.  The result was extraordinary.” Hear it below: Will you or your company inspire the next “Intel Inside” logo mnemonic?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 9:38PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) operates in many different product segments, spanning personal computers to data centers to different types of Internet of Things devices. And within those segments, the company builds several products to serve a range of customer demands. That's why it can be quite difficult to single out an Intel product line -- generally a processor or family of processors -- as being the company's "best" release each year. However, within the company's broad portfolio of products, there are clearly those that are much more important to its financial results today and its prospects tomorrow. Of all the product families that Intel launched in 2016, there was one that was noteworthy -- the 10-core Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition processor. A $1,723 processor for gamers and enthusiasts The Core i7 6950X chip arrived as part of a family of processors commonly referred to by their code name, Broadwell-E. The Broadwell-E family of chips is targeted at what Intel refers to as the high-end desktop market, which consists of gamers and other personal-computer users who want as much processor power as they can get. Image source: Intel.  Intel priced this chip at an eye-popping $1,723, making it one of the most expensive consumer-grade processors the company has released in recent years. Looking back to 1997, Intel's 300MHz Pentium II processor was priced at $1,981 -- or just shy of $3,000 today, adjusted for inflation. The launch of this chip, particularly at its price point, smacked of putting out a "feeler" for whether there would be much of a market for such an expensive consumer-grade chip. Going by comments from CEO Brian Krzanich in July, sales of the 10-core chip in the months following its launch were "much better than what even [Intel] anticipated." So it would appear that there is, indeed, real demand for such a processor.  Why this product was so important It's hard to imagine that the revenue impact from this single product would be enough to move the needle for a behemoth like Intel. Even at very high average selling prices and probably excellent margins, the absolute volumes are just too low to have a big impact. Nevertheless, the success of this product relative to Intel's expectations probably has the company seriously considering putting more effort into building high-end products specifically tailored for gamers and other personal-computer enthusiasts. For some context, Intel has made it clear that its sales of gaming and enthusiast-related processors continue to enjoy "double-digit" percentage year-over-year growth rates. By focusing on this market more, the company might be able to accelerate unit growth there through even better products -- as well as revenue and average selling prices -- by introducing even higher-end processors within a given gaming-focused product line. Runner-up? Knights Landing A very close second to the Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition gaming chip was Intel's second-generation of Xeon Phi processors, commonly referred to by their code name, Knights Landing. These chips were targeted at high-performance computing and deep-learning applications. Intel's prior-generation Xeon Phi processors saw some traction in the marketplace, but the second generation of products launched early in 2016 look much more competitive. That hypothesis is seemingly verified by the fact that Krzanich told investors back in July that during the first half of 2016, shipments of its second-generation Xeon Phi processors were up eight times relative to the total number of first-generation Xeon Phi chips that Intel sold during the full year of 2015. But just like the Core i7 6950X Extreme Edition, robust sales of the second-generation Xeon Phi processors won't dramatically move the needle for Intel, as the revenue base from which sales growth is occurring is quite low. However, that early success should give the company more confidence to invest in future iterations of the product line. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

No longer is our economy a physical one, but one of connected networks and systems where cybercriminals have put us on the defensive. This new second economy has put us in a world where more than money is at stake and where private and public sectors are fighting against time and working to justify trust. » View the Intel Security FOCUS 16 press kit Cybercriminals are forcing cybersecurity companies to redraft the rules of engagement for defending the civilized world; to effectively counteract them, we have to abandon old security playbooks to become more unpredictable and collaborative and make cyber defense a priority, said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group. Our strategic charter is simple, yet disruptive: integrate, automate and orchestrate the threat defense lifecycle to drive better security outcomes  ultimately reducing more risk, faster and with fewer resources. Built upon the industrys largest open ecosystem leveraging a proven integration program, Intel Securitys unified defense architecture is enabled by four protection systems  Dynamic Endpoint, Pervasive Data Protection, Data Center and Cloud Defense, and Intelligent Security Operations  that are intelligently integrated to multiply effectiveness. Dynamic Endpoint  Isolated solutions can be effective against individual assaults, but there are too many examples where isolated solutions cant keep up with the wide range of sophisticated, emerging threats. Tactical security firefighting needs to be replaced with integrated, dynamic security defenses designed to outsmart attackers. Intel Securitys Dynamic Endpoint solution uses advanced protection, shared intelligence and unified workflows on a single management console to unify endpoint protection, detection and correction to guard against todays most pervasive threats. This solution, delivered in McAfee® Endpoint Security 10.5 and McAfee® Active Response 2.0 software, includes capabilities like: Patient Zero Protection  Dynamic Application Containment improves protection against patient zero and ransomware threats and isolates the rest of the network from infection by monitoring and intercepting post-malicious process actions based on file reputation. Advanced, Persistent Threat Protection with Containment and Machine Learning  Intel Security is the first and only vendor to offer machine learning based malware classification using both static pre-execution analysis and dynamic post-execution analysis from the cloud that is designed to help detect zero-day malware in near real time, tracing behavior when deemed suspicious and remediating without relying on traditional signatures. Enhanced Protection with Integrated Web and Endpoint Protection  Only Intel Security seamlessly integrates a connection between its endpoint client and web gateway technology to enable quick-to-deploy, pervasive protection both on and off the corporate network that is designed to prevent zero-day malware from reaching the endpoint. Real-Time Advanced Threats Protection  McAfee Active Response 2.0 software uses the cloud to accelerate investigations by dynamically tracing process behavior and allowing administrators to access threat context in real time during an investigation.  Quickly hunt and respond using single click correction and then automate responses to address future attacks. Pervasive Data Protection  The rise of software as a service (SaaS) applications and a highly mobile workforce has created the need to securely enable cloud-driven business. Organizations are looking for a unified solution that extends security outside the traditional perimeter covering on and off-network users and cloud services. Intel Securitys approach to pervasive data protection is to unify SaaS security across web protection, cloud access security broker, data loss prevention and encryption to provide the industrys broadest solution across endpoints, networks and cloud-based services all centrally managed.  With a foundation in unified management, along with common rulesets, policies and encryption, Intel Security will help organizations maximize business efficiency and employee productivity. Organizations are empowered to make sensitive data readily available to the people who need it, while minimizing the risk of data leakage and misuse by unauthorized personnel. Components of the integrated solution include: Increased Productivity with Centralized Data Protection  McAfee® DLP for Mobile Email 10.0 software introduces unified policies and incident management for both endpoint and network DLP. It also offers end-user empowerment tools such as end-user manual classification, and end-user initiated DLP scanning and self-remediation. Not only do these capabilities help strengthen the corporate security culture, it also alleviates administrative burden. Ubiquitous Web Security  McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Service is designed to enable security teams to gain the same benefits of advanced threat protection as on-premises web gateway appliances but without the cost of hardware or the resources used to maintain it. With 3x the data centers of our previous web SaaS solution, better performance and improved uptime our new cloud service has never been more ready for the enterprise. Cloud Application Governance  McAfee Cloud Data Protection, available as a beta, features cloud access security broker (CASB)) technology, to provide an integrated view of risky endpoint and cloud events, including the ability to perform a real-time endpoint health check, ensuring only trusted devices are able to access sensitive information. Data Center and Cloud Defense  Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing, which introduces unique security requirements that many legacy security solutions cannot address.  Consequently, many struggle with weak and inconsistent cloud security controls, slow resolution of security issues and inefficient compute and staffing resource utilization. Intel Security cloud security products are designed to protect data centers with industry-leading security that detects advanced targeted attacks and manages security efficiently across physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Intel Securitys Data Center and Cloud Defense solution combines server security, network security and threat intelligence sharing to enable a single view of security across data center environments. This solution, delivered through McAfee® Server Security Suite 4.5 and McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP) 8.3, includes capabilities like: Cloud Security Visibility  Cloud workload discovery provides deep visibility across public and private clouds for virtual machines, associated workloads, networks and storage, enabling organizations to establish a strong and consistent security posture. Threat Intelligence Sharing and Unification  Unification of perimeter and virtual machine protection thwarts advanced targeted attacks while ensuring efficient resource utilization within highly virtualized server environments to allow organizations to detect more threats, faster and with fewer resources. Once a threat has been detected, this knowledge is shared across the data center and corrective actions can be taken. Integration and Orchestration  Tight integration across McAfee Management for Optimized Virtual Environments Anti-Virus (MOVE AV), McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP), McAfee® Advanced Threat Defense, and McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange along with virtualization platforms like VMWare NSX and OpenStack enable orchestration of security efficiently and more easily. Intelligent Security Operations  Organizations looking for rapid response and remediation need a closed loop threat defense lifecycle framework that makes it easy to integrate, monitor and orchestrate security solutions. New Intel Security capabilities integrate with the above solutions and Security Innovation Alliance partners to enhance and unify visibility, investigation workflows and reporting. Flexible Advanced Malware Detection  Expanded options include a new cloud-based machine learning-driven malware analysis service, McAfee Cloud Threat Detection, as well as a virtual McAfee Advanced Threat Defense appliance that makes the most of an improved user experience, more Windows OS coverage, and a significant throughput rate increase. Improved Visibility and Investigation  McAfee Enterprise Security Manager introduces a new HTML 5-based interface with an intuitive, analyst-centric user experience and simpler, faster search results to expedite threat management and incident response. Expanded Strategy and Incident Response Services  New consulting, deployment, assessment and incident response services enable long-term maturation of an organizations approach to risk and threat management and improve ROI. Retainer and on-demand based managed security and emergency response augment in-house expertise. OpenDXL Initiative The industry has long needed a way to make different technologies work better together, and we paved the way with the most highly adopted technology across major players with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL). To accelerate that, today Intel Security announced its intent to open the McAfee Data Exchange Layer to the industry as a concrete means of disrupting the cyberattackers advantage. Through an open source strategy and the beta release of a new software development kit (SDK) for DXL, white hats (both organizations and technology providers) will gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defense lifecycle. DXL provides a standardized application framework to integrate technologies from different vendors with each other and with in-house developed applications. The OpenDXL initiative will expand access and capabilities of the DXL SDK and the management and community infrastructure that will support it, enabling developers within ISVs, enterprises, colleges and even competitors to gain the many real-time integration and operational benefits of the Data Exchange Layer.

The McAfee brand is to be resurrected after the company was acquired by Intel five years ago in a $7.7bn deal  and later rebranded as Intel Security only to be spun off in 2017 as an independent company in partnership with investment firm TPG, with Intel retaining a 49% stake.   Young, general manager of Intel Security for the past two years, will be chief of the new firm and will retain his current leadership team. “When we become an independent company, we are going to accelerate a lot of what we are doing today, but one of the main differences is that we will be 100% focused on cyber security as a company at the company level,” he told Computer Weekly at Intel Security’s annual Focus conference in Las Vegas. “And that puts us in a bit of a different position. While all technology companies need to be part of the cyber security fight, there is real value in those that are dedicated to cyber security as a problem set that we are trying to solve, which will allow us to innovate in different ways.” Young said that although the company was already bringing to market a number of new technologies and systems, to be announced at Focus 2016, once it was independent, there would be a strong emphasis on growth and keeping pace with what was going on in the cyber security industry. “From my perspective, the cyber security space is the most dynamic part of the overall IT landscape, so as much as IT and technology is changing, cyber security is changing that much faster and so those of us who play in this industry have to grow and innovate very quickly,” he said. “So I view our future as McAfee as an accelerator of what we are currently doing.” Young said the company’s new tagline was “together is power” and that one of the main differentiators for the newly independent McAfee would be the fundamental thesis that business must organise and unite customers’ threat defence architecture, which goes beyond integration. Real orchestrated systems In 2016, said Young, the company was delivering a number of “automated use case-driven workflows”, but the organisation’s future vision was to drive “real orchestrated systems”. “The journey from integrated capabilities to automated use case-driven workflows to orchestrated systems is how I think of the evolution of our business and of where our industry needs to go,” he said, “because the past of this industry, and even our own portfolio, has been a lot of point products that are knitted together in customer environments, but without the real integration, automation and orchestration that is required to be resilient enough to deal with the changing nature of the threats that we see.” Everything the company announced at Focus 2016 was aimed at enabling it to build towards that orchestrated future, he said, but that did not mean customers would have to use McAfee products and systems from end to end. “This week, we will be making a number of partner announcements, as well as new products and system announcements, and that we are opening up the McAfee data exchange layer [DXL] to make it available to everyone in the industry to do threat intelligence sharing in real time between and among the different point products in their infrastructure,” said Young. “Opening up DXL is a massive announcement for us and shows we are aiming to integrate multiple capabilities in our customers’ environments.” DXL provides a standardised application framework to integrate technologies from different suppliers with each other and with applications developed in-house. According to Intel Security, DXL is the most highly adopted technology among major players as a way of enabling different technologies to work together better. To accelerate that, Intel Security is opening DXL to the industry as a “concrete means” of disrupting the cyber attackers’ advantage. Open source strategy Through an open source strategy and the beta release of a new software development kit (SDK) for DXL, the company said white hat organisations and technology providers “will gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defence lifecycle”. The theme for Focus is the “second economy”, which refers to the virtual economy based on the provision of services through machine-to-machine communication and interaction through connected networks and systems with no human involvement. “The second economy is more trust-related and, as we move from a physical to a virtual economy, the trust factor and our ability to deliver a real cyber security capability will be more important because we are moving into a world where computing is a pervasive element of how we live our lives,” said Young. For this reason, it was important to have a security model for the emerging, virtual and trust-based second economy, which would otherwise struggle to grow, he said. “Cyber criminals are forcing cyber security companies to redraft the rules of engagement for defending the civilised world,” said Young. “To effectively counteract them, we have to abandon old security playbooks to become more unpredictable and collaborative and make cyber defence a priority. “Our strategic charter is simple, yet disruptive: integrate, automate and orchestrate the threat defence lifecycle to drive better security outcomes – ultimately reducing more risk, faster and with fewer resources.” Sharing threat information The importance of sharing threat information was a key theme in Young’s keynote presentation at the RSA Conference 2016, when he highlighted his company’s participation in the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), a cross-industry initiative set up to foster the sharing of information about cyber security threats. “We are still actively working with the CTA and we are driving towards a future that is going to be truly ground-breaking for industry,” he said, adding that more announcements about that were the pipeline. According to Young, the new company will continue its dedication to threat intelligence sharing, not only through the CTA, but also by opening up DXL. “That is a contribution we are making in our technological fabric for cyber security that is going to enable organisations to do real-time threat intelligence-sharing between the different security control points in their infrastructure,” he said. “As we build on open DXL with the industry and our partners, it is going to open up a whole new set of use cases for how our different products and systems communicate with each other and share.” Read more about Intel Security Intel to raise $3.1bn by spinning off security business. UK social media habits are a corporate security risk, warns Intel Security. Security industry needs to do more, says Intel Security head Chris Young. Another key theme of Young’s RSA Conference keynote was the value of automation in freeing up human resources to take care of the more challenging security threats and strategic approaches to data defence. “Our strategy is built around the ‘thread defence lifecycle’ – protect, detect and correct,” he said. “Those are the three phases of a closed-loop set of actions when an organisation is under attack, but historically the tools, processes and approaches were disconnected across that lifecycle, and so we are giving customers the ability to prosecute that lifecycle in a fully automated way to get the full value of this approach.” Young said that in the company’s dynamic endpoint system, for example, it was adding to protection through something called dynamic application containment, which restricted access to resources to any new file that was not known good or known bad. “The problem is that if you automatically block something that is not malicious, then you risk upsetting people in the business by disrupting their work,” he said. “But at the same time, you do not want to expose yourself to a zero day attack by allowing something that is unknown to have unfettered access to resources on a device. So dynamic application containment allows you to restrict resources on the machine, so you do not allow a full-blown zero day attack without disrupting the business.” Machine-learning capability Young said the company was also going much broader and deeper on detection by adding machine-learning capability through a new capability called “real protect”, which has both on-device and in-cloud machine-learning capabilities. “This enables organisations to do both pre- and post-execution analysis of files that land on these devices, opening up a whole new set of detection capabilities by doing static code analysis and behavioural analysis, which are both important for a comprehensive look at zero day and similarly difficult-to-find attacks,” he said. The company has also integrated McAfee active response, which enables organisations to conduct cloud-based trace detection and analysis. This means that if something gets through that is later found to be malicious, organisations can go back to identify where the threat landed in the environment. “All of this is now being delivered in a common system that runs across all endpoints and is managed all in one place with our e-policy orchestrator,” said Young. “This is a great example of how we are automating to get the full closed-loop threat defence lifecycle capability in one system, which otherwise would require organisations to work across four or five different systems.” Another area of focus for the company is securing the internet of things (IoT), but Young said it was important to think about which industry vertical was involved. “You need to consider whether you are looking at IoT for the home or whether you are looking at it in the context of manufacturing or healthcare,” he said. “It is important to start with where you are in the domain, which enables you to understand what type of attacks you need to worry about and which attack vectors are important.” IoT is technology transition Young said the IoT was about connecting devices and experience, and bringing computer-generated experiences into the physical universe. That is what the IoT really represented: a technology transition, he said. It was not a market, but a movement, an evolution. “And, depending on which industry you are in, that will have different implications for security and what you are looking to protect,” he said. “To determine that, you have to consider the risks of connected devices and connected experiences in a particular environment.” The IoT botnet attack on domain name system (DNS) services supplier Dyn in October 2016 demonstrated that even if an organisation has no internet-connected devices in its environment, it may still be the victim of an attack that exploits those connected devices. “Clearly, we all have an interest in ensuring that the cyber security model contemplates the power of billions of connected devices and what that could mean in other, non-connected environments,” said Young. Although Young said there was still a lot of work to do in this regard, he believed technological controls could be found. “We work very closely with partners in manufacturing environments and healthcare, all of whom are working very diligently to implement cyber security for their connected devices and the data that they generate,” he said. The connected home One of the areas that Intel Security’s consumer-focused business was tackling was around the connected home, said Young. He pointed out that the company was planning some announcements on this subject at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2017.   “This shows we are moving from being a provider of security mainly for PCs and computing devices to one that is going to provide capability to protect customers more broadly with all the different devices and connections they have got in their home environment,” he said. “That kind of capability is going to be important, not only to protect against inbound attacks, but also in the long term against outbound attacks [such as the one against Dyn].” Despite his conviction that technological controls could be brought to bear, Young acknowledged that, like everything to do with security, all stakeholders had a role to play, ranging from silicon producers to device manufacturers to IoT service providers and users. “But even if device manufacturers step up and do more, you are always going to have cyber attackers who find a way to use the infrastructure we are connecting to their advantage, and that is where the pure-play cyber security companies have a role to play,” he said. “If you want to make any device, any software or any cloud application usable, it will be attackable. That is just always going to be true.” Confirming that the new company’s strong financial backing from TPG would allow its leadership to start thinking about mergers and acquisitions, Young said the company believed in its vision of integrate, automate and orchestrate. “As we evolve our business, we are going to look at how we build, who we partner with, and what gaps we have in achieving the strategy and the mission we have set for ourselves, and we will look at where mergers and acquisitions can play in the set of opportunities that we’ve got,” he said.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Intel Security Outlines Strategy for Protecting New Digital Economy Intel Security Enhances Unified Defense Architecture to Safeguard Against Threats to Trust, Time and Money NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel Security to strengthen threat defense lifecycle through integration, automation and orchestration. Unified architecture is enabled by four key integrated systems: Dynamic Endpoint, Pervasive Data Protection, Data Center and Cloud Defense, and Intelligent Security Operations. Across unified architecture, Intel Security announces 10 new products that feature organically developed capabilities including machine learning-based malware classification and cloud-based advanced threat detection service as well as cloud access security broker (CASB). New Open McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL) marks the next phase of Intel Security’s renewed commitment to help the industry accelerate the threat defense lifecycle. LAS VEGAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–FOCUS 16 — Today Intel Security announced an enhanced unified defense architecture designed to empower organizations to more effectively protect today’s new digital economy of trust, time and money. No longer is our economy a physical one, but one of connected networks and systems where cybercriminals have put us on the defensive. This new second economy has put us in a world where more than money is at stake and where private and public sectors are fighting against time and working to justify trust. “Cybercriminals are forcing cybersecurity companies to redraft the rules of engagement for defending the civilized world; to effectively counteract them, we have to abandon old security playbooks to become more unpredictable and collaborative and make cyber defense a priority,” said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group. “Our strategic charter is simple, yet disruptive: integrate, automate and orchestrate the threat defense lifecycle to drive better security outcomes – ultimately reducing more risk, faster and with fewer resources.” Built upon the industry’s largest open ecosystem leveraging a proven integration program, Intel Security’s unified defense architecture is enabled by four protection systems – Dynamic Endpoint, Pervasive Data Protection, Data Center and Cloud Defense, and Intelligent Security Operations – that are intelligently integrated to multiply effectiveness. Dynamic Endpoint – Isolated solutions can be effective against individual assaults, but there are too many examples where isolated solutions can’t keep up with the wide range of sophisticated, emerging threats. Tactical security firefighting needs to be replaced with integrated, dynamic security defenses designed to outsmart attackers. Intel Security’s Dynamic Endpoint solution uses advanced protection, shared intelligence and unified workflows on a single management console to unify endpoint protection, detection and correction to guard against today’s most pervasive threats. This solution, delivered in McAfee® Endpoint Security 10.5 and McAfee® Active Response 2.0 software, includes capabilities like: Patient Zero Protection – Dynamic Application Containment improves protection against patient zero and ransomware threats and isolates the rest of the network from infection by monitoring and intercepting post-malicious process actions based on file reputation. Advanced, Persistent Threat Protection with Containment and Machine Learning – Intel Security is the first and only vendor to offer machine learning based malware classification using both static pre-execution analysis and dynamic post-execution analysis from the cloud that is designed to help detect zero-day malware in near real time, tracing behavior when deemed suspicious and remediating without relying on traditional signatures. Enhanced Protection with Integrated Web and Endpoint Protection – Only Intel Security seamlessly integrates a connection between its endpoint client and web gateway technology to enable quick-to-deploy, pervasive protection both on and off the corporate network that is designed to prevent zero-day malware from reaching the endpoint. Real-Time Advanced Threats Protection – McAfee Active Response 2.0 software uses the cloud to accelerate investigations by dynamically tracing process behavior and allowing administrators to access threat context in real time during an investigation. Quickly hunt and respond using single click correction and then automate responses to address future attacks. Pervasive Data Protection – The rise of software as a service (SaaS) applications and a highly mobile workforce has created the need to securely enable cloud-driven business. Organizations are looking for a unified solution that extends security outside the traditional perimeter covering on and off-network users and cloud services. Intel Security’s approach to pervasive data protection is to unify SaaS security across web protection, cloud access security broker, data loss prevention and encryption to provide the industry’s broadest solution across endpoints, networks and cloud-based services all centrally managed. With a foundation in unified management, along with common rulesets, policies and encryption, Intel Security will help organizations maximize business efficiency and employee productivity. Organizations are empowered to make sensitive data readily available to the people who need it, while minimizing the risk of data leakage and misuse by unauthorized personnel. Components of the integrated solution include: Increased Productivity with Centralized Data Protection – McAfee® DLP for Mobile Email 10.0 software introduces unified policies and incident management for both endpoint and network DLP. It also offers end-user empowerment tools such as end-user manual classification, and end-user initiated DLP scanning and self-remediation. Not only do these capabilities help strengthen the corporate security culture, it also alleviates administrative burden. Ubiquitous Web Security – McAfee Web Gateway Cloud Service is designed to enable security teams to gain the same benefits of advanced threat protection as on-premises web gateway appliances but without the cost of hardware or the resources used to maintain it. With 3x the data centers of our previous web SaaS solution, better performance and improved uptime our new cloud service has never been more ready for the enterprise. Cloud Application Governance – McAfee Cloud Data Protection, available as a beta, features cloud access security broker (CASB)) technology, to provide an integrated view of risky endpoint and cloud events, including the ability to perform a real-time endpoint health check, ensuring only trusted devices are able to access sensitive information. Data Center and Cloud Defense – Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing, which introduces unique security requirements that many legacy security solutions cannot address. Consequently, many struggle with weak and inconsistent cloud security controls, slow resolution of security issues and inefficient compute and staffing resource utilization. Intel Security cloud security products are designed to protect data centers with industry-leading security that detects advanced targeted attacks and manages security efficiently across physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Intel Security’s Data Center and Cloud Defense solution combines server security, network security and threat intelligence sharing to enable a single view of security across data center environments. This solution, delivered through McAfee® Server Security Suite 4.5 and McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP) 8.3, includes capabilities like: Cloud Security Visibility – Cloud workload discovery provides deep visibility across public and private clouds for virtual machines, associated workloads, networks and storage, enabling organizations to establish a strong and consistent security posture. Threat Intelligence Sharing and Unification – Unification of perimeter and virtual machine protection thwarts advanced targeted attacks while ensuring efficient resource utilization within highly virtualized server environments to allow organizations to detect more threats, faster and with fewer resources. Once a threat has been detected, this knowledge is shared across the data center and corrective actions can be taken. Integration and Orchestration – Tight integration across McAfee Management for Optimized Virtual Environments Anti-Virus (MOVE AV), McAfee Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP), McAfee® Advanced Threat Defense, and McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange along with virtualization platforms like VMware NSX and OpenStack enable orchestration of security efficiently and more easily. Intelligent Security Operations – Organizations looking for rapid response and remediation need a closed loop threat defense lifecycle framework that makes it easy to integrate, monitor and orchestrate security solutions. New Intel Security capabilities integrate with the above solutions and Security Innovation Alliance partners to enhance and unify visibility, investigation workflows and reporting. Flexible Advanced Malware Detection – Expanded options include a new cloud-based machine learning-driven malware analysis service, McAfee Cloud Threat Detection, as well as a virtual McAfee Advanced Threat Defense appliance that makes the most of an improved user experience, more Windows OS coverage, and a significant throughput rate increase. Improved Visibility and Investigation – McAfee Enterprise Security Manager introduces a new HTML 5-based interface with an intuitive, analyst-centric user experience and simpler, faster search results to expedite threat management and incident response. Expanded Strategy and Incident Response Services – New consulting, deployment, assessment and incident response services enable long-term maturation of an organization’s approach to risk and threat management and improve ROI. Retainer and on-demand based managed security and emergency response augment in-house expertise. OpenDXL Initiative The industry has long needed a way to make different technologies work better together, and we paved the way with the most highly adopted technology across major players with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL). To accelerate that, today Intel Security announced its intent to open the McAfee Data Exchange Layer to the industry as a concrete means of disrupting the cyberattackers’ advantage. Through an open source strategy and the beta release of a new software development kit (SDK) for DXL, “white hats” (both organizations and technology providers) will gain the ability to attach to a shared real-time communication fabric and exchange security intelligence as well as orchestrate actions for the shortest possible execution of the threat defense lifecycle. DXL provides a standardized application framework to integrate technologies from different vendors with each other and with in-house developed applications. The OpenDXL initiative will expand access and capabilities of the DXL SDK and the management and community infrastructure that will support it, enabling developers within ISVs, enterprises, colleges and even competitors to gain the many real-time integration and operational benefits of the Data Exchange Layer.

(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) With his mom working as a science teacher and his father as an engineer, Dhruv Iyer caught the science bug at a young age. The ambitious Hamilton High School senior is currently planning his next life steps to study computer science and entrepreneurship at a university next year. From there, he hopes to explore STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) career and business opportunities. “I want to explore the world and make a difference in it,” Iyer said. The 17 year-old Chandler resident is also a committed community builder, especially when it comes to advocating for STEM opportunities for his peers. Last year, Hamilton students elected him the junior class Chief Science Officer (CSO). Started in the 2015-16 school year, the Intel-sponsored CSO program exposes young adults and youth to the STEM working world while also giving them a voice in government, professional and academic environments. The Intel-sponsored program is relatively new, starting in Arizona during the 2015-16 school year, but it’s now making a big splash locally and beyond. “I never had been involved in student government and it was an opportunity to do something new through something I loved. … I have a passion for connecting students, industry and government to support science and engineering,” Iyer said. How the program works The CSO program involves sixth through 12th grade peer-elected officers from Valley schools. In its first year, the CSO effort saw participation from 78 schools and 138 officers. Its second year grew to 110 schools and 220 officers. After being elected by their peers, CSOs attend a fall summit to learn networking, blogging, strategic planning and other business skills, explained Jeremy Babendure, a CSO program organizer and executive director of the Arizona SciTech Festival. Students are also paired with “Jedi Mentors” from Intel and other local technology companies to offer support with community building at schools and insights into STEM careers. “As key drivers of innovation, STEM disciplines are critical in the complex and competitive knowledge economy. Intel works to encourage student participation in STEM disciplines. It’s important they have mentors throughout their academic careers that help link STEM activities to real-world work experiences,” said Intel Arizona’s Director of Public Affairs Carlos Contreras. After the summit, students report back to their schools to use their skills to connect with peers interested in STEM. Iyer started a STEM newsletter at his school and also encouraged science clubs to work together to create fairs and other STEM-related events. With the help of his Jedi mentor, he hopes to host a rocket launch at Hamilton this school year. A White House trip to discuss science, technology and policy with congressional leaders was the highlight of last year’s CSO experience, Iyer said. More recently, in October, he and other CSOs also met with local leaders at the state capitol to discuss STEM jobs, education and policy. These once in a lifetime experiences for teens and pre-teens, Babendure added, are critical to the CSO vision, which seeks to engage the voice of youth in the increasing dialogue about STEM careers and needed job skills. “You often find, in all these different business meetings, conversations about where the future workforce should be and you never see kids at the table,” Babendure noted. “This is an opportunity to position them as liaisons, elected by their peers, who represent their schools.” The future Now in its second year, the CSO effort is gaining national momentum. About a dozen regions around the country have expressed an interest in initiating the program in their area. Iyer is committed to setting the foundation at his school for future CSOs, and he loves to see how some of his early efforts in talking to political leaders are paying off so quickly. The experience has taught him a lifelong lesson. “I learned that anybody can get involved and make a change,” he said. “I never thought that I, as a high school student, could make a difference in my community or my school. But I now know the only thing stopping you from making a change … is your own inhibitions. … Anybody can advocate for their situation.” To learn more about how Intel supports community STEM initiatives, click here. 419 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2eAqeYT Intel Intel's pro bono legal clinic helps Arizonans battling financial hardships Nov 14, 2016 More Stories from Intel Camp gives Chandler junior high girls a fresh look at STEM opportunities Sponsor story Intel-sponsored program shows Latinas STEM career possibilities Sponsor story Foundation connects at-risk youth to STEM possibilities Sponsor story Intel supports seniors with online safety, computer basics, more Sponsor story

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 11:27AM Per a report from well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities (via MacRumors), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to launch new MacBook Pro systems during the second half of 2017. These new systems, the analyst says, could support up to 32 gigabytes of system memory -- an increase from the 16 gigabytes that the recently released models have. Image source: Apple.  Kuo says that this memory increase "depends on whether or not [MacBook processor supplier] Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ships Cannonlake CPU on time in 2017, which features 15-25% less power consumption of LPDDR 4, versus the existing LPDDR 3." The analyst further goes on to explain that "If Cannonlake doesn't enter mass production as expected, the new models launched in 2H17 will adopt Coffee Lake, which continues to adopt LPDDR 3, and maximum DRAM support will remain unchanged at 16GB." Here's why this analysis is so confusing.  Why don't the new MacBook Pro computers support 32 gigabytes of memory?  The current 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro systems use Intel's sixth-generation Core processors, also widely referred to by their internal code name, Skylake.  The fact that these chips only support the older, less-efficient LPDDR3 memory type is widely believed to be the reason that Apple doesn't offer 32 gigabytes of memory in these new systems (since that much LPDDR3 would draw too much power, forcing Apple to lower its advertised battery life targets).  The idea behind this analysis seems to be that once Intel's high-performance processors begin to offer support for the newer, more-efficient LPDDR4 memory standard, Apple will be able to increase the amount of memory that it can offer in these systems without sacrificing battery life.  That's straightforward enough; what's so confusing, then?  Code name confusion The only thing that doesn't quite make sense with Kuo's analysis is that Coffee Lake is merely the code-name for the high-performance notebook chips based on the Cannon Lake architecture (a fact first published right here at The Motley Fool). A likely explanation for why Intel doesn't just call this product family Cannon Lake (rather than Coffee Lake) is that instead of being manufactured on Intel's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, these processors will be built on an enhanced version of Intel's 14-nanometer technology. In other words, Coffee Lake is fundamentally a Cannon Lake chip; if Cannon Lake supports LPDDR4 (and it is extremely likely that it does), then so will Coffee Lake.  Kuo's analysis is sound with a simple change An argument that makes more sense is the following: If Intel can get Coffee Lake into Apple's hands soon enough, then MacBook Pro systems launched in the second half of 2017 will gain support for LPDDR4, paving the way for configurations with 32 gigabytes of memory.  If Intel can't get Coffee Lake out in that time frame, Apple must use Intel's Kaby Lake processor family to hit a second-half 2017 release schedule. Kaby Lake uses the same fundamental chip architecture as Skylake (though the implementation of that architecture has been reworked to take advantage of an enhanced 14-nanometer process), and therefore doesn't support LPDDR4 memory.  Bummer for MacBook Pro power users Unfortunately for potential MacBook Pro buyers eager to get their ahold of MacBook Pro computers with 32 gigabytes of memory, the latest Intel roadmap leaks show that Coffee Lake isn't due out until the second quarter of 2018. This means that, barring a pull-in of Coffee Lake's development schedule (unlikely given Intel's track record), Apple has two choices: Refresh the MacBook Pro in the second half of 2017 with Kaby Lake processors with memory support topping out at 16 gigabytes; or Hold off on refreshing the MacBook Pro until the first half of 2018 to be able to use the newer, superior Coffee Lake processors, which could make 32 gigabyte system configurations a reality.  If Kuo is correct that new MacBook Pro computers are coming in the second half of 2017, then consumers shouldn't expect those computers to be configurable with 32 gigabytes of memory.

Officially Ditches This Intel Corporation Technology in the 15-inch MacBook Pro Apple didn't choose to use Intel's graphics-heavy processors inside its new 15-inch MacBook Pro, but it's not a big deal. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 12:00PM With the launch of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) fourth-generation Core processors came the birth of the company's Iris Pro graphics technology. In a nutshell, Intel created two versions of its H-series laptop processors (aimed at larger, higher-performance laptops): ones with relatively weak on-board graphics, referred to as Intel HD graphics -- and ones with much higher performance graphics, known as Iris Pro. Image source: Apple. The business rationale behind the Iris Pro models was simple to understand: Intel wanted personal computer makers to, instead of paying a graphics-processor vendor for a low-end stand-alone graphics processor, put those extra dollars toward an Intel processor with a roughly comparable integrated graphics processor. It's not hard to see that capturing that dollar content would lift the average selling prices of Intel's processors, ultimately boosting Intel's revenue and gross profit. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) used versions of Intel's fourth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro inside the 15-inch MacBook Pro computers it launched between 2013 and 2015 (but still offered potential buyers the option to choose stand-alone graphics as well). The Mac maker also utilized fifth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro inside the 21.5-inch iMac desktop computers launched in 2015. However, with its latest 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, Apple passed on newer Core i7 processors with Iris Pro; instead, it opted for variants with vanilla Intel HD graphics, and now includes stand-alone graphics processors in all new 15-inch MacBook Pro systems. Although prior leaks showing Intel's future notebook processor plans indicated that Iris Pro was a goner, Apple's processor choice inside of the 15-inch MacBook Pro makes it official. What does this mean for Intel? Although it may seem that this is somewhat bad news for Intel, particularly as the chipmaker likely charged Apple (and the small group of other companies that used the technology) a premium for these parts over what it charges for chips with vanilla HD graphics, over the long term it's not that bad. It could even be a positive development. For one thing, even though Iris Pro appears to have run its course, Intel is still selling Iris-based processors. Iris technology is fundamentally the same as Iris Pro, except it is used in lower-power processors: Iris Pro was found on 45-watt chips, and Iris is used in Intel's premium 15-watt and 28-watt chips. Iris is a much more sensible product, because the kinds of laptops that use 15-watt or 28-watt chips tend not to have the power and space budgets to accommodate a worthwhile stand-alone graphics processor. In contrast, if a system can support a 45-watt processor, it's likely to have the power and space budgets to include a discrete graphics processor as well. Indeed, Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro computers use Intel processors with Iris graphics, and the technology seems to be picking up steam with other personal computer makers (such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), VAIO, Dell, and Lenovo Group (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY). So, Intel should still be able to improve its notebook processor mix as it improves the value proposition of its Iris graphics offerings. For Intel's efforts here to succeed, though, customers need to believe that by picking laptops with Iris technology, they will be able to enjoy modern games at reasonable performance and quality settings. That will have to come from a combination of Intel delivering good performance with its Iris technology, and Intel effectively marketing the technology to customers. Intel's mix opportunity beyond graphics It's also important to note that, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, Intel's replacement for the quad-core notebook processors with Iris Pro graphics will be a hex-core processor with vanilla Intel HD graphics. If Intel can command a premium for the six-core part relative to the quad-core part, as it did with the quad-core chips with Iris Pro relative to the quad-core parts with standard Intel HD graphics, then the chipmaker still has an opportunity to sell a richer mix of products. Gaming laptops could be prime candidates for higher-priced, higher-core count processors. And, to be blunt, far more customers (especially in the gaming-laptop and mobile-workstation markets) are likely to be willing to pay extra for more processor cores than to pay extra for more integrated graphics performance. Over the next couple of years, I suspect the removal of Iris Pro from its lineup, coupled with increased focus on Iris graphics for low-power chips and higher CPU core counts for higher-power chips, could help Intel sell a richer notebook processor mix than it does today. Why increasing product mix is important The personal-computer market is generally believed to be in decline, and there's little that Intel can do to change those broader trends. What Intel can do is try to deliver more value with its processors, so that when people do go to purchase personal computers, they have incentive to buy machines with more powerful (and more expensive) Intel processors. More cores is a nice selling point. Intel may even want to consider revamping its branding efforts to make sure customers are aware of which laptops with Core i7 processors pack four cores and which ones have six (though this is a topic for another day). A richer product mix can certainly help to offset unit declines. For example, over the last three quarters combined, Intel says that although its laptop processor unit shipments dropped 1%, average selling prices here went up 2% -- ultimately leading to slight revenue growth. In desktop processors, Intel saw a similar trend, though one not quite as good: Volumes dropped 5%, but the resulting revenue drop was somewhat offset by a 2% increase in average selling prices. The more that Intel can do to sell a richer mix of products in the face of unit-volume shipments which range from flat to slightly down, the better of a shot the company has to keep its PC-related revenues stable over time.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 11:27AM Per a report from well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities (via MacRumors), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning to launch new MacBook Pro systems during the second half of 2017. These new systems, the analyst says, could support up to 32 gigabytes of system memory -- an increase from the 16 gigabytes that the recently released models have. Image source: Apple.  Kuo says that this memory increase "depends on whether or not [MacBook processor supplier] Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) ships Cannonlake CPU on time in 2017, which features 15-25% less power consumption of LPDDR 4, versus the existing LPDDR 3." The analyst further goes on to explain that "If Cannonlake doesn't enter mass production as expected, the new models launched in 2H17 will adopt Coffee Lake, which continues to adopt LPDDR 3, and maximum DRAM support will remain unchanged at 16GB." Here's why this analysis is so confusing.  Why don't the new MacBook Pro computers support 32 gigabytes of memory?  The current 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro systems use Intel's sixth-generation Core processors, also widely referred to by their internal code name, Skylake.  The fact that these chips only support the older, less-efficient LPDDR3 memory type is widely believed to be the reason that Apple doesn't offer 32 gigabytes of memory in these new systems (since that much LPDDR3 would draw too much power, forcing Apple to lower its advertised battery life targets).  The idea behind this analysis seems to be that once Intel's high-performance processors begin to offer support for the newer, more-efficient LPDDR4 memory standard, Apple will be able to increase the amount of memory that it can offer in these systems without sacrificing battery life.  That's straightforward enough; what's so confusing, then?  Code name confusion The only thing that doesn't quite make sense with Kuo's analysis is that Coffee Lake is merely the code-name for the high-performance notebook chips based on the Cannon Lake architecture (a fact first published right here at The Motley Fool). A likely explanation for why Intel doesn't just call this product family Cannon Lake (rather than Coffee Lake) is that instead of being manufactured on Intel's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, these processors will be built on an enhanced version of Intel's 14-nanometer technology. In other words, Coffee Lake is fundamentally a Cannon Lake chip; if Cannon Lake supports LPDDR4 (and it is extremely likely that it does), then so will Coffee Lake.  Kuo's analysis is sound with a simple change An argument that makes more sense is the following: If Intel can get Coffee Lake into Apple's hands soon enough, then MacBook Pro systems launched in the second half of 2017 will gain support for LPDDR4, paving the way for configurations with 32 gigabytes of memory.  If Intel can't get Coffee Lake out in that time frame, Apple must use Intel's Kaby Lake processor family to hit a second-half 2017 release schedule. Kaby Lake uses the same fundamental chip architecture as Skylake (though the implementation of that architecture has been reworked to take advantage of an enhanced 14-nanometer process), and therefore doesn't support LPDDR4 memory.  Bummer for MacBook Pro power users Unfortunately for potential MacBook Pro buyers eager to get their ahold of MacBook Pro computers with 32 gigabytes of memory, the latest Intel roadmap leaks show that Coffee Lake isn't due out until the second quarter of 2018. This means that, barring a pull-in of Coffee Lake's development schedule (unlikely given Intel's track record), Apple has two choices: Refresh the MacBook Pro in the second half of 2017 with Kaby Lake processors with memory support topping out at 16 gigabytes; or Hold off on refreshing the MacBook Pro until the first half of 2018 to be able to use the newer, superior Coffee Lake processors, which could make 32 gigabyte system configurations a reality.  If Kuo is correct that new MacBook Pro computers are coming in the second half of 2017, then consumers shouldn't expect those computers to be configurable with 32 gigabytes of memory.

If you’ve been waiting ever-so patiently to upgrade your ultrabook, now is a better time than ever to start shopping for the best value ultrabook in 2017! As Intel’s latest 7th-generation Core processors begin to roll out to the masses, the new processors offer upwards of 15% more power while cutting their battery usage in half, meaning you can tear through reports at work or games online for hours at a time without worrying about finding a plug in between. Other factors that make these ultrabooks better than the rest for the value is their increased hard drive space (no less than 128GB SSD), their faster RAM (1866MHz LPDDR3 or above), and at least 8 hours of battery life on a single charge. All those factors considered, we’ve come to the conclusion that the best rated value ultrabook is the refreshed 2017 Dell XPS 13. This is a laptop that continues to dominate the ultrabook space with precision engineering and a level of quality unlike anything else, often surpassing even Apple both in beauty and power combined. Best Value Ultrabook 2017   Dell XPS 13 HP Spectre x360 13t Acer Aspire S 13 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice/ Best Value Ultrabook #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating N/A N/A Screen Size 13.3" 13.3" 13.3" Display 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 Battery Life Up to 12hrs Up to 15hrs Up to 11hrs Touchscreen CPU 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-6200U RAM 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 Storage 128GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD Weight 2.7 pounds 2.85 pounds 2.87 pounds Price $999.99 $1049.99 $669.99 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now How We Choose the Best Value Ultrabook When we talk about the ultrabook category, the idea of value is definitely a fleeting one. All that said, in this space it’s all about getting the most bang for the bucks you do end up spending, so what does all that mean? Well, first you should understand what is an ultrabook? Next, it’s important to know that our top two choices in the category include the absolute latest in Intel’s processor lineup: the 7th-gen “Kaby Lake” CPUs. The company says users can expect about a 12-14% boost in power from these chips over their Skylake-based predecessors, all while saving around 10% more battery to power them throughout the day. Next there’s RAM, which should be at least 8GB of LPDDR3 or above, while the hard drive has to be at minimum a 128GB SSD (all three models include a 256GB upgrade option as well). Last there’s the screen, which needs to be at least 1920 x 1080 resolution to ensure you have as much real estate as possible to get all the productivity you need out of your best value ultrabook. Why You Should Buy the Best Value Ultrabook As is the case with any technology, the world of ultrabooks is a rapidly evolving beast that never stays in one place for any longer than it has to. There have been a number of significant upgrades that have hit ultrabooks in 2016, namely the upgraded hard drives and the newer processors. Not only that, RAM capacities and speeds have also gone up quite a bit, so if you’ve been waiting for over two years to upgrade there’s never going to be a better time to jump on that train than now. #1 Pick  Dell XPS 13/Editor’s Choice The Dell XPS 13 is the king that continues to reign supreme over all ultrabook contenders Price: $999.99 | Features: 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 12-hr battery life, 13.3″ full-HD screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Kaby Lake brings the Dell XPS line of ultrabooks into the future.  As though it should come as any kind of surprise, once again the Dell XPS 13 tops our list of the best value ultrabooks of 2017. With their recent upgrade to the all new line of 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors, the latest XPS ultrabooks are faster and more power efficient than ever, a real feat considering how long they lasted on a single charge before. The model we’ve featured comes with a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked to 1866MHz, and a 128GB SSD. Technically there is a cheaper option that starts at $799 with only 4GB of RAM and an i3-7100 clocked to 2.1GHz, though we recommend the $999 version if you plan on doing any serious work in the near future while using the best value ultrabook of 2017! View on Dell  #2 Pick  HP Spectre x360 13t If this were a contest of pure sex appeal alone, the HP Spectre x360 would be way out in front of the pack Price: $1049.99  | Features: 2-in-1 hinge, 1920 x 1080 13.3″ touchscreen display, 15hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Spectre x360 wins on almost pure sex appeal alone. Value aside, it’s hard to look at the new line of HP Spectre x360 ultrabooks and not want one to show off to all your friends just for the sake of having the sexiest looking laptop at the coffee shop. HP was never one to release any laptops or ultrabooks that I found particularly attractive, but none of that really seemed to matter as soon as I laid eyes on this downright gorgeous piece of ultra-mobile kit. With sleek, svelte lines and a nearly bezel-less 13.3″ touchscreen display, this 2-in-1 has the power and the brains to make itself a must-have on any tech geek’s Christmas list. Read More: Best Ultrabooks In true HP fashion you actually get a decent set of specs for not a lot of cash, too. The included i7-7200U is the same as what we found on the Dell, and although the HD Graphics 620 chip may not be much to write home about, it’s still plenty for the average user and will still handle 4K video output with some help from the Kaby Lake upgrade. View on HP #3 Pick  Acer Aspire S 13 Despite its older processor, the Aspire S 13 offers serious value all around Price: $669.99  | Features: 0.57″ thick, 8GB LPDDR3 SDRAM, 13.3″ FHD screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Acer Aspire S 13 is perfect for anyone who likes their ultrabooks thin, light, and cheap.  Last up we come to the true “value” pick of the bunch, the Acer Aspire S 13. The Aspire line of ultrabooks are a go-to choice for thousands of road warriors who need an upgrade in this category, and the S model is no different. At just $669 this is far and away the cheapest option here, but that discounted price comes at a compromise. The Acer Aspire S 13 unfortunately only includes last year’s 2.3GHz Skylake-based Intel Core i5-6200U processor, but fret not, because it more than makes up for what it lacks there with its stunningly razor-thin profile of just 0.57 inches. It’s also feather-light at 2.87lbs, and still manages to include all our minimum requirements on the side like a 256GB SSD, 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and 11 hours of battery life. If you need a fast, light, and ultra-portable ultrabook that can take a beating and look great doing it, it’s pretty obvious what is the best value ultrabook for you! View on Amazon Most Important Features Weight In true ultrabook fashion, all the choices we’ve listed here weigh in on the scales at less than 3lbs each, with the Dell XPS 13 taking the title at a mere 2.7lbs. Don’t worry though, the HP Spectre x360 follows closely behind at 2.85lbs, while the Acer Aspire S 13 tips the scales as the “heaviest” at 2.87lbs. Battery life Ultrabooks are made to go wherever you need them to, and last at least 8 hours on a single charge thanks to Intel’s pre-mandated requirements that every laptop must meet if it wants the honor of calling itself “ultra”. Display As anyone who’s owned a laptop sporting anything less than 1920 x 1080 resolution can attest; getting work done on a low-res screen can be a frustrating, hair-thinning experience for even the most seasoned road warriors among us. With a full-HD display you have more room for more windows at a time, making it simple to keep multiple programs running simultaneously side-by-side. Price And last but certainly not least, there’s the price of your next value ultrabook. On a purely pound-for-dollar basis, the Aspire S 13 is obviously the clear winner, but we’d also suggest giving both the XPS 13 and Spectre a second look in case you aren’t satisfied with the price. Both models have multiple budget configurations available, which at least in the case of the XPS, can bring the price all the way down to a cool $799 out the door. Mistakes or Things to Avoid Don’t buy more than you need: The first rule in value shopping is to always buy exactly what you need, and don’t spend a dime on an extra spec more. All three models included on this list have multiple configurations that can change the price of the unit wildly, anywhere from $799 up to $2500 in some situations, so be sure you custom-tailor your next ultrabook to fit right in the range of specs-to-price that first you best. Don’t get one for gaming: As great as these ultrabooks are for getting work done quickly and efficiently, they’re going to slog hard if you try and do any serious gaming on them. Because most of their cost is put on the processor and battery, the GPU is generally the first spec to take the biggest hit when it comes to cutting down on costs.   What Else You Should Think About Now that you know everything you need to about the best value ultrabook for 2017, what else do you need to know about the world of ultrabooks and everything they have to offer? If you’re still not sure whether or not you want to splurge on an ultrabook or if a Chromebook might do the job just as well for a fraction of the cost, you should check out our showdown between the two types in Ultrabooks vs. Chromebooks. Also, there’s tons of lighter, cheaper options to choose from in the Lightest Ultrabooks of 2016, and if the HP Spectre x360 is your style but you want more selection, we’ve got you covered with the Best 2-in-1 Ultrabooks of 2016. No matter what you need, picks like the Dell XPS 13 continue to shine bright as a well-built, solid all-around choice for anyone that needs a workhorse to get them through the day and won’t need to get plugged in for another charge until well into the night.

It becomes the most powerful gaming laptop of this size ever from the PC maker, thanks to the combination of an Intel quad-core H-class CPU and Nvidia 1000 series GPU. Other modern PC architecture niceties such as DDR4 memory and SSD-only storage support the headline component specs. Dell provides a wide range of Alienware 13 configurations which it is also possible to further customise before purchase. All of the machines are claimed to be VR-Ready due to the excellent entry level spec which includes; an Intel Core i5-6300HQ processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB GDDR5, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 180GB M.2 SATA 6Gb/s SSD. This entry model features a 13.3 inch HD (1366 x 768) TN Anti-Glare 200-nits display. The starting price for a machine thus configured is US$1199. Moving up to more expensive pre-built models you can go for an IPS 1080p display, or even an OLED 1440p display. Processors can be upgraded as far as an Intel Core i7-6700HQ, pre-built-RAM configurations offer up to 16GB DDR4 but can be further configured to 32GB. Storage in pre-built configs tops out at 512GB PCIe SSD but can be upgraded up to 2x 1TB PCIe SSDs. The pre-built configurations plateau at US$2099. Other major Alienware 13 features are its standard Windows 10 OS, 76Wh lithium Ion battery, Alienware Sound Centre and Audio Recon software with 2.0 Speaker configuration, Alienware HD+IR presence detection camera (with Windows Hello and Tobii eye tracking support), Killer 1435 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1, a new Alienware TactX keyboard with 2.2mm of key travel and N key rollover, an upgraded thermal design (with the 'thermal shelf' behind its screen), and AlienFX lighting. The Alienware 13 measures 390 x 259 x 23.3mm and weighs 2Kg. The full list of ports is as follows: SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type-C Port SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type-A Port RJ-45 Killer Networks e2400 Gigabit Ethernet Port Mini-Display Port 1.2 (certified) Output HDMI 2.0 Output Thunderbolt 3 Port (USB Type-C with support for SuperSpeed USB 10Gbps, 40Gbps Thunderbolt, and DisplayPort) Alienware Graphics Amplifier Port Power/DC-in Jack Noble Lock port (cable and lock sold separately) SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type-A Port with PowerShare technology Headphone 1/8" Port (re-taskable for Microphone/Line-In analogue audio input) Audio Out 1/8" Ports (Compatible with inline mic headset) Though you have the on-board GTX 1060 6GB graphics the Alienware 13 is still compatible with the Alienware Graphics Amplifier. Such an expansion would facilitate upgrading to your choice of full length, dual-width graphics card and provides an additional 4-port USB 3.0 hub.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Review: The $1,499 2016 MacBook Pro is an expensive MacBook Air on the inside Touch Bar tests must wait, but this MBP is neither high-end nor entry-level. by Andrew Cunningham - Nov 2, 2016 11:30 am UTC Login to bookmark 506 Andrew Cunningham The $1,499 version of the 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro.

You can't fault longtime die-hard Mac users for being a little frustrated with Apple. In the space of just a decade, they've watched their favorite platform go from being the center of the company's attention to a minor line item. The iPhone gets refreshed promptly and consistently every September, while some Macs sit there for one or two or three years without even being mentioned. Macs aren't even regularly refreshed with new processors from Intel, Nvidia, and AMD as they're released anymore; we could rely on that as recently as three years ago. The new MacBook Pros—released, for the record, a year and a half after the 2015 models, which were in some cases changed very little from the 2014 and 2013 models—have been birthed into this era of frustration. As a result, the initial reaction has been harsher than it would have been if Apple refreshed the Mac with the same regularity that it managed back in 2012 or 2013. But not everyone is a longtime Mac user, and divorced from that context what you've got in the new MacBook Pros is a lineup of very nice-looking (if not game-changing) laptops that combine a refreshed design with a healthy dose of updated technology. Today, we'll be examining the $1,499 version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the version with the row of function keys in place of the ballyhooed Touch Bar. We'll be examining the other 13- and 15-inch model thoroughly when we can get them, of course, but the $1,499 version still tells us a lot about the design, the keyboard, the new Thunderbolt 3 ports, and about Apple's design priorities and the Pro's target audience. Differences between the Touch Bar model and this one Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.0GHz Intel Core i5-6360U (Turbo up to 3.1GHz) RAM 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 540 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 867Mbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 54.5Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,499.99 Price as reviewed $1,499.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, dual integrated mics The Touch Bar is the biggest feature separating this entry-level MacBook Pro from the more expensive models, but there are some other small and not-so-small differences you have to live with when you opt for the $1,499 model. This is the complete list—otherwise, assume that the two share all the same features. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers (one of those controllers uses "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which I assume means it's using PCI Express 2.0 instead of 3.0). Intel’s Thunderbolt controllers support a maximum of two Thunderbolt 3 ports each, and while many PC OEMs are shipping Thunderbolt 3, none is providing more than one or two ports. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard should all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. Look and feel If the Retina MacBook was what you’d get if an iPad and a MacBook Air were put into the Large Hadron Collider and smashed into each other, the new MacBook Pro is what you’d get if you took the Retina MacBook and the first Retina MacBook Pro and did the same thing. Like the MacBook, the new Pros are slimmer, have much smaller display bezels and footprints, and jettison many ports. Like the previous Pro, they’re a uniform thickness throughout rather than tapered, they’ve still got more powerful processors, and because of those more powerful components they still have fans inside. The Pro’s construction is still rock solid despite being thinner and lighter, and there’s still not a trace of creaking or flexing anywhere in its aluminum unibody design. If you were bothered by previous designs’ unadorned metal or the hard corners of their wrist rests, none of that has changed. Apple does offer both a “space gray” finish alongside the classic silver, though the MacBook’s gold and rose gold finishes and the iPhone 7’s black and jet black finishes aren’t available. I tend to prefer darker gray and black colors when I can get them, and the space gray finish is really nice even if it still bothers me that Apple can’t quite keep the “space gray” color consistent across different product lines and model years. At 3.02 pounds, the new Pro is around half a pound lighter than last year’s and roughly the same weight as the 13-inch MacBook Air. I’m jumping from the 13-inch Air to the 13-inch Pro since I can’t quite live with the 12-inch MacBook’s performance or its individual port, so if you’re making that jump the laptop is going to feel exactly the same in your bag. The weight savings is noticeable but not life-changing if you’re coming from an earlier Retina model, but remember that it’s a full 1.5 pounds lighter than a pre-Retina, 13-inch unibody Pro—if you’re coming from one of those older machines, it makes a huge difference. The laptop’s fan is normally not audible in a room with little to no ambient noise. You can definitely notice it spin up if you’re pushing the laptop’s performance for an extended period, but it’s quieter than the previous Pros or Airs, and it’s much quieter than the jet engine-style noises that come out of some PC Ultrabooks. Even when the fan is going at full-tilt, the laptop can still get pretty warm, especially underneath and on the area above the keyboard. Still, it never gets too uncomfortable to hold or rest on your lap.

The security group has begun refining its channel strategy and will continue that process after Intel spins it off as separate security firm under the McAfee banner in partnership with investment firm TPG.

The move comes five years after Intel completed its $7.7bn acquisition of McAfee and just two years after rebranding it as Intel Security. Intel will retain a 49% stake in the new business, which is expected to be up and running by the second quarter of 2017, led by Intel Security chief Chris Young and his existing management team. “The way organisations are consuming security products is changing, and our channel strategy is changing in response to that,” Steranka told Computer Weekly at Intel Security’s annual Focus conference in Las Vegas. Today, most of the products are perpetual and installed on-premise, he said, and often not implemented correctly or to their optimal ability. “It is often a painful exercise for companies. They spend the capex [capital expenditure], but do not always achieve the outcomes they were expecting,” said Steranka. As a result, he said, companies are looking to move to subscription models that enable them to pay for security products as they are used and as they deliver value. That is key to Intel Security’s “cloud first” strategy, he said, which is also aimed at accommodating the fact that many organisations’ infrastructure is not on-premise any more, but in the cloud. “The deployment model is also changing because organisations’ workloads are increasingly not on-premise but in the cloud, and that is where they are looking to secure them,” said Steranka. Selling products reaps rewards Security is becoming more services orientated than product orientated, said Steranka, and organisations are recognising that security needs to be applied to all assets in an IT infrastructure all the time. Because organisations typically do not have enough people to do that, he said they are looking to other companies to augment their security capabilities by manging alerts and helping to respond to breaches when they are detected. “Our channel is shifting to those dynamics of moving into subscription-based services, selling products that are more born in the cloud and putting all those together in a services-based offering aimed at providing a security capability,” he said. Steranka said in response to these changes, Intel Security has shifted its partner programme from being a fairly basic reward programme based on volume to one that is focused more on competencies of the partners and meeting the needs of the customer. “It is the consultative element and the services element that are the most important to them for achieving the security outcomes they are looking for,” he said. “We have started with product competencies in selling – and, in 2016, we introduced the requirement that partners be certified in selling competencies in three product areas, but plan to add more service competencies in 2017. “Training is a key area where we are investing money to bring out new courses on implementation, design and architecting.” However, Steranka said as important as training is, it can be done only inside the confines of the existing talent pool. “What we have got to do from a technology perspective is to simplify things through more automation of security processes to free up human resources, and so enabling products to do more on their own is part of our product roadmap,” he said. Increasing partner profitability As part of the new partnership programme, he said the company is looking to continually increase partner profitability through new products and business models, and making fundamental changes to partner rebates. “We have just announced a platinum rebate programme that is dramatically simplified and starts to pay out money to partners earlier – as early as 80% achievement of their quarterly target,” he said. According to Steranka, there are also “pretty substantial” accelerators such as the payment of an 8% rebate on achieving 150% of target in response to feedback from partners. “We are listening to what they think works and what doesn’t and we are making those changes pretty rapidly,” he said. Spin-off business welcomed by partners Channel partners have responded positively to the news of the planned spin off, said Steranka. “Some have said to me that they felt that powerful and internationally recognised McAfee brand had been diluted and lost in the integration [of McAfee with Intel] They are excited about not having to explain who Intel Security is,” he said. But Steranka said it is important to note that Intel will remain a very active partner in the new business. “The opportunity to bring raw silicon – and what we can do in security defence there – together with our software capability is still a powerful story that is interesting to our partners. “We will be taking all of the good that happened with Intel, but being a separate entity with very strong financial backing from TPG will give us the ability to innovate and execute at a quicker pace than we could have as a group inside Intel,” he said. The spin off, said Steranka, opens up opportunities to work with a growing number of partners, particularly with global system integrators, service providers and host companies as organisations move towards more services-based security. “Until now we have been contained in terms of developing everything internally, but with the strong [financial] backing of TPG, we can start thinking about mergers and acquisitions, although there is nothing immediately on the horizon,” he said.

The Alienware 13 sports a GTX 10 series graphics card and a sixth-generation Intel Skylake processor with a base price of $1,199.  ( Dell ) Advertisement Alienware's touting itself as the maker of the first virtual reality-ready 13-inch laptop with the new Alienware 13, a powerful notebook that packs an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics card, sixth-generation Intel Skylake chips and up to 16 GB of RAM. Alienware's name carries the weight of reputable gaming computers none of which are underserved with mediocre specs. The company's highly recognized for top-tier high-powered laptops, and Alienware 13 remains a service to that brand but with the prized presence of virtual reality tagging along. This year saw tremendous inroads for virtual reality, as several companies fumbled together its own virtual reality headsets such as Google's Daydream, Sony's PlayStation VR, HTC and Valve's HTC Vive and others, with the sustained imminence of mobile VR platforms slowly gaining traction. It's still a fairly nascent platform, but many companies have been exceedingly toying with it, even Atari's Nolan Bushnell wants in on the game. The Alienware 13 comes as Alienware's entry point in accessible virtual reality experiences because the setup involved in creating a VR experience requires very powerful and bulky equipment, a prerequisite many VR companies try to quash in order to make the appeal of the platform immediate. The base model of the VR-ready Alienware 13 has a powerful Intel Core i5-6300HQ chip alongside an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics chip, specifically, the GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB GDDR5 and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM. This configuration will net you $1,199, but if you prefer beefier specs, there are Core i7 models with 16 GB of RAM at much higher price points. In terms of storage, Alienware 13 comes with up to 2 TB of internal storage split into two: 1 TB of PCI express of solid state drive as a boot drive, and the other terabyte serves as storage. The screen may also come in different options, with the lowest being a 13.3-inch 1,366 x 768 display. If low-resolution displays are a pet peeve, there's an option for a 1080p IPS display and a Quad HD display with touch control. Of course, a better screen spells a more expensive price. In terms of portability, the Alienware 13 weighs below six pounds and is less than an inch thick at its thickest point. Alienware has outfitted this laptop with "maximum thermal design power support," which keeps the system cool even under intensive performance. It comes with a 76 Wh battery and customizable color schemes for the keyboard. The Alienware 13 is available now on Dell's online store, which ships in 23 to 27 business days.

May Bring to the 2018 MacBook Pro Line Although Apple just refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup, the next iterations of these systems could see substantial performance boosts. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 1, 2016 at 9:26PM On Oct. 27, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its long-awaited refresh to the MacBook Pro lineup. The company released three new models, including two 13-inch models and a 15-inch model. These machines have seen substantial improvements across the board, ranging from much better displays to faster processors, and a lot more.  Apple's new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro systems. Image source: Apple.  Although Apple managed to deliver some nice generation-over-generation improvements, it is very likely that the company's next MacBook Pro refreshes -- which I expect to come in the first half of 2018 --- will include some very substantial upgrades in one critical area: processor performance. Get ready for a large leap in performance Apple delivered solid improvements in the performance levels of its latest MacBook Pro systems relative to the prior-generation models. The 13-inch MacBook Pro saw a move from Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) older Broadwell architecture with vanilla Intel HD graphics to its newer Skylake processors with its more sophisticated Iris graphics. The 15-inch MacBook Pro enjoyed a bump from Intel's 2013 Haswell architecture to its much more modern Skylake architecture. That's a two-generation leap. However, even though the underlying processor architectures in the newer MacBook Pro systems are improved relative to those found in the prior-generation models, one thing has remained constant across the board: processor core count. Both the old and new 13-inch MacBook Pro systems come with dual-core processors, and both the old and new 15-inch MacBook Pro systems come with quad-core processors. These are currently among the fastest notebook processors available today, and certainly the highest core count Intel laptop processors available in their respective segments. However, those core counts are set to go much higher in Intel's early 2018 mobile processor lineup, which I believe Apple's next MacBook Pro systems are likely to use. More cores for the Mac Intel's next-next generation processor lineup, code-named Coffee Lake, is expected to come in a couple of new configurations that should be quite interesting to Apple. According to a leak of an Intel mobile processor road map that has made its way across the Web, the company's 28-watt processor lineup, used in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, is expected to get a variant with four processor cores paired with the company's Iris graphics technology. The 45-watt processor lineup, used in the 15-inch MacBook Pro, is expected to come in a configuration with six processor cores and Intel HD graphics, according to the leak. Those additional cores should enable a large boost in performance, particularly in applications that can take advantage of those additional cores -- think video editing. Apple's tight control of the hardware and software could better position it to find compelling use cases for the additional performance, and should Apple market the increase correctly, it could help to fuel a robust MacBook Pro upgrade cycle. We could see one even stronger than what we'll witness with Apple's recently released MacBook Pro systems -- though the strength of that remains to be seen. Not a game changer for Apple stock, but... The Mac product line isn't the major driver of Apple's revenue or profit. The iPhone is. Nevertheless, it's important for Apple's non-iPhone businesses, such as its Mac business, to perform as well as possible to provide something of a cushion in case the company's iPhone business has a bum year, as it did during fiscal 2016. Apple credited Mac with 12% of revenue in the fourth quarter. As long as Apple makes sure it delivers compelling new Mac systems at a regular and predictable cadence through a combination of delivering its own hardware and software innovations and leveraging innovations from key component suppliers, it stands a pretty good chance of keeping its Mac business healthy.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library Adds OpenGL 4.5 Capability, Radeon Vulkan Driver GO OpenGL 4.4 support is available as well in this release Nov 1, 2016 23:59 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After being in development for the past month or so, during which it received a total of three RC (Release Candidate) builds, the final version of the highly-anticipated Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library is now available for GNU/Linux distributions. And it looks like it's a major release that we must install on our Linux-powered computers if we want to play games, use various OpenGL apps, or just have the best possible graphics support for our AMD Radeon, Nvidia, or Intel GPUs. The biggest new feature of Mesa 13.0.0 is, as expected, OpenGL 4.4 and OpenGL 4.5 capability. While OpenGL 4.4/4.5 is there after upgrading to Mesa 13.0.0 stable, the drivers may show a lower version. That happens because of the pending Khronos CTS validation, but it will be fixed very soon in an upcoming point release, such as 13.0.1. The good news continues with a Radeon Vulkan driver (RADV) for supported AMD Radeon GPUs by the AMDGPU kernel driver. OpenGL ES 3.2 now available for Intel Skylake or later The list of cool new features implemented in today's Mesa 3D 13.0.0 Graphics Library release continues with OpenGL ES 3.2 support for Intel Skylake or later, OpenGL ES 3.1 support for Intel Haswell, Windows-DRI support to the GLX component, as well as KHR_no_config_context and EGL_KHR_debug support for EGL component. The Mesa EGL interface also received official support for EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless, along with various improvements for Android, X11/DRI3, and Wayland backends. H.264 encoding support is now available for the Video Acceleration API (VAAPI) and H.265 decoding support for OMX. You should also know that Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library requires Flex 2.6.1 or older, libudev is no longer required and was replaced by libdrm, third-party tools are required for certain components, such as xxd for Intel's aubinator and python2 for SWR, and dozens of GL extensions have been added to the included drivers. Check out the full release notes for more details.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 is ready for anything by Zak Killian  2:59 PM on November 3, 2016 Panasonic's Toughbooks are well-known and respected in industrial and emergency environments for their durability, reliability, and long battery life. The company also sells similarly-ruggedized tablets under the Toughpad brand, and today it announced that the latest version of its 10.1" Toughpad FZ-G1 is now available in the U.S. We haven't really talked about the Toughpads previously here at TR. The FZ-G1 is now in its 4th revision, but you wouldn't know by looking at it; the exterior is unchanged since its inception. Inside, the machine is now powered by an Intel Core i5-6300U SoC and its HD 520 graphics. There are 8GB of DDR3L memory on tap, a 256GB solid-state drive (a 512GB unit is optional), and 64-bit Windows 10 Pro. This latest revision includes an Intel 8260 chip providing dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. The FZ-G1's 1920x1200 LED-backlit IPS display remains unchanged. Panasonic fits the tablet with a ridiculously powerful backlight that can ramp the brightness up to 800 cd/m² to ensure outdoor readability even at mid-day. The capacitive touchscreen has 10-point multi-touch capability, as well as gloved and wet-touch support. The machine includes a waterproof active stylus and seven hardware buttons along the bottom edge of the screen, two of which are user-configurable. As with most tablets, the FZ-G1 includes both a front-facing camera and an 8MP rear camera. Of course, the real point of the Toughpad is its extreme durability. Panasonic describes the machine as "fully rugged," and that moniker seems apt. The tablet's chassis is crafted from magnesium alloy, and then that frame is encased in ABS plastic with thick elastomer corner guards. It has MIL-STD-810G certification for shock, vibration, and weather resistance, too. The spec says it will consistently survive drops from four feet, and also that it's weatherproof. Curiously, Panasonic says the solid-state drive has its own heater. Panasonic also proudly states that the battery life of the FZ-G1 has nearly doubled since its original incarnation, from 8 hours to 14 hours. The company also offers an optional long-life battery that it says supports up to 28 hours of continuous operation. If that's not enough, the device has a multi-function bay that can accept a bridge battery to allow users to change main batteries without shutting down the machine. Panasonic offers additional options for the multi-function bay, like a serial port, an Ethernet port, a magnetic stripe reader, or a GPS unit. While that all sounds pretty fancy, top-class engineering like this doesn't come cheap. Panasonic says the FZ-G1 is available at US distributors now starting at $2,899.

While Apple's offerings are true laptops with a few mobile-inspired perks, Microsoft bills the Surface Pro 4 as a tablet that can replace your laptop. For the purpose of this comparison, we're focusing on the two current 13-inch MacBook Pros and the varying configurations of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro is sold as a tablet, but it gains much of its laptop-esque functionality from the add-on (but essential) Type Cover, a detachable keyboard and trackpad extension that's sold separately. Size Apple's laptops are relatively thin for their size. Meanwhile, the Surface Pro 4 (sans keyboard) is one capacious and hefty tablet – at least compared to mobile-only tablets like the iPad. Keep in mind that the Surface's keyboard adds some extra total depth (not factored into this measurement) when it's folded shut over the screen. Weight The 13-inch MacBook Pros weigh 1.37 kilograms, or about 3 pounds. The Surface Pro's weight depends on what configuration you're using. The lightest tablet plus keyboard combination possible is 1.06 kilograms. If you upgrade to an i5 or i7 processor (see below) the set-up will weigh 20 grams more. That would still be about 25-percent lighter than a MacBook Pro. Build MacBooks are still rocking their characteristic aluminum unibody. Microsoft uses a magnesium alloy for the Surface Pro build. The Type Cover is made from a soft, fabric-like material. Colors MacBook Pros are available in two neutral metallic tones. The Surface Pro tablet is only available in silver, but the Type Cover is available in black, blue, bright blue, red or teal. Display size The MacBook Pro display is an inch larger across the diagonal. That gives it an 11-percent area advantage over the Surface Pro 4. Display resolution The Surface Pro's pixels are 16-percent more dense, which may be especially noticeable when viewing it closely in tablet mode. Still, there is more to display quality than resolution alone, and we don't have any complaints about the new MacBook Pros. Touchscreen Apple has reiterated that there are no intentions of creating a touchscreen MacBook, but Microsoft isn't afraid to create machines with several input options. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-fledged touchscreen. Tablet mode No surprises here – the Surface Pro is a tablet first, and you don't need to buy the Type Cover to use it as such (though it wouldn't make for much of a product without its transforming 2-in-1 nature). Trackpad This year's MacBook Pros have huge glass solid-state trackpads. The trackpad doesn't actually move but instead has click-mimicking haptic feedback. It's also Force Touch-equipped, which means it differentiates between a light touch and a more forceful press. Apple has been playing up this pressure-sensitivity as a big efficiency measure, but we sometimes find it a little too touchy. You'll need a Type Cover to get trackpad functionality with the Surface Pro. The Type Cover has a traditional glass trackpad (similar to pre-Force Touch trackpads on the MacBook). Touch Bar 13-inch MacBook Pros are available with or without a Touch Bar. The Touch Bar replaces the row of Fn keys at the top of the keyboard with a dynamic app-specific shortcut bar that you can control with a fingertip. Stylus Every device in the Surface Pro line comes with a pressure-sensitive Surface Pen stylus for drawing, writing and mousing on-screen. Fingerprint sensor Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros have built-in Touch ID. The versions with traditional Fn keys do not have a fingerprint sensor. There's no fingerprint sensor on the Surface Pro or on the base model Type Cover. For an additional US$30, however, you can spring for a Type Cover with integrated fingerprint sensor for additional security. Processor MacBook Pros have an Intel Core i5 (Skylark) processor. The Touch Bar version reaches higher speeds than the base model. The entry level Surface Pro has a relatively weak Intel Core m3 processor, but there are options to upgrade to the much better i5 or i7 chips instead. Microsoft hasn't published clock speeds. One bonus of going with the entry-level SP4 is that it's fanless and silent as the grave. Graphics These machines have integrated Intel GPUs. With the Surface Pro, each processor has a different pairing. All MacBook Pros have a generation-newer Intel GPU. Storage MacBook Pros are ready-built with either 256 or 512 GB. You can also special order 1 TB versions directly from Apple. Storage options for the Surface Pro vary depending on which processor you choose, but there are several options. The smallest 128 GB option is only available with the m3 processor; the 1 TB storage option is only possible with the top-shelf i7. USB ports MacBook Pro ports are exclusively Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. There are two on the base model and four on the Touch Bar variant. The Surface Pro has one full-size USB port. Either way, you'll probably need an adapter or two to meet your various needs. SD card reader The MacBook Pro does not have an SD card reader, an omission that's sparked the ire of some power users. The Surface Pro has a microSD slot. Charging port To charge a MacBook Pro, you'll occupy one of the aforementioned Thunderbolt ports. The Surface Pro has a separate, dedicated port that holds the charge cable in place magnetically. Headphone jack The good news: Both of these have a dedicated headphone jack. The bad news: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus owners won't have a place to plug in their Lightning-port headphones. Battery Microsoft hasn't published the Surface Pro's battery size(s), but battery life estimates indicate you'll get a little more time with the full-size MacBook Pro. Camera Neither of these devices are touted for their photography power, but the built-in cameras work for applications like video conferencing. MacBook Pros have one 720p webcam, but like most tablets, the Surface Pro has both a front and rear camera. Facial recognition login That front camera on the Surface recognizes your face for another layer of security. Software Both machines run full desktop software. MacBook Pros ship with MacOS Sierra and Surface Book has Windows 10 Pro. Release The non-Touch Bar versions of the MacBook are shipping now, while the Touch Bar models are available for pre-order and ship within 1-2 weeks. The Surface Pro 4 has been around for a year. Starting price The entry level MacBooks start at US$1,499; the Touch Bar models will set you back at least $1,799. Full retail price for the Surface Pro 4 starts at $899 for the tablet only, though it's fairly easy to find this year-old device at a discount. The Pro 4 Type Cover starts at $130. MacBook Pros are more expensive, but then again, they're a generation newer and are made of metal all around, including on the base. But depending on how you want to use it, it may make sense to cut costs – and size – and opt for the more adaptable Windows tablet. Operating system preferences will doubtlessly play into this decision, so it's wise to consider the differences between MacOS Sierra and Windows 10 as well. We will post a full-length review on a Touch Bar MacBook Pro in the near future, so stay tuned. So far, even the base model 2016 MacBook Pro looks and feels promising, and the Surface Pro 4 is an excellent choice for those who favor 2-in-1s – despite growing a little long in the tooth.

News & Analysis Lattice Semiconductor to be Acquired for $1.3 Billion Max Maxfield 11/3/2016 12:20 PM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Lattice Semiconductor, one of the last independent FPGA companies, has just announced that it has agreed to be acquired by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners — a newly formed, global private equity buyout fund that is headquartered in Palo Alto, California — for approximately $1.3 billion inclusive of Lattices net debt, or $8.30 per share in cash. This represents a 30% premium to Lattices final trade price on November 2, 2016, the last trading day prior to the announcement. This latest acquisition leaves Xilinx as "the last man standing" with regard to the larger FPGA players. Actel was acquired by Microsemi in 2010 and Altera was acquired by Intel in 2015. In both of those cases, there was a technology play behind the story. Microsemi is big in security, and Actel's Flash-Based SmartFusion SoC FPGAs can play a big role in the secure boot process, for example. Meanwhile, Intel is huge in CPUs, and the combination of these CPUs with Altera's FPGAs — as separate devices, mounted in the same package, or, ultimately, fabricated on the same die — will be very important with regard to applications like high-performance computing (HPC). In early 2015, Lattice acquired Silicon Image, touting the advantages of having both an FPGA and ASSP play (see Lattice Deal: Harbinger of FPGA & ASSP Union). One of the first offspring from this marriage was the CrossLink family of video bridge pASSPs (programmable ASSPs). There is no technology play in the case of Canyon Bridge acquisition of Lattice — this is purely a financial play. The newly-formed Canyon Bridge wants to be a player in the technology market, and it sees Lattice Semiconductor as the anchor for their long-term investment portfolio, said Doug Hunter, senior director of marketing at Lattice Semiconductor in an interview with EE Times. Canyon Bridge is going to leave the Lattice team in place while providing investment to accelerate what Lattice is already doing, Hunter told us. This actually makes a lot of sense, because for Lattice has been carving out a nice niche (a large and growing niche) for itself over last few years with regard to small-to-medium capacity, low-power FPGAs deployed in a wide range of mobile, home, and augmented/virtual reality market applications (in addition to FPGAs, Lattice also boasts its pASSP products and a suite of power and thermal management solutions). Hunter says that Lattice has been talking to shareholders and investors about its long-term vision, and that Canyon Bridge believes in this vision and wants to play a part in it. But does Canyon Bridge know how to handle a high-tech company? Well, even though its described as "a newly formed, global private equity buyout fund," the Canyon Bridge leadership team has deep roots in Silicon Valley. Collectively, the principals in Canyon Bridge have more than 50 years of experience in the global technology, private equity, and M&A markets from the perspectives of founders, senior management, board members, and equity investors. In this day and age, where everyone is buying everyone else, Lattice was starting to look a little left out. Lattice's strategy of focusing on niche markets was good as far as it went, but niche markets simply arent going to cut it in the current business environment. Having serious investment from Canyon Bridge — coupled with the explosion in the IoT and cognitive (thinking, reasoning) systems boasting artificial neural networks and machine learning, vision, and speech — may allow Lattice to evolve and grow its "niche" and become a major player.

The certified integration will link the patented industry leader for least privilege management on Windows with the most advanced, extensible and scalable centralized security management software in the industry. Through its commitment to preventing privilege misuse and stopping unauthorized access, BeyondTrust plans to become fully integrated with McAfee ePO to provide a unified approach to least privilege and endpoint security. According to the 2016 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 86% of users have too much access to corporate assets. When a data breach happens as a result of the misuse or abuse of excessive user privileges, the natural reaction for IT is to enhance endpoint protection and remove admin rights. This reaction is designed to stop future attacks on important assets, but often requires multiple tools that don't talk to one another in order to implement. Integrating PowerBroker for Windows with McAfee ePO will help overcome the complexity involved with making these changes and will allow cohesion within a single user interface to manage endpoint and privileged risks. Integration will address several critical use cases for organizations embracing least privilege: Deliver a lightweight client that integrates with the existing environment to perform least privilege functions Provide a single platform for event, policy and reporting of privileged events Enable the capability to remove administrative rights without impacting the end user's workflow on desktops and servers Protect against keystroke loggers and password stealing techniques like Pass-the-Hash using a least privileged client to perform application elevation Audit and report on all privileged and requested privileged activity in accordance with security best practices and regulatory compliance initiatives "Our customers require cohesive, integrated solutions that cover a broad range of security needs, so we are pleased to see that PowerBroker for Windows will be integrated with McAfee ePO," said DJ Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. "We look forward to presenting our customers with this central console for administrative visibility over their security and least privilege environments that helps them better understand and take action against privilege-based risks." "BeyondTrust is proud to be working towards integration with McAfee ePO, joining the simple, flexible and scalable console of security offering it provides," said Brad Hibbert, Chief Technology Officer, BeyondTrust. "Our commitment to stopping privilege misuse and unauthorized access fits perfectly into the mission of McAfee ePO, and we look forward to providing our leading protection more broadly than we have to this point."

Montréal, Québec (PRWEB) November 03, 2016 Cicada Security Technology today announces a successfully completed integration of Cicada Physical Data Protection (PDP) with McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL), aimed at protecting endpoints compromised due to attempted theft or tampering. Cicada PDP protects active and authenticated laptops, desktops, servers and other endpoint devices by monitoring multiple trigger points and identifying specific actions which are common to physical threats. Once triggered, Cicada PDP responsively invokes protective actions to prevent unintentional data exposure at the precise moment theft or tamper is detected. Cicada’s patented PDP technology is the first commercially available solution that allows data privacy focused organizations to extend the capabilities of their protective environments to include risks posed to their mobile work force. The extended capabilities include targeted attacks and human error for both active and authenticated devices. Cicada Security Technology actively participated in the Intel Security Innovation Alliance to achieve interoperability and has concurrently attained McAfee compatibility with the McAfee DXL framework. McAfee DXL affords Cicada PDP immediate compatibility with other McAfee DXL-compliant vendors by natively delivering physical threat awareness to these respective product platforms with minimal development effort during integration. McAfee DXL provides Cicada PDP a valuable platform which enables the intercommunication of threat event alerts between other security technologies, including physical risk aware encryption, authentication or other protective technologies. “Cicada PDP’s integration with McAfee technologies is an important step in the efforts to extend the scope of data protection technologies. This integration enables those responsible for the delivery of absolute data privacy to not only prevent data exposure on active and authenticated endpoints, but to effectively manage these events in an enterprise environment,” said Ryk Edelstein, CEO of Cicada Security Technology. “We are pleased to add Cicada Security solution to the select list of Technology Partners in the Intel Security Innovation Alliance program,” said D.J. Long, head of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. “We expect our joint solutions to stimulate powerful new workflows for security and compliance, a key goal of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance program.” Cicada’s innovative approach to protecting mobile data has gained considerable interest from government, public and private sector clients facing significant challenges in securing an elastic security perimeter. “The Cicada technology addresses real capability gaps, not only in federal civil agencies but also across the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community.” said Dr. Thomas A. Cellucci, Chief Commercialization Office U.S. Department of Homeland Security (Ret.). Cicada PDP Technology Availability Founded in 2010, Cicada Security Technology is the worldwide leader in physical threat aware data protection technologies. Cicada PDP Technology is the first of Cicada Security Technology’s data protection products. Cicada PDP Technology products are available for immediate purchase at http://www.cicadasecurity.com.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 3, 2016 -- 02:27 GMT (19:27 PDT) | Topic: PCs Dell Business Black Friday and Cyber Monday ads have both leaked. Hot off the heels of the Dell Home Black Friday ad being leaked, its small business arm has seen its ads leaked not only for Black Friday, but Cyber Monday to boot. There's nothing as eye-popping as the $100 laptop and desktop specials the consumer ad revealed, but there are still plenty of PC deals for those looking for solid performance systems. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Microsoft preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals The lowest-priced notebook in the four-page Black Friday ad is an Inspiron 15 3000 with Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and a 15.6-inch display that's just $199 starting at 8 a.m. on Black Friday morning. For a little more ($329), you can grab a beefier configuration with an Intel Core i3 CPU, or move up to the Inspiron 15 5000 model with Core i5 chip and double memory and hard drive space for $499. If you'd prefer the more business-oriented Latitude instead, there's a 14-inch model available starting Monday the 21st from 11 a.m. for $429 that features a Core i3 processor with 4 gigs of RAM and 500GB hard drive, or a 15-inch version stocked with Core i5 CPU, 8GB of memory, and a terabyte hard drive for $499. Desktop deals include an Inspiron tower (Core i5, 12GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive) doorbuster at 2 p.m. on Black Friday for $429, a $379 small-form-factor Inspiron with Core i3 CPU, 8 gigs of RAM, and 500GB hard drive, and a small-form-factor OptiPlex 3040 with Core i5 chip and the same amount of RAM and hard drive as its small Inspiron sibling for $579. If you need more performance, the XPS 8900 includes a Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and a GeForce GT 730 graphics card for $699, though that's just the $30 off the current price. If you need an XPS 8900 with more memory, there's one with 16GB of RAM that is a $729 Cyber Monday doorbuster at 3 p.m. Other Cyber Monday desktop sales include an Inspiron Small Desktop for the same price as on Black Friday, though this one has half the RAM and twice the hard drive capacity.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 Latest News and Features: Latest Updates from MacBook Pro 2015, No Touch Screen, Price By Neal A. Lasta Nov 2, 2016 | 9:46 PM Apple finally unveiled a new line of MacBook Pro devices after a long wait and much speculation during these past few months. The press conference, called "Hello Again," that launched the redesigned MacBook Pro 2016 was held last Thursday in Cupertino, California. The only major features which are new to the MacBook Pro 2016 are the Touch ID, new processor, and the OLED panel in the upper portion keyboard. With this in mind, consumers wonder if they should even bother upgrading to the latest MacBook Pro or stick with their older version. New Features One of the most prominent features of the MacBook Pro 2016 is the Touch Bar. This is an OLED panel that is located at the top of the keyboard and supports multi-touch and changes interface depending on what app is currently in use. The MacBook Pro 2016 also has a Touch ID feature and is powered by a 6th gen Skylake processor. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The MacBook Pro 2016 comes in two models, the base model which has a 13-inch screen, and a 15-inch screen model. The 13-inch screen version doesn't have an OLED Touch Bar, nor does it have the Touch ID feature. It runs with a 2.0-GHz dual-core Intel iCore i5 processor. It also has a 256 GB SSD and an Intel Iris Graphics 540 GPU. It starts off with an 8 GB RAM which you can upgrade to 16 GB. The most lavish version of the 15-inch model has a Touch Bar, 512 GB SSD, Intel HD Graphics 530, 2.7 GHz quad core Intel Core i7 processor and Radeon Pro 455 GPU. Both 13-inch and 15-inch versions have Force touch trackpads and butterfly keyboards. Aside from these new features, MacBook Pro 2016 and the MacBook Pro available last year has lots of similarities. For one, both models have the same Retina display, although the 2016 version is brighter by 67%. No Touch Screen Some fans and analysts are disappointed that the MacBook Pro 2016 doesn't have touch screen capabilities like the all-new Microsoft Surface Studio. According to Jon Fingas of Engadget, "Apple has made a point of publicly resisting the pressure to introduce touchscreen Macs. Computers need a fundamentally different interface than your smartphone or tablet, Apple argues, and it's cumbersome to keep raising your hand to the display." Still, Fingas adds that the addition of the OLED panel may be an acknowledgement from Apple that having touch input "can improve your computing experience." Price MacBook Pro 2015 model has a starting price of $1,299 while the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 model is worth $1,499. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 is $1,999 and a newer version is worth $2,999.

Backyard·后花园 Home Categories Archives Tags Search Vanilla Installation of Asterisk 13 on Raspberry Pi 3 with G729 Codec Posted on 2016-11-01   |   In Asterisk , Raspberry Pi   |   I have an Asterisk server at home I built few years ago. It has an old Intel atom processor running on CentOS 6. It works quite well. I have couple SIP trunks to severial ITSP, including Google Voice. The Asterisk is version 11 LTS and it is a vinilla installation. The current Asterisk LTS version is 13 and it come with support of PJSIP. I never had a chance to learn PJSIP configuration. And I just happen to have a Raspberry Pi 3 on hand. So I think I should give a try. Raspbian Jessie First, I load Raspbian on a 8GB micro SD card and boot it up. I try to keep this system clean and tight so I used “Raspbian Jessie Lite” (Release date: 2016-09-23) without Desktop. After the RPi up and running, set the timezone. timedatectl set-timezone America/Vancouver And bring it up to date: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo reboot After reboot, start installation as root Install MySQL database I need to use MySQL database to save CDR. sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y sudo mysql_secure_installation The database creation and configration is just starand as on other platform. So I just skip them here. Install Asterisk Some dependencies need to be installed: apt-get install build-essential apt-get install openssl libxml2-dev libncurses5-dev uuid-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev pkg-config libjansson-dev subversion libiksemel-dev libspeex-dev libssl-dev libmyodbc unixodbc-dev libsrtp0-dev Installation of Astersik is quite simple: cd /usr/src wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-13-current.tar.gz tar zvxf asterisk-13-current.tar.gz cd asterisk-13.12.1/ ./contrib/scripts/get_mp3_source.sh ./configure --with-pjproject-bundled make menuselect make -j 4 make install make config make samples G729 Codec In order to compile the g729 codec for a Raspberry Pi(ARM processor), the fastest way is to build it with the bcg729. The bcg729 is a software encoder for g729a and decoder library written from scratch. The resulting codec will be x2 slower than if it has been compiled with IPP, but it’s good enough for my home use. Install autoreconf: sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf bcg729 cd /usr/src wget http://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/releases/linphone/plugins/sources/bcg729-1.0.0.tar.gz tar xzf bcg729-1.0.0.tar.gz cd bcg729-1.0.0 ./configure --libdir=/lib make sudo make install Compiling g729 codecs cd /usr/src wget http://asterisk.hosting.lv/src/asterisk-g72x-1.2.tar.bz2 tar xjf asterisk-g72x-1.4.tar.bz2 cd asterisk-g72x-1.4 ./autogen.sh ./configure CFLAGS='-march=armv6' --with-asterisk130 --with-bcg729  --with-asterisk-includes=../asterisk-13.12.1/include make sudo make install Test Restart asterisk and log in CLI: core show translation It looks good, g729 is on the list!

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ‘We have created value, democratised technology’ Sangeetha Chengappa   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet BL MICHAEL DELL Chairman and CEO, Dell Technologies Margins reflect appreciation by customers; investment in R&D is vital: Michael Dell At the recently concluded first Dell EMC World 2016 conference in Texas, Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, Michael Dell heralded the dawn of a new digital era – where physical and digital realities are transforming into physical and digital businesses – to an audience of over 8,000 people. Stating that Dell Technologies is the largest enterprise systems company, he said the goal is to be the most trusted, innovative provider of essential infrastructure for organisations to build their digital future, transform IT and protect their most important asset – information. In an interaction with BusinessLine on the sidelines of the conference, Michael Dell talked about what it means to be a tech powerhouse, new opportunities for growth and innovating for the future. Excerpts: Traditionally, customers do not like being locked to a single vendor. Dell customers that BusinessLine spoke to fear that the combined powerhouse of Dell and EMC would lead to a monopoly. What’s your take? If you think about the PC space, for example, where we have gained share for the last 15 quarters in a row, we are doing very well. But if you double-click a little more on the architecture, when a customer chooses Dell for commercial PCs – this concern doesn’t really come up with consumers – they are choosing Dell for the product, for the service, and support. At the same time, they are also choosing Intel, AMD and Microsoft typically; which actually have much higher shares than Dell. So, there are suppliers of ours that have an even higher share than us. If one were concerned about the issue you mentioned; you would be concerned about our suppliers like Intel and Microsoft maybe more than you would be concerned about us. That’s precisely the point. You may not yet be there, but you are you not getting there? I think one of the reasons we’ve succeeded is because we’ve created a tremendous amount of value for customers and democratised technology – made it more available, more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the businesses that we are in. I think if we continue to deliver great value to customers, continue to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, and have great relationships with them, customers will reward us with more business. If we don’t, they will not do so and choose somebody else. And there are plenty of other choices really in every business we are in. What are the challenges of integrating the two distinct corporate cultures of Dell and that of EMC? It’s already done. We had a decade-and-a-half lead up to the combination of Dell and EMC. This goes back to 2001, when Dell and EMC announced an alliance in which Dell would sell EMC storage technology to its customers and form a Dell-EMC storage business. The Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every EMC storage product line that existed, and EMC became our largest OEM customer in the world. And so our teams, starting in 2001, learned how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culture; we became friends. I was present within EMC from the day of the announcement – at leadership meetings, learning about them as we came together. It is one family and the cultures are more similar than different. Customers have paid different margins for Dell and EMC products. With the new organisation structure in place, how do you plan to rationalise the margins customers will have to pay henceforth? In terms of margins, the averages tell the story. When you de-average, you get a very different story because Dell has some products with high margins, and some with low margins. There definitely are ways across the portfolio to manage that. We also tend to focus more on the margin dollars than the per cent, as a private company. Let me explain what I mean by margin dollars – if your goal is to have a business with the highest margin per cent, then sell mousepads. Why do we spend $4.5 billion every year in R&D? We think we will get back more than the $4.5 billion in margins, because of the innovation we are applying. And margins are a way of the market telling you that your innovation is valuable and appreciated. What more needs to be done to create opportunities for growth, and a stronger value proposition to customers? We have a lot of cross-selling to do with the combined entity. We have an organic innovation engine that is very significant, with the R&D teams across Pivotal, VMware, Dell EMC and the whole family. We also have alliances with hundreds of important companies from SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, to many others. We have our own Dell Technologies Capital Group investing in hundreds of new companies that are 24, 36, 48 months out into the future in terms of new things that are evolving.

The system is equipped with NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1070 graphics, a quad-core CPU from Intel, rich I/O capabilities and a hot-swappable battery. Despite its positioning, the VR GO can be used like a normal desktop computer, which differentiates it from early prototypes of wearable VR PCs from other makers. ZOTAC is mostly known for its graphics cards and high-performance small form-factor PCs, but not wearable systems (which are not that uncommon: industrial- and even space-grade wearable PCs have existed for years). To develop its VR GO computer, the company had to use experience it obtained from building SFF systems for gamers as well as to find ways to minimize weight and to ensure that the design can handle harsh treatment during gaming sessions. Basically, ZOTAC had to fix everything tightly inside the box while ensuring appropriate cooling and proper position of the I/O ports. To make it convenient to connect a VR headset to the VR GO, one side of the device has the appropriate ports. The single side has one HDMI output, two USB 3.0 ports and one power connector on top of it. Such positioning greatly simplifies cable management and makes VR gaming with a PC on your back a little more comfortable. The system also comes with a removable battery pack that enables autonomous operation for (waiting on offical numbers) hours. While virtual reality is considered as an important milestone for gaming, it hardly makes sense to develop a PC only for VR, which is why ZOTAC’s VR GO is a powerful PC in general and can be used like a desktop computer too. It has three additional USB 3.0/3.1 Type-A connectors, an SD card reader, four additional display outputs (two HDMI, two DP), two GbE ports as well as two 3.5 mm audio jacks. Inside the ZOTAC VR GO there is a custom motherboard in a proprietary form-factor carrying an Intel Core i7 CPU, two DDR4 SO-DIMMs, an M.2 SSD (PCIe 3.0 x4), an 802.11ac Wi-Fi module and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1070 MXM module. To cool down the CPU and the GPU (a total TDP of 150 W), ZOTAC uses a proprietary low-profile air cooling system but has not disclosed details. At this point, we do not know whether the manufacturer reinforced the design of its cooler's backplate somehow, but this is a logical thing to expect. To expand the storage capacity of the system, ZOTAC also added one bay for a SATA-based 2.5" storage device (either HDD, which might be affected by rapid movement, or a high capacity TLC SSD). ZOTAC’s VR GO system is not the first backpack-type PC developed by the company. At Computex 2016 the hardware manufacturer already demonstrated a wearable system, but that was largely a prototype and still in the early design stage. By contrast, the VR GO looks like a commercial product. ZOTAC does not specify exact availability timeframe for its VR GO backpack PC other than Q4 2016 as well as its estimated price. We expect to see it at CES in early January for sure.

(MGT) MGT stock may look alluring, but its rally can't go on forever By John Divine, InvestorPlace Assistant Editor  |  May 17, 2016, 12:58 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2016 The $68B Uber IPO Is DEFINITELY Not Worth the Wait Why You Should SELL 3x Gold Mining ETFs JNUG and NUGT Today Recent Posts: Best Stocks of 2016: Snap-On Incorporated (SNA) Stock Is a Steal MBLY Stock: Why It’s a Great Time to Buy Mobileye NV SWHC Stock: It’s Time to Dive in With This Gun Stock View All Posts Editor’s Note: This story has been changed to reflect the fact that McAfee was not involved with his eponymous company when it sold to Intel (despite the insinuation that he was in MGT’s May 9 press release), and that John McAfee is not technically CEO of MGT Capital yet. Also, he does not own D-Vasive. You rarely, if ever, see a chart like this. MGT Capital Investments Inc. (MGT) stock is up over 40% in intraday trading on Tuesday, more than 1,000% in the last five days, 1,556% in the last month and 1,700% so far in 2016. Languishing in the company of other penny stocks as recently as a week ago, MGT stock traded as low as 15 cents per share at its 52-week low. On Tuesday, shares flirted with $5/share at their peak. So what changed? Two words: John McAfee. In a surprise move last week, the software security pioneer was suddenly proposed as the new CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a company involved in mobile gaming, social casino and fantasy sports areas. 7 A-Rated Small Caps to Pocket and Run With But frankly, the whole thing is a little shady when you start to take a look at the deal. At the end of the day, buying MGT stock is an extremely high-risk, high-reward play, but with so little insight into what the endgame is here, I’d venture to say that there are better stocks to take fliers on. MGT Stock: McAfee’s Public Plaything When McAfee was installed as CEO of MGT on May 9, that wasn’t the only news; MGT also agreed to purchase certain assets from D-Vasive Inc., an anti-spy software firm, for $300,000 cash and 23.8 million restricted shares of MGT stock, or 47% of the company. But the McAfee madness doesn’t end there. MGT is also renaming itself to John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc. I guess he figures, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The MGT press release announcing these moves claimed that McAfee sold his old company, the antivirus software company McAfee, to Intel Corporation (INTC) for $7.6 billion in 2011. In reality, he had nothing to do with the company at that point and was not involved in its sale to Intel. In conjunction with these two major announcements, MGT also struck a consulting agreement with Future Tense Secure Systems Inc., a tech incubator founded by none other than John McAfee himself. If you’re starting to wonder just how great these deals will be for MGT stock owners going forward, we’re on the same page. At the end of 2015, MGT had just $359,000 in cash. $300,000 of that is now gone, in the coffers of McAfee’s D-Vasive. The company posted revenue of just $104,000 last year, which is a pretty meager sum considering the current price of MGT stock values the company at upward of $70 million. When you add to that the fact that the company isn’t even growing fast — that $104,000 was up just 10% from the $94,000 it sold in 2014 — this becomes a real head-scratcher. Electronic Arts Inc. – ‘Star Wars’ Shoots EA Stock Into Hyperdrive Obviously, the X-factor here is what sort of value John McAfee, and the newly acquired assets of D-Vasive, bring to the table. Since D-Vasive is a private company, we don’t have much insight into that. It’s pretty overtly clear, though, that the recent hot streak we’ve seen with MGT stock is due to rampant speculation that McAfee can come in, work some magic with his knowledge and connections, and make this company a player or maybe even sell it. But with pretty much zero insight into how that’s gonna go down, and after a run of epic proportions that is based on nothing of fundamental significance, I’m far more prepared to bet on MGT being a zero than a hero. As of this writing, John Divine did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. You can follow him on Twitter at @divinebizkid or email him at editor@investorplace.com.

The tax collecting HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) launched a specialist unit in 2009 which studies the tax accounting of the U.K.’s 6,500 richest individuals. This is a group which makes up only 0.02 per cent of the population and counts over £20 million (US$24.5 million) worth of assets apiece. The dedicated unit uncovered an additional £416 million of tax for collection in 2015 to 2016 on top of what was paid voluntarily by these individuals. This is a more than doubling of the £200 million (US$ 245.4 million) secured by similar investigations four years earlier. It was also a sum that came in far ahead of the HMRC’s internal target of £250 million (US$306.7 million) for the period. Tina Riches, national tax partner at financial affairs adviser Smith & Williamson, told CNBC via telephone that the theme of tax entities keeping a closer watch was not just restricted to the U.K. According to Riches: ”Across the board all tax authorities are trying to step up a gear in terms of pursuing any taxpayer where they feel they can squeeze some extra tax out of them.” Change of direction Turning to the U.K. specifically, she noted while the first strategic objective for HMRC had been simply to “maximise revenues”, this mandate was expanded in February 2016 to “maximise revenues due and bear down on avoidance and evasion.” This prioritisation to tackle what in some cases may be considered routine tax planning is said to have marked a notable change of direction for the agency. The report was keen to emphasise that the discrepancies primarily relate to tax avoidance schemes and the legal interpretation of complicated tax issues rather than outright – and illegal – tax evasion. The complexity of some cases and the high amount of capital at stake mean that investigations can drag on at length, with 4,000 now having been open for over three years. The report also stated that an average of four issues are being looked into for each taxpayer involved in the probe. Further complexities concern even the initial identification of high net worth individuals as reporting is not required for most of the information about their wealth, including sources of income or assets owned. The risk to HMRC of targets slipping under the radar is evident from the unit’s uncovering of an additional 1,000 people with net worth above the £20 million (US$24.5 million) cut-off point. A word of warning Drilling down into the numbers, Riches cautioned about the haul reported by the NAO, saying some of the money collected was due to newly introduced powers to demand accelerated payments, where taxpayers are required to pay a requested amount in advance of the final agreed tax charge being decided and while the case remains open. The report notes that by March 2016, HMRC had issued 1,400 accelerated payment notices to high net worth individuals with the average value of such a notice to a high net worth individual being around £450,000 (US$55, 2100.50), compared with £75,000 (US$92,016.80) for the broader population.

Alienware's name carries the weight of reputable gaming computers none of which are underserved with mediocre specs. The company's highly recognized for top-tier high-powered laptops, and Alienware 13 remains a service to that brand but with the prized presence of virtual reality tagging along. This year saw tremendous inroads for virtual reality, as several companies fumbled together its own virtual reality headsets such as Google's Daydream, Sony's PlayStation VR, HTC and Valve's HTC Vive and others, with the sustained imminence of mobile VR platforms slowly gaining traction. It's still a fairly nascent platform, but many companies have been exceedingly toying with it, even Atari's Nolan Bushnell wants in on the game. The Alienware 13 comes as Alienware's entry point in accessible virtual reality experiences because the setup involved in creating a VR experience requires very powerful and bulky equipment, a prerequisite many VR companies try to quash in order to make the appeal of the platform immediate. The base model of the VR-ready Alienware 13 has a powerful Intel Core i5-6300HQ chip alongside an Nvidia GTX 10 series graphics chip, specifically, the GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB GDDR5 and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM. This configuration will net you $1,199, but if you prefer beefier specs, there are Core i7 models with 16 GB of RAM at much higher price points. In terms of storage, Alienware 13 comes with up to 2 TB of internal storage split into two: 1 TB of PCI express of solid state drive as a boot drive, and the other terabyte serves as storage. The screen may also come in different options, with the lowest being a 13.3-inch 1,366 x 768 display. If low-resolution displays are a pet peeve, there's an option for a 1080p IPS display and a Quad HD display with touch control. Of course, a better screen spells a more expensive price. In terms of portability, the Alienware 13 weighs below six pounds and is less than an inch thick at its thickest point.

By chuq | Published Nov 01 2016 Today has been a fascinating day, many many conversations about Apple and a lot of great feedback. It’s had me thinking about this more and trying to understand some of the aspects of this that I hadn’t really gotten clear in my head. In terms of the event itself, I find I’m using this variations of this phrase in many conversations: Apple did a great job of introducing two new trees while ignoring the forest dying of drought around us. The more I think about it, the more I think that sums up my discomfort with the announcements this week. This afternoon I had a nice long talk with an old friend who has a lot of experience doing marketing within the Apple ecosystem. And at one point, I said “You know what we need? We need this — and he agreed with me completely.” Remember This? It’s — The Grid. In 1997, Steve introduced his new philosophy for what products should have using this grid. 20 years later, we’re now trying to make sense of the Mac product line and we seem confused, so I decided to sit down and try to sort it out a bit. So here we are, the New Grid: I have consciously left off some of the legacy laptops (anything without USB-C because they’re there for special purposes or are transitioning towards end of life). I think it points out a few reasons why we’re confused at exactly what Apple is doing right now. First off, their support for pro level users is pretty limited: the new laptops don’t seem to be capable of serious 4K/5K video processing due to memory constraints, and that’s a problem. We have products that desperately need a refresh, and we don’t know when or if that’ll happen. And I think there’s a more basic problem: Can anyone really explain to me what Apple means by a “Pro” user? Because these Macbook Pros don’t seem t be the answer for two of their key core pro demographics: high end video and high end developers. So what is a pro? Or has Apple embraced the prosumer and decided that’s — good enough? I don’t know, and they didn’t clarify this at all. Also, what’s a creative? Microsoft knows, Microsoft thinks it can attack Apple’s market here, and from my discussions in the last day or so, there are a good number of traditional Apple users taking a look and going Hmm…. Apple is clearly vulnerable here, and I’m not convinced these laptops made them comfortable about staying loyal. So, what to do? First, while I know we’re all very tired of waiting, we need to relax a bit. The rumor mill seems to make it clear that a refreshed iMac is coming as soon as Apple can get enough parts from Intel (in 2017, after the holidays). Ditto something for the Mac Pro area, again when parts are avaialble from Intel — and this might take 4-5 months. The other boxes? I’m not sure there’s a “pro” answer for laptops, given what we’ve found out about batter size limitations on airplanes. A laptop you can’t carry on a plane is dead at launch. I had some discussions today about returning to replaceable batteries, but I just can’t see Apple doing that and it has it’s own set of complications and pain points. There seem to be some possible improvements in Cady Lake or other future Intel chips, but we’re now into late 2017 at best, if then. So I expect the pro/laptop box stays empty. For desktops — now what? I made the suggestion today that what Apple really needs is a new desktop line that leverages the design across the different models, much as they do laptops. That makes it less expensive to create a Mac Mini type machine than if it is it’s own unique design. So, two or three models based around the same design, each with 2-3 build to order options, just like the laptops. I called this the reinvention of the Mac IIci, because I feel that’s a machine that really exemplifies the kind of device we need now. The basic unit is a lot like today’s Mini: good power, low price, limited expandability. Make the high end support 128Gb of RAM, a range of GPU options (hopefully with upgradability, evne if it requires a trip to the genius bar) and include at least one really kick butt GPU. The middle model straddles this with more memory and some good GPU options, but without replacement options. And all use the same overall design, and take advantage of the reality that USB C and thunderbolt 3 really get us to the point that you don’t need to stuff all your disks and other gear into the chassis for performance — that was something Thunderbolt 2 promised but didn’t quite deliver. This is a paradigm shift for developers to come to grips to, but I think it’s the right time for them to get their heads around. And if only Apple had had this slide up during the presentation, with those two boxes marked obsolete blurred out and with “coming early in 2017” instead, we probably all would have gone home happy. Okay, most of us. I know I would have. But I really do think it’s time for Apple to think about resetting the way they view the brand and our expectations about what to expect by bringing out a new, updated grid and explaining who fits in what boxes and which machines solve their problems. Because even after sorting this out to this degree in my head so I could write about it, I’m honestly still fairly confused. What is a pro user in Apple’s Mac ecosystem today? Because I don’t know how Apple would answer that question. Do you?

ROGERS Apple MacBook Pro showing Touch Bar. Photo courtesy of Apple - + Apple's event last week, a day after Microsoft's announcement of some well-received devices, revealed the expected updates to the MacBook Pro range. The new devices from Microsoft and Apple use the Intel Skylake processor, not Kaby Lake. While Microsoft favours a touchscreen, Apple has avoided this. Apple's iPhones have shown how touch technology can help productivity, but there is a feeling that using this on the computer monitor is not helpful. The Touch Bar puts input where needed. Long-time Mac users often make use of key commands for efficiency, so this extends that functionality. This second display is run from the T1 -- an ARM chip based on the ones used in the Apple Watch. More features could be made available, but for now the Touch Bar changes depending on which app is being used. One addition that the Touch Bar allows is Fingerprint ID like on iOS devices, which will make secure online payments easier. At the Apple event there were demonstrations on its use in Final Cut Pro and Adobe Photoshop, showing how quickly users can do things. Other developers (like 1Password) are already working on providing support. When running Windows in BootCamp, Function keys will be displayed. The 13-inch models with the Touch Bar are US$1,799 and US$1,999. Converting the former price gives 63,055 baht. Adding 7% for VAT is 67,469. On Apple's online store this model is 67,900 baht, so pricing is close. The price of the other new 13-inch MacBook Pro converted to baht and with 7% added is 74,969 baht, making this model a fraction cheaper at its listed 74,900 baht. The two 15-inch models are $2,399 and $2,799: 89,971 and 104,972 baht with VAT factored in, while the prices quoted here are 89,900 and 105,900 baht respectively. When I checked the weekend, these new Macs were shown as "currently unavailable" here. In the US, the new 13-inch versions have delivery times of four to five weeks, with the 15-inch at three to four weeks. Two weeks ago, the Apple Watch Series 2 went on sale here. I have been running a black version for the last few days. I had been quite happy with the first release of the Apple Watch, especially messaging and fitness monitoring, although I am not a gym visitor or runner and use this for basic inputs. Last Friday, the Apple Watch Nike+ was released worldwide. There are two versions: 38mm at 13,900 baht and 42mm at 14,900 baht, on sale here now. The Series 2 Apple Watch has added considerably to what can be done by those who do make use of the fitness features, helped by some of the 18,000 apps now available. Placement of apps can be done as before using the iPhone Watch app. Users may also add regularly used items (such as heart rate or message apps) to the Dock. There are more complications available so a watch face (and there are more of these too) can be set up to provide a user with personalised input and output methods. There were several improvements to the S2 chip that now powers the Watch. With dual cores, enhanced graphics capabilities and GPS, it works faster. The screen is easier to see and GPS location capabilities help provide significantly more detail for those who run (or in my case, walk). Improvements for fitness include colour-coding on the map for different running speeds or when stationary. As GPS only works outside, dotted lines indicate when tunnels or subways are used. This additional location information is assisted by built-in Wi-Fi. WatchOS allows for several types of exercise input, including running and walking, plus more highly-tuned workouts for wheelchair users and for swimming. These require new types of motion recording: input from arm movements is completely different. Activities can be shared, which adds group or family competitiveness. As swimming needs full immersion, waterproofing was developed for the Watch. A quick-access menu turns off input to the watch face -- avoiding unwanted input from splashes -- and locks the watch. When done, turning the digital crown unlocks the watch and expels any water from the speaker housing with a sonar-like beeping. It is water resistant up to a depth of 50m. When the watch I am now using arrived, it had the black fluoroelastomer band which is ideal for sports. I loved the stainless steel Milanese loop band I had with the first Apple Watch, so I also bought a black version of this. It felt thinner than the original, so I checked this with the help of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Mahidol University's Engineering Faculty. The black band was 1.44mm thick compared with 1.45mm of the older band. It may be that the weave of the band is finer. Next time: more on the Apple Watch. Graham K.

Login Search Close Update: S&P 500 and Nasdaq Poised for Eighth Day of Declines as Facebook, Election Jitters Weigh November 03, 2016, 04:28:33 PM EDT By MT Newswires, MT Newswires Shutterstock photo Wall Street extended losses on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite marking eight straight days of declines and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in its sixth consecutive retreat as Facebook's ( FB ) warning of slower revenue and jitters about next week's election weighed on investors' sentiment. Polls have shown a tightening race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 8 vote. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as the Vix, soared 16% late in the session to the highest since late June, when voters in the UK jolted markets by deciding to leave the European Union. On the S&P 500, most of the 11 sectors were weaker, led by a 1% drop each in information technology and health care. The Dow spent much of the day swinging between gains and losses before settling on a path lower. Blue-chip Pfizer ( PFE ) continued to slide following its earnings miss earlier in the week and Intel ( INTC ) retreated 2% amid the tech sector weakness. Fitbit ( FIT ) cratered 34% after cutting its 2016 outlook and took GoPro ( GPRO ) down 7% in step ahead of its own earnings release due after the close. Garmin (GRMN) was also lower by 1.5%. Energy stocks ended 0.3% higher, defying a slide in US crude futures, which were down 1.5% to $44.66 late in the day. Utilities were up 0.4% and financials added 0.1%. The day's data showed initial jobless claims rose by 7,000 to 265,000 in the final week of October, but the rate of layoffs in the U.S. remained extremely low. The October Institute for Supply Management services Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to 54.8 after a September surge to an 11-month high of 57.1 and missing economists' expectations. Investors will turn their attention Friday morning to the key non-farm payrolls data, which is expected by analysts to show an increase to 178,000 from September's initial outturn of 156,000. Here's where the markets stood by the close: US MARKETS Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 28.97 points (-0.16%) S&P 500 was down 9.28 points (-0.44%) Nasdaq Composite Index was down 47.16 points (-0.92%) GLOBAL SENTIMENT FTSE 100 was down 0.8% Nikkei 225 was closed Hang Seng Index was down 0.56% Shanghai China Composite Index was up 0.84% UPSIDE MOVERS (+) IQNT (+35%) Being bought by GTCR LLC for $23 per share cash (+) LHCG (+14.9%) Raises 2016 guidance after beating Street earnings, revenue estimates (+) KTOS (+10.5%) Fiscal Q3 earnings swing to profit, tops estimates DOWNSIDE MOVERS (-) DPLO (-42.2%) Q3 results miss Street estimates, lowers 2016 guidance (-) FSLR (-15%) Posts Q3 earnings beat, revenue miss, lowers 2016 revenue guidance (-) SFM (-11.3%) Q3 earnings fall 24% and expenditures rise (-) WYNN (-9.3%) Misses Q3 earnings estimates, Stifel cuts PT (-) CS (-8%) Posts steep drop in quarterly profit but tops estimates (-) OZM (-4.6%) Fitch downgrades credit rating The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

Weapons qualification is a part of the 369th Sustainment Brigade's mobilization requirements for their upcoming deployment to Kuwait this fall. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Cesar E. Leon) (Photo Credit: Sgt. Cesar Leon) VIEW ORIGINAL During the unit's post-mobilization training at Fort Hood Soldiers took part in a Mission Readiness Exercise that resembled a recent "Warfighter" exercise the brigade headquarters took part in at Fort Carson, Colorado, earlier in the year. The difference? Refinement of their skills to better prepare the unit for how things are done in Kuwait. The purpose of the Warfighter is to train Soldiers how to perform their duties in a combat environment. However, the MRX, conducted by First Army Division West and the United States Army Reserves 75th Training Division at Fort Hood, focuses on skill refinement and what units will encounter while deployed to Kuwait. "They have Soldiers here (Fort Hood) from the current unit that are there (Kuwait) now to give some real world things that are going on there now," said Warrant Officer Claudiann A. Atkinson, 1st Sustainment Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, about the MRX. Atkinson also emphasized the importance of the MRX because of how it gives the unit materials and experiences they need to be familiar with the areas they are going to so when they get there it's a more familiar place. The importance of the training at Fort Carson, Indiantown Gap, and Fort Hood was not lost on the Soldiers of the 369th, especially those new to the ranks. "As a newer Soldier to the unit, and the Army in general, our training was essential," said Spc. Kyle Beckley, an Intelligence Analyst for the 369th Sustainment Brigade. "The training provided life-like simulations in a tactical environment that helped me acclimate both to my duties as an Intel Analyst, and also as a member of the team," Beckley added. When the 369th Sustainment Brigade's MRX kicked off there were some bumps in the road. As with any team or organization each section needed to find their rhythm and get in sync to work towards the end goal of becoming a cohesive team. "I feel as unit you are better at the end of training then at the beginning," said Atkinson. "Initially there were some synchronization issues and some sections didn't really completely understand their roles and responsibilities," she added. "From then until now there has been a drastic change," added Atkinson. "Everyone needs to understand their roles and responsibilities and they need to communicate together if they want to complete the mission effectively." The intent of all the training the unit has conducted over the past year is to help prepare them for the mission ahead. Over the years things like political climate change making it difficult to train for every possible condition or scenario. But that doesn't make training less important. "You need to be prepared because every war is going to be different, you can't train the same way that you did for your first deployment that you are going to do for this deployment. It is not always going to be the same. That is why this training is so important," said Atkinson. At the end of the day readiness is the key to success and the Soldiers of the 369th feel they are ready to take on the challenge and are confident in their abilities to succeed. "Our team proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are ready, willing and able to stand in the wake of real world events and adjust, adapt, and overcome anything that presents itself," said Sgt. 1st Class Charles Tomsella, assistant NCOIC, Current Operations Assistant. Soldiers also completed training they didn't complete during the unit's pre-mobilization training conducted at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, August 8-27. Soldiers qualified on their assigned weapon and also completed counter-IED training.

Intel is taking another step into the worlds of virtual reality and sports technology with plans to buy a small company called Voke that sells immersive sports video equipment. The move comes months after Intel bought Replay Technologies to expand its presence in such areas as 3D video, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and less than two week after the chip maker announced the creation of the Intel Sports division, which will pursue opportunities in what Intel officials call the "digitization of sports." No financial details were released regarding the purchase of 12-year-old Voke. The deal is also part of Intel's larger strategy to extend its reach in the area of immersive computing, which includes technologies such as VR and AR. The chip maker already has used 360-degree camera technology from Replay for such events as the NBA All-Star Game and the X-Games in Aspen, Colo. Now the company will be able to expand what it can do in the immersive sports market. "Virtual reality (VR), or what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has stated as 'merged' reality, is an important building block for delivering a truly immersive sports experience, one that uses computing power to deliver virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before," James Carwana, general manager of the Intel Sports Group, wrote in a post on the company blog. "Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defender's perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterback's perspective. This kind of experience may sound futuristic, but it's closer than you think." Intel is looking to expand into a broad array of emerging growth markets, including VR, drones, autonomous vehicles, the internet of things (IoT), the cloud, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Under Krzanich, the company is moving  beyond its legacy as a PC and server chip supplier, and now sees a role, not only in many of the systems in these emerging markets, but also as the foundational technology supplier for the supporting infrastructure. With VR, the chip maker's efforts include its work on such products as the RealSense 3D camera technology, acquisitions of such companies as Replay, Voke and, in September, Movidius, and investments in others, including Dysonics and InContext Solutions. Voke's TrueVR portfolio includes stereoscopic cameras that can capture 180- to 360-degree views of events, from the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament to the New York Fashion Week shows. Users can view the events through a range of devices, from VR headsets to PCs, tablets and smartphones. In addition, the technology enables events to be live-streamed in VR. Intel could pair the Voke TrueVR products with the freeD technology the chip maker picked up in the deal for Replay. The Replay cameras are placed all around an event—such as a baseball or basketball game—and software in servers then stitches the images together to give users a seamless 360-degree view of the event. The team from Replay that developed the freed technology is now part of Intel's Sports Group, according to Carwana.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Read More More Other Filters Crafting a Touchable World with Juicy Feedback in VR for Luna November 3, 2016 4:10 PM | Lena LeRay Luna, due out next spring, is a fable about recovering from mistakes. A baby bird gets tricked into eating the last of the waning moon by an owl and is immediately swept away by a storm. When the bird, named Luna, awakes, it's forgotten everything and must populate the terrarium around it with life to regain its memories and find its way home. The game is currently in development for PC and PC-enabled VR, and Funomena's Robin Hunicke shares her thoughts with us about creating a touchable world with juicy feedback that can serve as an ambassador about the magic of VR. "I've been drawing the Luna bird in my notebook for years," says Hunicke. "Initially, when I designed it, it was a side-scrolling musical platformer. Now it's a musical, 3D sculpture-toy creativity game. It was transformed by the technology." Originally, Funomena was developing Luna for Intel's gesture-enabled RealSense cameras, but the introduction of special controllers for VR struck the team as an opportunity to create a touchable world. "The overarching feeling on the team was that being able to look down into the terrarium and rotate it and feel the space the same way that you do when you're building it in, like, Maya, was just such a beautiful way to share the experience with people," says Hunicke. "Always looking at different spots to be able to see the whole thing. Just like a little toy world. We just thought that would be fantastic, so in the end it really won us over." In the interest of creating their touchable world, the Luna team prototypes environments with physical objects. Most of the game takes place in a bowl-shaped terrarium, so they bought a big serving bowl and built a little landscape of sculpted hydrophobic sand, Playmobil toys, and an assortment of odds and ends made from materials like pipe cleaners. "We use them to sort of play the space, and actually we've found that that's been a very instrumental part of the development cycle," Hunicke explains. They build an environment physically first before making a rough version in the engine, testing it, and iterating again on the physical prototype. "It's very fluid compared to working on a more standard process." Sometimes, the developers also use the physical props in discussions of how the individual pieces of the game should act. A pipe cleaner representation of a flower is useful for testing the arrangement of objects in the terrarium space, but flicking it and watching it jiggle can also give the team an idea of how that flower might react to player interaction while they play. "The whole idea with games like Journey or Flow or Flower, for example, that we always talked about at GDC was this idea of juicy feedback," says Hunicke. "Martin [Middleton] and I really believe that that's core to the experience of a really well designed game that has less to do with, like, rules and achievement and more to do with experience and the sense of accomplishment through exploration. So with VR, it's like ten times [as important]. "The best example that we have in the game right now is rocks," she continues. "We made a pile of rocks; you could throw the rocks around and they would sail through the sun and there'd be no sound effect. Or they'd land in the water and there were no ripples or splashes. Right now, you can balance them on a lily pad and the lily pad doesn't sink. You have to start to physically simulate all the interactions between the rocks and every other object in the environment." Hunicke compares the problem of having throwable rocks in VR to that of adding something like rope or a deck of cards to an adventure game. In reality, these objects are very versatile, capable of enabling many solutions to problems. A game designer, however, only has the resources to implement a limited number of possible uses. "People's imaginations will just run wild, and then they'll only feel the edges of the game," she points out. One big issue the Luna team is facing is making the player's in-game hands feel as real as possible. The player's hands can go through everything, but none of the objects react to that happening. There is no audio or sound to go with it. The player's hands in the game look kind of like flowers opening and closing, but there's no feedback for when the player's hand completely closes. "I want to put in a little sound," says Hunicke. "Just a tick to let you know know that it's fully closed. It's like when you're a baby: once you learn to snap, you'll do it. Once you learn to clap, you'll clap, because you're engaging with the idea that this pressure and the sound is you hitting you. It's VR; you're new; that's all new." Another challenge they've faced is in wrestling with the sharp contrast between the power grip that controllers, both VR and traditional, are made for and the delicate grabbing motion Hunicke wants for Luna. "Both the Vive and the Touch controllers are built for a certain engagement," she says. "[It's] kind of like a strong posture. It engages your arm and your hand in a way that makes you feel a certain way and I really want them to be [a grabbing, pinching motion]." Even with the feedback not being as juicy as Hunicke wants yet, PAX attendees who tried the game had no trouble understanding the controls. Funomena had about 500 people per day try the game that weekend, many of them women and children. Many of those players had never used VR before. Nonetheless, the reactions they got were in line with what the team had been hoping for. "We had a girl who said, 'It's the kind of game you want to play when you're having a bad day,' " Hunicke says with a laugh. "A lot of kids would get in the headset and immediately dive in and look all around and put their heads inside of everything, look underwater, and make all these excited remarks. We had one young boy, like a nine year old, who, as soon as the turtle appeared at the end of the demo, dropped the controllers and hugged it. Hunicke was pleased with how the game resounded with women. "A lot of women would just take the headset off and say, 'I didn't think that VR was for me. I wasn't really sure if I was gonna like it. It seems like it's an intense experience. I was expecting it to be intense. I was a little afraid to give it a shot, but it was so relaxing and calming. This is exactly the kind of game I would play!' "I want it to be an expander title that someone can download and share with someone with very little experience and go, 'This is why VR is magical.' It isn't all shooting stuff or things flying at your face. It can be kind of a chill, creative, meditative experience," Hunicke continues. "That's what I wanted to build, and so to hear that, we were just thrilled." The team had been nervous about showing the game at PAX, unsure if it would be as well received as they hoped. Players' reactions gave them a confidence boost, making them feel like they were on the right track in spite of their mistakes along the way. And that, says Hunicke, is really what Luna is about. "A lot of games are about getting revenge or going back in time to fix mistakes, but that's not how it works in the real world," Hunicke says. "In the real world, when you make a mistake, you have to kinda learn to talk about it, share your story with other people, and then by listening to their stories realize that you're not alone. "And that's pretty much what the game is about. It's about the idea that we grow every time we push forward, even if we don't always get the outcomes that we expected, and that that's how you learn," she continutes. "I really want this game to reinforce this idea that by acknowledging and sharing the things that you're not great at or that you didn't do right or that weren't so great that happened to you, you can make real, positive change. The #notokay hashtag would be a perfect example. The more we talk about the challenges that we face, the more likely we are to heal those challenges and to move forward as a society."

(Photos by Todd Burke, left, and Jacqueline Lee / Daily News) By Jacqueline Lee | jlee1@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 3, 2016 at 11:31 am | UPDATED: November 3, 2016 at 12:39 pm Related Articles Silicon Valley millionaire Clyde Berg found ‘factually innocent’ sex abuse of wife In the state Assembly District 24 race, where voters are choosing between shades of Democrat, money speaks. There are no major differences on social issues between Palo Alto City Councilman Marc Berman, who won the June primary with 28.2 percent of the vote, and Palo Alto patent attorney Vicki Veenker, who ended up second in the eight-person primary with 22.2 percent. Both support spending more for universal preschool and education, back the countywide Measure B sales tax hike for transportation improvements and advocate legalizing recreational marijuana across the state. Where they differ is reflected by the nature of the special interest groups — from charter school backers to Realtors against rent control to women-in-power advocates — that have lined up behind them. Together, these independent groups have spent more than $3.4 million as of Wednesday for television and online ads, mailers and polling. About 90 percent of the outside funding has benefited Berman. EdVoice, a super political action committee (PAC) that pushes for education reform policies often opposed by teachers unions, spent more than $1.8 million on Berman this year, campaign reports show. EdVoice gets its money from philanthropists and entrepreneurs such as Arthur Rock, an early investor in Intel and Apple, and Carrie Walton Penner, granddaughter of the founder of Walmart and a staunch advocate for charter schools. Bill Lucia, president of EdVoice, previously told The Daily News it views Berman as the best candidate for public education because of his track record as a former development director of the Silicon Valley Education Foundation. Berman said in an interview Tuesday that charter schools are a good option in many parts of the state, including East Palo Alto, where students do not have a traditional high school. “Charter schools have less regulation and do not necessarily have to follow the same rules and regulation as tradition schools, so they have the flexibility to try new things,” Berman said. “Sometimes those things work … and in those instances, they should be shared with other schools in the area.” Veenker, on the other hand, has the endorsement of a traditional Democratic union stronghold: The California Teachers Association/Association for Better Citizenship contributed $16,700 to her campaign. She said charter schools are an important part of the public school system, but appropriate oversight is needed where tax dollars are spent, especially when the money is diverted from traditional schools. “To look at (charter schools) as the solution for solving our educational problems misses the point,” Veenker said. “We need to look at improving all schools for students.” The candidates disagree on how to weed out bad teachers and retain good ones. Berman says one fix is to increase the amount of time it takes for teachers to get tenure from two years to four. The state’s teachers unions have long resisted change to tenure laws, most recently winning a state Supreme Court appeal this summer to uphold job protection for teachers. Berman said giving tenure after two years is bad for good teachers because schools are sometimes hesitant to permanently hire someone after only 18 months of teaching. School districts spend hundreds of thousands of dollars firing bad teachers, Berman said, and many of those cases are settled, resulting in the teacher moving to another district. Veenker said if she’s forced to vote on changing the tenure law, she’d support the change to four years. But her preference is to address the process for teacher layoffs, which she said is based on seniority, takes too long and costs too much. Veenker said she wants teachers to keep getting tenure sooner than later for job security. It’s also one way to attract good teachers in an area hurt by the high cost of housing, she added. The neck-to-neck race has top Democrats choosing sides: Berman has endorsements from Rich Gordon, who terms out of the seat they’re running for, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Menlo Park Councilman Peter Ohtaki, a Republican and the third-highest vote-getter in the June primary, also has endorsed him. Veenker is backed by Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian and Palo Alto Mayor Pat Burt. The rest of the money After EdVoice, the California Real Estate Independent Expenditure Committee-California Association of Realtors spent the most on Berman, $358,856. Berman, who does not support rent control, also has the endorsement of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors. “I’ve been a leading advocate for additional housing in my time on the Palo Alto City Council,” Berman said. “Increasing supply is what we need to focus on. I’m perfectly fine with it existing where it currently exists, but rent control is not the answer.” Veenker said rent control is a tool that should be left on the table. “Many rely on it to stay in their homes,” Veenker said in a statement. “We are in a housing crisis. I support solutions including a state housing bond and tax incentives for affordable housing.” As of Wednesday, the following outside groups, among others, also spent money on ads for Berman: • Californians Allied for Patient Protection Independent Expenditure Account, $287,156; • Building and Protecting a Strong California, a Coalition of Firefighters, Building Trades, Realtors and Correctional Officers Organizations, $126,036; • and the California Dental Association Independent Expenditure PAC, $109,576. Veenker has support from the following committees: • Silicon Valley Progressive Women for Equity and Oportunidad Supporting Vicki Veenker for Assembly 2016, $268,226; • California Chiropractic Association PAC, $65,000; • and the Women in Power PAC, $10,000. The last filing deadline before the election showed that as of Oct. 22, Berman directly raised about $690,008 this year in monetary contributions and Veenker about $559,208. With a personal life experience as a working mother, a 30-year career as a patent attorney with chemical and technical experts and her advocacy work through the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, Veenker said she would bring her perspective as a woman to the state Capitol. “We don’t have women setting the agenda in many cases,” said Veenker, who plans to focus on improving laws around campus sexual assault, equal pay and better maternity and paternity leave. Veenker’s biggest independent expenditure proponents are women’s groups striving to place more progressive women in Assembly. Women currently hold 19 of 80 seats. Berman says he cares just as much as Veenker does about issues affecting women. One thing he wants to do in his first year in office is to craft a bill of rights so sexual assault survivors know what help they’re guaranteed. Environmental fight Veenker’s campaign has sought to portray her as more passionate about the environment than Berman. It has released a polarizing television ad with images tying Berman to the single-use plastic bag industry and this week questioned the spending from Dart Container Corp., a single-use Styrofoam company, on Berman’s behalf. Berman’s campaign said Wednesday he has not sought Dart’s support and would not have accepted direct contributions from it. The help came in the form of an independent expenditure, like that of EdVoice and others, which are made without candidates’ involvement. “We do not appreciate or condone their involvement in our race, and their actions are completely independent from our campaign,” Berman’s campaign said in a statement. Berman’s campaign also noted he voted last November to expand Palo Alto’s ordinance to prohibit sale of plastic foam products, including those made by Dart, in local stores. Veenker, who has the endorsement of the Sierra Club and California League of Conservation Voters after the groups interviewed both candidates, said she questions whether Berman can fully represent the district on environmental issues since he has a financial interest in his father’s company, which makes reusable plastic bags. As a councilman, Berman had to recuse himself from a vote on single-use plastic bags, so there could be other bills he has to sidestep, Veenker said. Berman said he, like Veenker, supports Proposition 67 to uphold a ban on some plastic bags. “This will be decided before I ever take the oath of office,” Berman said. “There will be no opportunity for a conflict to come up in the future.” Berman said he’s disappointed Veenker chose to run an ad that shows “plastic bags blowing in the wind” to intentionally mislead voters into thinking his family makes those bags. Veenker has said she will pursue a state statute to reduce petroleum use and work on water conservation. She wants to offer tax credits for research on water use technology, like smart grids for water; give subsidies to farmers who adopt such technology; and discourage water use by altering rates. Berman said his environmental priorities are reducing dependence on oil, improving vehicles’ fuel efficiency and protecting natural resources. District 24 encompasses Atherton, East Palo Alto, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Portola Valley, Sunnyvale, Woodside and parts of Cupertino and San Mateo County.

The company has announced its fourth-generation 14-nanometer (nm) process and third-generation 10nm process to be implemented in next-generation products across both their mobile and consumer electronics product lines, as well as in data centre and automotive solutions. For those unfamiliar with the terms used above, the two processes will be used in semiconductor device fabrication to create new 14nm and 10nm Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC). The 14nm chip was first commercially shipped by Intel in 2014, while Samsung started mass production on mobile processors that feature 10nm FinFET technology this year. Rumours have the technology potentially debuting in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 830, and it could also be used in Samsung’s own 2017 flagship Exynos SoC. The company states that its new 14nm process technology delivers improved performance at the same power and according tot the same design rules compared to its previous 14nm process. Meanwhile, the new 10nm process technology will provide area reduction compared to its previous generations. Samsung says it’s expected to be “the most cost-effective cutting-edge process technology in the industry.” The South Korean tech giant also updated 7nm Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) process development status and showcased its 7nm EUV wafer, which is generally expected to hit the market in 2019. Samsung states process design kits for the new technologies will be available in the second quarter of 2017, meaning the resulting new chips may become commercially available in 2018. Image credit: Honou Related: Samsung starts production on 10nm FinFET mobile processors SourceSamsung ViaAndroid Authority RG But will it explode? Omis Only if you use it. Alex yes, with the new state of the art 14nm chip an 10nm chip, we can create bigger explosions, in smaller devices. As consumers want smaller, and slimmer designs, its difficult to get users the power that they want, but with these new chips, we did it. This new chip will definitely blow you away, regardless where you hide it. Cameron Davidson Yawn.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Samsung shows off refinements to 14-nm and 10-nm process nodes by Wayne Manion  12:00 PM on November 3, 2016 As process nodes become smaller and smaller, chip manufacturers have to work harder to squeeze performance and power savings out of each step. To wit, Intel's recently changed from its familiar "tick-tock" cadence of alternating die-shrinks and architecture updates to a three-step "process-architecture-optimaztion" model. Likewise, Samsung's fabrication arm recently presented the latest revisions of its 10-nm and 14-nm process nodes to its manufacturing partners at its Device Solutions America headquarters. Samsung showed off the latest version of its 14-nm process, the company's fourth generation at that node size. The new fabrication technology, dubbed 14LPU, is intended for "high-performance and compute-intensive applications" and will deliver "higher performance at the same power and design rules." The new 10-nm process, which Samsung calls 10LPU, is the company's third go-round with fabrication at that node size. Samsung claims the new process will allow for smaller die sizes compared to its older 10-nm offerings. Samsung goes on to claim that 10LPU could be "the most cost-effective cutting-edge process technology in the industry." Refinements at existing node sizes are great, but smaller sizes are probably more interesting to readers. Samsung took the opportunity to show off 7-nm EUV wafers and provide updates on this process to its partners. Samsung says process design kits for the 14LPU and 10LPU processes will be available in the second quarter of next year. We expect that actual products built with these technologies will appear not too long after that.

The fellowships were announced this week. (Photo by Sarah Mullinax) by Dan Margolies, Heartland Health Monitor A University of Kansas scientist has been named one of the first recipients of an $825,000 fellowship for her work in developing a protein designed to thwart antibiotic resistance. Joanna Slusky, 37, who heads the Slusky Lab at KU and specializes in outer membrane proteins, is one of five inventors nationwide recognized by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, Calif. The foundation, established by the co-founder of Intel Corp. and his wife, anticipates awarding a total of $33.75 million to support 50 promising inventors over the next 10 years, according to its website. Slusky is part of the first cohort announced Wednesday. Slusky is an assistant professor of computational biology and molecular biosciences at KU. She was recruited there two years ago after completing postdoctoral work at Stockholm University and the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She received her doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania. Her lab looks at how outer membrane proteins fold. It seeks to develop applications for cancer therapeutics, vaccine development and environmental remediation. The invention for which Slusky is being recognized is a so-called “helper” protein that disables a bacterium’s ability to protect itself from attack by antibiotics. “In order to do that, what one needs to do is disable the resistance mechanism of the bacteria,” Slusky said in a telephone interview. Slusky said the resistance mechanism is a protein pump that pushes antibiotics out of a cell, thwarting their ability to kill it. “So I’m making proteins that disable that resistance and disable it in a particularly interesting way that has never been tried before,” she said. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have spawned antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the world’s most pressing health problems. Illnesses that were once easily treatable with antibiotics now often mutate into dangerous and sometimes life-threatening infections. “More than 700,000 people are dying worldwide every year from antibiotic-resistance infections,” Slusky said. Some studies project that, if current trends continue, by 2050 more people in the United States will die from such infections than from cancer. Slusky’s invention is still a long way from coming to market. It has yet to undergo preclinical studies, let alone clinical trials in humans. “It’s probably a minimum of 15 years off, or something like that,” Slusky said. “And that’s partly related to the fact that it takes so long, once you have something that works, to bring to market.” The Moore Foundation money — $825,000, including $50,000 from KU, over three years — will help accelerate that process. The funds will enable Slusky to do more hiring, plan more long-term experiments and, with any luck, begin pre-clinical trials in three to five years. “We are investing in promising scientist problem solvers with a passion for inventing — like Gordon Moore himself,” said Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, in a news release. “By providing support to these early-career researchers, we can give them the freedom to try out new ideas that could make a real and positive difference.” The release said that Slusky’s invention “could have a global impact on antibiotic resistance and re-establish the efficacy of antibiotics.” The other recipients of this year’s Moore Foundation awards are Deji Akinwande of the University of Texas, Shane Ardo of the University of California, Irvine, Xingjie Ni of Pennsylvania State University and Mona Jarrahi of the University of California, Los Angeles. The awards are being given on the 50th anniversary of Gordon Moore’s now-famous prediction, known as Moore’s law, that components on integrated circuits would double every 18 months, exponentially increasing computer power.

Canyon Bridge Capital Partners said it will pay $1.3 billion for Lattice, or $8.30 per share. The offer represents a 30 percent premium over Lattice's closing stock price Wednesday. Lattice's shares shot up more than 18 percent on news of the deal, to $7.54. That's well below Canyon Bridge's offer price, though, reflecting skepticism about whether the little-known investment firm will be able to complete the deal. Lattice Semi's history 1983: Lattice Semiconductor founded by veterans of Tektronix and Intel. 1987: Lattice files for bankruptcy and reorganizes. 1988: Cyrus Tsui named chief executive. 1989: Lattice holds an initial public offering. 1993: Revenues surpass $100 million as Lattice buys California-based chip designer QuickLogic Corp. 2000: Lattice shares peak at $41.34, and revenues peak at $568 million. 2001: Sales plunge 48 percent following the dot-com and telecom busts, and the company falls into the red. Lattice is not consistently profitable going forward. 2004: Lattice restates financial results amid an accounting probe. 2005: Tsui and another executive are fired following shareholder allegations of excessive bonuses and lavish corporate spending. Steve Skaggs is named CEO. Lattice lays off 140. 2008: Skaggs is fired and replaced by Bruno Guilmart. 2009: Lattice posts its first profitable quarter in nearly three years. 2010: Guilmart quits unexpectedly, replaced by Intel veteran Darin Billerbeck 2015: Lattice moves from longtime Hillsboro headquarters to The U.S. Bancorp Tower (Big Pink) in downtown Portland, pays $600 million for California-based Silicon Image, and lays off roughly 200 workers in two rounds of job cuts. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland left his price target on Lattice at $7.50 despite the $8.30 offer, writing in a note to clients that he's unsure Thursday's deal will close given the uncertainty about Canyon Bridge's ties to China and the firm's track record. Canyon Bridge did not immediately respond to an inquiry about its background, portfolio or funding. Lattice's sale would not be a surprise — the chip industry is undergoing a massive wave of consolidation — and the Portland company had topped the lists of takeover targets for more than a year. But the decision to sell to a unknown investment firm, instead of another chip company, is unexpected. California-based Canyon Bridge could be looking for opportunities to improve Lattice's results before putting it on the market again. Just last week, Rolland said that Lattice would be an attractive acquisition for Xilinx, Qualcomm, Marvell or even Apple, which apparently is already a Lattice customer. On Thursday, though, Rolland told clients the Canyon Bridge deal faces uncertain prospects because of murky information around the investment firm. He noted that Canyon Bridge identifies its funding as coming from "limited partners in China." In his note, Rolland said he believes the Chinese government is seeking to buy chip companies in other countries to integrate with a Shanghai-based company, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. Lattice would be a neat fit, he wrote, because its chips are made by contractor manufacturers based on older technology of the kind SMIC uses. Additionally, Rolland said, Lattice is small enough, and its technology sufficiently low-tech, that a sale to Chinese investors would probably pass muster with United States regulators who review such deals for national security implications. For its part, Lattice said Thursday it expects business as usual under its new ownership. Historically, the company has had about 200 employees in Oregon, split between its Portland office and its former headquarters in Hillsboro. Lattice employed 1,146 worldwide at the start of the year. "Importantly, we will operate as a standalone subsidiary after the acquisition and do not expect any changes in our operations or our unwavering commitment to continued innovation for our customers," Lattice chief executive Darin Billerbeck said in a written statement. The company told employees that its headquarters will remain in Portland. Lattice is the smallest of three companies that dominate the market for a kind of chip called a field programmable gate array. The programmable chips play supporting roles in everything from telecommunications networking equipment to digital cameras and TVs. Last year, Intel paid $16.7 billion for another programmable chip company, Altera. And Lattice had made deals of its own, paying $600 million last year for a California company called Silicon Image. Lattice reported $406.0 million in revenue last year, up from $366.1 million in 2014, before the Silicon Image deal. Lattice lost $159.5 million in 2015, including $93 million in restructuring, accounting and acquisition-related expenses. Founded in 1983 by alumni of Tektronix and Intel, Lattice literally trademarked the term "Silicon Forest." It has never had an easy path, though. Lattice filed for bankruptcy in 1987, revived the business, then withstood a formidable downturn following the dot-com crash. It endured an accounting scandal in 2004 and fired longtime CEO Cyrus Tsui a year later amid shareholder accusations of lavish corporate spending. The company's business rebounded somewhat in recent years by focusing on the low-end of the programmable chip business, but results were uneven and Lattice laid off workers in 2012 and twice last year. The buyer, Canyon Bridge, has no public track record and its website identifies no other companies in its portfolio. The firm lists a Palo Alto address and two partners, including former Cadence Design Systems CEO Ray Bingham. Lattice's sale is the latest in a long string of deals for Oregon's biggest tech companies. Earlier this year, Beaverton-based Cascade Microtech sold for $352 million and FEI Co. sold for $4.2 billion. Wilsonville-based Mentor Graphics, the state's largest pure tech company, is under pressure from investors and has reportedly hired an investment bank to put itself on the market. All three of those companies serve the chip industry, which is consolidating as maturing businesses look to expand their markets and reduce costs by acquiring peers in related fields. Oregon tech, with no really big companies of its own, tends to be on the selling end of those transactions. Last year, Hillsboro-based Planar Systems agreed to sell itself to a Chinese company, Leyard Optoelectronic Co. That deal encountered skepticism, too, tied to economic turmoil in China, but Planar ultimately completed its sale. The electronic display company continues to operate in Hillsboro. Update: This article has been substantially updated with additional information about Canyon Bridge. Correction: The name of the firm buying Lattice has been corrected, as has the date of Lattice's bankruptcy. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Opinions / Best MacBook Air Alternatives: 5 thin and light laptops you'll love Best MacBook Air Alternatives: 5 thin and light laptops you'll love by Edward Chester 03 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Best MacBook Air Alternatives: We pick the best thin and light laptops you should look for as an alternative to the Apple MacBook Air. The MacBook Air has been the go-to thin and light laptop for both Windows and Mac users for years now. However, with Apple not keen on keeping it updated with the latest tech, its crown has begun to slip. If you’re an Apple user happy to try an alternative, or you’ve always just installed Windows on your MacBook Air, then these five alternatives are the best place to start your search for a new laptop. All prices were correct at time of publication but are subject to change. Related: How to run Windows on a Mac 1) Dell XPS 13 Price: £1,099.99 | $1,074 Our Score: 9/10 Our Verdict: "The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best no-nonsense portable laptops around" The first Windows laptop ever to categorically wrestle the crown for best thin and light from the MacBook Air, the Dell XPS 13 is a superb little laptop. It all starts with a fantastic design that’s different but easily the equal of Apple’s laptop. It’s markedly smaller too, with the 13-inch screen fitting in the same footprint as most older 12-inch laptops. The screen itself is also great. Dell offers two versions – a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel non-touch model, and a 3,200 x 1,800-pixel touchscreen model. We’d recommend going for the non-touch version, as it still offers great quality, you get better battery life, and the extra resolution and touch features are of minimal benefit. When the Dell XPS 13 launched in 2015 it was available for just £800, making it a bona fide bargain. However, prices for certain configurations have since risen to more than £1,000 – but even at this level it's still a great option for those happy to pay MacBook Air prices.

This is a great option for those seeking a top-notch lightweight laptop without breaking the bank." Taking over the XPS 13’s title of best-value ultrabook, the Lenovo 710S offers a fantastic combination of performance, screen quality, design and battery life for its (circa) £800 asking price. That said, the design is the main area where you’re compromising a bit. While you get the overall look and feel of a MacBook Air-alike, you’re not getting the same build quality. The Apple machine is made from solid blocks of aluminium milled down to form the various panels of its chassis, while Lenovo uses thin sheets of aluminium pressed into shape and attached to a plastic chassis. As a result it’s a little more flexible and lacks that reassuring heft that the Air possesses. This aside, though, you’re getting a heck of a lot for the money. For a start, the screen is excellent. The 13-inch IPS panel has a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel resolution and looks great – in fact, it absolutely wipes the floor with the Air. Inside you’ve got a nippy Intel Core i7-6560U, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, where most rivals at this price point offer only 128GB of storage. Connectivity is decent too, with plenty of USBs and an SD card slot, and the keyboard is very good. The trackpad lets the side down a little but it’s still perfectly useable, unlike some really cheap and nasty laptops. Battery life can’t quite keep pace with either the Air or the XPS 13, but at comfortably over eight hours it’s enough for most of a working day.

Something a little different, the Acer Chromebook 14 forgoes Windows and instead runs Google’s ChromeOS. This is a stripped-down, simple operating system, but as a result it needs far less processing speed and it sips rather than guzzles power, making for an incredibly cheap and long-lasting laptop. For around £200, you’re getting a laptop that’ll cover all your basic computing needs such as web browsing, email, word processing, basic photo editing, watching video – basically anything that you can do in Google’s Chrome web browser. Inevitably at this price, you’re skimping when it comes to design, with no metal or other premium materials on show. But you still get a smart-looking laptop that’s impressively thin and light, though it is a slightly larger 14-inch machine rather than a 13-incher. One crucial area where you really are missing out is the screen. With only a 1,366 x 768 pixel resolution, the quality just isn't that great. Still, with a perfectly decent keyboard and trackpad, and adequate performance from the Intel Celeron N3060 and 2GB/4GB RAM, you can get all your basic computing done and enjoy a far better typing experience than on a tablet. If you're coming from a MacBook Air, it will be significantly slower, so you should only consider a Chromebook if your needs are very basic, or you're looking for a secondary laptop. Note that you only get 16GB or 32GB of storage – the idea is you store most of your files on Google’s cloud services – and that you need an internet connection to get pretty much anything done on Chromebooks. But with the better part of 10 hours' battery life, this makes for a great laptop for students or those on a really tight budget.

Asus' ZenBook line has produced some of the most consistently good alternatives to the MacBook Air, thanks to eye-catching design, solid performance and competitive pricing. The UX330UA continues this trend, including a 3,200 x 1,800-pixel display and 256GB SSD– all for under £800. Like the Lenovo Ideapad though, the design here is more about aping the look of premium metal, rather than emulating its actual feel. Only the lid is metal – and it looks fab – but the rest of the machine is plastic with embedded metallic particles. Other areas where it can’t quite match the competition are the middling keyboard and below par battery life. You’ll get only around six hours of use from a charge, which is below the 8-10 hours many others will manage. If battery life is less of a concern, though, then the superb screen and good overall performance make this a good option. Best Deals for Asus ZenBook UX330UA 5) New Razer Blade Stealth Price: £999 | $1,649 Our Score: TBC Early Verdict: "You’re getting a great, powerful ultrabook with a bunch of freebies." If gaming’s your thing but you still want a truly thin and light laptop then the Razer Blade Stealth might be just what you’re after. The 12.5-inch laptop is just 0.52-inches thick, weighs only 1.25kg, and can be kitted out with either a 4K or QHD display. In almost every way, it's a typical high-end ultrabook, packing an Intel Core i7-7500U along with 8-16GB of RAM, a 256GB-1TB SSD, and a claimed battery life of up to nine hours. The real trick with this laptop, though, is that it can dock with an external graphics card so that it can transform into a powerful gaming machine. The Razer Core (£499), as it’s called, is a box that contains a power supply and desktop graphics card – which can be upgraded – and it plugs into the Blade Stealth via a Thunderbolt cable. We’ve yet to review the Razer Blade Stealth in full, but it looks set to be a truly exciting laptop for on-the-go gamers.

brings total funding to $28M with round led by Mayfield to expand the science of Nutriomics and "Eating Well Made Simple," empowering Food to rival Drugs as Medicine News provided by Zipongo Nov 03, 2016, 07:30 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- By making it easy to eat well, Zipongo has been able to help people tastefully sustain healthy eating and outcomes, and formalize Food Benefits Management for health plans, wellness platforms and a range of employers, from tech and financial services giants, to leading retailers and manufacturers.  Now with the closing of their $18 million Series B funding round—bringing total financing to $28 million—Zipongo and partners are further enabling Nutriomics and behavior science to empower health providers and disease management systems to measurably leverage food as medicine. The Series B was led by Silicon Valley pioneer, Mayfield, a key investor in companies ranging from Genentech and Solar City (acquired by Tesla), to Marketo and Lyft.  Mayfield's recent investments in Digital Health include Basis Science (acquired by Intel), HealthTap, Lantern, Brighter, Finrise and a stealth investment in AI applied to healthcare.  Mayfield was joined by existing Zipongo investors, including Series A lead, Boston-based Excel Venture Management, which has been a key backer of companies such as Craig Venter's Synthetic Genomics, Cleveland HeartLab, WellDoc, and ShapeUp (acquired by Virgin Pulse).   Zipongo, founded by Jason Langheier, MD, MPH, has been a pioneer in leveraging behavioral economics, nutrition, personalization data science and well-designed software user experiences to make eating well easy, and the health results sustainable.  Dr. Langheier was inspired to launch Zipongo after helping launch the pediatric obesity clinic at Boston Medical Center, and build it based on science, rooted in training from Harvard's Nutrition Department, Duke University Medical School and the University of California at San Francisco Biostatistics and Pediatrics clinical research teams.   Today, over 150 companies and the majority of national health plans and wellness platforms work with Zipongo to drive engagement, health impact, cost savings and happiness of their people.  Zipongo's comprehensive digital nutrition coaching platform and food utility tools support people from all walks of life, from those that cook and leverage grocery discounts regularly, to those who eat prepared meals from restaurants frequently.  Just as Pharmacy Benefits Management companies help drive adherence to the most cost-effective drugs that lower disease-related costs, Food Benefits Management powered by Zipongo helps people eat the right foods for them—the ultimate personalized generic drug—to lower healthcare costs and deliver a return on investment.  Zipongo's goal is to reduce the burden of chronic disease, reduce risk from the unintended side-effects of taking multiple drugs and in-hospital disease care, and help rein in unsustainable healthcare cost growth.   "Jason is a mission-driven entrepreneur who has made it easy for millions of people to eat foods that they like and are also good for them," said Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield. "Zipongo has also built an amazingly scalable software business in the process that delivers exceptionally high sustained user engagement and better outcomes that employers and insurance companies have found compelling." The new funding empowers Zipongo, its partners and their consenting study participants to expand on research and development begun many years ago driving the burgeoning data science of Nutriomics—the study of personalizing food recommendations based on bodily measures of genetics, metabolomics, immune-response and the microbiome, and a person's nutrition status, food buying, tastes and food environment, to optimize measures of health, emotional and performance outcomes.  Further study will enable health providers and health systems to prescribe Food as Medicine to more sustainably prevent and support care of many disease states—from diabetes to inflammatory bowel disease to cancers, when paired with food utility tools that make it easy to eat well.    Excitement about the growing depth and breadth of Zipongo's existing Food Benefits Management products and services has led to a 120 percent revenue increase, year over year, since third quarter of 2015. As part of this Series B investment, Ursheet Parikh and Tim Chang will join Dr. Langheier, Juan Enriquez (Excel, Synthetic Genomics), Zac Zeitlin (New Ground Ventures) and Todd Hixon (New Atlantic Ventures, former BCG Digital Practice leader) on the board of Zipongo. Says Dr. Langheier, "Humanity needs to feed nearly 10 billion souls by 2050, in a way that both eradicates chronic disease and sustains Earth.  In the face of that daunting challenge, we feel grateful to have so many engaged clients and users, as well as investors with so much experience in Enterprise Software-as-a-Service, Healthcare, Personalized Medicine, Data Science and Consumer Engagement, who are helping us build a company that delivers long-term value.  It takes a large village—and patient persistence—to feed such a big family, well." About Mayfield Mayfield is a global venture capital firm with over $2.7 billion under management.  The Firm has been championing entrepreneurs for more than 47 years.  Mayfield invests primarily in early-stage IT companies in enterprise and consumer sectors.  Mayfield invests in India-based companies through a dedicated fund.  Since its founding in 1969, the Firm has invested in more than 520 companies resulting in 114 IPOs and more than 160 mergers or acquisitions.  Some recent successes include Elastica (acquired by Symantec), Marketo (acquired by Vista Equity Partners), SolarCity, and The Rubicon Project.  About Excel Venture Management Excel Venture Management builds companies that apply transformative technologies to solve problems in healthcare and beyond. The Excel investment portfolio is balanced across healthcare IT and services, diagnostics, and medical devices, plus life science platforms that address adjacent markets including energy, chemicals, defense and agriculture.

This means that there are a lot of devices out there in the world with many different types of video connections. But what are the differences between them all? Which ones do you need to care about? What’s the bottom line? In this article, we’ll explore the most prominent cable types of today and when you may want to use each one. VGA The Video Graphics Array (VGA) is one of the oldest connection standards which can still be found in large swaths of computing equipment. It was first developed by IBM and introduced in 1987. It was widely used for video cards, TV sets, computer monitors, and laptops Two Monitors for an Extended Desktop: 3 Things You Should Check First Two Monitors for an Extended Desktop: 3 Things You Should Check First You'd think that all you'd have to do is plug any video display into the computer port on your laptop or PC. Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Read More . Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock VGA can support resolutions up to 640 x 480 in 16 colors, although you can increase the colors to 256 by lowering the resolution to 320 x 200. This is known as Mode 13h and is commonly used when booting your computer into Safe Mode. It’s also the mode that was used in computer gaming back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Image Credit: Choksawatdikorn via Shutterstock The VGA cable can carry RGBHV video signals: Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and Vertical Sync. The VGA socket is made up of 15 pins in three rows of five pins, and typically colored blue. The cable socket is securely attached to the device using two screws, one on each side of the socket. Ads by Google It is rarely used today and is mostly found on older hardware, having been largely replaced by the digital DVI and HDMI connections, which we explore later in this article. RCA The famous red, white, and yellow setup of the RCA connector was once the most popular and widespread connection type for audio/visual devices. Image Credit: dugwy39 via Shutterstock While they are often referred to as RCA cables, RCA actually refers to the metal connectors at the end of the cables, named after the Radio Corporation of America which popularized the connection type. Image Credit: Vladimir Zhupanenko via Shutterstock The cables themselves are red and white audio cables and yellow for single channel composite video.

DVI More than a decade after IBM introduced VGA, the Digital Display Working Group launched the digital successor, DVI, in 1999. DVI, which stands for Digital Visual Interface, can transmit uncompressed digital video in one of three different modes: DVI-I (Integrated) combines digital and analog in the same connector. DVI-D (Digital) supports digital signals only. DVI-A (Analog) supports analog only. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock DVI-I and DVI-D can come in single- or dual-link varieties. Single-link can support 1920 x 1200 at 60 Hz, while adding a second digital transmitter for dual-link means the resolution can be increased to 2560 x 1600 at 60 Hz. In order to prevent forced obsolescence of VGA devices, DVI was developed to support analog connections using the DVI-A mode. This meant that DVI connections and devices could be backwards-compatible with VGA connections. Mini-DVI Apple is infamous for always trying to make their devices thinner and lighter. Most people think of this as a relatively recent development, but they’ve been at it since at least 2006 when they decided to move on from the mini-VGA port. In its place, they developed the mini-DVI connector. Image Credit: Wijit Wongwijit via Shutterstock It was included in the PowerBook G4, Intel-based iMacs and Macbooks, and Xserve. The mini-DVI doesn’t support dual-link connections and so was always limited to resolutions of 1920 x 1200 or less. This, in conjunction with advancing technology, led Apple to discontinue the use of mini-DVI in 2008 and replace it with Mini DisplayPort connections instead. HDMI HDMI, or High Definition Media Input, is a proprietary but wildly successful digital audio and video transfer interface. HDMI was created by a group of electronics manufacturers — including Sony, Sanyo, and Toshiba — to transfer video (uncompressed) and audio (either uncompressed or eight-channel compressed) to computer monitors, digital TVs, and DVD or Blu-ray players. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock As of HDMI 1.4, it can support 24-bit uncompressed audio at 192 kHz and video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160, which is also known as 4K or Ultra HD What's the Difference Between 4K and Ultra HD? What's the Difference Between 4K and Ultra HD? Thinking of buying a new TV or monitor but feeling lost with all of the terminology like 4K and Ultra HD? Here's everything you need to know about it. Read More . As HDMI uses the same video format standards as DVI, the two are compatible through an adapter. As no signal conversion is necessary, there is no loss of quality either (although unlike HDMI, DVI does not support audio). There are three commonly used HDMI connectors. Type A is the full-sized HDMI connection for use on TVs and home theater equipment. Mini-HDMI (Type C) is commonly used on laptops and tablets, while Micro-HDMI (Type D) is mostly used on mobile devices. DisplayPort DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). DisplayPort can carry digital video and audio, making it functionally similar to HDMI. As of DisplayPort 1.4, there is support for resolutions up to 8K (7680 x 4320) at 60 Hz, which surpasses even HDMI 1.4. Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock However, HDMI and DisplayPort were designed for different markets. While HDMI was made primarily for home entertainment, DisplayPort was designed for connecting computing devices to monitors. Due to their similar functionality, it is possible to connect DisplayPort and HDMI devices together using a Dual-Mode DisplayPort adapter. DisplayPort operates using packet data transmission which is commonly used in Ethernet and USB connections, and that’s what makes it ideal for use in computing as opposed to home entertainment. Mini DisplayPort Image Credit: PPBR via Shutterstock Apple replaced the mini-DVI connection on their Macbooks and iMacs with their own take on DisplayPort, known as Mini DisplayPort (MDP). Although Apple created MDP, it was incorporated into VESA’s DisplayPort 1.2 specification in 2009. Thunderbolt Thunderbolt is an interface used to connect peripheral devices to a computer. It was originally developed by Intel under the name of Light Peak and used optical cables for data transfer (hence the name Light Peak). After extensive testing, Intel found they could make it cheaper with copper cables without impacting performance. Apple was the first manufacturer to bring Thunderbolt to the market in their MacBook Pro models in 2011. When Thunderbolt debuted, it was able to use the MDP connector that Apple had created, meaning the new connection would be backwards-compatible. One of the biggest advantages of Thunderbolt over DisplayPort is the high speed of data transfer. Versions 1 and 2 of Thunderbolt could transfer at a rate of 20 GB/s using the MDP connector.

Read More  through a technique called daisy-chaining, which reduces the amount of ports needed on a device. Thunderbolt is able to carry audio either using the DisplayPort protocol or by using USB audio cards. As of Thunderbolt 2, there was support for DisplayPort 1.2 specifications, which allowed for 4K streaming to a 4K monitor. The Simplification Factor If you’re still confused, the good news is that the world is moving towards a unified standard. HDMI Licensing recently announced that in order to connect to an HDMI device, all you will need is a compatible USB Type-C to HDMI cable Everything You Need to Know About HDMI Alt Mode and USB Type-C Everything You Need to Know About HDMI Alt Mode and USB Type-C The new HDMI Alt Mode standard will allow phones and tablets to stream directly to monitors and TVs using USB-C-to-HDMI cables.

Fortunately, its rights are owned by INTEL, not Apple. Needless to say, this matters ;). This interface has all the bandwidth to do *everything* we need. "Thunderbolt is interoperable with DisplayPort 1.2 compatible devices. When connected to a DisplayPort compatible device the Thunderbolt port can provide a native DisplayPort signal with 4 lanes of output data at no more than 5.4 Gbit/s per lane. When connected to a Thunderbolt device the per-lane data rate becomes 10 Gbit/s and the 4 lanes are configured as 2 channels with each bidirectional 10 Gbit/s channel comprising one lane of input and one lane of output.[2]". -wikipedia Reply Fer September 4, 2012 at 3:40 am Thank you Jeremy :) Reply subhasish nayak March 22, 2016 at 11:54 am display port is better than HDMI..

Reply Jeremy Collake September 3, 2012 at 5:09 pm I love this idea of educating the masses on these simple things. Us geeks have known for years, and it doesn't take much to look up the differences. However, it is important for Joe Consumer to understand, as the manufacturers *sure don't* explain the differences when buying - especially low-end - monitors and such. It *is* too bad you didn't add DisplayPort though, as *that* may be the future of how we dock our mobile devices to multi-monitor setups with keyboard and mouse all with one cable. Let me add one more thing: Avoid Analog at all costs. You want Digital. Digital Digital Digital. No DVI-A (or analog over DVI-I). .. and, again, DisplayPort - watch for it!

The Series B was led by Silicon Valley pioneer, Mayfield, a key investor in companies ranging from Genentech and Solar City (acquired by Tesla), to Marketo and Lyft.  Mayfield's recent investments in Digital Health include Basis Science (acquired by Intel), HealthTap, Lantern, Brighter, Finrise and a stealth investment in AI applied to healthcare.  Mayfield was joined by existing Zipongo investors, including Series A lead, Boston-based Excel Venture Management, which has been a key backer of companies such as Craig Venter's Synthetic Genomics, Cleveland HeartLab, WellDoc, and ShapeUp (acquired by Virgin Pulse).   Zipongo, founded by Jason Langheier, MD, MPH, has been a pioneer in leveraging behavioral economics, nutrition, personalization data science and well-designed software user experiences to make eating well easy, and the health results sustainable.  Dr. Langheier was inspired to launch Zipongo after helping launch the pediatric obesity clinic at Boston Medical Center, and build it based on science, rooted in training from Harvard's Nutrition Department, Duke University Medical School and the University of California at San Francisco Biostatistics and Pediatrics clinical research teams.   Today, over 150 companies and the majority of national health plans and wellness platforms work with Zipongo to drive engagement, health impact, cost savings and happiness of their people.  Zipongo's comprehensive digital nutrition coaching platform and food utility tools support people from all walks of life, from those that cook and leverage grocery discounts regularly, to those who eat prepared meals from restaurants frequently.  Just as Pharmacy Benefits Management companies help drive adherence to the most cost-effective drugs that lower disease-related costs, Food Benefits Management powered by Zipongo helps people eat the right foods for them—the ultimate personalized generic drug—to lower healthcare costs and deliver a return on investment.  Zipongo's goal is to reduce the burden of chronic disease, reduce risk from the unintended side-effects of taking multiple drugs and in-hospital disease care, and help rein in unsustainable healthcare cost growth.   "Jason is a mission-driven entrepreneur who has made it easy for millions of people to eat foods that they like and are also good for them," said Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield. "Zipongo has also built an amazingly scalable software business in the process that delivers exceptionally high sustained user engagement and better outcomes that employers and insurance companies have found compelling." The new funding empowers Zipongo, its partners and their consenting study participants to expand on research and development begun many years ago driving the burgeoning data science of Nutriomics—the study of personalizing food recommendations based on bodily measures of genetics, metabolomics, immune-response and the microbiome, and a person's nutrition status, food buying, tastes and food environment, to optimize measures of health, emotional and performance outcomes.  Further study will enable health providers and health systems to prescribe Food as Medicine to more sustainably prevent and support care of many disease states—from diabetes to inflammatory bowel disease to cancers, when paired with food utility tools that make it easy to eat well.    Excitement about the growing depth and breadth of Zipongo's existing Food Benefits Management products and services has led to a 120 percent revenue increase, year over year, since third quarter of 2015. As part of this Series B investment, Ursheet Parikh and Tim Chang will join Dr. Langheier, Juan Enriquez (Excel, Synthetic Genomics), Zac Zeitlin (New Ground Ventures) and Todd Hixon (New Atlantic Ventures, former BCG Digital Practice leader) on the board of Zipongo. Says Dr. Langheier, "Humanity needs to feed nearly 10 billion souls by 2050, in a way that both eradicates chronic disease and sustains Earth.  In the face of that daunting challenge, we feel grateful to have so many engaged clients and users, as well as investors with so much experience in Enterprise Software-as-a-Service, Healthcare, Personalized Medicine, Data Science and Consumer Engagement, who are helping us build a company that delivers long-term value.  It takes a large village—and patient persistence—to feed such a big family, well."

Gerry Smith, the veteran executive who has held several different management roles within Lenovo, was named to a new position as executive vice president and chief operating office of PCs and smart devices. Replacing him as head of the Data Server Group, which is responsible for server sales and related services, is Kirk Skaugen, a former executive at Intel. Lenovo acknowledged that Data Center Group sales fell 8 percent to $1.1 billion year-over-year and the group lost $141 million. "With these changes Gerry Smith, currently EVP of DCG, moves to be EVP and COO PCSD (PCs & Smart Devices) using his knowledge, experience and proven track record to lead Lenovo global operations and operations for our core businesses, PCs and tablets," Lenovo noted. In the mobile business, Xudong Chen is now senior vice president of global services. He had led mobile as co-president and senior vice president. Replacing him is Gina Qiao, who had been senior vice president for human resources. The Lenovo veteran had previously served as chief strategy officer and as head of marketing in China. "In the last 12 months Xudong has stabilized the mobile business in China and will use his experience there to ensure we build a world-class and customer-centric service organization," Lenovo said. Lenovo mobile sales fell 12 percent year-over-year to $2 billion in its most recent quarter but did improve 20 percent from the previous quarter. Since acquiring Google's Motorola Mobility business two years ago, smartphone sales have plunged, dropping Lenovo out of the world;s top five among device servers.Several management changes and reorganizations also have taken place in the group. New faces Other new appointments include: Laura Quatela as Chief Legal Officer. Quatela previouls had served as chief legal officer and executive vice president for intellectual property at Alcatel-Lucent as well as general counsel at Eastman Kodak. Yong Rui as chief technology officer Yong had most recently served as deputy managing director for Microsoft Research Asia. Young succeeds longtime Lenovo and IBM veteran Peter Hortensius, who transferred to the data center group in March. “We have ... added several of the industry’s top minds into Lenovo, and are continuing to strengthen our leadership team," Lenovo Chairman and CEO Yang Yuanqing said in a statement. "We remain confident in our vision, our strategy and our team’s ability to achieve new heights.” MORE COVERAGE: Meet the new leaders WRAL TechWire any time: Twitter, FacebookCopyright 2016 WRAL TechWire.

Now, Dell and Lenovo both are reportedly working on new products that look to take on the newly-announced Surface Studio and the company's popular Surface Pro laptops. Starting with Dell, YouTuber Surface Pro Artist has put up a video of the company teasing its upcoming AIO creative PC. The teaser was shown as part of the Adobe MAX opening keynote, and it shows all the new things that the product is expected to bring. First up, the keyboard is entirely touch-based and comes with a dial to control edit tools etc. This is unlike the Surface Studio which allows you to directly draw on the computer, and has a separate Surface Dial that can be used on the display. The Dell AIO is set to unveil at CES next year.Dell has further told Engadget "At the start of Adobe MAX, Dell energised the audience with a sneak peek of its smart desk concept in action, teasing its innovative functionality and the exciting potential it will bring to creators everywhere. A full-horizontal touch display designed to work across a variety of systems, the device provides an immersive workspace for creators to build and interact with their content more naturally using pen, totem and touch. It's a new category of computing designed specifically for creators and nothing like it exists on the market today. Envisioned originally in 2014, we're excited to officially unveil it and more at CES 2017." Lenovo appears to be looking to expand its Miix series (the company's Surface Pro lookalike product line) as well. After launching a range of Ideapad Miix laptops in India, the company is now reportedly working on the IdeaPad Miix 720. WinFuture reports that the Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 720 will sport a 12-inch (2880x9120 pixels) screen, and be powered by Intel's latest seventh-generation i3, i5, and i7 Kaby Lake processors. It will offer 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD. It will add USB Type-C port alongside two legacy USB ports as well.Microsoft said that the Surface Studio's base model with 1TB storage, Intel Core i5 processor, and 8GB RAM will cost $2,999. And the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 was launched in October last year for a price starting at $899. There is no word on the exact pricing of the Dell and Lenovo products. While Dell confirmed a CES launch date, the Lenovo ideaPad Miix 720 laptop launch date remains unknown.

Written by: Vicky Nanjappa Updated: Thursday, November 3, 2016, 11:41 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News Bengaluru, Nov 3: Amidst reports of ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Bhagdadi being surrounded by the Iraqi army an audio clip has surfaced. The ISIS released an audio clip of Bhagdadi in which he is heard saying, " this is what Allah and his messengers promised us." There has also been hectic activity on the social media with pro ISIS handles urging the killing of non-Muslims in the West. On the social media there were poems being posted which speak about the importance of killing non-Muslims in the West. In the audio clip, Bhagdadi has termed this as a Sunni vs Shia war. The SITE Intel Group says that Bhagdadi is trying to rally his fighters in the wake of this offensive by the Iraqi forces. He is also heard calling for attacks on Turkey while saying that the Shias are doing everything in their power to take over the country. Even if I am killed, the fight must go on says Bhagdadi. He tells fighters around the world to continue fighting if he is killed. Many deaths have taken place recently, but that not weakened the ISIS, he also says. The Iraqi forces entered Mosul for the first time in two years. Bhagdadi the supreme commander of the ISIS is beleived to be hiding in Mosul. Several observers say that the end is near for Bhagdadi. The death of Bhagdadi will weaken the ISIS considerably and the outfit would have to immediately declare a new Caliph. The Iraqi forces are confident that they would beat the ISIS down and even kill Bhagdadi. The ISIS is unlikely to overcome this challenge as it has already lost several of its fighters. There are currently around 5,000 ISIS fighters in Mosul and 1,500 on the outskirts. According to reports many would try to make an escape bid, but would find it hard. The death of Bhagdadi will no doubt weaken the outfit a great deal. However there is also a lurking danger of the ISIS taking the fight to the main land. Several pro-ISIS handles have already urged its fighters to carrry out attacks outside of Iraq and Syria. The audio clip released also makes it clear that the fight is far from over and the West would increasingly be targeted.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid Fans were left disappointed when Microsoft did not launch or even announce the Surface Pro 5 in October where other devices such as the Surface Book i7 and the Surface Studio were showcased. Despite a no show, fans still believe that the device will be launched early 2017 with the Intel Kaby Lake chipset. An early 2017 release would mean fierce competition from other tech companies who are expected to reveal a number of next-generation devices during that timeframe. In terms of features and specs, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to feature a 4K/UHD display with a 3:2 aspect ratio just like Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4. The screen resolution would be of 3869 x 2560 pixels. A highly-advanced Surface Pen may also be included, writes iTech Post. This would be more pressure sensitive than its predecessor. A fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C ports are also expected for added security. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may run on the latest Windows 10 Redstone 2 update, consist of a 16GB RAM and have a longer battery life. When it comes to camera specs, the device may sport a 16MP primary and 8MP front camera. So far none of the rumours have been confirmed. Microsoft has not released any official statement regarding the Surface Pro 5. However, most unconfirmed reports suggest that the device’s release has been shifted to 2017 mainly because of the Intel Kaby Lake chipset and Windows 10 Redstone 2 update. The Kaby Lake chipsets are expected to be launched in December. These chipsets are said to provide some awesome graphics performance in high-end devices, writes Android Origin. They also improve battery life. Rumours suggest that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may sell around the price tag of US$899 (AU$1,170). Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

SARAH MULLINAX A University of Kansas scientist has been named one of the first recipients of an $825,000 fellowship for her work in developing a protein designed to thwart antibiotic resistance. Listen Listening... / 0:48 Joanna Slusky, 37, who heads the Slusky, Lab at KU and specializes in outer membrane proteins, is one of five inventors nationwide recognized by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, California. The foundation, established by the co-founder of Intel Corp. and his wife, anticipates awarding a total of $33.75 million to support 50 promising inventors over the next 10 years, according to its website. Slusky is part of the first cohort announced today. Slusky is an assistant professor of computational biology and molecular biosciences at KU. She was recruited there two years ago after completing postdoctoral work at Stockholm University and the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania. Her lab looks at how outer membrane proteins fold. It seeks to develop applications for cancer therapeutics, vaccine development and environmental remediation. The invention for which Slusky is being recognized is a so-called helper protein that disables a bacterium’s ability to protect itself from an attack by antibiotics. “In order to do that, what one needs to do is disable the resistance mechanism of the bacteria,” Slusky said in a telephone interview. Slusky said the resistance mechanism is a protein pump that pushes antibiotics out of a cell, thwarting their ability to kill it. “So I’m making proteins that disable that resistance and disable it in a particularly interesting way that has never been tried before,” she said. Slusky, fourth from left, and members of her lab study how outer membrane proteins fold. Credit Becca Peterson Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have spawned antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the world’s most pressing health problems. Illnesses that were once easily treatable with antibiotics now often mutate into dangerous and sometimes life-threatening infections. “More than 700,000 people are dying worldwide every year from antibiotic-resistant infections,” Slusky said. Some studies project that, if current trends continue, by 2050 more people in the United States will die from such infections than from cancer. Slusky’s invention is still a long way from coming to market. It has yet to undergo preclinical studies, let alone clinical trials in humans. “It’s probably a minimum of 15 years off, or something like that,” Slusky said. “And that’s partly related to the fact that it takes so long, once you have something that works, to bring to market.” The Moore Foundation money – $825,000, including $50,000 from KU, over three years – will help accelerate that process. The funds will enable Slusky to do more hiring, plan more long-term experiments and, with any luck, begin pre-clinical trials in three to five years. “We are investing in promising scientist problem solvers with a passion for inventing – like Gordon Moore himself,” said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, in a news release. “By providing support to these early-career researchers, we can give them the freedom to try out new ideas that could make a real and positive difference.” The release said that Slusky’s invention “could have a global impact on antibiotic resistance and re-establish the efficacy of antibiotics.” The other recipients of this year’s Moore Foundation awards are Deji Akinwande of the University of Texas; Shane Ardo of the University of California, Irvine; Xingjie Ni of Pennsylvania State University; and Mona Jarrahi of the University of California, Los Angeles. The awards are being given out on the 50th anniversary of Gordon Moore’s now-famous prediction, known as Moore’s law, that components on integrated circuits would double every 18 months, exponentially increasing computer power.

And you can thank her for helping lead the way to a pretty hefty parental leave policy at the tech giant. “When we increased our maternity leave to 18 weeks, we saw the number of women who left Google cut by 50%,” Susan Wojcicki told CNNMoney in an interview at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit last month. That data was enough for Google to make the argument that paid leave is well worth the cost. “We wanted to retain women, we wanted to show them that Google cared, that they can be a mother and they could work at Google,” she said. As CEO of YouTube (now with over 1 billion users a month) Wojcicki has her eyes on changing TV as we know it — while advocating for more women in top roles at tech companies. Oh, and in the meantime raising her five children. Wojcicki was one of the first woman hired at Google — and now she’s the only female CEO under Google’s behemoth umbrella. In 1998, Wojcicki left her marketing job at Intel and became employee number 16 at Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had been running the fledgling company out of Wojcicki’s garage in Menlo Park, California at the time. She’d agreed to rent it to Brin and Page (then PhD students at Stanford) to bring in some extra dough. “It was truly because I needed help paying the mortgage.” Eventually, Page and Brin convinced her to join their team. Wojcicki was the first woman to take maternity leave in the nascent days of Google. “When I first started I don’t think we really had an HR department. So it wasn’t really clear.” She said, “‘Hey Larry, hey Sergey, I’m going to take a little time off … Nobody had ever done it before at the company.'” Fast Forward nearly two decades and she’s helped lead the charge on family leave at Google — for men and women — which now offers new mothers 18 weeks of paid leave and new fathers 12 weeks. Google certainly isn’t the only company in Silicon Valley offering lengthy periods of paid time off for new parents. Companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Netflix all generous new parental leave policies last year. Facebook now offers four months paid leave to new mothers and fathers. In making the announcement, Facebook’s VP of People, Lori Goler, posted: “Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, outcomes are better for the children and families.” So why have tech companies seemingly led the way on parental leave? “I think Silicon Valley has led on this because Silicon Valley, at the end of the day, is really focused on talent,” Wojcicki said. “It’s a talent business, getting the right engineers, the right leaders … And Silicon Valley is also focused on having more women, more diversity.” But there’s still a long way to go. Wojcicki is perturbed by the dearth of women in top technology jobs in Silicon Valley. Only 26% of all tech jobs in the U.S. are held by women. At Google, 31% of global employees are women. And just 24% of leadership positions and 19% of tech roles are held by women. “I see tech as … a force that is changing pretty much all parts of our society,” Wojcicki argues. “It’s really sad for me that we don’t have enough women that are part of that. I compare this to the revolution where people were able to read and write for the first time, and the printing press. I think it is that big, in terms of how much our society is being changed.” Last year, Time Magazine dubbed Wojcicki “the most powerful woman on the internet.” Like so many working parents, Wojcicki is juggling a big job — and a big family. And she says that being a mother has actually helped her do her job better. She credits her children with priceless user feedback on what YouTube is doing well — and where the platform could improve. “I try to watch my kids behavior, and I try to get insights from that, and understand how are they thinking about media, what are they watching. Then I try to marry that with quantitative data that we have in the office.” And she feels a responsibility to change the narrative, and the statistics, on girls and women in technology across the country. “One of the things that I’m trying to do is use the position that I’m in … to encourage the next generation of girls to think about the internet as a career opportunity.” Her gender has in no way held Wojcicki back from excelling — but she sees the path that she took as far too narrow for too many women. “You see a lot of powerful women on the internet,” Wojcicki said, “but I wish there were more. I think the internet really could use a lot more women.” And Wojcicki wants everyone to remember the contributions women have made to technology. “I think people have forgotten the role that early women played in computer science and [the first computer programmer] Ada Lovelace is a great example of that.” Fitbit stock tanks 30% on lousy sales Facebook nears 2 billion users Related Posts Attorney General Kelly Cautions PA Residents about Storm-related Consumer Issues and Scams Sankey Speaks at Small Business Day Overachiever Mark Zuckerberg finishes his year-long running challenge 5 months early Google new CFO and her $70 million pay package Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Blog :  On-Premises Can Be Just as Effective as On-Cloud Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar Gen-Z Consortium Preps High-Speed Memory Interconnect Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 02 Nov, 2016          |         |     Share 9 Rules for Digital Transformation in the Enterprise Sometime shortly after the turn of this decade, IT organizations should witness the arrival of servers capable of maximizing a new generation of high-speed nonvolatile memory that is supposed to begin arriving next year. A Gen-Z Consortium formed by AMD, ARM, Cavium Inc., Cray, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Huawei, IBM, IDT, Lenovo, Mellanox Technologies, Micron, Microsemi, Red Hat, Samsung, Seagate, SK hynix, Western Digital Corporation, and Xilinx is working on a new high-speed interconnect based on a specification due out later this year. Gen-Z Consortium president Kurtis Bowman, who is also the director of server solutions in the office of the CTO at Dell EMC, says that specification will then be used to create a new open memory interconnect in the form of a proof-of-concept in 2017. Production of the new memory connect would then move forward in 2018, resulting in servers using that memory bus most likely arriving by 2020, says Bowman. Capable of supporting several hundred GB/s of bandwidth to provide access to sub-100 nanosecond memory such as the 3D X Point memory technology that Intel and Micron are developing, the memory interconnect technology being proposed by the Gen-Z consortium is at the very least intriguing because it provides a crucial missing piece in the quest to shrink the data center. As more primary storage moves into the memory, the overall density of the data center environment can increase dramatically because both the number of physical servers and storage devices can theoretically be sharply reduced. Bowman says the new memory interconnect will be designed to support both multiple types of processors and nonvolatile memory. Of course, that may also account for why Intel has not yet elected to join the effort. Given its investment in 3D X Point, it’s probable that Intel is investing in developing its own advanced memory interconnect technology. Intel is also absent from an OpenCAPI Consortium that has pledged to develop open interfaces by 2017 that more tightly couple different classes of co-processors with main CPUs. That effort is being led by AMD, Dell EMC, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Mellanox Technologies, Micron, NVIDIA and Xilinx. The one thing that everybody does seem to agree on is that multicore processors and advanced forms of nonvolatile memory will soon transform IT. “Faster memory connects will turn on the innovation ignition,” says Ron Noblett, vice president of advanced architecture development in the CTO Organization of HPE. “The amount of memory available per core today is actually less than it was in 2003.” Whatever form that innovation takes, the one thing IT organizations can count on is that the data center as a whole will not only be a lot smaller in terms of space and energy consumed than today; it will also provide orders of magnitude more performance.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Cloud How DreamHost Builds Its Cloud: The Future November 2, 2016 Written by Luke Odom This is the seventh and last in a series of posts about how DreamHost builds its Cloud products. Written by Luke Odom straight from the data center operations.  Welcome to the last post in the “building a cloud” series! In this post, we’re going to look at where we are going next. Technology is always moving forward. Processors, hard drives, memory, and networking technologies are ever-evolving and getting faster, smaller, and more power efficient. Now that the cluster is designed and implemented, we are constantly looking at ways we can improve both the current cluster and future clusters. Here are a few upgrades you might see coming to DreamCompute soon! Since the release of our new DreamCompute cluster, Intel has released a new generation of their x5-2600 processors. The new Broadwell processors are an upgrade of the Haswell processors we currently deployed—but with smaller transistors, giving us the same amount of power but with less wattage and less heat output. AMD Zen is also expected out this year. Zen is a significant update from the server chips currently sold by AMD, which were released in 2012. We will be keeping a close eye on Zen and may consider it for DreamCompute if the price and performance is right. On the drive side, NVMe drive prices are rapidly going down and will be on par with SATA drives soon. As soon as prices drop sufficiently, we will move to NVMe as it’s a more optimal SSD interface than SATA or SAS. Based on the current market, we expect to be moving to NVMe some time next year. However, many of our SSD vendors are already phasing out Enterprise SATA SSDs and replacing the models with NVMe so the transition may be much sooner. With faster processors and faster NVMe drives, we would need to consider using a faster networking technology to connect the machines. The next bump in speed would be to move to 40 Gbps. There is a standard for fiber, Twinax, and ethernet that is 40 Gbps, but there is only fiber and twinax widely available on the market. The final thing we are looking at to improve DreamCompute—expansion to other locations. Having availability in our Portland facility will probably be our next step. After that, it will depend on where the most customer demand is. We’ve now come to the end of the “building a cloud” series of blog posts.

FILE PHOTO , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By FROM REGISTER NEWS SERVICE REPORTS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Chipmaker Broadcom is buying Brocade in a deal valued at approximately $5.5 billion. Brocade shareholders will receive $12.75 per share, a 13 percent premium to the Tuesday closing prices of the computer networking company. The deal, which also also includes $400 million in debt, comes less than a year after Broadcom Ltd. Chief Executive Hock Tan, then CEO of Avago Technologies Ltd., closed on the chipmaker’s more than $30 billion purchase of Irvine-based Broadcom. Tan has orchestrated at least six transactions valued at more than $100 million over the past five years. Only semiconductor heavyweights like Intel Corp. have been more active on the M&A front, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This probably won’t be the last deal we see from Broadcom, now based in San Jose, and its CEO. On a conference call to discuss the Brocade deal, he said he doesn't think the company has reached a point where it says it’s done with deals and it can be flexible about addressing opportunities when they show up. Broadcom Ltd. plans to sell Brocade’s IP Networking business, which includes wireless and campus networking, data center switching and routing and software networking solutions. Brocade CEO Lloyd Carney said the company will work with Broadcom to try to find a buyer for the IP Networking business. The deal, targeted to close in the second half of Broadcom’s fiscal 2017, is not conditioned on the sale of the IP Networking business. It still needs approval from shareholders of Brocade Communications Systems Inc.

And while the stock market is pretty much a bottomless well of material, the House of Saud is giving it a run for its money. Every time I think about their idiotic oil policy, another article springs to life. Today, I'm wondering: What did they think would happen? The great plan to crush oil prices, secure their own market share, kill U.S. shale production, and force OPEC members in line has been a complete failure. The only thing they've managed to get right is the "crush prices" part. They've certainly not killed the U.S. shale industry. Hurt it, yes. Something like 80 U.S. oil companies have gone out of business. But the oil is still there and will get pumped by stronger hands.  How did they miss the fact that Permian Basin oil is profitable around $30 a barrel? I don't know, seems like a pretty significant oversight.  To be fair, I'll grant that the Saudis may have gained a couple points of market share. But at what cost? You can't make up the lost revenue on volume. They're pumping as much as they can. And they've blown a massive hole in their budget. Deficits were $98 billion last year, and should be around $87 billion this year. Plus, they've had to spend $170 billion of their savings, roughly 23%. And debt to GDP has gone from 2% in 2013 to around 20% today. There's just no way you can look at those numbers and not think "disaster." But the funniest part to me has been the whole production cut fiasco that the Saudis have tried to orchestrate. It definitely looks like a face-saving move to me. The Saudis want prices higher, but they don't want to admit that they made a mistake. If anything, the Saudis have lost power in OPEC, not gained it. Eye for an Eye It was assumed that Saudi Arabia wanted to put the squeeze on Iran when they boosted production and cut prices. Iran was just about to re-enter the global oil market, and the Saudi didn't want them suddenly flush with cash. In addition to Iran, the Saudis screwed over every OPEC member. Look at Venezuela. Sure, it's never had a healthy economy. But today it's on the brink of total collapse. And it's the Saudis' oil policy that pushed it over the edge.  So now, the Saudis want to throw OPEC a bone and get oil production in line and prices higher. Only other OPEC countries don't want to play ball. In a perfect act of retribution, both Iran and Iraq want production cut exemptions. They are both basically saying, "You want prices higher, you cut production." Iraq has been steadily raising its production to pre-war levels. That extra production is a bit like gravy. For Iran, it's all gravy, because they haven't been able to sell oil at all. Talk about a miscalculation — it might be true that both Iran and Iraq are better able to deal with low oil prices than the Saudis! Pride is now at play in the OPEC production cut dealings. So I have no doubt that more article-worthy material is on the way.  The Best Free Investment You'll Ever Make Stay on top of the hottest investment ideas before they hit Wall Street.

You know I like to write "digest" style articles, hitting a few different topics in one article. Well, here goes... ****Keep on semiconductor stocks. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) bought out Avago earlier this year, and now the powerhouse is taking out Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD). Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) just announced a $110 buyout price for NXP Semi (NASDAQ: NXPI). NXP does near-field communications (NFC), chips that broadcast in a small range. These are the chips that just appeared on credit and debit cards. NFC will also be very important when the Internet of Things (IoT) really gets going.  It makes me wonder what Intel is doing. It is missing the mobile communications chip boom in a big way. And as cars go automated, this a huge opportunity that Intel is also behind on. So, keep an eye on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia has a lot of potential in the driverless car space. That's why it keeps hitting new highs.  Also, Cypress Semi (NASDAQ: CY) has been getting some buyout interest around $14. It's at $10 now and pays a 4.4% dividend.  ****My election barometer stock Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) just threw a curveball. I've been watching it because it's a biotech, and biotechs have been in the crapper since presidential hopeful Clinton attacked drug pricing. Investors worry that Clinton will try to reel in prices, hurting biotech profits. I've theorized that strength in biotech/Gilead suggests that investors are now comfortable that valuations are in line with the worst that a potential Clinton presidency could do.  But Gilead missed earnings last night. The stock is down, and it may be losing its usefulness. Still, I'm watching the $73 level. If that holds, we may see some more upside action for biotech. ****Q3 GDP came in looking good at 2.9%. But don't forget, health care spending is included in this. So as we spend more and more on insurance, GDP improves. But real spending on stuff that we want isn't improving. This might not be widely understood by the general population, but it's an issue for the stock market. In fact, it might be the biggest issue for the long term. Consumer spending is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. You just don't want to see discretionary dollars being diverted to things like health insurance premiums. ****Twitter's (NYSE: TWTR) business is actually improving. Last week, the company beat earnings expectations and grew monthly user numbers. Not by much, mind you, but anything is good at this point. I don't know if you use Twitter, but as an investor, you should. The traders, money managers, and analysts that share their work on Twitter are top-notch. It's a really great and useful community. And it looks like Twitter management has figured this out... I understand that it is going after Yahoo! Finance, with soon-to-be-released stocks charts and other stuff. My experience of Twitter management is that they haven't been very responsive to what their users want. This move would mark a change in that attitude. I know I've recommended Twitter stock higher than it is now, but I'll say it again: around $18, it looks pretty good. And if you want to follow me on Twitter, here's where you can.

According to the New York Times, chipmaker Broadcom has agreed to snap up Brocade Communications Systems, which makes routers and other networking gear, for a reported $5.5 billion. Broadcom makes computer chips for a long list of tech heavyweights, including Intel and Apple. Broadcom itself was bought up by Avago in 2015, and Avago then changed its name to Broadcom. This latest deal comes among a flurry of mergers: Qualcomm just bought chipmaker NXP for $38 billion last week, right after NXP merged with Freescale Semiconductor in a $12 billion deal, and Japan’s Softbank shocked the tech world this past summer by snapping up British chipmaker ARM for $32 billion. What’s driving all the dealmaking? Analysts say the rise of the “internet of things” is helping to fuel chip demand, because all those “smarty things” – which eventually, will be every “thing” – will all need little computer chip brains. And that’s a lot of chips. Why stick with 7 when 10 is such a 10? Microsoft is pushing users to upgrade to Windows 10, and they just made the decision easier by announcing they will no longer sell Windows 7 Pro and 8.1 to PC system builders. Halloween marked the cutoff date for Win7 Pro and 8.1, while no cutoff date has been specified for Windows 10. That might seem obvious, but Microsoft has said that Windows 10 will be the “last” version of Windows they’ll make. Whether that means the next Microsoft PC OS will be a clean-sheet effort not called Windows, or Windows 10 will become an endlessly evolving platform, sort of like Apple has done with MacOS, remains to be seen. But for the moment, if you’re still hanging on to that dusty copy of Windows 7 Pro, you might want to just concede and pull the trigger on Redmond’s latest and greatest. Adobe’s Sensei A.I. won’t tell you to sweep the leg With A.I. being the hot topic in cutting edge tech, it might surprise you to learn about some unlikely places it’s popping up. Case in point: Adobe and their AI tech, called Sensei. The maker of industry standard software including Photoshop and Premiere says future updates will include help from Sensei that will streamline tedious tasks and make advanced operations, such as cleanly altering facial features, easier to accomplish. So when will Sensei arrive in a Creative Cloud update? Adobe says its already present in some tools in the current versions of Photoshop and Premiere, and will be coming to more apps soon. Adobe is expected to give a big demo showing Sensei being used in Photoshop next week, and we’ll be watching closely, especially when its used in a feature called “Face Aware Liquify.”

While Lenovo did just recently release the Miix 510, an upgraded successor to last year’s Miix 700, WinFuture reports that the upcoming Miix 720 will offer further improved specs. Specifically, the 12-inch is getting a higher-resolution 2880 x 1920 screen, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB SSD. And even more importantly, Lenovo is also updating the processor options to Intel’s latest seventh-generation i3, i5, and i7 Kaby Lake models. the Miix 720 charges via USB-C, but keeps two legacy USB ports WinFuture also claims that the Miix 720 will update its port selection, joining the Miix 510 in adding a USB-C port (that’s also used to charge the device). Unlike other recent laptops, like Apple’s MacBook and new MacBook Pro models, the Miix 720 will also offer two legacy USB ports. And similar to the earlier Miix and Yoga models, Lenovo is keeping its signature watchband hinge on the kickstand. We still don’t know when the Miix 720 will release, or how much it will cost, but with this much information already leaked out, it probably won’t be too long before an official unveiling from Lenovo.

How Apple blew the MacBook name game CNET 11/2/2016 Sean Hollister © Provided by CNETJames Martin/CNET, edited by Kelly Nelson/CNET Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not represent the views of MSN or Microsoft. One word could have made all the difference. Popular Searches Audi AG AUDVF ▼ 656.20 -11.30 -1.69% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS ▼ 56.71 -4.18 -6.86% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% LGL Group Inc LGL ▲ 4.49 +0.18 +4.28% "Air," instead of "Pro."  If Apple had introduced a new MacBook Air last week, the company wouldn't be facing down a mob of angry creative professionals. It might not have Apple software developers questioning whether the company has lost its way. Because the new MacBook Pro basically is a MacBook Air -- the most impressive Air ever made. Let's rewind time for a moment. It's Thursday, October 27, and Apple's event is under way. Imagine that instead of introducing the new MacBook Pro, Apple unveiled a new MacBook Air. One that's 12 percent lighter, 13 percent smaller by volume and practically the same weight -- but manages to cram in a faster Intel processor, faster graphics, plus the far sharper, brighter and more colorful Retina Display the MacBook Air so desperately needed. Sure, it starts at $1,500 rather than $1,000, but you get twice the solid-state storage for the price -- and you can double the RAM, quadruple the storage and get the awesome new Touch Bar secondary screen with Touch ID fingerprint sensor if you're willing to pay even more. How long has your MacBook Air had a 1.6GHz processor? This new one is 2.0GHz or 2.9GHz; there's even a 3.3GHz option. And sure, it's got a thinner keyboard and only two (or four) general-purpose Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of handy full-size USB ports and SD card slots. But we, Apple, figured you'd rather have a more accurate keyboard and amazing single-cable Thunderbolt 3 docking options to go with your mobile MacBook Air lifestyle. Now, you can pull your MacBook Air right out of your manila envelope and plug in a single cable to charge it, dock with your peripherals and power multiple monitors all at the same time. Oh, and one more thing: we knew you'd like the MacBook Air so much, we built a 15-inch model. You won't believe how fast it is -- this Air has a quad-core CPU that's 50 percent faster than last year's MacBook Pro! The graphics are over twice as fast, and yet we've kept the same 10 hour battery life as the 13-inch version. If you've ever wanted to edit photos or home videos on a MacBook Air, this computer's for you. Oh, and it comes standard with the Touch Bar and Touch ID, too. We think you're going to love the new MacBook Air. It's the best MacBook we've ever made. Everything I just said is true of Apple's new laptops. But all of it describes the new MacBook Pro, not the MacBook Air. Apple chose to market a thinner Pro instead of a faster Air, even though they're basically the same thing. And that's not lost on Apple -- it was Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller who suggested the 13-inch MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) was designed for MacBook Air buyers. (That's him in the pictures above.) "We think that a lot of potential MacBook Air customers are going to be very excited by this product, too," said Schiller. But the choice between a thinner Pro and a faster Air isn't just semantics -- the word "Pro" carries weight. The new MacBook Pro is not for pros, and pros know it.

Staples announced today to release the Staples Black Friday 2016 ad through their shopping app on November 6. The Staples Black Friday 2016 deals will be available on online starting Thanksgiving Day. Stores are closed on Thanksgiving Day as previously announced by the office supply retailer.

We have to wait to find out which model the laptop is and its other specifications. The Staples Black Friday 2016 sale will begin online on Thanksgiving Day. This concept of Black Friday is a sane way, but many of the large retailer stick to their plans of also opening stores on Thanksgiving Day.  The releasing of Black Friday ads through shopping apps is getting more common.

We thought Apple would conclude the wait with a laptop that would last with us for years, but instead we got a transitional device that bridges the perpetual gap between present and future with the metal corpses of (almost) every useful port we now use and rely on. Apple’s position is clear: you either sign up for its vision of wireless and USB-C communications dominating everything, or you go elsewhere. For those adventurous MacBook users who are now finding themselves more open to exploring Windows waters, here’s a quick rundown of the top alternatives to Apple’s new, port-less MacBook Pro. Dell XPS 13 Dell This laptop is the most obvious and direct alternative to the MacBook Pro. Dell’s 13-inch XPS 13 has a wonderfully minimal bezel around the display, a great keyboard, good trackpad, solid construction, and attractive design. Its battery life stretches up to 10 hours and it has recently been upgraded with Intel’s 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) processors, a generation ahead of Apple’s latest MacBook Pros. Handsome, affordable, and a proven design that won’t spring any surprises: there’s very little wrong about the Dell XPS 13. It can be had with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and that lovely gold shell above for $1,199. To get it with a high-resolution (3,200 x 1,800) touchscreen display, you’d have to step up to $1,449, but that’s still $50 less than the MBP and it manages to fit an SD card reader and two regular USB ports alongside the Thunderbolt 3 connector. Razer Blade Stealth Razer This one, I’m less confident about, but it sure is a stunning piece of machinery, isn’t it? Razer’s 12.5-inch Blade Stealth is the gaming gear maker’s first ultrabook, and it does the whole aluminum unibody thing in a gorgeous matte black highlighted by the company’s signature Chroma keyboard backlighting. You can have it with a Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) display, a Kaby Lake CPU, 256GB of storage, regular USB and a Thunderbolt 3-capable USB-C for $1,250. Now, granted, the Blade Stealth is kind of in a funny position with its own lack of an SD card slot, and its battery life won’t rival the MacBook Pro’s, but Razer’s secret weapon with this laptop is the ability to plug it into the company’s Core box. For another $400, the Core lets you hook up a full desktop graphics card to the Blade Stealth, which raises it gaming ceiling exponentially, lending this laptop a unique advantage that many in its category lack. HP Spectre x360 Props to my colleague Dan Seifert for calling this one out as a very attractive escape route for dissatisfied MacBook users. HP’s newly updated 13-inch Spectre x360 has an edge-to-edge display much like Dell’s XPS 13, but it also has a fully rotating hinge like Lenovo’s Yogas. It’s got a quad-speaker array, and HP makes some terrific claims about it lasting up to 15 hours on a single charge — even if it only achieves two-thirds of that claim, it seems likely to be able to keep you productive through a whole day’s work. At 2.85lbs (1.29kg), the 13.3-inch HP Spectre x360 is lighter than Apple’s corresponding new MacBook Pro. It also has two USB-C ports, but HP doesn’t forget to include a regular USB one "for added flexibility." Alas, this super thin and light computer does lack an SD card slot, so you’d have to go to the 4lbs (1.81kg), 15-inch model to have that photographer-favored port. Still, with prices starting at $1,159, there’s a lot of headroom to max out a Spectre x360’s spec before reaching even the entry-level MacBook Pro’s cost. Worth considering. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga I saw this laptop at IFA 2016, and The Verge’s Tom Warren reviewed it very recently. Our shared conclusion? The ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a couple of foibles, but its OLED display is easily among the very best we’ve seen on a laptop. Spanning a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 and including touch capabilities, it’s pretty close to our ideal laptop display. Being a Yoga laptop also means this one can rotate a full 360-degrees, which doesn’t matter on a daily basis but is a nice extra to have. Apple’s MacBooks have always opened to just a little bit past vertical, which can be problematic when they’re used in bed or in any other circumstances that are less than ideal. Now, buying into this OLED futurism isn’t cheap, and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga with OLED starts at $1,682 right now, but I’d say this is a much more enticing use of the technology than Apple’s thin strip of it above the keyboard (aka the Touch Bar). Microsoft Surface Book Well, it couldn’t be a roundup of the best Windows computers without one from Microsoft, now could it? The newly refreshed Surface Book has more of everything: more power, longer battery life, and a higher price. Kicking off at a mighty $2,399, this 13.5-inch laptop includes a stylus and a touchscreen along with an SD card slot and some trusty old USB ports. The display is detachable from the base, and there’s a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics chip to amp things up. The biggest advantage of this upgraded Surface Book is Microsoft’s claimed 16 hours of battery life, which is an extraordinarily long endurance by any laptop category’s standards. And it doesn’t weigh all that much, either, at 3.63lbs (1.65kg). As its screen size, weight, and price suggest, the Surface Book sits somewhere between Apple’s 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, but it offers plenty of functionality (and ports) that Apple’s new computers lack.

Richard Florida @Richard_Florida Nov 1, 2016 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet LEGO statues for the South by South Lawn Festival of ideas, arts, and action are seen at the White House in Washington. (Gary Cameron/Reuters) In today’s knowledge economy, science and technology are prerequisites for economic success. But which states are America’s science and technology leaders? A new report, the State Technology and Science Index, from Ross DeVol and his colleagues at the Milken Institute, illuminates the great divide separating America’s leading and lagging states, ranking all 50 of them on an updated State Technology and Science Index (STSI) based on dozens of indicators spanning five broad categories: research and development, entrepreneurship and risk capital, human capital, the scientific and technological workforce, and the concentration and dynamism of high-tech industries. (Taylor Blake) The map above by Taylor Blake of the Martin Prosperity Institute shows the broad pattern. The leading states, in deep purple, are mainly in the Northeast and West Coast, with Minnesota, Utah, Colorado, and Texas also scoring highly. The table below lists the top ten states on the STSI. Massachusetts tops the list, followed by Colorado, Maryland, California, and Washington. Connecticut, Minnesota, Utah, Virginia, and Delaware complete the top 10. There has been some shuffling of positions on the list, as the table shows. Rank State STSI Previous Rank 1 Massachusetts 83.67 1 2 Colorado 80.40 4 3 Maryland 80.31 2 4 California 75.94 3 5 Washington 71.84 6 6 Connecticut 71.05 9 7 Minnesota 69.58 12 8 Utah 69.14 5 9 Virginia 65.88 7 10 Delaware 65.38 10 The next map shows the change in position of states from 2014 to 2016. Wyoming saw the biggest improvement, rising ten spots from 46th to 36th, while New York and Vermont saw the largest declines, the former falling from seventh to 15th, the latter declining from 18th to 26th. (Taylor Blake) The study finds a close association between a state’s technology and scientific capability as measured by the STSI and a state’s economic success. The chart below shows the association between real high-tech economic output per capita and the STSI Index across the 50 states. The report points out that overall the STSI predicts about 75 percent of the variance in real high-tech GDP per worker. And once the study factors out the outlier effects of Oregon and Washington, whose tech economies are driven largely by two companies, Intel and Microsoft, respectively, the explanatory power gets closer to 90 percent. (Milken Institute) So what kinds of states do better in science and technology? There are certain basic characteristics that distinguish more technologically and scientifically innovative states from those that are less so. To get at this, my colleague Charlotta Mellander ran a basic correlation analysis between the Milken Institute’s STSI measure and key economic, demographic and political characteristics of the 50 U.S. states. Economists have long argued that science and technology are generators of wealth. So it’s not surprising to see that states with higher scores on the STSI are also wealthier. The STSI is positively associated with wages (0.77), income (0.61), and economic output per capita (.49). More educated states also do better on science and technology. There is an even closer connection between the STSI and the share of adults who are college grads (.84). More innovative states are not only more affluent and educated, they are healthier and fitter as well. The STSI is positively associated with both overall well-being (.48) and the share of the population that engages in regular exercise (.59). That said, these same states are also more expensive to live in; the STSI is higher in states with more expensive housing (with a correlation of .49). The kind of work people do factors in as well. The STSI is highly correlated with the share of the workforce who make up knowledge, professional, and creative workers (.80), and negatively associated with the share that are members of the blue-collar working class (-.59). The reality is that some kinds of creative and innovative work are more highly connected to the science and technology capabilities of states than others. It’s not surprising to see that states with greater concentrations of computer scientists and mathematicians are more innovative (with a correlation of .83), as these are the kinds of occupations required to staff science and technology organizations. The STSI is also closely associated with the share of business and finance occupations (.80) and engineering and architecture occupations (.57). What is perhaps more surprising is the close connection between the arts and the scientific and technological capabilities of states. Indeed, the STSI is more closely associated with the share of workers in arts, culture and entertainment occupations (.53) than it is with the share of the workforce that is comprised of scientists (.41). Many states have invested in educational and medical institutions, so-called “eds and meds,” as a way to build up their high-tech capabilities and spur economic development. But, we find no statistical association whatsoever between the STSI and the share of workers in eds and meds occupations. Another thing that matters is openness to diversity. I’ve long argued that innovation turns on tolerance and diversity. Scientists and technologists come from all backgrounds and ways of life. Many are immigrants. Openness to diversity is a feature that enables places to attract top scientific and technical talent across the aboard. The STSI is positively associated with both the share of the population that is foreign-born (.45) and the share that identify as LGBT (.40). Urbanization plays a role too. Urbanists have long argued that innovation requires density. More urbanized states are also more innovative. The STSI is positively associated with the share of a state’s population that lives in urban areas (.55) and negatively associated with the share that drives alone to work, a proxy measure for sprawl (-.30). This stands in contrast to the older notion that innovation and high-tech industries grow up in suburban office parks and nerdistans like those of California’s Silicon Valley or in the suburbs along Route 128 outside Boston. Indeed, my own research has found high-tech startups coming back in large numbers to urban centers in order to attract talent. Innovation at the state level also reflects America’s long running political and cultural divides. Liberal, blue states are more innovative than conservative, red ones. The STSI is positively associated with the share of voters who voted for Obama (.48) and who currently favor Hillary Clinton (.56). They’re negatively associated with the share of voters who voted for Romney (-.48) and favor Trump (-.64). The sociologist Max Weber long ago argued that the growth and development of Western nations was tied to their “Protestant work ethic.” But today religiosity appears to be a fetter on innovation. The correlation between the STSI and religiosity, measured as the percent of the population who say they are “very religious,” is negative (-.40). More innovative states are also more highly taxed states, with the STSI being positively correlated with state income taxes per capita (.45). Building a state knowledge economy which requires public funding for universities and research institutes. Spending for urban infrastructure is another expensive investment, but one that ultimately pays off in the form of greater scientific and technological capability as well as higher wages and incomes. Ultimately, the science and technology capabilities of states not only reflect, but underpin America’s underlying economic, political, and cultural divides. Our most technologically advanced states are bluer, denser, more expensive, more diverse and richer, while those that lag in science and technology are redder, more working class, and falling further behind in the knowledge economy.

News & Analysis Anticipating a More Virtual Moores Law Alan Patterson 11/2/2016 00:00 AM EDT 5 comments 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — Nicky Lu, executive director of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association, is looking forward to the coming era of a “virtual” Moore’s Law, leading to a resumption of growth and profitability in the chip industry. Nicky Lu “There will be another 30 years of growth for the semiconductor industry,” Lu predicted in an interview with EE Times. “We are going to see ‘effective’ 1nm. Moore’s Law will become a ‘virtual’ Moore’s Law. The industry needs a boost. From 1995 to 2008, the sector delivered a 7 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and a total return to shareholders nearly three times that of the overall stock market, management consultancy McKinsey notes in a 2015 report. Now, the story is much different. Although some semiconductor players continue to thrive and gobble up smaller competitors, overall growth and revenue have declined. The semiconductor industry can break out of stagnation at around $400 billion in annual revenue to achieve $1 trillion at 1nm, according to Lu. In his paper entitled “A New Silicon Way” that will be presented at the IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference on November 7 in Toyama, Japan, Lu outlines a transition to a new generation beyond the limitations of traditional linear scaling on silicon. There is evidence that linear scaling has already reached its physical limits. “People say they are doing 10nm process modes, but you will not find any line widths at that level,” Lu says. Departing Flatland That’s why technology development has gone non-linear. In 2011, Intel announced its Tri-gate technology, leading the way from planar development of transistors on silicon into three dimensions. With 3D, even scaling by a factor of 0.85 results in a transistor density that is more like 0.5 scaling in two dimensions, Lu says. Other companies have followed that trend. Toshiba built 3D NAND in 48 layers, and that memory has been used in Apple’s iPhone 7. Samsung has taken the idea a step further with the creation of a 64-layer flash memory device. The technology level was only 32nm, yet it was the virtual equivalent of 13nm, Lu notes. “Now we are in silicon age 2.0 with vertical transistors and a scaling parameter of 0.8 to 0.85,” Lu says. “Silicon 3.0 is like a 3D landscape. We are seeing more and more people going there.” Lu says that his theory, as described in his paper, starts with Silicon 4.0. The advances from the current 3.0 generation have enabled a lot of new applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality and machine intelligence, he says. The next threshold is what Lu calls heterogeneous integration, or the incorporation of silicon and non-silicon materials by means of technologies such as integrated fan out (InFO). To InFO and Beyond InFO is a packaging technology developed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to put bonding pads on the edge of silicon, eliminating the need for a interconnecting substrate. InFO provides a 20% reduction in package thickness, a 20% speed gain and 10% better thermal performance. Infineon developed the technology in 2008 as embedded wafer-level ball grid array (eWLB,) to cut cost and package thickness while boosting component integration. However, yield problems impeded adoption of the new technology up until TSMC’s commercialization of InFO. (Source: TSMC) “This new InFO structure is what will lead heterogeneous integration to Silicon 4.0,” Lu says. “Another innovation is through interconnect via (TIV), which is like a pillar connecting the die to the outside. So you have both horizontal and vertical interconnect, both outside the silicon. That’s key for the continuation of heterogeneous integration. In the past, we couldn’t do TIV because we didn’t have InFO technology.” With InFO, silicon will connect directly with parts such as lenses, sensors or actuators that are currently built into systems and haven’t yet been miniaturized, according to Lu. “That’s heterogeneous integration of silicon and non-silicon using InFO,” Lu says. “All of these parts today are sitting on a printed circuit board, burning a lot of power. We are still five orders of magnitude away from optimal power consumption.” That’s where Lu sees new potential for foundries, silicon designers and system houses to cooperate. Silicon is a $300 billion industry, but consumer electronics is a $1.6 trillion industry, he notes. System makers will need heterogenous integration to create smaller devices with lower power consumption, according to Lu.  “There should be a very smooth transition to these new technologies because we are still two generations away from the end of Moore’s Law,” Lu says. “Tri-gate, 3D NAND and InFO have come very smoothly. Silicon will scale down to 5nm with performance like 1nm.” Email This Print Comment More Related Links Chip Veterans Scan Horizon Electronica: CEO Forum Rambles on IoT Security, Safety Chip Forecast Rises Through 2017 ASML Invests $1.9B in Next-Gen EUV U.S. Needs Big Bet on Chips Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author scaling apaDAV   11/8/2016 1:10:15 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate If we did scale every dimension by a factor of 0.85 every generation, that would be 0.7225 in area. To achieve twice as many transistors we would also have to add 44.5% more transistor layers every generation or double their number every two generations. As of now I am not aware of any logic with more than one layer of transistors. The issue of power density is not solved but compounded, now you have to cool more more devices per area. The other option would be to add a new technology every few nodes, that make up for the lack of scaling. Sounds unrealistic to me.

Answering that question, the term 'virtual' is sometimes thrown about these days with little real consideration to its meaning in the term of software and electronic hardware systems. And marrying this oft misused term of virtual in a statement about Moore's Law makes those of us who appreciate precision in language wonder about the quality of that following argument.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Nov 2, 2016 at 10:31AM Image source: NVIDIA. With their stocks soaring in the last year, it's been an incredible time to be a shareholder of semiconductor stocks NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD data by YCharts. To see which stock looks like the better buy going forward, though, let's examine AMD's and NVIDIA's stock histories, the financial trends underpinning their recent rises, and the long-term outlook for their respective businesses to see which stock remains the better buy today. Advanced Micro Devices' investment thesis WIth the stock tripling in the past 12 months alone, investors clearly see a major opportunity ahead for AMD. As longtime second fiddles to rival Intel in the PC CPU market, AMD and NVIDIA have benefited mightily from a resurgence of interest in graphics-intensive computing in a number of markets. Specifically, AMD's move deeper into semi-custom graphics chips that ship into video game consoles has proven to be a boon for the company of late. Case in point: Revenue from its semi-custom chip segment increased about 5% in AMD's most recent quarter. However, I'm not so sure the rally in AMD stock can sustain itself. Looking to the bigger picture, several red flags emerge in AMD's business model that could conceivably reverse the recent GPU market share gains it has achieved. For starters, there is increasing competition in graphics chips, since NVIDIA -- traditionally the high-end vendor in the GPU market -- recently launched its GeForce GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti chips. These chips target the lower-cost segment of the market where AMD has recently been able to eke out some market share gain. The company's balance sheet isn't particularly impressive, either. AMD carries about $3.3 billion in total assets, compared to $2 billion in long-term debt. This isn't an acute issue, but interest payments on its debts do create one more headwind for a company still struggling to switch to profitability -- which is by no means the case for NVIDIA . Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA's investment thesis NVIDIA shares many of the same opportunities as AMD, but the company's long-held status as the premier graphics processing chipmaker has allowed it to branch this specialization into a number of emerging growth areas -- and to do so better than its rival. The rise of competitive gaming is one area that few -- myself included -- expected to grow into a major business, but NVIDIA's wares have become the leading chip for the professional gaming industry, which favors the computing power of PCs over consoles. Self-driving cars also serve as another emerging source of significant opportunity for NVIDIA, since they use many external sensors to gauge their surroundings and behave accordingly. Strange as it may sound, discerning in real time whether the object next to it is a person riding a bike or a car requires a tremendous amount of graphics processing power, for which NVIDIA has also created a series of turnkey solutions. NVIDIA enjoys a similar opportunity in big data and AI visualization, but by now, hopefully you see a trend. The general direction of computing and technology is toward more graphics-intensive activities, and NVIDIA stands to be the beneficiary of this movement, perhaps more than any other company. Equally compelling is the fact that NVIDIA is also profitable and enjoys a strong balance sheet. Its 47 times P/E ratio makes the company about twice as expensive as the broader market. However, given the generational nature of some of NVIDIA's opportunities, the company could easily outgrow that valuation for investors willing to hold its stock over the long term. Better buy: NVIDIA Hopefully, the likely winner in this scenario is abundantly clear. NVIDIA has the better business model, technological leadership, and a stronger balance sheet, and it has already achieved profitability. What's more, NVIDIA's move into some areas that have driven AMD's recent success threatens to derail AMD's growth story before the company can flip to profitability. Here, the conclusion is obvious. NVIDIA is the better semiconductor stock for investors to buy today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Nvidia.
