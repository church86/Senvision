Would you buy this? Yes 10 No 1 Price $ 359.00 (AUD) The $359 hexa-core AMD Ryzen 5 1600X processor is here to challenge Intel’s quad-core, $350 Core i5-7600K for the honour of being “The People’s CPU.” Everyone likes to read about expensive, gold-plated, $1000 parts, but in the real world, most people can’t or won’t spend that much and are looking for the best price-to-performance ratio. While Ryzen 5 1600X may not have clock speeds as high as the Core i5-7600K’s, it does offer additional cores and virtual cores. We’ve run a battery of benchmarks to see if those cores will make up the difference. Gordon Mah Ung AMD’s Ryzen 5 1600X will compete head-on with Intel’s Core 5-7600K in the all-important $350(ish) CPU category. Meet Ryzen 5 AMD actually announced four Ryzen 5 CPUs last month. Two of them are quad-cores with SMT (simultaneous multithreading): The $245 Ryzen 5 1400 and the $275 Ryzen 5 1500X. The last two are six-core chips with SMT: The $319 Ryzen 5 1600 and the $359 Ryzen 5 1600X. [Related: Which CPU is best: Intel or AMD Ryzen?] [Related: Gigabyte Aorus GA-AX370-Gaming 5 AMD Ryzen AM4 motherboard review] All are based on the same die used in the upscale Ryzen 7 lineup we’ve already reviewed, but they have cores switched off. The one of most interest to us is the Ryzen 5 1600X. With its list price of $359, it maps almost perfectly to the Core i5-7600K, which has a current list price of $350 but can be had for nearer $320 if you shop around. The six-core and quad-core Ryzen CPUs are essentially built using the same eight-core dies from Ryzen 7. Each features two Core Complex (CCX) units with CPU cores switched off. One core on each is switched off for the six-core Ryzen 5s, and two cores on each are turned off for the quad-core CPUs. They also have different clock speeds. AMD Each Zen core complex is made up of four individual processors. AMD turns off some cores for the six-core and quad-core Ryzen 5 parts. How we tested For the Core i5-7600K, testing was conducted using the same system we used for the Core i7-7700K in our Ryzen 7 review, but with a few key changes. We updated the Asus ROG Maximus IV Code to the latest available BIOS, which basically adds Optane support. We also pulled two of four memory modules we had installed. This reduced the RAM from 32GB to 16GB of DDR4, but it also allowed us to increase the memory clock of our Corsair modules from DDR4/2133 to DDR4/2933 speeds. Ryzen 5 vs Core i5 Note that running Kaby Lake at higher speeds with all memory slots full isn’t an issue. Not all of the CPUs we tested (*cough* Ryzen), however, will easily support high clock speeds with all DIMM slots loaded. For the Ryzen 5 1600X, rather than re-use the previous AMD X370 build from the Ryzen 7 review, I used an MSI B350 Tomahawk motherboard. AMD provided the board, saying it had a newer BIOS that offered the best performance. A clean install of Windows 10 was loaded onto a Kingston 256GB HyperX SSD (the same model and capacity used in other test machines). For RAM, I used a pair of Geil EVO 8GB modules with the timing set to AMD’s specifications for testing on the Tomahawk board. As with all of our builds, we used Founders Edition GeForce GTX 1080 cards. I verified clock and RAM timings on each card before I began testing.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

Announced at a M|17 conference for users of open source MariaDB databases, Swarm64 CEO Karsten Rönner says the Swarm64 scalable data accelerator (SDA) is a storage engine for SQL databases that can be dropped in alongside existing storage engines employed in MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL databases. Instead of replacing existing databases with, for example, a new database that runs in-memory, Rönner says FPGAs make it possible to process SQL requests to run in real time against large amounts of data without having to move data into a different database platform. “We designed our storage engine to coexist with the existing storage engine,” says Rönner. In the future, Rönner says, Swarm64 expects to be able to make use of an Oracle Data Cartridge to provide the same capability for Oracle databases. Michael Strickland, architect and director for data center and storage business within the Intel Programmable Solutions Group, says Intel, following the acquisition of Altera, now has vested interest in making FPGAs a standard approach to accelerating application performance. In the initial form, that effort manifests itself in the form of an FPGA card. But Intel has already shown how it intends to package FPGAs and Intel Xeon processors together. Moving data to a new database platform is not an activity most IT organizations relish. If a new storage engine coupled with FPGAs forestalls the need to swap out an existing database, chances are then high that large numbers of IT organizations would prefer to simply add additional hardware versus going to the pain and trouble of implementing a new database.            |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 11, 2017 at 3:36PM Memory-chip prices rebounded in the second half of 2016 after slumping for two straight years. That recovery, which is expected to continue throughout this year, is mainly attributed to tighter supplies and rising demand among device makers. That's why many memory-chip stocks rallied over the past year. Let's look at three promising plays in this cyclical market -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) -- and see if they can continue rising in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology Micron is the third largest mobile DRAM and fourth largest NAND manufacturer in the world. It's arguably the most straightforward play on the memory-chip market for investors, since rivals such as Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital generally have more diversified businesses. Micron is currently developing next-gen memory technologies such as 3D NAND and 3DXPoint with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it's scaling up by buying smaller memory-chip makers such as Inotera Memories. Micron has a pretty high enterprise value of $40 billion, but it's frequently cited as a takeover target for Intel or China's state-backed Tsinghua Group. Tsinghua already tried to buy Micron once in 2015, but the deal was blocked by U.S. regulators on national-security concerns. Rising memory prices are expected to boost Micron's revenue by 58% to $19.6 billion this year. Its earnings are expected to surge from $0.06 per share in 2016 to $4.28. That growth is expected to continue, with 9% sales and 20% earnings growth in 2018. Shares of Micron already surged 160% over the past 12 months, and its P/E of 50 looks high, but it's easily justified by its earnings growth. Samsung Electronics Samsung is the world's largest manufacturer of DRAM and NAND chips. However, it's also a heavily diversified company that sells home appliances, consumer electronics, mobile devices, display panels, and other electronic components. Samsung's memory-chip revenues rose 10% to 37.9 trillion won ($33.3 billion) in fiscal 2016, accounting for 74% of its total semiconductor revenues and 19% of the company's top line. That made the semiconductor unit Samsung's fastest-growing business and offset Note 7-related declines at its mobile business. The higher margin of the semiconductor business also enabled it to bring in 47% of its operating profits -- which offset lower margins at its mobile and consumer electronics businesses. Unlike other leading memory-chip makers, Samsung has its own foundry, which enables it to maintain tighter control over its chips while keeping production costs low. Its production of other components such as displays also gives it bundling power with OEMs -- a strength that Micron and other smaller rivals lack. Wall Street expects Samsung's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 11% and 46% this year, as the new Galaxy S8, higher memory-chip sales, and stabilizing display demand help it move past its Note 7 debacle and ongoing corruption probe. Samsung still trades at just 11 times earnings, despite rallying nearly 50% over the past 12 months. Western Digital After acquiring SanDisk last year, Western Digital became the world's third largest manufacturer of NAND memory after Samsung and Toshiba. Before that, it purchased Hitachi's hard-drive unit, HGST -- which now handles most of WD's NAND assets -- as well as other flash-memory players such as Virident, STEC, VeloBit, Amplidata, and Skyera. Image source: SanDisk. All those moves diversified WD's business away from traditional hard disk drives, which were being displaced by flash memory-based solid-state drives. SSDs are more expensive, but they're faster, they're more power efficient, and they last longer because they didn't have any spinning platters. WD's aggressive expansion into the NAND market paid off. Its revenue, boosted by the SanDisk deal, is expected to rise 44% this year to $18.7 billion and grow another 2% in 2018. Its earnings are expected to jump 59% this year and 15% next year as its bigger scale reduce production costs. WD has rallied more than 80% over the past 12 months, but the stock trades at just 9 times forward earnings -- indicating that it still has room to run. But mind the long-term risks Some analysts have called the current spike in memory prices the start of an "ultra-super cycle" for the industry. But that doesn't signal an all-clear for Micron, Samsung, and Western Digital just yet. Last December, Micron warned that state-backed Chinese companies could flood the market with cheap memory chips in the near future, in the country's bid to build a domestic semiconductor industry. If that happens, memory prices would plummet -- which would help device makers and consumers but crush memory-chip makers. Investors should carefully weigh those risks before loading up on memory-chip stocks.  Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of Western Digital.

By Cianan Brennan Tuesday 11 Apr 2017, 9:30 PM 10 hours ago 21,186 Views 38 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3335949 Share Tweet Email8 The Intel Ireland plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare Source: Rollingnews.ie TECH GIANT INTEL is to close a pension scheme for its Irish workers in the coming months. The company’s Irish arm Intel Ireland today informed employees at its Leixlip, Co Kildare, base via email that the action will happen  from 1 July. Speaking in that email, general manager of Intel Ireland Eamonn Sinnott said that the current defined benefit scheme to which an estimated 2,500 of the company’s employees belong is “unsustainable”. “Our direct benefit costs have risen exponentially from 5.6% in 2001 to 15.9% to date,” Sinnott said. If we don’t take action now, these costs will further double to 30.1%. These increases are driven by factors beyond our control and are subject to further unpredictable increases in the future. Sinnott added that the company would be “contributing more than $100 million (€94.3 million)” towards preserving the benefits already built up by employees to date. Those employees who were in the defined benefit scheme will move to a defined contribution scheme instead from July. Defined benefit schemes are ones in which the final payoff is calculated by formula, and therefore fixed and known in advance. In defined contribution schemes, both the employer and the employee contribute to an investment fund which is used to buy a pension at retirement. While the latter is inherently less predictable than the defined benefit variant, such a move has become “quite commonplace among companies” in recent years according to Jerry Moriarty of the Irish Association of Pension Funds. Staff in Leixlip were this afternoon being briefed as to how exactly the pension cuts would affect their own funds. The defined benefit scheme at Intel had been in operation since the company’s arrival in Ireland 28 years ago. However, it had been closed to new employees since 2012. Last year Intel began the process of cutting 11% of its workforce, or 12,000 positions, worldwide, a move which saw roughly 500 redundancies in the Irish workforce.

X Intel shuts pension scheme for Irish staff US computer chip giant blames rapidly rising costs for decision to shut final salary scheme about 13 hours ago Dominic Coyle Technology giant Intel is closing its final salary pension scheme after the cost of funding it multiplied in recent years.         Technology giant Intel is closing its final salary pension scheme after the cost of funding it multiplied in recent years. The 2,100 active members of the scheme – current employees of Intel at its Leixlip plant in Co Kildare – will be transferred to a defined contribution scheme that has already been operating for new recruits since June 2012. Including deferred members, there are understood to be more than 5,000 people in the scheme who have not yet retired. The company said that, from the end of June 2017, no further contributions will be paid into the defined benefit (DB) scheme. However, staff and deferred members will retain the benefits built up to date. Company executives held a series of meetings with staff at the Intel campus on Tuesday to explain why the scheme was closing and what would happen next. Intel says the cost of servicing the scheme has jumped from 5.6 per cent of employees’ pensionable salary in 2001 to 15.9 per cent now. ‘Factors beyond our control’ “If we don’t take action now, these costs will further double to 30.1 per cent,” the company’s country manager Eamonn Sinnott said in an email to staff ahead of the meetings. He said Intel Ireland was putting the new arrangements in place “because the DB model of pension provision is unsustainable”. Rapidly increasing costs were “driven by factors beyond our control and are subject to further unpredictable increases in the future”. Staff were told that the company will put more than $100 million into the scheme to preserve benefits accruing to date and to grow this benefit at a rate of 2.5 per cent per year until retirement. It said it would also provide a 12 per cent contribution to “kick-start” the new defined contribution arrangement for staff. New scheme Thereafter the company will contribute a percentage of employee remuneration into the new scheme on a pro-rata basis to contributions from the workers themselves. Unusually, the contribution will be calculated not just by reference to basic pay but will include shift premiums, bonuses and other income. Intel has been operating a defined benefit pension scheme since it arrived in Ireland in 1989. It closed the scheme to new members in 2012. The computer chip giant is the latest US multinaitonal to review its pension arrangements in Ireland as companies warn that rapidly rising pension costs threaten to undermine the competitiveness of Irish plants competing for investment from US parent groups. Pharma group Pfizer is looking to close its non-contributory defined-benefit scheme at two facilities in Cork.       Topics: Eamonn Sinnott Intel Ireland Read More Want to become a mother?

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD’s Ryzen 5 1500X and 1600X reviewed: Taking the fight against Intel to the midrange market AMD’s Ryzen 5 1500X and 1600X reviewed: Taking the fight against Intel to the midrange market By Joel Hruska on April 11, 2017 at 9:00 am Comment Roughly five weeks ago, AMD launched its Ryzen 7 processor family. While the new chips are extremely powerful, they’re not particularly cheap. Today, AMD released its new Ryzen 5 midrange CPU family, aimed squarely at Intel’s desktop Core i5 and Core i7 SKUs. Can AMD pull a win out of its hat two months in a row? AMD is launching multiple Ryzen 5 processors today, from the Ryzen 5 1400 (quad-core, SMT, 3.2GHz base, 3.4GHz turbo) to the Ryzen 5 1600X (six-core, SMT, 3.6GHz base, 4GHz turbo). We have two of the new parts on-tap today — the Ryzen 5 1500X, with an MSRP of $189, and the Ryzen 5 1600X, with an MSRP of $249. Details on the two chips are shown below. Like Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 is aggressively targeting Intel’s price points and market position. At $189, the 1500X offers SMT, a feature Intel’s desktop Core i5 chips have always lacked. At $249, the 1600X packs six cores and SMT to compete directly the upper end of Intel’s Core i5 range (the 7600 and 7600K) as well as the Core i7-7700K. But the threat to Intel isn’t just about processors. AMD’s new B350 chipset has picked a fight with Intel’s midrange chipset designs as well. AMD’s various Ryzen platforms. The B350 is the chipset we’ll be focusing on today. Click to enlarge. The chart above show AMD’s various chipsets for Ryzen; we’ll be testing the midrange B350 today as opposed to the higher-end X370. Intel’s equivalent midrange chipset is the B250. Intel’s B250 chipset. Click to enlarge. There are a few salient points to consider when comparing these platforms. Among them: Overclocking: AMD’s B350 fully supports it for both memory and CPUs. Intel’s B250 does not. The highest RAM standard you can use on a B250 board is 2400MHz. This includes any attempt to use XMP settings — our Asrock B250M Performance board died and refused to POST every time we attempted to load XMP values. Why Asrock continues to make them an option on a motherboard that shouldn’t offer the feature is anyone’s guess. RAID support: The B350 supports RAID 0, 1, and 10. Intel’s B250 supports no RAID of any kind. USB support: Intel’s B250 offers more native USB 3.0 ports without the need for any additional chips, but AMD has a pair of native 3.1 Gen 2 ports that Intel lacks. NVMe support: Both Intel and AMD can support NVMe, but there’s a difference between them. AMD’s support for PCI Express 3.0 is baked directly into the SoC on its own dedicated channel, while Intel’s NVMe support shares bandwidth with all of the other chipset I/O, connected via DMI 3.0. Motherboards based on B350 are expected to retail for $75 – $120, which broadly corresponds to Intel’s B250 motherboard ($62 – $129 on Newegg). Overall, we’d say AMD’s B350 offers better enthusiast features, with USB 3.1 Gen 2, RAID 0,1,10 support, and fully unlocked overclocking. Intel’s B250 has the edge in total PCI Express 3.0 lanes, but all of that I/O has to pass through the bottleneck of an x4 PCIe configuration (DMI 3.0). AMD also uses an x4 PCIe connection to provide much of its I/O, but that’s key to the company’s argument: What good is that much connectivity if any serious attempt to use all of it results in I/O bottlenecks? Test setup: I’ve got the DDR4-3200 blues My original plan was to test Ryzen 5 with the same 16GB of DDR4-3200 that we used for the Ryzen 7 launch. This worked beautifully with our Ryzen 5 1600X, but refused to play nice with the 1500X. We tried two different sets of DRAM from Geil and G.Skill, and neither could run at 3200MHz when paired with the 1500X. Adjusting timing and voltages made no difference. We dropped back to DDR4-2933 for the 1500X and ran all those tests before realizing that Intel’s B250 chipset presented its own problem. With no memory overclocking capabilities at all, the fastest RAM we could pair with the Core i5-7500 was DDR4-2400. These configuration discrepancies are noted in our graphs. Since higher DRAM clocks and voltages also increase power consumption, our maximum power consumption tests cannot be considered a strict apples-to-apples comparison. All four testbeds were tested with the same Geil DDR-3200 with an Gigabyte G1 Gaming GTX 1070 running Nvidia driver version 376.33. Our general benchmark results echo what we saw with Ryzen 7. Given room to stretch its legs threads, Ryzen 5 easily outperforms the Core i7-7700K. In tests that don’t thread as well, Ryzen 5 can be outmaneuvered by the 7700K’s higher clocks and IPC edge. In the 12 non-gaming benchmarks and sub-benchmarks we performed, the 1600X beats the Core i7-7700K in seven of them. The i5-7500 and Ryzen 5 1500X show a nearly identical spread between tests. The only difference is that the i5-7500 and the 1500X effectively tied in PCMark 8 (tests within a 2-3% of each other are considered ties). The final count for the 1500X is seven wins to four losses vis-à-vis the i5-7500. Let’s switch over now and consider gaming performance. We’ve retained the game settings and resolutions we tested Ryzen 7 with, but have updated Ashes of the Singularity and switched to its standalone expansion pack, Escalation, to take advantage of recent patches that improved Ryzen’s overall performance. Conclusion: AMD is gunning for Intel’s entire product stack AMD hasn’t pivoted from the Ryzen 7 strategy it debuted five weeks ago: Introduce extremely competitive CPUs at bargain-basement prices. forcing Intel to either cut its own prices or watch its market share shrink. It’ll take some time before we know how well that strategy is working, but the Ryzen 5 1500X and 1600X are both extremely well-positioned. The Ryzen 5 1600X wins a majority of its non-gaming benchmarks against the Core i7-7700K and maintains high frame rates (though not leadership) in comparison to the Intel processor. Given that the Core i7-7700K costs 1.4x more than the Ryzen 5 1600X, it’s hard to justify that CPU based on frame rates alone. The Core i5-7500 is in an even tougher position compared with the Ryzen 5 1500X. Unlike the Core i7-7700K, which outperforms the 1600X in almost every gaming test, the 1500X beat the i5-7500 in Ashes of the Singularity and in one of our Civilization VI tests. In multi-threaded applications, the 1500X is always the better option. Frankly, I’m not as concerned about the “Ryzen gap” in gaming as I was when Ryzen launched. AMD has demonstrated that Ryzen can recover some of the missing performance thanks to updates and patches, and our GTX 1080 Ti review illustrated that the 1800X can go head-to-head with Intel’s Core i7-6900K in 1440p and 4K with barely a hint of daylight between the two CPUs. Ryzen 5’s debut has highlighted how weak the Core i7-7700K’s value proposition truly is. In the old days, when the FX-9590 competed with Core i7 in much the same way a pigeon competes against a bird-of-prey, Intel could get away with charging an extra $100 for Hyper-Threading. If you care about a mix of gaming and multi-threaded performance, the 1600X blows the Core i7-7700K out of the water. If you only care about gaming, the 7700K seems like an easy pick — but remember, repeated testing shows that Hyper-Threading adds almost nothing to overall frame rates over and above a fast Core i5. There’s nothing wrong with the Core i7-7700K, but it’s neither a great deal for gamers (the Core i5-7600K is $100 less and has a 3.8GHz base clock with a 4.2GHz boost), nor for multi-threading performance. Between high-end Core i5’s and Ryzen, the Core i7 doesn’t have much room to stake a position for itself. While Intel wasn’t able to provide any six-core chips for testing, we don’t expect the six-core verdicts to look much different than the eight-core chip comparisons did in early March. Intel’s Core i7-6800K (3.4GHz base, 3.6GHz Turbo) is a $419 CPU; the 6850K (3.6GHz base, 3.8GHz Turbo) costs $609. At $249, the 1600X will go through both like a fat kid on cake. Final verdict? These chips are everything we like about Ryzen, a bit less of things we didn’t like much, and they’re selling at prices that wreck Intel’s price structure. While there are exceptions and corner cases, AMD currently offers the best overall price/performance ratios in the CPU business. It’s about time.

There's promise of next-generation RX Vega graphics coming to a PC in May or June, bringing much-needed competition to the high-end space, and AMD already has a trio of Ryzen eight-core CPUs out in the wild. Excelling in multi-core activity and offering a better bang for buck than Intel, premium Ryzen CPUs have been disruptive. Yet the real CPU push arrives with Ryzen 5, launched today in 1400, 1500X, 1600 and 1600X flavours. A key difference between these chips and the range toppers is the marketing choice to split Ryzen 5 into four- and six-core models. AMD Ryzen CPU Specifications Model Cores / Threads TDP L3 Cache Base Clock Turbo Clock XFR Memory Package Price AMD Ryzen 7 1800X 8 / 16 95W 16MB 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $499 AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8 / 16 95W 16MB 3.4GHz 3.8GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $399 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 8 / 16 65W 16MB 3.0GHz 3.7GHz 50MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $329 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 95W 16MB 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $249 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 / 12 65W 16MB 3.2GHz 3.6GHz 100MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $219 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 65W 16MB 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 200MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $189 AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4 / 8 65W 8MB 3.2GHz 3.4GHz 50MHz DDR4-2666 AM4 $169 Ryzen 5 1400 and 1500X both use the established four-core, eight-thread architecture common on mainstream Intel chips. As we already know that all Ryzen chips are unlocked, the pair are split on base and boost frequencies, with R5 1400 chiming in at 3.2GHz base and 3.4GHz boost while 1500X increases this to 3.5GHz and 3.7GHz, respectively. The XFR 'ultra-boost' clock is interesting insofar as it's poor on the 1400 but, at 200MHz, the highest of any Ryzen chip for the 1500X. It seems sensible to spend the extra $20 to avail yourself of guaranteed faster speeds and higher single-core potential. Both chips have a restrained 65W TDP, making them eminently suitable for small-form-factor PCs. Ryzen 5 1600 and 1600X offer a middle ground between the top and bottom of the range by offering six cores and 12 threads, thus harnessing a core count that Intel doesn't currently play in. In other respects, R5 1600X is the same chip as the head honcho 1800X that we have reviewed recently, albeit at half the price. AMD has confirmed that all Ryzen 5 CPUs are Ryzen 7 chips that have been symmetrically disabled, so 3+3 across two CCXes for the six-core part, and 2+2 across the same two CCXes for the four-core part. This means they use a much larger die than would be absolutely necessary, one that taps into the full 16MB gamut of L3 cache for all but the R5 1400, so it will be interesting to see if the Ryzen 5 1400/1500X ever move over to a single-CCX die. This is wholly AMD's manufacturing and costing concern, however. Ryzen 5 chips are cut from the same eight-core cloth as Ryzen 7 All but the R5 1600X arrive at retail with coolers in the box. You may have heard of AMD releasing a slew of new heatsinks alongside the Ryzen launch, so the R5 1400 gets the Wraith Stealth while R5 1500X and R5 1600 receive the beefier Spire. We'd argue it is far more important for AMD's continued bottom line to ensure that Ryzen 5 is successful against a host of Intel chips - each company will undoubtedly sell more of these than $300-plus models. With that in mind, here is how the Ryzen 5 quartet line up against the price-equivalent chips from Intel's current Kaby Lake stable. AMD vs. Intel price comparison AMD Price Intel AMD Ryzen 5 1600X (6 / 12) $249/$243 Intel Core i5-7600K (4 / 4) AMD Ryzen 5 1600 (6 / 12) $219/$213 Intel Core i5-7600T (4 / 4) AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (4 / 8) $189/$192 Intel Core i5-7500 (4 / 4) AMD Ryzen 5 1400 (4 / 8) $169/$168 Intel Core i3-7350K (2 / 4) AMD offers more threads at each price point, replicating what Ryzen 7 has done at the higher end of the spectrum. Gaming performance is still up in the air, especially as each chip is using SMT, so let's get right to the benchmarks.

Mobile by Shara Tibken 11 April 2017 3:29 am BST @sharatibken Qualcomm's put on the boxing gloves in a patent spat with Apple. The chipmaker on Monday, in a 134-page redacted filing, responded to an Apple lawsuit about patent licensing and made some counterclaims of its own, including breach of contract. It also asked for an unspecified amount in damages. "Over the last 10 years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services," Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement. "But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies." Apple referred CNET back to its filing from January, in which it said, "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Qualcomm is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips, and it created some of the essential standards for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing that technology to hundreds of handset manufacturers and others. Apple designs the processors in its iPhones and iPads, but it buys chips from Qualcomm to connect to 4G LTE and other cellular networks. Under Qualcomm's licensing structure, Apple, through its manufacturers such as Foxconn, pays Qualcomm a fee for its chips and another fee for the intellectual property utilized in the mobile phones. Most components suppliers bundle the IP cost in with the chip sales price. Qualcomm, though, says its intellectual property is essential for the operation of a mobile phone, not just the chips inside handsets. See also Qualcomm CEO fires back at Apple: Bring it on Apple sues Qualcomm over unfair licensing terms Apple expands Qualcomm legal spat to China For the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, introduced late last year, Apple also started buying 4G LTE chips from another supplier, Intel. Because Qualcomm owns IP related to 3G and 4G phones, any handset maker using the technology has to pay it a licensing fee, even if they don't use Qualcomm's chips. That fee is based on the total value of the device ($650 in the case of the iPhone) versus the value of the chip (closer to $20), but it's capped at a certain level. Qualcomm didn't disclose the limit, but it's lower than the actual $650 price of the iPhone. As with most licensing terms, this gets complicated pretty quickly. But essentially, Apple bears a cost for using Qualcomm technology in its phones, whether or not the chips it includes are directly from Qualcomm. 'Each and every allegation' Qualcomm on Monday denied "each and every allegation" Apple made in its January lawsuit and cited 35 different defenses, including that "to the extent that Apple has suffered damages, if at all, all damages were caused by Apple's own actions." The company talked about the investments it has made in R&D, as well as the innovations it has contributed to the mobile market. It also accused Apple of breach of contract and interfering with agreements and relationships Qualcomm has with contract manufacturers. It said Apple has withheld money (the amount was redacted) owed to Qualcomm under a contract relating to a high-speed feature of Qualcomm's chips. It also said Apple hurt Qualcomm by "deliberately making false statements to government agencies about Qualcomm's licensing practices and chipset business." Qualcomm alleged that Apple hurt consumers by limiting Qualcomm chips in the iPhone 7 to make performance more comparable to chips from Intel. (Apple chose to use modems from both companies in certain versions of its popular smartphone.) Qualcomm said Apple threatened to not make public comparisons about the "superior performance of Qualcomm-powered iPhones." 19 How red is the iPhone 7 Plus Product Red Special Edition? "Apple's goal is clear -- to leverage its immense power to force Qualcomm into accepting less than fair value for the patented technologies that have led innovation in cellular technology and helped Apple generate more than $760 billion in iPhone sales," Qualcomm said in its filing. In addition, Qualcomm said in the filing that it has invested more than $40 billion in research and development over the past three decades and that it employs nearly 20,000 engineers. Its patent portfolio contains more than 130,000 issued patents and patent applications worldwide. "Qualcomm invented fundamental technologies at the heart of 2G, 3G, and 4G cellular communications, is leading the industry to 5G, and has contributed innumerable additional innovations used in virtually every modern cell phone," its filing said. Chip battle Apple in January filed suit against Qualcomm in the US, alleging the wireless chipmaker didn't give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate. Apple wants a court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion. The iPhone maker said in its suit that Qualcomm should be paid royalties based on the value of its particular contribution, not for contributions from other patent holders. Currently, Qualcomm's royalties are based on the selling price of a phone, rather than what portion Qualcomm's technology enabled. Qualcomm has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged monopolistic practices. Two years ago, it paid China nearly $1 billion to end a 14-month antitrust investigation in that country. Then, in December, South Korea hit Qualcomm with a $850 million fine following a three-year investigation. The South Korean Fair Trade Commission accused the chipset maker of having an "unfair business model" and creating a monopoly with its practices. The US Federal Trade Commission also has accused Qualcomm of illegally dominating the cellular chip market. Along with the US suit, Apple has sued Qualcomm in China and the UK.

Update at 1:05 p.m. PT on April 11 to add in information about Qualcomm royalty cap. Does the Mac still matter?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Fix the “Custom Scale Factor Is Set” Error on Windows By Cameron Summerson on April 11th, 2017 More and more laptops these days are coming with super high resolution screens, which means Windows needs to “scale” the interface to make things readable. If you don’t like the default scale level, you can change it yourself. This is essentially a “zoom” of sorts—scaling icons and text so that the display is still running at native resolution, but all the on-screen content is larger without getting distorted. RELATED ARTICLE How to Make the Windows Desktop Work Well on High-DPI Displays and Fix Blurry Fonts However, many people have run into a problem where the scale level gets stuck or “locked” at a certain custom position. You can turn off custom scaling, sign out, sign back in, and set the scaling yourself…but once you reboot, it’ll be right back where it started. This is often due to a third-party program interfering with Windows’ settings, and it’s maddening. The thing is, there are actually multiple things that can cause this, which means there are multiple potential fixes…none of which are guaranteed to work. Having personally experienced this issue and spent days trying to find the answer, however, I’ve collected the most common solutions that seemed to work for people. Hopefully this will save you from having to go through the hundreds of posts and half-baked solutions out there in Internetland. Option One: Change the Setting Manually While you may not be able to change the setting in Windows’ Display Settings, there is a workaround that may be a solution for you. First, right-click anywhere on the desktop and choose “Display Settings.” This is what it looks like when the Custom Scale Factor is set. Yours should look similar: See that grayed out bar? Yeah, you can’t do anything with that. If you want to modify the scale level, you have click the “Turn off custom scaling and sign out” button, then set it. And if your PC goes into hibernation for any reason (or you restart), you’ll have to do it again. It’s also worth pointing out that the number shown basically means nothing. My screen was locked into 125% scaling when that screenshot was taken, yet this setting showed 175%. In other words: ignore what it says. Now, scroll all the way down to the bottom of that page and choose “Advanced Display Settings.” On the next screen, scroll to the bottom again and click “Advanced Sizing of Text and Other Items.” This will take you away from the “new’ Windows settings and into the Control Panel. What a mess. This menu is a little weird, but you’re looking for the link in that body of text that reads “set a custom scaling level”. Click it. RELATED ARTICLE Windows 10’s Settings Are a Mess, and Microsoft Doesn’t Seem to Care This will open yet another box that you can use to set your scale level. Yes, this setting exists in two different places, but one of them is more granular than the other. Welcome to Windows, y’all. In the dropdown, pick your preferred scale level. Click “OK,” then “Apply” on the next window. Everything should change. Once you’ve applied the change, you’ll need to log out and back in. For some users, this was enough. For many, though, it wasn’t the final solution. If it doesn’t work for you, read on. Option Two: For Laptops with Intel HD Graphics If you’re using a Windows laptop with Intel HD Graphics (which there’s a good chance you are), Intel’s drivers may be the culprit, and there is a potential solution for it. First, right click on the desktop and choose “Graphics properties.” If you don’t have that option, click your computer’s system tray and find the Intel icon. It’s a little blue one. Click it and choose “Graphics Properties.” This will open the Intel HD Graphics Panel. Here, click on “Display.” You’re only going to make one change here. At the bottom, click on “Maintain Aspect Ratio” then tick the “Override Application Settings” box. That last step is crucial. This will basically tell the Intel driver to ignore all other settings and force your preferred scale level regardless. At this point, you can close all the previously-opened windows and reboot. Your new settings should stick at this point. Hopefully. Option Three: Check the Software that Came with Your Monitor I’ll admit, this solution is a bit less specific than the others, mostly because we haven’t experienced it ourselves—but we have seen a lot of talk out there about it. Much like the above-mentioned Intel utility, there’s a chance your monitor may have its own display utility. LG, for example, has some software for their 4K monitors that adds extra window management features. But, unfortunately, this can mess with Windows’ display scaling. If you have a custom utility installed—one from your display’s manufacturer—try uninstalling it. There’s a good chance it’s mucking up the system and overriding what Windows wants to do. Once this tool has been uninstalled, reboot your PC. Hopefully everything is fixed now. Option Four: Remove Any Third-Party Scaling Utility Fun fact: Windows 10 isn’t great at DPI scaling. When scaled up, some fonts looks blurry and just generally terrible. As a result, one developer created a tool that allowed users to switch to the Windows 8.1 method of scaling, which is strangely a lot better. The only quirk: if you use this tool, you have to set the scaling from within the tool, not within Windows’ normal settings. Confession time: this was the issue on my laptop. It turns out I had used said utility many moons ago and forgotten about it. Since this is a portable app that doesn’t get a formal installation, I had forgotten it was even on the system—a not uncommon mistake, I’m sure. This was a pretty popular utility when it was released, so if you ever recall using it (or anything like it), now’s the time to fire it back up and switch it back to Windows 10’s native scaling option. Once you do that, you’ll need to reboot, disable Custom Scaling by clicking the “Turn off custom scaling and sign out” link in Display Properties, then reboot again. Alternatively, you can keep using the tool, but change your scaling level from within the tool. Just keep it around if you ever want to switch back to Windows’ built-in scaling instead. A quick Google search will show what a widepsread problem this is, so hopefully you’ve stumbled upon this post in the desperate search for an answer. One of the above listed should hopefully be the solution you’ve been looking for. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Cameron Summerson is a die-hard Android fan, Chicago Bulls fanatic, metalhead, and cyclist.

A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is an essential microprocessor embedded in every single computer to process information. The CPU carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing logical, control, I/O and arithmetic operations. In gaming, a CPU processor is important as it is responsible for processing the game’s instructions and processing input from the player. Depending on the type of game it is, some may require a more powerful CPU. Have an interest in gaming? Carry on reading for CBR’s best CPU for gaming to find out which one is best for you.   Intel Core i5-7600K As the latest processor to be released from Intel’s recent launch of Kaby Lake processors, the K-series Core i5 is now classified as the top of the range and one of the best CPUs for gaming. Major enhancements to this model include improvements in the 14nm processor that enables Kaby Lake to clock around 300MHz higher than the Skylake 15-6600K, which is good for almost eight percent more performance in CPU limited situations. Read more: Intel gives traditional hard drives a speed boost with Optane Memory The per watt performance, single-core multi-core performance and the power efficiency together are each individually higher than the previous generation i5’s. Specifically useful for gamers, is the efficiency of better performance in rendering applications and video editing software. Due to the higher base and boost clock added to the i5-7600K, it is able to overclock better than majority of the processors currently in the market. It includes four cores, four threads, 3.8GHz of base clock and 4.2GHz of boost clock. The high standards in terms of performance levels will serve gamers very well. Intel’s Core 15-7600K can be purchased online at Intel.co.uk from £229.72.   AMD Ryzen 7 1800X Up next in the best CPU for gaming list is AMD’s answer to rival Intel’s processor line. The Ryzen processor uses Zen microarchitecture which is based on a 14nm FinFET manufacturing process and also utilises a new AM5 socket. It also includes AMD’s new Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) technology, with two threads utilised per core. The AMD Ryzen 7 1800X is one that has been designed to suit those that require a CPU which is competent for gaming, and also built to handle multi-core tasks such as video production and streaming. Although, the overclocking and single core performance specs of this CPU are less efficient than that of Intel’s i5-7600K, the inclusion of other features makes it one that enables games developers and system programmers to approach software design in a new way entirely.   Intel Core i7-6950X Intel’s second mention on this best CPU for gaming list, with the Broadwell-E core 17-6950X billed as a 10 core processor with 20 threads, making it part of Intel’s Extreme Edition line of launches. The Broadwell-E includes better memory support, with the addition of multipliers which are available to fine-tune performance. However, the main unique selling point of this model is the extra two cores, all pure and simple meaning it provides 25 percent better performance than the previous generation 6950X. The CPU family delivers platform scalability with up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes and support for high speed storage, up to 4 discrete graphics cards, and Thunderbolt technology. The CPU family is the first to feature the new Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology, which boosts the processor frequency to deliver maximum application performance. An Extreme Edition gaming experience, means an extreme retail price. It can be purchased on the Intel website from £1,621.98.   AMD and Intel dominate the next entrants on this best CPU for gaming list Next Tags AMD CPU Gaming Intel microprocessor Sidebar List Previous ArticleWhat is Visual Studio?

AMD made quite a splash with the launch of its first Ryzen CPUs. The Ryzen 7 1800X was so good it became the first AMD CPU TrustedReviews has strongly recommended in the better part of ten years. But, the 1800X and the other two Ryzen 7 processors that launched a month or so ago are all high-end products with eight cores and price tags to match. That’s where the Ryzen 5 chips come in. Launching today, the Ryzen 5 processors are available in six and quad-core configurations, and have a far lower upfront cost. This makes them ideal for more mainstream and enthusiast users who want a powerful processors but don’t really need, or can’t afford, the massive multi-core power of a Ryzen 7 CPU. There are four processors that make up the Ryzen 5 lineup, two of which are quad-core and two six-core. I’ll be looking at the top tier versions of each, the quad-core 1500X and the six-core 1600X. Related: Best Graphics cards for all budgets AMD Ryzen 5 – Features and Specifications The Ryzen 5 processors are the second set of chips to arrive from AMD’s full Ryzen range. In the second half of the year we can expect to see Ryzen 3 chips. With the addition of these four new processors, the Ryzen range now extends from the £330-£500 of the Ryzen 7 chips, down to the £160-£250 of Ryzen 5. This pits them against Intel’s Core i5-7600K at the top end and a variety of dual- and quad-core processors at the lower end. What’s striking about the entire Ryzen range so far, including these new Ryzen 5 chips, is that they all have essentially identical features, apart from the number of cores and their clock speeds. All are multiplier unlocked for easy overclocking, all include simultaneous multithreading (SMT), all include Precision Boost and all fit in the same motherboards. Manufacturer Product Line Model Cores / Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) TDP MSRP in USD AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 3.6 4.0 65W $249 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 / 12 3.2 3.6 65W $219 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 3.5 3.7 65W $189 AMD Ryzen 5 1500 4 / 8 3.2 3.4 65W $169 The only other differentiator is the X on the end of the model numbers which tells us whether the chip has extended frequency range (XFR). This allows the processor to boost the clock speed of one of its cores just a tiny bit further than non ‘X’ chips – up to 50MHz more, to be precise. This is all in contrast to the way Intel has compartmentalised its CPU range where different chips will or won’t have Hyperthreading (Intel’s equivalent of SMT), only a few processors are multiplier unlocked for easy overclocking, some don't include Turbo Boost (Intel's euivalent of Precision Boost) and you need to invest in completely different platforms if you want to move from a quad-core CPU to a six- or eight-core CPU. Intel doesn’t have any six-core processors at this price (regardless of platform) and the only quad-core chips it offers don’t include Hyperthreading. This means the Ryzen 5 1600X should be a shoe-in for that middle ground between the eight-core Ryzens and cheaper quad-core processors. It’s priced to compete with the Intel Core i5-7600K and while Intel’s chip has a clock speed advantage that will make it faster in single-thread applications, it’s only quad-core without hyperthreading. This means the 1600X should have a handy advantage when it comes to multi-threaded workloads, such a rendering video footage. Meanwhile, the 1500X comes up against two Intel processors: the Intel Core i5-7400 and the Core i3-7350K. The former is quad-core but again it lacks hyperthreading and is actually clocked slower than the 1500X, so AMD’s chip should compete on single-thread then run away with the victory in multi-thread. Manufacturer Product Line Model Cores / Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) TDP MSRP in USD AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 3.6 4.0 65W $249 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 / 12 3.2 3.6 65W $219 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 3.5 3.7 65W $189 AMD Ryzen 5 1500 4 / 8 3.2 3.4 65W $169 Intel Core i5 7600K 4 / 4 3.8 4.2 91W $242 Intel Core i5 7400 4 / 4 3.0 3.5 65W $182 Intel Core i3 7350K 2 / 4 4.2 4.2 60W $168 The i3-7350K is a different story. It’s clocked at the same base clock speed as the i7-7700K and can be overclocked to 5GHz, giving it a massive clock speed advantage that will make it quicker in many day to day single-threaded applications and games. However, it’s only dual-core (though with hyperthreading) and doesn't have Turbo Boost Technology so its single-thread advantage isn't as high as it could be and heavy multi-taskers and those that need multi-thread processing power will find it lacking. Competition aside, it is a little disappointing AMD couldn’t squeeze a little more clock speed out of the 1500X. As the flagship quad-core part it would be nice to see it reaching the same speeds as the 1800X and 1600X, in the same way that the Intel Core i3-7350K matches the i7-7700K. That leaves the Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500, which we’re not reviewing here. As non-X processors they generally have slower clock speeds and miss out on XFR. However, as they have SMT and are overclockable they still have the potential to be speed demons, and the £30 saving for the 1600 could make it a particularly tempting option for those after as much mutli-core performance as possible for the least money. AMD Ryzen 5 – What’s inside? All the Ryzen 5 processors are built on the same foundation, which also powers the Ryzen 7 chips. The Zen micro-architecture was built from the ground up to address the power consumption and performance-per-clock issues of previous AMD processors. AMD employed a host of techniques to achieve this, which we won’t cover in depth here – you can read more about Zen in our 1800X review – but we’ll highlight a few of the key points. Related: Best gaming monitors The new design has boosted instructions per clock by 52%. A move that has brought AMD near enough to parity with Intel after years of trailing far behind. As a result, if the two companies released a processor each with an identical number of cores and clock speed they should produce near-identical performance. However, as it is right now Intel still has a maximum clock speed advantage so AMD is throwing cores at the problem. Another key addition with Ryzen is simultaneous multithreading. This is AMD’s answer to Intel’s Hyperthreading technology that allows each core of the processor to juggle two threads at a time, so it can deal more efficiently with its workload. This makes the processor appear to software like it has double the number of cores and results in a performance increase of between 10% and 30%. The third key aspect to Zen is that power consumption has greatly improved. AMD’s previous performance champ, the eight-core FX-8 9590, had a thermal design power (TDP) of 219W. The 1800X has a TDP of just 95W, while the Ryzen 5 range are all just 65W. Again, this essentially puts AMD’s processors on a level with Intel. Another feature of Ryzen is Precision Boost. This is internal overclocking akin to Intel's Turbo Boost technology where you have a base clock frequency and then all the cores of the processor can overclock to a second higher frequency when needed, CPU temperature depending. Meanwhile XFR is a final little push that can be given to one core of the chip when it's under heavy load. AMD Ryzen 5 – The platform The whole AMD Ryzen range can be installed in the new AMD AM4 socket, which is support by five AMD chipsets: X370, B350, A320, X300 and A300. All will support the range of Ryzen processors but only the X370, X300 and B350 will support overclocking; and only the X370 and X300 will support SLI/Crossfire. There are currently only X370 and B350 boards available and they range in price from £80-100 for a B350 board to £150-£300 for X370 boards. You’ll most likely have to buy a new CPU cooler to fit the AM4 socket, though unlike Ryzen 7, some of the Ryzen 5 range can be purchased with included coolers.

The security is based on two subsystems: the security subsystem is in control of supplying power and managing encryption key/access control, and the PC subsystem provides the standard computing environment. ORWL comes with Ubuntu, Windows 10, or Qubes OS pre-installed, but users can install and run any modern 64 bit Intel-compatible operating system. Ubuntu is our preferred choice of system as it provides a very strong balance of features. It is noted for its installation scripting and default system configuration working well with a wide variety of modern hardware and is reliable and stable. The ORWL device hosts an Intel Skylake Core m3 processor, 8GB RAM, 120GB or 480GB SSD, Intel 515 graphics, USB 3.0 Type-C ports, Micro HDMI port, and supports 4K videos. This system can run GNU/Linux-based distros and Windows 10. Furthermore, the device is protected by an active mesh in its casing. Any attempt to breach the case, made of a type of brittle plastic that’s prone to shatter if punctured, triggers the MAXIM controller to delete the encryption key that grants access to the user’s protected data. ST has provided the NFC controller giving critical functionality to the ORWL device. Manufacturing of the device is handled by Quanta Computers giving flexibility on the quantities of desktop PCs to be made. Design SHIFT is actively pursuing getting ORWL certified as a cryptographic module under a US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard known as FIPS 140-2. This is the standard under which the US government, financial institutions, health care providers, and other regulated industries store and process sensitive data. The ORWL device is shipping Q2, 2017, pricing upon request. For more information visit www.design-shift.com. About Design SHIFT: Design SHIFT is building digital security providing privacy in new generation of computers a, more than ever, demanding world. From designing, engineering to manufacturing cycles, the company enables developers and users in healthcare, government agencies and financial institutions to build trusted encrypted networks, multimedia hubs and other services that will allow individuals and organization to communicate better, more securely. More information at www.design-shift.com. About ORWL: ORWL is a unique new category of desktop PC designed for banking technologies to protect sensitive data. ORWL requires two factors of authentication, a key and a password. It protects against physical attacks and will erase the SSD encryption key if tampered with, enabling new privacy and security applications. The innovation offers physical protection in a consumer computer available to the mass market. ORWL runs many standard OS out of the box, it is open source.

Buying Guides What’s the Best Chromebook for Performance in 2017? Joel Lee April 11, 2017 11-04-2017 6 minutes What’s the Best Chromebook for Performance in 2017? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Chromebooks, long seen as “casual use only” laptops, never emphasized performance. But as Chrome apps continue to mature and impress Switching to Chromebook: 8 Apps to Replace Your Desktop Favorites Switching to Chromebook: 8 Apps to Replace Your Desktop Favorites The hardest part about switching to a Chromebook is that you cannot install Windows or Mac software, but Chromebooks are perfect for everyday tasks. These top Chromebook apps can replace your desktop favorites. Read More , people are starting to use Chromebooks in a professional capacity — myself included — and for that, performance does matter. So what’s the best Chromebook for performance? Of the things to consider before buying a Chromebook 7 Things to Consider Before Buying a Chromebook 7 Things to Consider Before Buying a Chromebook How do you know if a Chromebook is right for you? In this article, I'm going to explain seven things you need to consider before making a purchase. Read More , you now have one more thing to mull over: how productive do you need to be? Don’t expect to do anything too intensive, of course, like editing videos or programming video games. But if you want high resolutions, no lag, no choppiness, and the ability to open more than two browser tabs at once, then a high-performance Chromebook will fit the bill. Criteria for Chromebook Performance Speed is the first thing you think of when “performance” comes up, but other factors can’t be ignored. A lightning-fast device with a poor design is just as bad as a slow machine. Productivity, not speed, is the ultimate goal. System specifications — In particular, three specs stand out as most important: RAM, CPU, and battery life. For speedy performance, never dip below 4 GB of RAM and ideally shoot for 8 GB. CPU performance is measured by benchmarks, which we’ll include for each Chromebook in this post. As for battery life, a minimum of 10 hours is ideal. Display size and resolution — Display size is entirely up to personal preference, but regarding productivity, we think the ideal range is between 13 inches and 15 inches. For best image quality, aim for a model with an IPS display Understanding The Differences Between LCD Display Panels [Technology Explained] Understanding The Differences Between LCD Display Panels [Technology Explained] Read More and at least 1080p resolution. You can always scale down if 1080p is too hard to see. Build quality and design — An aluminum body not only feels good but can be more protective in case of physical damage. Weight is a crucial factor in portability, for which we recommend staying under 3 pounds. And don’t forget about the keyboard! There’s nothing worse than a laptop with an awkward layout and uncomfortable keys. Chromebooks are still relatively new, so don’t expect to nail each and every one of these criteria. Figure out which ones are most important to you, and then keep an eye out for those as you browse our Chromebook recommendations below. 1. Acer Chromebook 14 for Work ($725) RAM — 8 GB CPU — 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5-6200U (28,300 Octane) Battery Life — 10 hours Display — 14″ up to 1920 x 1080 (IPS) Right away, it’s important to point out that the Acer Chromebook 14 for Work is a different model than the Acer Chromebook 14. The “for Work” models have significantly beefier CPUs, more RAM in general, and professional build quality. Whereas most Chromebooks feel cheap, this one’s hefty enough to survive serious abuse. As far as high-performance Chromebooks go, the Acer Chromebook 14 for Work arguably offers the best value. The CPU benchmarks top the charts, the RAM and battery life are perfect, and the uncommon 14-inch size strikes the right balance between screen size and portability. Also worth noting is that this device was one of the first to allow installation of Android apps 12 Android Apps You Need to Install on Chromebook 12 Android Apps You Need to Install on Chromebook With the Google Play store about to come to our fingertips, the power of an incredible number of apps is about to reach Chrome OS. So what will we install first? Let's see. Read More . If you’re an Android user, you’ll soon find that Chromebooks are perfect companions to Android Have an Android Device? Chromebooks Are the Perfect Companion Have an Android Device? Chromebooks Are the Perfect Companion Android phones and tablets play really well with Chromebooks -- this is why you'll want both. Read More , and this model is one of the better proofs of it. 2. HP Chromebook 13 G1 ($840) RAM — 8 GB CPU — 1.1 GHz Intel Core m5-6Y57 (28,500 Octane) Battery Life — 8 hours Display — 13.3″ up to 3200 x 1800 (IPS) Without the doubt, the HP Chromebook 13 G1 sits at the top of the top. The version that comes with an m7 CPU is the only one to break 30,000 on the Octane benchmark so far. That being said, the m7 version starts at $1,500 new, and we could never recommend that. The gains just aren’t worth it. Instead, you can “settle” for the m5 version at about half the price, which still offers comparable CPU performance and more than enough RAM to support whatever office work you’ll be doing. The battery life is on the shorter side, though, and it costs about $150 more than we’re comfortable with. We only recommend this one only if you need the massive 3K resolution, if the Acer Chromebook 14 for Work isn’t available, or if you can get it on sale or refurbished and save yourself a few hundred bucks. 3. Acer Chromebook 15 C910 ($495) RAM — 4 GB CPU — 2.2 GHz Intel Core i5-5200U (25,300 Octane) Battery Life — 8 hours Display — 15.6″ up to 1920 x 1080 (IPS) If your budget caps out at $500 and you want the best performer within that range, look no further than the Acer Chromebook 15 C910. The battery life could be better, and 8 GB of RAM would be preferable to 4 GB, but it’s not a bad value at all. The one downside, which may be a pro depending on your needs, is the 15.6-inch body that weighs in at just under 5 lbs. This is not the kind of laptop you want to carry around all the time. It’s also a bit too bulky for comfortable lap use. But if you don’t mind that, the performance is excellent. 4. Dell Chromebook 13 ($450) RAM — 4 GB CPU — 1.7 GHz Intel Celeron 3215U (17,600 Octane) Battery Life — 12 hours Display — 13.3″ up to 1920 x 1080 (IPS) The Dell Chromebook 13 used to come in Intel i3 and Intel i5 versions, as well as 4 GB and 8 GB versions for RAM, but those can be hard to find these days. If you buy directly from Dell, your only option will be the Intel Celeron version — which is noticeably slower. If you need a cross between performance and portability, it doesn’t get better than this. At 12 hours of battery, it’ll last more than an entire workday. The 13.3-inch body weighs just over a wieldy 3 pounds. And yes, the performance is definitely above average. Don’t be scared away by the Octane score. Most Intel Celeron-equipped Chromebooks have Octane scores in the 8,000 to 9,000 range — and cost close to $300. 5. Lenovo ThinkPad 13 ($395) RAM — 4 GB CPU — 1.6 GHz Intel Celeron 3855U (16,600 Octane) Battery Life — 10 hours Display — 13.3″ up to 1920 x 1080 (IPS) The Lenovo ThinkPad 13 serves a similar niche as the Dell Chromebook 13. For $50 less, you get a slightly worse CPU speed and about 2 hours less battery life. If you can’t spare the extra $50, don’t feel bad about grabbing this one instead. It still outperforms most Chromebooks on the market. But there is one huge reason why you may want to skip it: Lenovo devices are notorious for pre-installed malware 4 Security Reasons That Explain Why You Should Avoid Lenovo PCs 4 Security Reasons That Explain Why You Should Avoid Lenovo PCs Read More .

Key complaints are five, including a claim that the Cupertino-based company didnt use the full potential of the Snapdragon modems in the iPhone 7 so they don't perform as good as Intels chips. The company claims its products are better but Apple deliberately prevented consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomms innovation. Claims state that the Qualcomm iPhones outperformed Intel iPhones, but Apple said there was no discernible difference between the two variants. Along with this, Apple also deliberately hid the information from customers and even threatened Qualcomm to keep it quiet. Some of the other complaints include misrepresenting facts and false statements. This lawsuit is clearly an answer to Apples $1 billion claim filed in January, stating that Qualcomm has been drastically overcharging for its patents. Apple's actions followed the FTC litigation against Qualcomm that stated the San Diego-based company wouldnt sell its integrated circuits to manufacturers who didnt pay extra for all the phones that don't incorporate Qualcomm processors.

Miller April 10, 2017 10 Comments Recently, I had an opportunity to talk with Dan McNamara, general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (PSG). Much of the interesting processor discussion has lately revolved around using different kinds of chips and cores, as opposed to the general-purpose computing cores common in conventional CPUs. We've seen all sorts of different combinations of chips used for particular computing tasks, including CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, custom ASICS, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGs), and increasingly we're seeing applications that combine aspects of all of these, sometimes in a system and sometimes within a single chip. Even Intel—long the proponent of general-purpose compute cores that doubled in speed every couple of years—has gotten into the act with its purchase of Altera, one of the leading FPGA manufacturers. Recently, I had an opportunity to talk with Dan McNamara, general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (PSG)—what was once known as Altera—who shed some light on Intel's plans in this area and gave more detail on the company's plans for connecting different kinds of cores and different die together in high-speed chip packages. "The world is going heterogeneous," McNamara said, noting that there is now a common realization that you can't solve all problems with general-use cores. Custom ASICs—such as Google's Tensor Processing Units or TPUs can accelerate certain kinds of functions well beyond traditional CPUS or GPUs, but these take a long time to create. In contrast, he said, FPGAs allow for customizable code that gives much of the performance benefits of ASICs without waiting two years for chip design and manufacturing. A developer can change algorithms within an FPGA immediately, while a CPU, GPU, or custom chip works in a fixed way. McNamara also said FPGAs are very low-latency and can be highly parallel, with different parts of a chip working concurrently on applications such as image processing or communication. Intel is now shipping the Arria 10 FPGA, manufactured on TSMC's 20nm process, and offers a package that combines a Xeon (Broadwell) processor and the Arria 10. This is in use in applications such as web-scale search and analytics. McNamara said FPGAs could accelerate search by up to 10 times and noted that Microsoft has been public about using such FPGAs to accelerate search. One big area of improvement lately has been in creating faster multi-chip packages that can combine chip dies created on different processes and perhaps from different makers. These include packages that contain a CPU and an FPGA, such as the Xeon/Arria combination; an FPGA with different transceivers, as in Intel's Stratix 10 FPGA; or even different parts of a full CPU, as Intel described in its recent technology and manufacturing day. Related Enjoy Talking to Google? Thank Tensor Processing Units Enjoy Talking to Google? Thank Tensor Processing Units Intel has created a new technology called embedded multi-chip interconnect bridge (EMIB) to do this, which debuted in the Stratix 10. In EMIB, the core die is created on Intel's 14nm process and the transceivers on TSMC's 16nm process. Overall, McNamara said that several areas are moving toward adopting more FPGAs using such packaging. He talked about hyper-scale web sites, which are seeing demand change rapidly and where an FPGA/CPU combination may work well in areas like search, analytics, and video streaming, as well as network transformation, where trends such as software-defined networking and network functions virtualization are driving a need for more packet processing. Other focus areas include 5G and wireless applications, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In AI, McNamara said optimized ASICs and raw computer power may well be best for training (Intel has purchased Nervana), but said FPGAs are often best at inference, because of their flexibility and low-latency, and noted that ZTE used Arria 10s to show very impressive image recognition scores. Personally, I'm curious to see if future CPUs really will take different components and mix and match them using EMIB or a similar technology to change what we think of as a processor chip. I'm intrigued by the idea that systems of the future may use lots of different cores—some programmable (FPGA) and some fixed (a mix of both custom ASICs and traditional CPUs and GPUs) to do things together that improve on what any single technology can do on its own.

For Awesome multi-core performance Strong gaming performance Cool running chip Against Tricky overclocking AMD has made a huge splash with Ryzen 7 by bringing a full range of affordable octo-core chips to the market, but we’ve been far more interested in how Ryzen 5 will elevate the mainstream computing scene. Not only are the parts even more inexpensive, you’ll at the very least get four cores and unlocked overclocking potential – two things Intel typically gates behind higher-priced parts with suffixes like “HQ” and “K.” Of course, Ryzen 5 not only meets Intel’s specs, but shoots well above them. Like its bigger Ryzen 7 brother, these mid-range processors are all about packing more cores and hyperthreading. The 1600X sits at the top of the Ryzen 5 family, featuring six-cores and eight-threads with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz that punches up to a maximum of 4.0GHz. It’s an impressive processor that not only beats Intel’s Core i5 and i7 processors, but also manages to turn its nose up at the Broadwell-E series.   Spec sheet Cores: 6 Threads: 12 Base clock: 3.6GHz Boost clock: 4.0GHz L3 cache: 16MB TDP: 95W Pricing and availability For a hexa-core processor, AMD’s $249 (£249, AU$359) flagship Rzyen 5 1600X processor seems downright cheap. On paper, the cost of those two extra cores is almost an afterthought when you stack it up against its direct competitor, the $239 (£219, AU$339) quad-core Intel Core i5-7600K. That said, AMD still lags behind in frequency when the 7600K operates at 3.8GHz at any given moment and 4.2GHz when push comes to shove. If extended overclocking and boost frequencies are trivial matters to you, AMD also offers the Ryzen 5 1600 at $219 (£219, AU$319). It’s still outfitted with 6-cores and 12-threads, but clocks in at a slower 3.2GHz and maxes out at only 3.6GHz. By comparison, Intel’s current hexa-core processor is the Core i7-6800K, which runs for a significantly higher $419 (£395, AU$599) price tag. Going back a generation to Haswell-E doesn’t make six-core processors that much cheaper either, with the ageing Intel Core i7-5820K running for $319 (£260, AU$310). Features and chipset With Ryzen 5, AMD continues to innovate on its new architecture and 14nm process. Like Ryzen 7, AMD has engineered Ryzen 5 to operate on a AM4 chipset with all the modern amenities of computing. This includes support for DDR4 RAM, the fastest NVMe SSDs and Thunderbolt 3 ports. Going a month back you may remember Ryzen 7 launching with high-end X370 motherboards featuring plenty of expandability with USB 3.1 Type-C and SATA Express ports. This time around Ryzen 5 has been introduced alongside B350 motherboards that are a bit lower-spec but still support a 10Gbps USB 3.1 port and two additional PCIe lanes for bleeding-edge SSDs. However, there are also some noteworthy cuts, including no support for multiple graphics cards. You might still find the odd, premium B350 board that offers dual PCie 3.0 x 8 graphics card slots, but be aware that AMD has stated these will only support the company’s own CrossFire technology and not Nvidia SLI. As the B350 boards aims to serve a more mainstream audience, you’ll also likely find fewer power phases and smaller heatsinks on some models. These could limit your ability to overclock the 1600X and other Ryzen 5 processors, so you would be better off getting a X370 board as we’ve used for this review. Test system specs GPU: Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti (11GB GDDR5X VRAM) RAM: 16GB Vengence LPX DDR4 (2,666MHz) Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair VI Hero Power Supply: SilverStone SX700-LPT Storage: 512GB Samsung 960 Pro M.2 SSD (NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4) Cooling: AMD Ryzen Wraith Max RGB Cooler Operating system: Windows 10 Performance Ryzen hasn’t had the smoothest entrance into the computing world with lackluster gaming and some CPU temperatures high enough to raise concerns. But after a month of optimizations plus new drivers and BIOS updates, Ryzen 5 seems to have bypassed those same growing pains. By contrast, the Ryzen 5 1600X has proven itself to be an issue-free processor. AMD’s flagship mid-range CPU scored an astonishingly high Cinebench R15 score of 1,232, nearly a two-times higher than the Intel Core i5-7600K. At the same time, it edges ahead of the Intel Core i7-6800K Broadwell-E processor, which racked up 1,153 points in the same test. When it comes to encoding, the 1600X shows off again by holding a frame rate that was twice higher than anything the 7600K could pull off. Surprisingly, this dramatic difference in performance didn’t carry over to the FryBench rendering test. Now the biggest question is can Ryzen 5’s top processor play games? The answer is yes and aw yiss. The 1600X not only put in better numbers than the Intel Core i5-7600K, it also one-upped the Ryzen 7 1800X we reviewed a month ago. This is due in part to those optimizations we mentioned before. We've also since upgraded our graphics card from a Nvidia GTX 1080 to a Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti. Regardless of those external factors, the 1600X proves it has the chops to be your main gaming system and a just as effective media creation platform – two things that are becoming intrinsically connected in this age of live-streaming, eSports and uploading gameplay videos. Overclocking and heat The Ryzen 5 1600X clocks up to 4.0Ghz just as it promises on the box, and with AMD’s Ryzen Master software you can take one of the cores all the way up to 4.1GHz. However, don’t expect to get much beyond that without seriously upgrading your cooling solution (read: liquid-nitrogen) and manually tweaking voltages behind the operating system level. The good news is the Ryzen 5 1600X stays at a temperate 50-degrees Celsius while on load using just AMD’s stock Wraith Max air-cooler. Things would likely be even frostier if we mounted a liquid-cooling system. Final verdict There’s a saying that two heads are better than one and, well, six-cores are better than four. The extra processing power of the Ryzen 5 1600X puts Intel’s processors to shame, including both its closest competitor and a much higher-spec Broadwell-E part. If you’ve been looking for an affordable, powerhouse CPU that both works and parties hard, this is it.  That said, to squeeze out all the potential of this surprisingly potent mid-range chip, you’ll want (and need) to splurge on an enthusiast-grade X370 motherboard. While the octo-core and high-price of the AMD Ryzen 1800X seemed like overkill in certain respects, the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X feels like a no brainer for everyone from enthusiasts to artists and regular users who look for an extra bit of power. It’s an affordable and powerful chip for everything the modern gamer and creative needs, with extra headroom to grow.

Closing Thoughts14. View All Pages Ryzen 5 1500X is AMD’s fastest quad-core based on the new Zen architecture. Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) makes this a four-core, eight-thread part that runs at an out-of-the-box frequency of 3.5-3.7GHz, with single-threaded boosts to 3.9GHz under Extended Frequency Range (XFR) conditions. Priced at $189 and shipping with the Wraith Spire cooler, AMD pits overclockable Ryzen 5 4C8T parts against multiplier-locked Core i5 processors from Intel. Logical competitors to the Ryzen 5 1500X are Intel’s Kaby Lake Core i5-7400 and Core i5-7500, depending on e-tailer pricing in the UK. AMD deploys the 4C8T Ryzen 5 1500X CPU as a design utilising dual CPU Complex (CCX) units. This gives the quad-core part a 2+2 design, as opposed to the asymmetrical 3+1 or 4+0 deployments that may have been theoretically possible. The balanced 2+2 design could mean that AMD is able to use Ryzen CCXs that don’t make the grade with all four cores enabled (or three cores that would form Ryzen 5 six-core chips). Other characteristics for the Ryzen 5 1500X are interesting as they distinguish it from the lower-cost quad-core 1400. The full slab of shared L3 cache is retained for the 1500X, with 8MB per CCX being available. That gives an effective 4MB of L3 cache per core (though not dedicated) that is double the available per-core capacity of Ryzen 7 and even higher than Intel’s HEDT processors. L2 cache capacity is still 512KB per core, making the total amount 2MB. Operating frequencies are also interesting for Ryzen 1500X. The base speed is 3.5GHz, with a maximum Precision Boost speed of 3.7GHz under 2-core loading conditions. That means that all-core loads see the chip running at a solid 3.6GHz. Noteworthy, though, is the 200MHz XFR headroom – double that we have seen on any other Ryzen processors to date. This gives the 1500X an ability to clock up to 3.9GHz under single-thread loads. As with all Ryzen parts, an unlocked core ratio multiplier with 0.25x granularity allows for overclocking on supported motherboards. AMD’s well-balanced Wraith Spire is included with the 65W TDP 1500X. This model is, however, different to the Wraith Spire supplied with Ryzen 7 1700 as it does not feature RGB lighting. For reference, Intel’s boxed Core i5 CPUs in this price range also ship with coolers.

Prime competition on the Intel side comes from multiplier-locked Core i5-7500 and Core i5-7400 processors, depending on selling prices in retailers.

View All Pages Enthusiasts have pinned hope on AMD’s eagerly-anticipated Ryzen 5 line-up as a set of processors that can offer competitive performance at an affordable, mid-range price point. The price range in question is currently dominated by Intel’s quad-core Core i5 CPUs that do not feature Hyper-Threading and only get an unlocked multiplier for the highest-end option. AMD is taking the fight to Intel’s $242 multiplier-unlocked 3.8-4.2GHz Core i5-7600K 4C4T processor with a 6C12T Ryzen 5 1600X clocked at 3.6-4.0GHz and retailing for $249. With overclocking the Core i5-7600K to 4.8GHz+ being a known simple procedure, can AMD’s Ryzen 5 1600X leverage its 50% increase in cores and three-times as many threads to compete against the current mid-range champion? The six-core, twelve-thread 1600X comes in as AMD’s Ryzen 5 flagship. Sporting a clock speed of 3.6-4.0GHz using Precision Boost, with up to 4.1GHz under Extended Frequency Range (XFR) conditions, the six-core part is essentially three quarters of a Ryzen 7 1800X. That point holds true for several of the metrics. However, the TDP is still rated at 95W and the twin CPU Complex (CCX) design means that the 1600X retains its full slab of 16MB shared L3 cache. L2 cache tips the scales at the same 512KB per core for all Ryzen processors thus far, giving this six-core part a 3MB capacity. On the topic of the dual CCX design, AMD is deploying Ryzen 5 six-core parts as 3+3 layouts. This means that one CPU core per CCX is disabled before joining the pair of complexes together by AMD’s Infinity Fabric. A 3+3 design should achieve the highest level of balance and it helps to ensure part consistency; opting for 3+3 as well as 4+2 layouts would have introduced manufacturing and performance variations between supposedly identical Ryzen 5 six-core processors. Utilisation of the CCXs in a 3-core capacity may also allow AMD to put defunct Ryzen 7 silicon to effective use. 14nm FinFET manufacturing is not cheap and the less silicon put in the bin, the better. Of course, there’s also the other side of the argument that suggests AMD is manually disabling a single core on the CCXs to achieve market segmentation. If this is true, we could see a return to the good old days of core unlocking on AMD CPUs but we do not know if this will be the case (or if it’s even possible). To say that AM4 is a flexible platform would be an understatement. Like all other Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 5 1600X can be dropped into an AM4 motherboard with no less than five different chipset types. Three of those – the enthusiast X370, mainstream B350, and SFF X300 – support overclocking with Ryzen’s unlocked core multiplier. By comparison, Intel forces you onto its Z270 chipset for overclocking support (and high-speed memory, for that matter) with LGA 1151 CPUs and those boards come with a ~£100 starting price. The logical partner for Ryzen 5 is a B350 chipset motherboard. Compared to the high-end (read: expensive) enthusiast-geared X370 motherboards found partnered with Ryzen 7, B350 forces you to give up PCIe bifurcation thus blocking multi-GPU CrossFire and SLI support, as well as a small number of USB 3.0, SATA 6Gbps, and PCIe 2.0 lanes. You’ll also have to accept the lower quality power delivery solution that vendors tend to create on their B350 motherboards that hover around a £100 sweet-spot. By comparison, £100 gets you an entry-level Intel Z270 motherboard that is short on frills but utilises the feature-rich 200-series chipset.

AMD offers up two more physical cores, which translates into eight additional threads thanks to Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). Meanwhile, Intel puts forward a 4.2GHz maximum Turbo Boost speed and the strong likelihood of a straightforward 4.6GHz+ overclock thanks to the vendor’s refined 14nm+ process technology. Neither processor ships with a cooler, meaning that head-to-head price point comparisons are just that. Cooler Master’s £27 Hyper 212X is the logical partner. Both CPUs should also work fine with DDR4 speeds that are sensible for this price range (3200MHz and below), provided you have a stable BIOS on the accompanying motherboard.

With that said what are the Cinebench IPC score if Intel’s Kady-lake and the AMD Ryzen running at the same clock speed. I would assume you would use the i5 7600K since that is the CPU the Ryzen 5 1600x and 1500x are shooting for both Single and multi threaded scores would be great. For example my i7 2700K gets 184 single and 894 multi @ 5Ghz(5007mhz) I have 5.2Ghz scores as well I just don’t recall them right now they are higher. 5ghz is my 24/7 settings anyway 5.2Ghz is for bench testing and chest thumping…lol It was nice seeing my i7 2700K in the review @4.6Ghz it gives a reference point of where my CPU would sit running at 4.6Ghz against the newer CPU’s thank you for including the older CPU’s. I also just noticed the i5 3570K included.I also have one of those in another system @ 4.6Ghz it is good to see it is also doing good as well.

The idea of getting a moderately powerful PC that fits in the palm of your hand for a bit over $100 seemed crazy just a few years ago, but now, they’re out there, and they’re solid. Chuwi is throwing its name into the mini PC space with its HiBox Hero. It’s quite reasonably priced, coming with a $130 price tag from GearBest. For a powerful PC that runs both Android 5.1 and Windows 10, it’s definitely cheaper than you’d expect. Many of the most popular mini PC models come in the stick form factor Got A PC-on-a-Stick?

The Intel Compute Stick (our thoughts on it  Buying an Intel Compute Stick? 7 Pros and Cons You Must Know Buying an Intel Compute Stick? 7 Pros and Cons You Must Know The Intel Compute Stick wants to be a truly portable PC in your pocket. Read More ) is generally regarded as the king of the sticks, and it comes with a $130 price tag. In the larger mini PC space, the Kangaroo Mobile Desktop is generally considered the best, and its comparable model comes with a $169 price. It also only has Windows 10, while Chuwi’s offering has both Windows 10 and Android. Does having both OSes make this a must-buy mini computer, or does it fall short of the performance you’d want for $130? Let’s find out! Make sure to keep reading through to the end of the review to learn how you can take home a Chuwi HiBox Hero for free, courtesy of GearBest. The Specs Let’s get into the numbers here, as that’s an important factor to consider when you’re looking for a PC. Intel Atom X5-Z8350 quad-core processor 4GB DDR3 RAM Intel HD Graphics 64GB built-in eMMC storage (expandable with SDXC card slot up to 128GB more) Bluetooth 4.0 Dual-band Wi-Fi HDMI version 1.4 (not 4K60 capable) For a mini PC, it’s more or less on par with the other big players on the market. As you’d expect, it’s not going to rival even a mid-range desktop, but with how small and how cheap it is, it’s specs are solid. The Box Let’s take a look at the outside of the Chuwi HiBox Hero before we break down the performance. As for the size of the hardware, it’s 4.72 x 4.72 x 0.98 inches. It only weighs .44 pounds, so it’s definitely small. You’ll find two USB 2.0 ports and an SD card slot on the front of the PC. On the side, there’s a USB 3.0, HDMI, Ethernet, and headphone port. There’s also a DC power adapter. The actual design of the PC is subdued, and it certainly won’t stand out on your entertainment center. It’s a small black box with white logos, so it’ll match whatever you have. Another important thing to note is that the mini PC is basically silent. There are no fans inside, so if you plan on using the PC as a media center, you won’t need to worry about loud fans overpowering your media. Controlling The PC One thing I really love about this PC is that it comes with a remote control right out of the box. For using Kodi or other basic app operations, it’s really all you need to control the PC. If you’re going to be doing more stuff that requires mouse movement, you’ll want a mouse and keyboard, though. Speaking of mice, the remote has a mouse pointer button on it, and it actually lets you move the cursor around as you would a WiiMote How to Use a Wii U Gamepad With a PC How to Use a Wii U Gamepad With a PC The classic Wii U gamepad can be used to play games on Windows . . . and it's a lot easier than it sounds. Read More . In my experience, it was fairly accurate, but I wouldn’t want to use it as my only input method. Because there are three USB ports, you can hook up any standard third-party device like an Xbox controller. You can also connect devices to the PC via Bluetooth, which gives you more options to control the Chuwi HiBox Hero. Android and Windows in Harmony Where the Chuwi HiBox Hero really stands out is in the operating systems. Without any tinkering you’ll get both Android 5.1 and Windows 10. When you turn the PC on, you just click left or right to choose the OS you want, and it’ll load up. When in Windows, there’s an app installed that will let you switch to Android, but if you’re in Android and you want to go back to Windows, you’ll need to restart the device and choose again. Because the internal memory is flash, it boots up quickly, so switching between the two is painless. Out of the box, the 64GB drive is partitioned with Windows getting the lion’s share of the space (you end up with about 40GB of usable space on the Windows side). This makes sense, as Windows apps tend to take up far more space than Android ones. Android Performance I’ll start off by saying that I found the performance of Android to be vastly superior to that of Windows, which makes sense, as it’s an OS designed to run on tablets and other less powerful systems. To test performance, we used the standard Antutu 3DBench, and it scored relatively well. It rated the CPU as mid to high-end, which means it can handle multitasking and large apps without issue. For gaming it recommends running basic games and 3D games at low settings, and in our testing, that’s what we saw. For newer, 3D Android games, framerates were inconsistent, but they remained playable at all times. Basically, you can play some games on this device well enough, but you shouldn’t expect it to be your primary gaming device. It’s a nice bonus to have, but the primary purpose is running media and basic work apps, and it does that well. All the traditional Android features you’d expect are there including full access to the Google Play Store for apps, the web browser, and so on. Speaking of the web browser, we found that it performed quite well (especially when compared to the sluggish performance of the PC browser, as we’ll get to) and loaded pages quickly and efficiently. In terms of real world usage, I found myself gravitating toward running Kodi most of the time, which performed well. It’s easy to install through Google Play. Between 1080p local videos and HD streaming, I never saw any slowdown. While running some unofficial addons, Kodi did crash. At one point, I ran into a loop where Kodi kept crashing at launch each time until I restarted the HiBox Hero. This only happened once, and in all other cases I was able to use it as my primary media center PC without any problems. Windows Performance For all the praise I can throw to Android performance, Windows runs less smoothly. You can pretty much forget about running Google Chrome. For low end devices like this, Edge is definitely the browser to use if you want to get on the web in Windows. However, even in Edge, running 1080p YouTube videos stuttered way too much for my liking. Fortunately, there are plenty of other ways to watch videos on the device. You can download and install Kodi, just like you would on any other PC, and it runs more or less the same as it does on Android. For PC gaming, you can run the absolute basics and nothing more. Even less advanced games run at unplayable framerates. However, if you have a gaming PC in another room, you can use Steam In-Home Streaming Steam In-Home Streaming Now Available To Everyone Steam In-Home Streaming Now Available To Everyone Steam In-Home Streaming, a feature that allows users to broadcast their games from one computer in their home to another, is now available for all Steam users to use. Read More to play games that way, and other than a bit of control latency that comes with playing games over a network, it works quite well. For benchmarks on Windows, we used 3DMark and PCMark. The results were about what we’d expect: middling. Using the PCMARK 8 Home Conventional 3.0 test, it scored a 1036, which is lower than a typical office PC from 2013. It scored decently for basic photo editing and video calling, but for casual gaming, it clocked in at about 6 frames-per-second, which is unplayable. Websites loaded quickly, as expected, and basic word processing was more than usable. Our benchmark tests matched up with the results we found while just using the PC and putting it through its paces. It works well enough for most basic computing tasks, but it’s definitely slower running Windows 10 than Android. Wrapping Up All in all, this is a solid mini PC for the price, though it’s not perfect. Windows performance isn’t amazing when compared to Android, but when you look at it compared to other mini PCs in this range, it’s right on par. It works great as a media player and for doing basic every day computer tasks. It won’t replace a high-end desktop by any means, but it’ll handle all of the basics with ease.

By Roman Loyola Senior Editor, Macworld | Apr 11, 2017 4:58 AM PT Credit: Rob Schultz More like this Which Mac should you buy? Wish list: What I’d like to see in the new Mac Pro What the Mac needs in 2017 Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac When Apple met with select members of the media to talk about the Mac Pro, Apple VPs also mentioned that the company plans to update the iMac this year. The gap between updates for the iMac isn’t as long as the Mac Pro, but it’s been a while. The current iMac was released in October of 2015, well past the yearly updates Apple used to issue. So the iMac is due. Pike’s Universum, which has an eagle eye for finding references to future Apple products in Apple’s operating system code, reported on some specs that could be used for the new iMac—though the site says that the information should be “handled with care/skepticism.” I’ll point out Pike’s findings in each section below, along with my commentary. The latest CPUs Pike’s Universum says that the high-end iMac could have an Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. This is a Xeon processor that’s not on Intel’s E3 v6 Family list, so you can either dismiss it as not true, or it could be a processor not yet developed. Intel does have older Xeon processors with the E3-1285 part number, so it does seem feasible. Intel released the E3-1200 v6 processor family in late March, so if there’s any credence to Pike’s report, it checks a box on my iMac wish list: that Apple use current CPUs, not ones that are a generation behind. It’ll be interesting if Apple decides to go with a quad-core Xeon processor, which is used in professional workstations. During the Mac Pro briefing, the iMac was mentioned as being used by professionals, and since a ship date for the future Mac Pro has not been announced, Apple could want to fill the professional demand in the meantime by offering a super fast iMac. Apple offers multiple models of the iMac, with 21.5- and 27-inch display. You’ll probably see Core i5 or Core i7 processors in the 21.5-inch iMacs, and then a Xeon processor in the 27-inch model. Let’s hope those Core processors are from Intel’s 7th generation. 16GB of memory Pixabay Besides the fast performance, another reason for using a Xeon processor in the high-end iMac is its support for Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM. ECC RAM has a chip that’s dedicated to finding and fixing memory errors. Standard RAM doesn’t have this capability, but it’s also less expensive. So you should experience fewer memory errors when using EEC RAM. What I’d like to see with the iMac is a standard configuration of 16GB of memory. Currently, it’s at 8GB. I’d also like to see Apple make the RAM user accessible on all iMac models, not just on the high-end 27-incher, so you can upgrade to 32GB or 64GB at a later date. Make Fusion Drives standard A solid-state drive would be great because of the speed benefits, but it’s expensive and will drive the price of the iMac up. Apple currently stocks 1TB hard drives in its standard configurations of the iMac, and a 1TB SSD would be really pricey. Pike’s Universum says that the new high-end iMac could have an NVMe SSD, which would be awesome, but there’s still a price consideration for the lower-priced iMacs. Apple A good compromise would be to make a 1TB Fusion Drive standard. A Fusion Drive is a hard drive that’s combined with flash storage and seen on the Mac and a single storage device. This provides fast file access and spacious file storage. A Fusion Drive upgrade for the current iMac is only $100. Hopefully Apple could find a way to offset the cost of making it a part of the standard configuration. Easier to access ports Apple puts its iMac ports on the back, because they’re ugly and they ruin the aesthetic of the iMac’s front appearance. If you need to regularly access those ports, however, it’s annoying. You have to reach around and scrape up the back of the iMac as you try to fit a connector into a port. Or you have to move the iMac itself, which can be disruptive if you have a special hardware setup. Roman Loyola Ports on the Retina 5K iMac. Above the power cable is the cover where users can upgrade RAM. But Apple won’t move the ports from the back. Maybe they have data that shows that it’s not really an issue. Maybe the data they have says customers want a change, but Apple doesn’t care, it’s sticking to its design. I can wish, but I know that in this case, it won’t happen. Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and USB 3 Here’s a wish that has a really good chance of coming true. I can easily see Apple replacing the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the current iMac with Thunderbolt 3/USB-C on the new iMac. I hope Apple retains the other ports on the back of the iMac: USB 3, ethernet, the headphone jack, and the SD card slot. I don’t see a reason for Apple to eliminate these ports, but I can also see Apple deciding to offer only Thunderbolt 3, and then telling people that you can use a dock like CalDigit’s TS 3 Lite ($200 on Amazon). That would mean paying extra money for something that used to be included. But on the bright side, a dock addresses my issue with port access. External GPU support The iMac’s all-in-one design limits the type of GPU that can be used. You can’t use one that generates a lot of heat. But if lots of pros are using iMacs, a pro-class GPU accessible externally would address the needs of graphically-demanding apps. An external GPU is also on my wish list for the Mac Pro. In that article, I said that an external GPU is the type of product you usually wouldn’t see from Apple, but if it can be used by any Mac, it makes it more feasible. And as I noted in the Mac Pro wish list, macOS needs some updating to support an external GPU. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Today, the mid-range Ryzen 5 makes its way to store shelves the world over, including India. We’ve already spoken at length on the new Zen architecture and what makes Ryzen tick. Details of pricing and availability of Ryzen 5 in India have also been covered here. Product Line Model Cores Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) Included Cooler TDP (Watts) Suggested Price, (INR) AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 4 N/A 95 Rs 18,199 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 12 3.2 3.6 Wraith Spire 65 Rs 15,799 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 3.7 Wraith Spire 65 Rs 13,799 AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4 8 3.2 3.4 Wraith Stealth 65 Rs 12,199 Suffice it to say that the Ryzen 5 lineup is priced and positioned squarely against Intel’s Core i5 line and, on paper at least, the comparison is very favourable to AMD. Today, however, let’s take a look at the progress that AMD has made with Ryzen and what it can potentially achieve with the platform. After all, Ryzen isn’t perfect and reviewers have noted a number of performance discrepancies with the platform. Intel is also holding its own on the gaming front, handily beating Ryzen despite offering fewer cores. Ryzen has had an indisputable edge in rendering performance, the massive number of cores in its price range are responsible for that. Ryzen’s new architecture, however, means that a number of applications, particularly games, are unable to take full advantage of these extra cores. Some reviewers have, in fact, found that disabling certain Ryzen features dramatically improves performance in some cases. AMD has also promised that it will work with game developers to optimise games for the platform. With Ryzen 5, this is all the more important because Intel’s Core i5, and the 7600K in particular, has been the king of gaming, and this is the king that AMD has to overthrow if it intends to make a mark. The first game we’ll be looking at has to be Ashes of the Singularity. It’s not a new game and it received an average rating, but it’s been the poster child for multi-threaded and DirectX 12 performance. One might even argue that it’s the sole reason for its existence today. AMD should have had an advantage in this benchmark. The game is supposed to be optimised for multiple cores and AMD’s offerings run at a higher speed when compared to Intel’s offerings with the same number of cores. Strangely enough, Intel still had a significant edge here. AMD worked with Oxide and Stardock, the makers of the game, and released a patch. PC Perspective tested the patch and discovered a 17-30 percent increase in performance on AMD Ryzen chips. This is a huge jump in performance, but as PC Perspective notes, the Ryzen 7 1800x still performs worse than the Intel 6900K. Of course, the 6900K is way more expensive than the 1800x, so when it comes to value for money, even for gaming, AMD is on the right path. ArsTechnica also analysed PC Perspective’s data and have come up with an explanation for Ryzen’s performance irregularities. The first issue, says ArsTechnica, is the way out-of-order execution is handled. Out-of-order execution is a method of pre-emptively performing operations for a program before they’re required by a program and stores the results. A program needs the results of these operations in a specific order, however. If the prediction mechanism is good, all the data a program needs will already be available to it. If the prediction wasn’t accurate or there was some error, that stored data will be useless and will need to be discarded. Regardless of the penalties of having to discard data, the advantage of predicting required data by utilising unused processing power is usually worth it. ArsTechnica believes that AMD’s new architecture means that this code hasn’t yet been optimised for it. The result is bad predictions, wasted clock cycles and a drop in performance. AMD is now championing the use of modern compilers like Visual C++ 2017, which better support Ryzen. The second issue that was discovered relates to the handling of CPU cache. CPU cache is memory that’s on the CPU die itself. This cache is blisteringly quick and absolutely essential for fast operations. The cache itself is rather small, however, usually 2-16 MB, and sometimes, it just makes more sense to use system memory, like RAM. When it’s known that the results of certain instructions aren’t required immediately, they’ll be sent to the slower RAM. Instructions called non-temporal instructions bypass the cache and write straight to RAM. If not handled correctly, however, these instructions can severely limit performance. ArsTechnica suggests that Ashes of the Singularity did something with non-temporal instructions that just didn’t work for Ryzen, while having no impact on Intel performance. Yet another issue affecting game performance, it turns out, is how Ryzen handled power consumption. Apparently, cores can be parked, i.e., inactive cores can be powered down when not needed. This is useful for saving on power, but the increased latency in powering the core back on can be detrimental to overall performance. In Rome: Total War, it was noted that core parking resulted in an 11 percent performance hit on Ryzen. AMD has since released a new power management profile to better handle this issue. Lastly, the strangest issue with Ryzen is the fact that its’ performance is literally tied to RAM speed. A lower RAM clock speed means that your Ryzen CPU’s performance will drop. By design, Ryzen is made up of blocks of 4 cores each. These blocks communicate with each other at a speed determined by RAM clocks, hence Ryzen’s heavy dependence on RAM speed. The problem here is consistency, with different combinations of boards, RAM and processors giving different results. Firmware upgrades are slowly being rolled out to deal with the issue. These issues and a number of others dealing with thread counts, instruction sets and a whole lot else are causing the performance issues with Ryzen. Zen is a new architecture, after all, and these initial teething troubles are expected. AMD’s Travis Kirsch at the Ryzen 5 unveiling We spoke to Travis Kirsch, who heads product management at AMD, and asked him about AMD’s work on improving gaming performance on the platform. While he didn’t reveal any details of the work, he assured us that AMD was working with some of the biggest developers to ensure that their titles were fully compatible with Ryzen and would perform optimally. A new architecture is a complicated thing of course, and judging by what we’ve seen so far, it does take some effort to get things working perfectly on Ryzen. Older games may not ever be updated to work better on Ryzen, but with newer titles, this is more likely. Game developers haven’t bothered building their games with support for anything more than 4 cores because they never had to. The Intel Core i5 is the standard gaming CPU today, so why bother? With Ryzen undercutting Intel’s CPUs on price and doubling the core count, the base line for number of cores just went up. Also, as Kirsch explained to us, Intel’s been making 14 nm chips for years now. This is only AMD’s first attempt, and it’s already threatening Intel’s dominion in the PC space. Overtime, things can only improve.

By John Ribeiro Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 11, 2017 3:55 AM PT Credit: Ann Singer More like this Apple sues Qualcomm over patent licensing and $1B in payments Qualcomm CEO slams Apple for 'without merit' lawsuits Apple takes patent battle with Qualcomm to China Video Hands on with Launchboom's do-everything wearable, Pinn Qualcomm is seeking damages from Apple, alleging that the iPhone maker interfered with long-term agreements between the chip company and licensees that manufacture the iPhone and iPad, and encouraged actions by regulators against the company by giving government agencies “false and misleading information.” Apple did not use certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7, claims Qualcomm. When iPhones with the Qualcomm chipset still outperformed iPhones that used a chipset from key rival Intel, Apple is said to have publicly claimed that there was “no discernible difference” between iPhones using Intel chipsets and those using Qualcomm chipsets, when it knew the opposite to be true, according to a filing Monday by Qualcomm. Apple warned that if Qualcomm were to make or sponsor public comparisons of the Intel and Qualcomm-based iPhones, Apple would use the marketing resources at its disposal to “retaliate” against Qualcomm and its standing as an Apple chipset supplier would be jeopardized. The filing Monday by Qualcomm in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California is in response to a lawsuit Apple filed against the company in January, accusing the chip supplier of charging “exorbitant” licensing fees for its cellular technology. Apple is seeking nearly US$1 billion in compensation for paying excessive royalties to Qualcomm. The company said in its filing in January that Qualcomm’s licensing model is based on the final selling price of a device, so that the royalty paid for its standard-essential patents by makers of high-value phones will be higher than that paid by makers of basic cell phones. The smallest salable unit for a cellular SEP license should be no greater than the baseband processor chipset, Apple argued. It also wants Qualcomm to negotiate single-patent licenses rather than offer a license to its patents as a single portfolio. Both companies have a lot at stake in the dispute. Apple would like to find ways to lower the cost of its iPhones, particularly in newer, price-sensitive markets, while Qualcomm makes a significant portion of its revenue from licensing its intellectual property. In its response Monday, Qualcomm portrays Apple as using its considerable power to try to get lower royalty rates from the chip company. After filing the lawsuit in the court in California, Apple also sued Qualcomm in China, the U.K. and Japan as part of “its aggressive strategy of constructing commercial disputes and then claiming it has been victimized,” according to the filing. On Monday, when asked for comment, a spokesman for Apple referred back to the company’s statement in January in which it claimed that Qualcomm had insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. “The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations,” the iPhone maker said in that statement, when filing the suit against Qualcomm in the California court. Apple said that Qualcomm has taken “increasingly radical steps,” including most recently by withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for its “truthful responses” to law enforcement agencies investigating the chip company. Qualcomm holds that “late-comer” Apple contributed virtually nothing to the development of core cellular technology and has depended heavily on Qualcomm technology to become the dominant player in the cellphone market. “Now, Apple wants to pay far less than fair value for a license to Qualcomm’ s patents,” it added. The chip maker alleged that Apple interfered, and continues to interfere, with the chip maker’s long- standing contracts with the manufacturers of Apple’s cellular devices, leading them to withhold certain royalties owed to Qualcomm, according to the redacted filing. The contracts with manufacturers like Compal, Wistron, Pegatron and Foxconn were signed even before Apple started using Qualcomm chipsets in its products. Rather than enter into a contract directly with Qualcomm, Apple chose to rely on the contracts Qualcomm had with the manufacturers. The chip maker also claims that Apple has withheld money owed to Qualcomm under another contract relating to a high-speed feature of its chipset. In negotiations between the two companies for a patent agreement, Apple is said to have offered to pay Qualcomm royalties per phone that would be “a small fraction of the royalty” paid by other smartphone vendors. Qualcomm also accuses Apple of giving false information to regulators. The chip company was fined in December by South Korea’s antitrust regulator for violating antitrust laws. By January, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission accused it in a lawsuit of strong-arming phone makers into accepting unfair licensing terms while giving Apple a break in exchange for exclusivity. The chip company now charges that Apple misled the Korea Fair Trade Commission on August 17, 2016 , by testifying, for example,  that “Apple has yet to add a [second chipset] supplier because of Qualcomm’s exclusionary conduct”. Apple had already at the time added Intel as a second baseband chip supplier and purchased Intel chips to include in the iPhone 7, which was only a few weeks away from its September release, according to the filing.

It’s a relationship which is starting to turn very bitter, reminiscent of when Britney and JT went through their public break-up, as lawsuits are flying all over the place. We’re not too sure whether we’re in Silicon Valley or Heathrow Terminal 5, but keep your head down, it looks like things are about to turn nasty. “Qualcomm is the world leader in inventing and developing fundamental, ground-breaking mobile technologies that enable the worldwide mobile ecosystem. Today, Qualcomm’s patented technologies remain the primary value driver for mobile devices,” Qualcomm’s General Counsel, Don Rosenberg very humbly stated. “Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90%  of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies.” Qualcomm has a few grievances with the iLife leader, but perhaps the most damning is the accusation Apple purposely inhibited the performance of its chips to demonstrate competitor chips were more suited. It would appear Qualcomm is claiming Apple is trying to be cute to get away from the now-turbulent relationship, though how much truth there is in the accusation remains to be seen. In recent months, Apple has released various devices in the US running modem chips from both Intel and Qualcomm. Following analysis, Apple has suggested devices powered by Intel performed better, which has not been received well by chip-maker. It’s a curious turn of events when you take into account Intel’s ‘varied experiences’ when it comes to cracking the smartphone market in recent years. The original lawsuit looked as though Apple was trying to put as much space between the two companies as possible, as it attacked Qualcomm’s chequered reputation as a market bully. Qualcomm has been accused of inflating prices through its licensing model, but also charging Apple for patents which it had nothing to do with, including TouchID, display panels and camera components. In retaliation, Qualcomm has accused Apple of breaching agreements and encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements. The relationship is turning very bitter, and who knows if there is a way to salvage it. “Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well-established and continuing value of those technologies,” said Rosenberg. “It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” It certainly has been a couple of weeks of upheaval at the smartphone giant, as the team has also ended its long-standing relationship with Imagination Technology from whom it licensed GPU designs. That is certainly one move which could end in tears, as Imagination patent lawyers will be on high alert, eager to sue should Apple infringe its IP with its own designs. Apple certainly isn’t shy about taking on suppliers on multiple fronts, but there is one thing you can guarantee over the next couple of months; Apple’s lawyers are going to be pretty busy.

Stock Skyrocketed 34.5% in March The auto-driving vehicle technology company is being acquired. Here's what investors need to know. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Apr 11, 2017 at 7:00AM What happened Shares of Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) jumped 34.5% in the month of March, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the company agreed to be acquired by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). So what More specifically, on March 13, 2017, Mobileye revealed it had entered a definitive agreement under which Intel will acquire all of its outstanding issued and ordinary shares for $63.54 per share in cash -- a more than 34% premium to Mobileye's closing price the day before the announcement. That also represented an equity value of roughly $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion. IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL. "The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles," the companies stated at the time. "Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030." Now what Of course, 2030 is a long way off. But in the meantime, Intel anticipates the acquisition to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow immediately after the deal's expected close within the next eight months or so -- that is, assuming the transaction receives the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals between now and then. With shares of Mobileye currently trading at less than 3% below the agreed acquisition price -- and assuming waiting to sell won't result in more favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment -- I think investors would do well to take their profits off the table and put them to work elsewhere.

Although the Cupertino company managed to update it three years ago, the updates then were somewhat dated. Furthermore, many users complained of some performance bottlenecking that is not justified by its premium price tag. Now, Apple is trying to reinvigorate its high-end workstation by announcing the Mac Pro 2018. In a recent press junket, Apple has acknowledged the fact that the Mac Pro 2013 is somewhat lacking in terms of performance. Even though the workstation is equipped with an Intel Xeon processor, it does not change the fact that it was a year older even when the Mac Pro 2013 was released. Because of this, many have argued what Apple should have done on the Mac Pro to make it a better machine. Modular design Right off the bat, this is perhaps one of the best announcements on the Mac Pro 2018 from Apple. In the said junket, the company’s executives were up front with the elephant in the room, which is the Mac Pro design. They were aware that the current design is somewhat detrimental in maximizing the potential of the workstation. As anyone would know by now, there are no options for other third-party hardware like a graphics card from either NVIDIA or AMD. 2006 Mac Pro (via memoryamerica.com) Based on this, it seems like Apple is reverting to the original 2006 design of the Mac Pro. On the Mac Pro 2018, users will be able to once again add third-party hardware on their systems. Skylake-EP with multiple processor support This is probably one of the most obvious differentiators between the next generation iMac and the Mac Pro 2018. The Mac Pro 2018 could offer multiple processor support for a single board, just like the 2006 Mac Pro. While this may drive the cost up, consumers can still opt to buy the second processor outside of Apple to save a few hundred or thousand dollars. In addition to multiple processor support, the chip would also need to be new. And since the development cycle of a server-grade processor is considerable slower than that of a desktop, an Intel Xeon E5 2600 V5 series will suffice. Although by the time Apple has released the upcoming Mac Pro, this chip will be about a year old. Mac Pro motherboard showing dual processor support (via anandtech.com) More third-party hardware support At the moment, Apple uses AMD GPUs on the current Mac Pro line. However, since NVIDIA will be releasing the latest Mac drivers for its line of graphics cards, more third-party devices will be able to work with the Mac Pro 2018. In addition to the graphics card, Apple could also include support for Intel NVMe storage like the new Intel Optane. That is not to say that Apple does not have a fast NVMe storage solution. Being able to have an option is always a welcomed feature. While it may seems like not a big deal at all, being able to add a third-party RAM module is a welcomed treat. Apple is not really forgiving when it comes to third-party hardware. Nevertheless, there are hopes that the Mac Pro 2018 will bring the feature back to the Mac ecosystem once again. New Apple display Since the Mac Pro is essentially a headless computer, a user will still need a display in order to use it properly. Apple has already made it clear that it will once again revisit the idea of making its own display like the original Apple Cinema display. While details are yet unclear, many speculate that the display in question will have an 8K resolution and quite possible a Thunderbolt 3.0 interface. As for the size, one can expect it to be between 27 and 32 inches. Touch and pen input for Apple display? Everyone knows that when it comes to desktop computing, Apple is not a fan of touch displays. For years, it has avoided that topic by introducing another technology to replace it. Even the current MacBook Pro does not have touch display support. Instead, Apple opted for the Touch Bar; a small strip of touch-enabled OLED display atop the keyboard. Of course, if Apple decides to finally break and add touch support on the Apple Display, a stylus of pen support is only fitting. This feature will bring in a whole new number of features for the Mac Pro 2018, especially for content creators. Microsoft Surface Studio offers touch and pen support (via store.microsoft.com) Unfortunately, Apple was very adamant that the company will not be using touch displays on any Mac anytime soon. Nevertheless, this will be a welcomed addition especially for professionals who choose the Mac Pro for its performance. Mac Pro 2018 price and release date For now, one can only guess how much the Mac Pro 2018 will be. However, judging by the past models, this thing will not come cheap. Consumers can expect to shell out a minimum of $2,000 for the entry-level system Mac Pro 2018. As for the higher-end of the spectrum, it could be anybody’s guess. If Apple decides to include multiple processor support, it will definitely drive the price up. The latest six-core Xeon processor costs around $885 per chip. However, coming from Apple, this could easily be sold for more than $1,000. As for the release date, if Apple wants the Mac Pro 2018 to stay relevant a bit longer, it will opt for a release in the first half of 2018. At that time, the Skylake-EP Intel Xeon processor will only be a few months old. In any case, we are barely at the start of the second quarter of 2017. There are roughly nine more months for Apple to nail the design of the Mac Pro 2018. Another option for Apple is an autumn of 2018 release, just like the MacBook Pro. However, if Apple will be releasing a MacBook Pro update in 2018, there is a strong chance that it will not have the Mac Pro 2018 released on the same event. Readers should note that these are nothing but speculations made on recent announcements and market movements. For more updates on the Mac Pro 2018, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Raspberry Pi 3 gets Microsoft Cortana with Windows 10 Creators Update Users will now be able to make cool devices with Cortana built in Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 11 April, 2017 06:49 0 - - - - print email You will very soon be able to use Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant with the Raspberry Pi 3 and make cool devices that can accept voice commands. But for that, you'll need to upgrade the popular developer board, which can run Windows 10 IoT Core, to the Creators Update of the OS. You'll be able to use Cortana on Raspberry Pi similar to the way it works on PCs. You'll be able to ask for weather, time, traffic, or stock prices. Users will also able to build smart devices using Raspberry Pi 3 that will be able to accept Cortana's commands. But the devices will need to be based on Windows 10 IoT Core, not Linux-based OSes. Customized commands can be programmed for devices and could be related to reminders, look-ups, mapping, events, news, dictionary, and other "skills." Microsoft mentions one Cortana functionality called "chit chat," which could refer to chatbots. That's a direct attack on Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant voice assistant technologies, which are being programmed into more smart devices. Many enthusiasts are developing smart devices but can't slip in personal assistant features. Microsoft is making that much easier with the Creators Update to Windows 10 IoT Core. Microsoft is pursuing an aggressive smart home strategy via Cortana, and the addition of the personal assistant to Windows 10 IoT Core could be a big piece in the strategy. Outside Raspberry Pi 3, Microsoft's Windows IoT Core also works with other boards and computers. Creators Update adds support for Intel's Compute Sticks and also base support for Intel chips code-named Apollo Lake. The OS already supports boards like Intel's Joule and MinnowBoard. But board enthusiasts will need to take some considerations into account if they want to use Cortana with the Windows 10 IoT Core developer boards. Cortana needs microphones and speakers, and the options there are limited. The Creators Update supports only Logitech's S150 USB speakers, and the microphone options include Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000, Sound Tech CM-1000USB Table Top Conference Meeting Microphone, and Blue Microphones Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone/Cardioid. Other improvements with Creators Update include support for more Adafruit peripherals that are widely used to make smart devices. Additionally, the OS adds supports for autodiscovery of smart devices in which you are logged in, which was considered an issue earlier. This change is likely due to the integration of IoTivity IoT protocols from Open Connectivity Foundation, which helps establish secure connections between IoT devices. The OS adds supports for new ARM PCI bus interconnects. Many low-power smart devices with Windows IoT Core use ARM CPUs but don't use the PCI interconnect, which is used in PCs. This is a feature aimed more at high-powered developer boards that don't operate on battery. You will need to flash Creators Update on the developer boards using the Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard. You will need to provide special permission to activate Cortana, much like when setting up Windows 10 desktop on PCs. Creators Update will roll out starting on Tuesday.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

According to a report from BenchLife, Intel’s high-end desktop components are set to drop between week 25 and week 27 of this year. A quick check of the calendar shows that to be between June 19 and July 9, or a little over two months away at the soonest. The publication previously reported that Intel planned to launch a new X299 chipset at Gamescom in late August. Given the revised timeframe, one would think that we’ll see the new chipset and CPUs debut at Computex which kicks off on May 30 and runs through June 3 in Taipei. As The Tech Report notes, Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X are expected to share the same LGA 2066 socket. Skylake-X processors are said to pack anywhere between six to 10 cores, support quad-channel DDR4 memory and have loads of PCIe 3.0 lanes. Kaby Lake-X parts, meanwhile, are reportedly limited to just four cores, dual-channel memory and far fewer PCIe lanes. BenchLife has a solid track record with hardware rumors although as always, keep in mind that nothing is for certain until it comes out of the horse’s mouth.

Apple did not use certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7, claims Qualcomm. When iPhones with the Qualcomm chipset still outperformed iPhones that used a chipset from key rival Intel, Apple is said to have publicly claimed that there was “no discernible difference” between iPhones using Intel chipsets and those using Qualcomm chipsets, when it knew the opposite to be true, according to a filing Monday by Qualcomm. Apple warned that if Qualcomm were to make or sponsor public comparisons of the Intel and Qualcomm-based iPhones, Apple would use the marketing resources at its disposal to “retaliate” against Qualcomm and its standing as an Apple chipset supplier would be jeopardized. The filing Monday by Qualcomm in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California is in response to a lawsuit Apple filed against the company in January, accusing the chip supplier of charging "exorbitant" licensing fees for its cellular technology. Apple is seeking nearly US$1 billion in compensation for paying excessive royalties to Qualcomm. The company said in its filing in January that Qualcomm's licensing model is based on the final selling price of a device, so that the royalty paid for its standard-essential patents by makers of high-value phones will be higher than that paid by makers of basic cell phones. The smallest salable unit for a cellular SEP license should be no greater than the baseband processor chipset, Apple argued. It also wants Qualcomm to negotiate single-patent licenses rather than offer a license to its patents as a single portfolio. Both companies have a lot at stake in the dispute. Apple would like to find ways to lower the cost of its iPhones, particularly in newer, price-sensitive markets, while Qualcomm makes a significant portion of its revenue from licensing its intellectual property. In its response Monday, Qualcomm portrays Apple as using its considerable power to try to get lower royalty rates from the chip company. After filing the lawsuit in the court in California, Apple also sued Qualcomm in China, the U.K. and Japan as part of “its aggressive strategy of constructing commercial disputes and then claiming it has been victimized,” according to the filing. On Monday, when asked for comment, a spokesman for Apple referred back to the company's statement in January in which it claimed that Qualcomm had insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations," the iPhone maker said in that statement, when filing the suit against Qualcomm in the California court. Apple said that Qualcomm has taken “increasingly radical steps,” including most recently by withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for its "truthful responses" to law enforcement agencies investigating the chip company. Qualcomm holds that “late-comer” Apple contributed virtually nothing to the development of core cellular technology and has depended heavily on Qualcomm technology to become the dominant player in the cellphone market. “Now, Apple wants to pay far less than fair value for a license to Qualcomm’ s patents,” it added. The chip maker alleged that Apple interfered, and continues to interfere, with the chip maker’s long- standing contracts with the manufacturers of Apple’s cellular devices, leading them to withhold certain royalties owed to Qualcomm, according to the redacted filing. The contracts with manufacturers like Compal, Wistron, Pegatron and Foxconn were signed even before Apple started using Qualcomm chipsets in its products. Rather than enter into a contract directly with Qualcomm, Apple chose to rely on the contracts Qualcomm had with the manufacturers. The chip maker also claims that Apple has withheld money owed to Qualcomm under another contract relating to a high-speed feature of its chipset. In negotiations between the two companies for a patent agreement, Apple is said to have offered Apple to pay Qualcomm royalties per phone that would be “a small fraction of the royalty” paid by other smartphone vendors. Qualcomm also accuses Apple of giving false information to regulators. The chip company was fined in December by South Korea’s antitrust regulator for violating antitrust laws. By January, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission accused it in a lawsuit of strong-arming phone makers into accepting unfair licensing terms while giving Apple a break in exchange for exclusivity. The chip company now charges that Apple misled the Korea Fair Trade Commission on August 17, 2016 , by testifying, for example, that “Apple has yet to add a [second chipset] supplier because of Qualcomm’s exclusionary conduct”. Apple had already at the time added Intel as a second baseband chip supplier and purchased Intel chips to include in the iPhone 7, which was only a few weeks away from its September release, according to the filing. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Using any of these methods, you can rotate your desktop screen easily. In the following list, I have added few methods which rely on third party software, while some of them can do that using Windows native features. Using all of these methods, you can rotate your desktop screen in 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. I don’t know why you will want to rotate your desktop screen, but the methods that can help you do that are mentioned below. Sponsored Links 5 Methods To Rotate Windows Desktop Screen Method 1: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using Windows 10 Display Settings The very first method in my list to rotate Window desktop screen uses  the native Display settings. And in Windows 10 you an easily find them and use to change the orientation of you monitor. Using this method, you can easily rotate your desktop screen in all the four rotations. You can rotate your desktop screen in Portrait, Landscape, Portrait flipped, and Landscape flipped. Using this method to rotate Windows desktop screen is very easy. Just right click on the desktop and then choose Display Setting option. After that, Settings windows will pop up. Navigate to the Orientation drop-down and choose the rotation method that you want. Now, hit the Apply button and your desktop will be rotated according to the rotation you chose. You can see the above screenshot. Method 2: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using Intel Graphics Options You may be aware of Intel Graphics as it is the most common display driver software for PCs. If you thought that it can only make the computer display better, then now you need to know that it can do much more than that. Using Intel Graphics options, you can easily change various settings of your PC monitor including rotation. And also there are some hotkeys predefined in the software to do that. If you already have Intel Graphics software installed on your PC, then you can easily rotate windows desktop. Intel Graphics drivers are model specific so I cannot provide a download link to that. So, yo will have to download them from your computer manufacturer website. I am assuming that there is already Intel Graphics software available on your PC. To rotate Windows desktop screen using Intel Graphics options, use the desktop’s right-click menu and then choose Graphics options from it. After that, from the main Interface choose the rotation that you like to have on your PC. Method 3: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using a GUI based Software Till now, I have shown you methods to rotate desktop screen which don’t need any third party software. But, now I will tell you about a freeware known as iRotate that can do the same. iRotate can rotate your desktop screen all the four possible orientations and by just a single click or via hotkey. Download and install iRotate from the above link and then launch it. You will see that it will place its icon in the system tray. Right-click on its icon and it will show the four rotation options in it. Choose any rotation option and the selected rotation will be applied to your desktop screen. Also, you can use the hotkeys (Ctrl +Alt + arrow keys) to do the same while the software is running. Method 4: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using another software EeeRotate is another free software to rotate Windows desktop screen. The software is quite unique among all the software as it operates by hotkeys rather than a GUI or commands. In order to make it work , you just have to keep it running in the system background. And use various hotkeys to rotate desktop screen. It adds its icon in the system tray. Getting started with EeeRotate is pretty simple. Download the setup file of EeeRotate from the above link and then install it on your PC. Do note that, the software will not appear in the Start Menu or Desktop. You will have to run it by double clicking on its EXE file which can be found at C:\Program Files (x86)\EeeRotate folder of your PC. After running the software, you can use Ctrl+Alt+ arrow keys to rotate you desktop by 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. But make sure that the software is running in the background. Method 5: Rotate Windows Desktop Screen using a Command line software. Apart from using a GUI based software, there is a command line software known as Display, that lets you rotate display from command prompt. To rotate Windows desktop using this command line tool, you will have to run certain commands. Alternatively, you can make the batch file for each rotation and execute it whenever you want to rotate your desktop. Apart from rotating the desktop screen, you can also do various other tasks such as change brightness, contrast (Display adapter dependent), display properties, turn off the monitor, etc. To get started with Desktop, grab its EXE file from the above link and then copy it to the C:\Windows folder. After that, you can run display commands from any location of your PC. To change the rotation of your desktop using Display software, run the following command. display /rotate:90 After running the above command, you desktop will be rotated by 90 degrees. You can replace 90 with 180, 270 to rotate and put 0 for normal orientation. Final Words These were some pretty cool methods to rotate Windows desktop screen. All of these method do what they say and you can apply them on your PC to rotate your desktop. By the way, why are you trying to rotate your desktop? Do let me know in the comments below.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Qualcomm fires back at Apple suit, files countersuit seeking damage Apple filed a $1 billion lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against Qualcomm earlier this year, saying that Qualcomm has been charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. Today Qualcomm has responded to Apple suit over patent licensing and has also filed countersuit including charge of limiting performance of Qualcomm modem chips in iPhone 7. It said that Apple is preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm’s innovation; and then, when the Qualcomm-based iPhones still outperformed the Intel-based iPhones, Apple falsely claimed that there was “no discernible difference” between iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets and iPhones with Intel’s chipsets, and (ii) acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets. “Apple’s goal is clear—to leverage its immense power to force Qualcomm into accepting less than fair value for the patented technologies that have led innovation in cellular technology and helped Apple generate more than $760 billion in iPhone sales,” said Qualcomm in the lawsuit. Qualcomm said that it seeks damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple. The filing outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcommm said: Qualcomm is the world leader in inventing and developing fundamental, ground-breaking mobile technologies that enable the worldwide mobile ecosystem. Today, Qualcomm’s patented technologies remain the primary value driver for mobile devices. The value of our inventions has been proven through hundreds of license agreements, negotiated and renegotiated over almost three decades, with virtually every significant handset maker in history, including the companies in Asia that have manufactured Apple iPhones and iPads. Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.

Matthew Heller April 7, 2017 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* In the second insider trading case arising from the $15.3 billion takeover of Mobileye NV by Intel, two Virginia men have been charged with making $925,000 in illicit profits based on nonpublic information about the pending deal. The U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission accused Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul of “highly suspicious” transactions, alleging they acquired Mobileye shares and call options after the adult children of two Mobileye founders told Shaoul’s adult children, with whom they were friends, about Intel’s interest in the maker of sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles. Recommended Stories: Two CFOs Tell a Tale of Fraud at HealthSouth Former EY Auditor Charged With Insider Trading Former iPayment Execs Charged With $11M Fraud After the takeover was announced on March 13, Mobileye shares rose 28.2% in one day. The charges filed Wednesday against Cluff and Shaoul came nearly two weeks after the SEC brought a similar case against two Israeli residents, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman, who allegedly generated more than $4.9 million in gains by trading illegally in Mobileye stock. According to the SEC, the defendants in both cases were connected to Mobileye through the academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and where Shaoul, an Israeli citizen, had studied. The SEC said Cluff and Shaoul traded in two accounts held in Cluff’s name, including one that had been dormant for six years and one opened on Jan. 29, 2017, around the time Mobileye and Intel began formal merger talks. On Feb. 1, Cluff allegedly used the new account to acquire 3,782 Mobileye shares at a cost of nearly $161,500. By March 10 — the last trading day before the announcement of the takeover — the account held 3,414 Mobileye shares and 1,209 call options with strike prices between $50 and $55, the SEC said. Mobileye shares closed at $47.27 on March 10. After the announcement of Intel’s $63.54-per-share-offer, Cluff allegedly sold 862 Mobileye call options for proceeds of $617,563 and, according to the SEC, his accounts have unrealized gains of approximately $335,000. The SEC has obtained a court order freezing assets of Cluff and Shaoul.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] 5 Best Chromebooks for 2017 Kevin Purcell04/08/2017 The Chromebook comes of age in 2017 thanks to some beautiful hardware designs and the Android apps available on every Chromebook released this year. We’ve got our list of the five best Chromebooks for 2017 so far. Google surprised the Chromebook market when they quit selling their high-end Chromebook Pixel last year. Fans who want a Chromebook with some high-end hardware had to pick one up on the second-hand market or look elsewhere. Now, in 2017, they have some options that compare favorably to the Chromebook Pixel, but don’t cost nearly as much. Samsung Chromebook Plus and Samsung Chromebook Pro We’re counting these two Chromebooks as one because they resemble each other in every way except for two key details. First, there’s the name difference. Second, the Pro uses an Intel Core m3 processor while the Plus has Samsung’s ARM processor. That makes the Pro faster than the Plus, but it also reduces battery life a little from about 12 hours on the Plus to closer to 9 hours for the Pro. These features add up to make the new Samsung Chromebooks two of the best Chromebooks for 2017. The Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro comes in a beautiful aluminum chassis with a 12.3-inch screen that’s beautifully bright and sharp. It has a 2400 x 1600 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio. The aspect ratio makes it a great choice for use as a tablet with the Chromebooks’ convertible design. The system runs at an effective resolution of 1200 x 800 thanks to the scaling handled by ChromeOS, but users can make full use of the higher level if they want. However, text will appear microscopic in many cases. Samsung sets their newest Chromebook apart from the others by giving it the S Pen stylus that used to only come on the Samsung Galaxy Note smart phones and tablets. This makes it the best choice for students, business people, and artists. Students and business people can use it to take notes or draw diagrams while artists can sketch or paint with it. The stereo speakers face down and do not produce as much sound, which becomes a problem in loud rooms. Other key specs include the following: Processor: Hexa-core Dual ARM Cortex A72 or Quad Cortex A52 for Plus and Intel Core m3 for Pro Display: 12.3-inch 2400 x 1600 resolution, touchscreen with active stylus S-Pen feature and 3:2 aspect ratio Memory: 4GB Storage: 32GB eMMC flash storage Graphics: Integrated Sound and Camera: Built-in stereo speakers and 720 webcam, internal mic and a combo audio port Wireless: 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 Ports: 2 USB-C ports, 1 combo audio port, micro-SD card slot Input: S-Pen, Touchscreen, Keyboard and Trackpad Battery Life: Up to 12 hours for Plus and up to 9 hours for Pro Get the Samsung Chromebook Plus now for $449.99 direct from Samsung. The Samsung Chromebook Pro becomes available in April 2017. HP Chromebook 13 HP brings us another high-end Chromebook costing just over $500.  The HP Chromebook 13 with its beautiful brushed aluminum design is slightly larger than the Samsung above at 13-inches. It adds something that aficionados of the best Chromebooks miss in the Samsung, a backlit keyboard. The 13-inch screen doesn’t fold back to use in tablet mode like the others, but it does sport an amazing 3200 x 1800 resolution in even the least expensive version. That’s going to give users some amazingly sharp text and images. Some lower priced models will only ship with a 1920 x 108o, however. HP threw in an Intel Core m7 processor in the high-end model and 16GB of memory for over-the-top performance. The price also jumps to nearly $2000 making the old Chromebook Pixel look like a bargain. Don’t worry, because the models that cost between $500-$700 will run fast, too. You’ll also enjoy a long battery life at over 11 hours (advertised). Check out the rest of the specs below: Processor: Intel Pentium up to and Intel Core m7 processor Memory: 4GB up to 16GB Storage: 32GB eMMC flash storage Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 Ports: 2 USB-C ports, 1 USB 3.1 port, 1 SD-card slot, and 1 combo audio port Audio and Camera: stereo speakers and HD TrueVision Camera Input: Keyboard and Trackpad Acer Chromebook 14 The Acer Chromebook 14 offers one of the best Chromebooks for people on a budget who still want a larger machine. This one costs just $263.99 at CDW and under $300 at the other online stores we checked. In addition to a low price, it also sports a beautiful brushed aluminum design with a nice 14-inch IPS display. Acer advertises this Chromebook’s durability as a primary feature. That makes it a good choice for the road warrior or her child. Thanks to the 12 hours of advertised battery life, the Acer Chromebook 14 should last long enough to get through the day for either of them. The base model ships with an Intel Celeron N3060 dual-core processor, 4GB of RAM and only 16GB of storage. The screen resolution comes in at 1280 x 720, a bit low for a 14-inch display. The keyboard and trackpad should give any touch typist plenty of room. Instead of going with the lower priced model, choose the one with the higher full 1080p resolution screen, faster Intel Celeron 3160 dual-core processor and 32GB of storage. You can find it at Best Buy for only $27 more. You can also head over to Amazon and find it in Gold or Silver for under $300.   Detailed specs on the Acer Chromebook 14: Intel Celeron processors with 3060 or 3160 dual-core available 4GB of RAM 16 or 32GB of storage 14-inch IPS display with resolution of 1280 x 720 or 1920 x 1080 powered by Intel HD Graphics 400 3.42lbs and .7-inches thin, 13.4-inches wide and 9.3-inches deep Bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi HDMI out, headphone mic combo port, 2 USB 3.0 ports 12-hour 3-cell battery ASUS Chromebook Flip C302A Acer updated their popular ASUC Chromebook Flip this year bring us the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302A. It’s a $500 convertible touchscreen device that works well as an Android tablet and a Chromebook laptop for those who don’t mind a tiny screen and keyboard. It has a nice 12.5-inch touchscreen with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. The screen folds back almost 360 degrees to give users a tablet they can hold in their hands. It also functions in tent mode or stand mode for viewing content on the screen. The larger screen, compared to the earlier model, works better in laptop mode. It’s a big improvement over the old one, which felt too small for adults to type on or even view content. ASUS also improved the keyboard. It works better and feels better to type on compared to last year’s Flip. They also gave it a backlight. Detailed specs list: Intel Core M 6Y30, 6Y75 or Pentium 4405Y processors 4 or 8GB of RAM 32, 64 or 128GB of RAM 12.5-inch touchscreen with 1920 x 1080 resolution Backlit chiclet style keyboard 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 2 USB-C ports, 1 micro-SD card slot and 1 audio combo port 2-cell battery with up to 10 hours of life HD webcam 1.2lbs and 304x210x13.7cm dimensions Dell Chromebook 11 (3189 Education 2-in-1) Dell makes the Dell Chromebook 11 3189 model for the education market, but it’s a great option for home users as well. The convertible 2-in-1 design means it behaves as a nice ultra-portable laptop and converts to a tablet when you fold the screen back nearly 360 degrees. 1 – Combo audio port, 2 – Noble Wedge Lock slot, 3 – Activity Light, 4 – AC Power, 5 – USB Card Reader, 6 – HDMI, 7 – USB 3.1 ports The base model, $349 Dell Chromebook 11, has an 11.6-inch touchscreen display with a 1366 x 768 resolution.

Emergent Tech Artificial Intelligence Nvidia says Google's TPU benchmark compared wrong kit You're faster than the Kepler, but what about the newer and better Pascal? 12 Apr 2017 at 01:42, Richard Chirgwin It's not easy being Nvidia: the rise of AI has put a rocket under demand for GPUs, but the corollary to that is World+Dog publishing benchmarks to try and knock Nvidia off its perch. The company is famously touchy about such things – witness last year's spat with Intel over benchmarks it didn't regard as fair. Well, it's happened again, this time with Nvidia taking exception to Google's claims last week to have overtaken everybody else in the field with its Tensor Processing Units. Had it been competitor Intel, El Reg suspects the return-of-serve would have been made less gently, but The Chocolate Factory is a heavy-hitting Nvidia customer. So before taking issue with Google's claims, Nvidia's blog post starts with a liberal spreading of honey. After acknowledging Mountain View's “groundbreaking work in deep learning” and patting its own back, Nvidia finally gets to the point: Google's benchmark showed the TPU outperformed its Kepler 80 by thirteen times, “however, it doesn’t compare the TPU to the current generation Pascal-based P40”. Nvidia's benchmark “The P40 balances computational precision and throughput, on-chip memory and memory bandwidth to achieve unprecedented performance for training, as well as inferencing.” the post claims. While the TPU outruns the P40 for inferencing, its memory bandwidth is less than a tenth that of the P40, Nvidia says. Nvidia isn't the only big name to present its own take on Google's performance claims. Last week, announcing it had taken the Chainer AI framework into its warm embrace, Intel claimed the project made Mountain View's TensorFlow look like it was working in treacle and outlined plans to make Xeons better than GPUs at the data-cruncing required to run AI code. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments MORE Nvidia Google Gpu Artificial Intelligence More from The Register Nvidia welcomes Intel into AI era: Fancy a benchmark deathmatch?

Earlier this year, Apple sued Qualcomm for about $1 billion over royalties. Not to be outdone, Qualcomm is hitting back by countersuing Apple and yesterday Qualcomm filed its Answer and Counterclaims relating to January lawsuit. The full lawsuit is 139 pages (download link), but it boils down to Apple deliberately hindering the performance of Qualcomm chips in certain iPhone 7 models to make Intel chips look better. The five key statements are as follows. That Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm's long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm underscored Apple's reliance on them in their statement that "Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies." By choosing to not utilize some of the high-performance features of the newer chipsets, Qualcomm is claiming that the customers could not enjoy the full extent of their innovation. Apple had been using chipsets from both Qualcomm and Intel in some of their iPhone 7 models. Qualcomm believes their chips outperformed the Intel ones and that "Apple's actions were intended to prevent consumers from realizing that iPhones containing Qualcomm chipsets performed far better than iPhones containing chipsets supplied by Intel." Apple's response was that there was "no discernible difference" between the two chipsets. The lawsuit seeks damages from this as well as for Apple to stop interfering with deals between manufacturers and mobile components. Apple has responded to the suit by saying that "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties." Both lawsuits against each other allege some form of extortion based on patents or chip technologies. Patent lawsuits can be brutal and this one seems to be getting messier every month.

Strong performance improved with Kaby Lake processor. Even longer battery life than before. Supports VR. Cons Expensive. Light on storage. Fans can get loud when gaming. Bottom Line The minimally updated Razer Blade shares last year's design and most of its components, but the upgraded processor and improved battery life make it the best ultraportable gaming laptop you can buy. By Matthew Buzzi Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors and Nvidia's new Pascal graphics means that we've seen scores of laptop updates in recent months. The Early 2017 Razer Blade ($1,899.99), a Kaby Lake-based version of the late 2016 Blade is one such laptop. Our test configuration includes the same display, storage, and graphics hardware as the Editors' Choice Blade we reviewed last December, with modestly improved performance and a longer-lasting battery. The upgrades aren't monumental (but neither is the price increase of $100), and given that the Blade was already our top pick for gamers who value both portability and performance, this model is an easy pick as our Editors' Choice for ultraportable gaming laptops. //Compare Similar Products Compare Razer Blade (Late 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Alienware 13   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo Legion Y520   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen 17   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming (7567)   %displayPrice%%seller% Razer Blade Pro (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% MSI GT62VR Dominator Pro-005   %displayPrice%%seller% Origin EON17-X 10 Series   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Predator 15 (G9-593-72VT)   %displayPrice%%seller% Gigabyte P37X v6   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG G752VS-XB78K Overclocked Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Petite, Packed With Power Since this version of the Blade is a mere component upgrade on the previous model, the laptop is physically unchanged on the outside. It weighs 4.16 pounds 0.7 by 13.6 by 9.3 inches (HWD), exactly the same as the Skylake model. The Alienware 13 measures 0.87 by 13 by 10.6 inches and weighs 5.43 pounds, thicker and heavier despite having a smaller screen than the Blade. The MSI GT62VR Dominator Pro-005 is a 15-inch laptop that offers more power for around the same price, but the form factor isn't nearly as sleek at 1.56 by 15.36 by 10.47 inches and 6.45 pounds. If you like the build and want something even more portable, the 11-inch Razer Blade Stealth is a non-gaming ultraportable with the same design that weighs just 2.91 pounds. On the other end of the spectrum, the premium Razer Blade Pro is a more powerful 17-inch, 7.72-pound version of the Blade with high-end features. The excellent-feeling keyboard and smooth touchpad are maintained here, and connectivity options are untouched. That means two USB 3.0 ports, and a headphone jack on the left, while the right panel holds another USB 3.0 port (all the USB ports are green to match the lid logo), an HDMI port, and a USB-C port with Thunderbolt 3. For wireless connections you get Killer-branded 802.11ac as well as Bluetooth 4.1, and the laptop covered by a one-year warranty. View All 7 Photos in Gallery Since the design is identical, you can read more details and impressions of the keyboard, key lighting, touchpad, and overall build in our review of the Late 2016 Blade. The $1,899.99 starting price for the refreshed Blade gets you 256GB of solid-state storage and a Full HD display (the configuration I'm reviewing here). You can ramp up to a 512GB SSD for $2,099.99, or max out at 1TB for $2,499.99, both with the same 1080p screen. 4K screen options with 512GB ($2,399.99) or 1TB ($2,799.99) have been announced, but are not yet available. Though speedy SSD storage, the 256GB capacity in our unit isn't a lot for gaming, and the drive will fill up pretty quickly. Only 225GB is useable from the start after accounting for the operating system and other essential software, so it will only fit a few modern games alongside other media and files given contemporary install sizes. Jumping up to 512GB is appealing, but it's an extra $200, so you'll have to make a personal judgment call on whether it's worth it for you. The Alienware 13 can also be configured with 512GB for $2,099.99, so the Blade isn't abnormal in this regard—SSD storage is just expensive. As for the 14-inch display, its high picture quality is as strong as on the previous model thanks to In-Plane Switching technology and vibrant colors. The 1080p resolution is a good match for the graphics hardware, since the GTX 1060 inside is solid, but not a high-end card, so going beyond HD will result in frame rate drops. 1080p is the sweet spot for these components, as you'll be able to keep most games at maximum settings at HD. The Alienware 13 opts for a QHD (2,560-by-1,440 resolution) touch display on a smaller 13.3-inch screen, but since it also uses a GTX 1060, you'll see more dropped frames at high settings. If you don't truly need the portability of the Blade (much of its high price can be attributed to its slim build), the excellent, though large, 17-inch HP Omen 17 packs a GTX 1070, a 4K screen, and lot more storage for $1,799. If you choose to wait for the 4K Blade, know that you can only opt for GTX 1060 graphics. Of course, you be able to view native 4K content, so that's not to say the additional screen resolution will be useless, but don't expect to play games at 4K. The 1060 is capable of smooth VR gaming, however, so you hook up your favorite VR headset without worry. Slim, Style, Speed The processor jump is the main attraction here, from a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ in last year's Blade to a 2.8GHz i7-7700HQ. The 16GB of memory remains the same. Due to Intel's relatively new rollout structure of incremental improvements between bigger CPU shifts, the move from Skylake to the newest Kaby Lake generation isn't as pronounced as that between some past iterations, but there are modest improvements in benchmark scores nonetheless. The Blade's PCMark 8 Work Conventional score, which measures general productivity, eked up a few hundred points over the Late 2016 Blade, and put more distance between it and the Alienware 13. The same can be said of the multimedia tests: You can see the new hardware shaves time off the Photoshop and Handbrake tests, and moderately improve the CineBench score. 3D and gaming performance are obviously the big points of interest, and the GTX 1060 performs admirably. The Early 2017 Blade comfortably reached over 60 frames per second (fps) on the Heaven and Valley benchmark test at Ultra settings in HD, an improvement on the Skylake edition which stayed in the low to mid 50fps range on average. As mentioned, the QHD resolution caused the Alienware 13 struggle a bit more on the tests despite also using a GTX 1060—it averaged 39fps on Heaven and 45fps on Valley at the same settings. If you want an option that might not be as flashy or quite as powerful, but still portable and reliable, the Lenovo Legion Y520 is a solid contender with entry-level pricing. In testing, the fans revved up loudly at times, and they were really revving under heavy strain, enough to be a bit distracting. I noticed that in Power Saving mode the fans were limited from whirring at top speeds, but there were corresponding frame rate drops, so that's probably not a worthwhile compromise for most people. The Blade also gets quite hot during gaming sessions, but it's nothing out of the ordinary for a system under load. See How We Test Laptops Battery results on our rundown test notably improve on the newest Blade, jumping to 10 hours and 36 minutes from the Late 2016 Blade's 7:23 time. The first Blade released in 2016 lasted for 5:04 on the same test, demonstrating how Razer has continually improved battery life in a relatively short span of time. The Alienware 13 lasted just 4:56 (the QHD resolution again playing a part), the Legion Y520 for 5:45, and the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming (our Editors' Choice budget gaming laptop) for 11:01. The Best Blade The Early 2017 Razer Blade is a modest upgrade with a more powerful processor, faster performance, and measurably improved battery life in the same compact, high-quality design. It's not worth upgrading if you already own a Late 2016 Blade, but if you're on an older version or less a powerful non-Razer system, this is the Blade to buy.

The plaintiff, Carlos Reyna, filed the complaint (posted here by DSL Reports) on March 31 in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California. Reyna, who purchased the model via Amazon last year, alleges that the device “contains a serious defect” and argued that Arris has not announced a recall of the affected model “or otherwise offered to repair or replace it.” Arris declined to comment on the lawsuit, but announced late last year that it was working with Intel on a firmware fix for the SB6190, a D3.0 device that can bond up to 32 downstream channels and eight upstream channels.

That's the view of prominent scientist R. Stanley Williams, a senior fellow in the Hewlett Packard Labs. Williams played a key role in the creation of the memristor by HP in 2008. Moore's Law is an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that has helped make devices smaller and faster. It predicts that the density of transistors would double every 18 to 24 months, while the cost of making chips goes down. Every year, computers and mobile devices that are significantly faster can be bought with the same amount of money thanks in part to guidance from Moore's Law. The observation has helped drive up device performance on a predictable basis while keeping costs down. But the predictions tied to Moore's Law are reaching their limits as it becomes harder to make chips at smaller geometries. That's a challenge facing all top chip makers including Intel, which is changing the way it interprets Moore's Law as it tries to cling on to it for dear life. Williams is the latest to join a growing cadre of scientists who predict Moore's Law is dying. The end of Moore's Law "could be the best thing that has happened to computing in decades," Williams wrote in a research paper published in the latest issue of IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering. The end of Moore's Law will bring creativity to chip and computer design and help engineers and researchers think outside the box, Williams said. Moore's Law has bottled up innovation in computer design, he hinted. So what's next? Williams predicted there would be computers with a series of chips and accelerators patched together, much like the early forms of superfast computers. Computing could also be memory driven, with a much faster bus driving speedier computing and throughput. The idea of a memory-driven computer plays to the strength of HPE, which has built The Machine along those lines. The initial version of The Machine has persistent memory that can be used as both DRAM and flash storage but could eventually be based on memristor, an intelligent form of memory and storage that can track data patterns. Memory-driven computing could also break down the current architecture-based and processor-centric domination of the computer market. In the longer term, neuromorphic chips designed around the way the brain works could drive computing. In the longer term, neuromorphic chips that are designed around the way the brain works could drive computing. HPE is developing a chip designed to mimic a human brain, and similar chips are being developed by IBM, Qualcomm, and universities in the U.S. and Europe. "Although our understanding of brains today is limited, we know enough now to design and build circuits that can accelerate certain computational tasks," Williams wrote. Applications like machine learning highlight the need for new types of chips. IBM has benchmarked its neuromorphic chip called TrueNorth as being faster and more power-efficient than conventional deep-learning chips like GPUs. Williams suggested ASICs and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) could play a role in driving computing beyond Moore's Law. These technologies will use superfast interconnects like Gen Z, which was introduced last year and will be supported by major chipmakers and server makers like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Quantum computers are also emerging as a way to replace today's PCs and servers, but are still decades away from running everyday applications.

Riding a wave of populist appeal that crested with the RX 480, what we’ve seen is a Red Team resurgence, and for good reason. The chip makers GPUs returned to relevance in striking fashion, and now the Ryzen 5 and 7 chips are attempting to push more cores into more systems, and it may just be working. But we aren’t gathering today to discuss trajectories or marketing strategies, we’re sitting down to discuss performance and value. In that sphere, AMD’s Ryzen chips compete directly with Intel’s most popular SKUs, with the Ryzen 5 1600X across from the Intel Core i5-7500Km, and Intel’s Core i7-7700K posing a serious threat to the Ryzen 7 1700’s value. Both chips sport surplus cores, unlocked multipliers, a modern feature set, and a brand new platform and chipsets to round off the package. The biggest question remains whether users need those extra cores now, or if they ever will in the future. Modern games rarely stress more than four cores, although the rise of streaming culture could help AMD’s odds. Whether you’re gaming or editing video, the Ryzen 5 chips offer an interesting performance proposition that’s impossible to ignore. We’ll talk over the whole series thus far and let you know where the best chips lie. Close to the Metal is a podcast from Digital Trends that takes a deep dive into computing and PC gaming topics. Each show, we’ll focus in on one topic, and leave no stone unturned as we show off the latest in hardware and software. Whether it’s the latest GPU, supercomputers, or which 2-in-1 you should buy,  we break down the complicated jargon and talk about how user experience is affected in the real world. Please subscribe, share, and send your questions to podcast@digitaltrends.com. We broadcast the show live on YouTube every Tuesday at 1pm EST/10am PST.

That's the view of prominent scientist R. Stanley Williams, a senior fellow in the Hewlett Packard Labs. Williams played a key role in the creation of the memristor by HP in 2008. Moore's Law is an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that has helped make devices smaller and faster. It predicts that the density of transistors would double every 18 to 24 months, while the cost of making chips goes down. Every year, computers and mobile devices that are significantly faster can be bought with the same amount of money thanks in part to guidance from Moore's Law. The observation has helped drive up device performance on a predictable basis while keeping costs down. But the predictions tied to Moore's Law are reaching their limits as it becomes harder to make chips at smaller geometries. That's a challenge facing all top chip makers including Intel, which is changing the way it interprets Moore's Law as it tries to cling on to it for dear life. Williams is the latest to join a growing cadre of scientists who predict Moore's Law is dying. The end of Moore's Law "could be the best thing that has happened to computing in decades," Williams wrote in a research paper published in the latest issue of IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering. The end of Moore's Law will bring creativity to chip and computer design and help engineers and researchers think outside the box, Williams said. Moore's Law has bottled up innovation in computer design, he hinted. So what's next? Williams predicted there would be computers with a series of chips and accelerators patched together, much like the early forms of superfast computers. Computing could also be memory driven, with a much faster bus driving speedier computing and throughput. The idea of a memory-driven computer plays to the strength of HPE, which has built The Machine along those lines. The initial version of The Machine has persistent memory that can be used as both DRAM and flash storage but could eventually be based on memristor, an intelligent form of memory and storage that can track data patterns.  Memory-driven computing could also break down the current architecture-based and processor-centric domination of the computer market. In the longer term, neuromorphic chips designed around the way the brain works could drive computing. In the longer term, neuromorphic chips that are designed around the way the brain works could drive computing. HPE is developing a chip designed to mimic a human brain, and similar chips are being developed by IBM, Qualcomm, and universities in the U.S. and Europe. "Although our understanding of brains today is limited, we know enough now to design and build circuits that can accelerate certain computational tasks," Williams wrote. Applications like machine learning highlight the need for new types of chips. IBM has benchmarked its neuromorphic chip called TrueNorth as being faster and more power-efficient than conventional deep-learning chips like GPUs. Williams suggested ASICs and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) could play a role in driving computing beyond Moore's Law. These technologies will use superfast interconnects like Gen Z, which was introduced last year and will be supported by major chipmakers and server makers like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

For some time now, foundries have named their latest process nodes based on their desired market positioning more than any transparent benchmark. It’s time the shenanigans stop. Intel recently proposed a simple but somewhat self-serving density metric. The response from rival foundries was a deafening silence. I suspect that Intel has an edge in transistor density, something its competitors don’t want to admit. Intel deserves praise for its recent decision to reveal metrics such as fin pitches and heights and minimum metal and gate pitches on its 10-nm node, which has not yet started production. These are the kinds of basic details that all foundries should supply when they first announce a new node. Click here to read more ...

kotaku Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video The Bests Steamed Cosplay Compete Snacktaku Highlight Reel Podcast Review AMD Ryzen 5 1600X & 1500X CPU Review: A Fantastic Alternative To Intel Steven WaltonYesterday 11:30am Filed to: Techspot Review Hardware CPU AMD Ryzen 5 1600x 1500x kotakucore 66 2 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink After years of anticipating their release, it’s hard for me to believe that AMD’s Zen-based Ryzen CPUs only arrived a month ago. Frankly, I’ve never seen so much drama unfold so quickly in the tech community — what an exciting time to be a PC enthusiast! Advertisement As we begin to recover from the roller coaster ride that was Ryzen 7, we now have Ryzen 5 to address. Getting the ball rolling, AMD has announced four models in its more affordable series, including a pair of six-core CPUs as well as two quad-core models. The 1600X is configured similarly to the Core i7-6800K and stands as the flagship of AMD’s Ryzen 5 family, boasting six cores and 12 threads with a base clock frequency of 3.6GHz and a boost speed of up to 4GHz. Like all Ryzen CPUs, the 1600X is unlocked, but we wouldn’t necessarily expect to squeeze much more out of the stock settings given what we’ve seen from Ryzen 7. AMD says the 1600X will be almost 70% faster than the Core i5-7600K when measuring multi-threaded performance in Cinebench, though that isn’t a huge surprise considering the Ryzen part has two more cores plus eight threads. Advertisement Alongside the 1600X is a second six-core part known as the 1600, which comes downclocked by 400MHz but is nonetheless completely unlocked. As was the case when we reviewed the 1700X and 1700, it’s likely that the 1600 will be a much better buy than the 1600X. However, we only have the 1600X on hand for today’s testing. The 1500X and 1400 represent AMD’s new four-core/eight-thread Ryzen 5 parts and these come clocked even lower out of the box. The 1500X operates at a base clock of 3.5GHz with a boost of 3.7GHz and the 1400 runs at 3.2GHz but can boost to 3.4GHz (and again, both are unlocked). For those wondering, the 1500X and 1600 will ship with the Wraith Spire cooler while the 1400 comes with the smaller Wraith Stealth cooler. Unfortunately, we only have one quad-core model on hand for review and that’s the higher-clocked 1500X. Price-wise, the 1600X is set at $250 alongside the Core i5-7600K, though we suspect you may be better off buying the standard 1600 for $30 less at $220. Folks seeking a sub-$200 Ryzen 5 chip have the 1500X and 1400 to pick from at $190 and $170, prices that compete with lower-end (locked) Core i5s and higher-end Core i3s such as the $170 unlocked 7350K, which we know to be terrible value. Advertisement Sponsored By the way things look on paper, the Ryzen 5 1400 should have Intel’s entire Kaby Lake-based Core i3 range begging for mercy while the locked Core i5 models should be equally if not more rattled. In the first of what will likely be many write-ups about Ryzen 5, we’ll be pitting the 1500X against the locked Core i5-7500 and the 1600X against the unlocked 7600K. The Core i7-7700K, 6900K and 1800X will be included purely for comparison’s sake, and although we haven’t had time to add results for the six-core 6800K, we think it’s unnecessary anyway. Given Ryzen’s pricing scheme, Broadwell-E can be considered a write-off at this point. Test System Specs & Memory Ryzen 7 System Specs AMD Ryzen 7 1800X (3.6 - 4.0 GHz) AMD Ryzen 7 1700X (3.4 - 3.8 GHz) Asrock X370 Taichi 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM Samsung SSD 850 Evo 2TB Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Ryzen 5 System Specs AMD Ryzen 5 1600X (3.6 - 4.0 GHz) AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (3.5 - 3.7 GHz) Asus Prime B350-Plus 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM Samsung SSD 850 Evo 2TB Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Haswell-E & Broadwell-E System Specs Advertisement Advertisement Intel Core i7-6900K (3.2 - 3.7 GHz) Asrock X99 Taichi 32GB DDR4-2666 RAM Samsung SSD 850 Evo 2TB Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Kaby Lake-K System Specs Intel Core i7-7700K (4.2 - 4.5 GHz) Intel Core i5-7600K (3.8 - 4.0 GHz) Asrock Z270 Gaming K6 32GB DDR4-3200 RAM Samsung SSD 850 Evo 2TB Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Kaby Lake System Specs Advertisement Intel Core i5-7500 (3.4 - 3.8 GHz) Asrock B250 Pro4 32GB DDR4-2400 RAM Samsung SSD 850 Evo 2TB Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Memory Bandwidth Memory bandwidth performance has improved for the Ryzen CPUs using the most up to date BIOS on the Asus B350 motherboard. AMD’s chips are now good for 35GB/s whereas we were previously seeing around 32GB/s with DDR4-2933 memory. Even with lower rated memory, Ryzen CPUs are delivering at least 10% more bandwidth than the Kaby Lake CPUs. This will hand the 1500X a massive advantage over the Core i5-7500 in memory-intensive workloads as it has over 40% more bandwidth at its disposal. Synthetic & Application Performance Using Cinebench R15 to measure single and multi-threaded performance we once again find extremely impressive figures from the Ryzen CPUs. The 1600X lays waste to the 7600K’s multi-threaded score, essentially doubling it. That said, for single-threaded workloads, the higher memory clock speed of the Core i5 results in the 1600X being 11% slower here. Advertisement Advertisement Moving to the 1500X, we find it’s just 15% slower than the 7700K in the multi-threaded test and 21% slower when looking at single-thread performance. However, when compared to the similarly priced 7600, the 1600X offered 45% faster multi-threaded performance and 6% faster when looking at single-thread. As we found when testing Ryzen 7, this points to Ryzen 5 offering vastly superior productivity performance compared to competing Intel CPUs. The 7-Zip benchmark shows similar margins to what we just saw in Cinebench R15, though this is a real-world application and the gains here can actually be enjoyed by the average user. There are two tests here: one measures the performance when compressing files to an archive and another measures performance when extracting an archive. Advertisement It’s interesting to note that Intel’s compression and decompression performance is similar. The AMD CPUs are much faster at decompression than they are compression, though to be fair they are anything but slow at either. In fact, the 1600X crushes the 7700K in both tests, being 15% faster when compressing and 44% faster when decompressing. When compared to the 7600K, the 1600X is more than twice as fast when decompressing. Meanwhile, the 1500X is over 60% faster than the 7500 in our decompression test, which is a massive difference and the vast majority of users will open archives more commonly than they will compress them so this is a big win for Ryzen. The Monte Carlo simulation is an old favorite and this heavy Excel workload crushes weak CPUs. It’s also a great test for measuring multi-threaded performance as it uses all available threads. We’ve seen it do a good job of utilizing a dual-Xeon configuration with 40-threads. Advertisement Advertisement I realize most of you are more interested in gaming performance than heavy spreadsheet work but this is a good indicator of real-world performance in applications that utilize multiple threads. Here we see that the 1600X is 10% faster than the 7700K and 62% faster than the 7600K, while the 1500X was 20% slower than the 7700K but 18% faster than the 7600K and 61% faster than the 7500. So when compared to similarly priced Intel CPUs, Ryzen 5 delivers around 60% more performance in this application. Before jumping to the game benches, let’s check out the performance results from Premiere Pro CC. This is a different workload from our previous Premiere tests. It’s still a 4K video export, but we reduced the video length to speed up the test. Advertisement The 1600X took 241 seconds to complete the workload, which was 31% faster than the Core i5-7600K, while the 1500X managed to match the 7600K and overtake the 7500 by 22% — another excellent application result for AMD. Gaming Performance Testing games is where things tend to get tricky. In Battlefield 1, the 1800X and 1600X fall short of the 7600K’s 153fps average, but if we look at the minimum frame rates they’re both faster than the 7600K. In fact, when comparing minimum results, the 1800X matched the 6900K while the 1500X was just 4% slower. Advertisement Advertisement The 1500X on the other hand loses out to the Core i5-7500 in both the minimum and average frame rates, though it’s still possible to overclock the 1500X for greater performance and we will explore this later in the review. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was tested using the DX11 API at 1080p with the high quality preset. Here the 1600X matches the performance of the 1800X though unfortunately both are slower than the 7600K by almost 10% when comparing the minimum frame rate. That said, the 1500X makes out quite a bit better, beating the locked 7500 by a slim margin. The DX11 Hitman results are quite competitive for the 1600X and 1500X which is great as the 1800X doesn’t fare that well against the 7700K or 6900K, at least when looking at the average frame rate, though I should note the minimum result is good. Moving on, the 1600X roughly matched the 7600K while the 1500X was a good bit faster than the 7500 — a great result for the 1500X here. The plan was to include Mafia III to showcase how well Ryzen can perform in some games. Previously this was a title where the Ryzen 7 processors did well, even beating the 7700K under certain conditions. However, this retest shows the 1800X quite a long way behind the 7700K. Advertisement Something has changed with this title. The 1800X has taken a big hit, particularly to the minimum frame rate and the same is also true for the 6900K. Conversely, the 7700K has gained a few extra frames, so it seems some optimization might have been done to make this title less demanding on the CPU. This could also be down to improvements made by the Nvidia display driver. I believe the game was patched last week but there was no mention of any performance changes. The Nvidia driver has also been heavily updated since they previous testing was conducted but the improvements mostly focused on DX12 performance. Advertisement I expected the 1600X to easily beat the 7600K here and the 1500X demolish the 7500. Instead, performance is competitive among these processors and again something has changed here. Moving to Ashes of the Singularity we see that the 1800X is able to close in on the 7700K for the normal batch test, that said it does slip away in the heavy batch test. Advertisement The new Ryzen 5 models look rather competitive when comparing the 1600X to the 7600K and the 1500X against the 7500. The latter chips are separated by almost 10% in the normal batch test — yet another strong result for AMD’s affordable quad-core CPU.

Computacenter and Intel on Breaking Down Barriers to Technology Adoption 2017-04-11 Print Tweet   As soon as you need to think about how to use technology it becomes a barrier, says Jim Henrys, Director of Business Solutions at Intel. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE He is referring to the current situation many people face in their companies, where the workplace applications being implemented are not intuitive systems, or if they are, are not given proper introduction. While companies are seeking to upgrade their operation by integrating intuitive software, they also need to focus on technology adoptionthat is, how to bring the people along with the new systems. Business leaders need to ask, What are the barriers to adoption of new technology? And then they need to break those barriers down. Computacenter and Intel are collaborating to show them how. The first thing to understand is how people work and how to use technology to support that. This is a user centric approach, rather than a technologically deterministic one. Mr. Henrys says, We want to know how technology can enrich [peoples] lives rather than limit them. He explains that there are three ways people work. First, they must be able to work on the go, which means they must have digital work tools that enable them to connect wherever they are in a versatile and secure way. Second, people need to be able to collaborate. Workplace collaboration is essential to an organisations creativity and productivity, and the technology should work to facilitate it with high quality visuals and audio, giving people the ability to seamlessly share ideas. And lastly, people need a quiet focused, personal workspace, with technology that is simple and adaptable so the mind is inspired to wander and concentrate freely. The adoption of new technology is a key issue in todays business world. The divide between the tech we use for play as opposed to work is becoming increasingly negigible, but theres still some work to be done to make work tools more agile. Therefore it is essential for businesses to look at barriers to technology adoption and eliminate them so that they dont lose out on investments in new technology, and so that employees will feel compelled to make the most of the tools they are given. Those companies that take a human-based approach to user adoption will in turn be more attractive to employees and customers alike. In conclusion, Mr. Henrys states, The tech supports the workstyles Ive described, its NOT the workstyle itself. The tech is the means by which people can work the way they want to, and need to. Do that and user adoption wont be a problem. Your investment in technology will yield a return: financially and in a very human way. Learn more!   Contact Info Octopus Group 222 Grays Inn Road, London, WC1X 8HB Phone: +44 (0)203 837 3702 Website: http://www.weareoctopusgroup.net/       (C) 2014 - PR Urgent News.

First, they must be able to work on the go, which means they must have digital work tools that enable them to connect wherever they are in a versatile and secure way. Second, people need to be able to collaborate. Workplace collaboration is essential to an organisation’s creativity and productivity, and the technology should work to facilitate it with high quality visuals and audio, giving people the ability to seamlessly share ideas. And lastly, people need a quiet focused, personal workspace, with technology that is simple and adaptable so the mind is inspired to wander and concentrate freely. The adoption of new technology is a key issue in today’s business world. The divide between the tech we use for play as opposed to work is becoming increasingly negigible, but there’s still some work to be done to make work tools more agile. Therefore it is essential for businesses to look at barriers to technology adoption and eliminate them so that they don’t lose out on investments in new technology, and so that employees will feel compelled to make the most of the tools they are given. Those companies that take a human-based approach to user adoption will in turn be more attractive to employees and customers alike. In conclusion, Mr. Henrys states, “The tech supports the workstyles I’ve described, it’s NOT the workstyle itself. The tech is the means by which people can work the way they want to, and need to. Do that and user adoption won’t be a problem. Your investment in technology will yield a return: financially and in a very human way.” Learn more!

Video Let's Play Thimbleweed Park At a Glance AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Table of Contents Meet Ryzen 5 First up: Productivity benchmarks Gaming performance: The big question Why you don't need to freak out Show More AMD’s $250 Ryzen 5 1600X is here to challenge Intel’s quad-core, $250 Core i5-7600K for the honor of being “The People’s CPU.” Everyone likes to read about expensive, gold-plated, $1,000 parts, but in the real world, most people can’t or won’t spend that much and are looking for the best price-to-performance ratio.  While Ryzen 5 1600X may not have clock speeds as high as the Core i5-7600K’s, it does offer additional cores and virtual cores. We’ve run a battery of benchmarks to see if those cores will make up the difference. Gordon Mah Ung AMD’s Ryzen 5 1600X will compete head-on with Intel’s Core 5-7600K in the all-important $250 CPU category. Meet Ryzen 5 AMD actually announced four Ryzen 5 CPUs last month. Two of them are quad-cores with SMT (simultaneous multithreading): The $169 Ryzen 5 1400 and the $189 Ryzen 5 1500X. The last two are six-core chips with SMT: The $219 Ryzen 5 1600 and the $249 Ryzen 5 1600X.  Mentioned in this article Intel Core i5-7600K $239.99MSRP $243.00View on Amazon All are based on the same die used in the upscale Ryzen 7 lineup we’ve already reviewed, but they have cores switched off. The one of most interest to us is the Ryzen 5 1600X. With its list price of $249, it maps almost perfectly to the Core i5-7600K, which has a current list price of $242 and has sat around at $250 for much of its life. The six-core and quad-core Ryzen CPUs are essentially built using the same eight-core dies from Ryzen 7. Each features two Core Complex (CCX) units with CPU cores switched off. One core on each is switched off for the six-core Ryzen 5s, and two cores on each are turned off for the quad-core CPUs. They also have different clock speeds.   AMD Each Zen core complex is made up of four individual processors. AMD turns off some cores for the six-core and quad-core Ryzen 5 parts. How we tested For the Core i5-7600K, testing was conducted using the same system we used for the Core i7-7700K in our Ryzen 7 review, but with a few key changes. We updated the Asus ROG Maximus IV Code to the latest available BIOS, which basically adds Optane support. We also pulled two of four memory modules we had installed. This reduced the RAM from 32GB to 16GB of DDR4, but it also allowed us to increase the memory clock of our Corsair modules from DDR4/2133 to DDR4/2933 speeds. IDG Ryzen 5 1600X and Core i5-7600K compared Note that running Kaby Lake at higher speeds with all memory slots full isn’t an issue. Not all of the CPUs we tested (*cough* Ryzen), however, will easily support high clock speeds with all DIMM slots loaded. For the Ryzen 5 1600X, rather than re-use the previous AMD X370 build from the Ryzen 7 review, I used an MSI B350 Tomahawk motherboard. AMD provided the board, saying it had a newer BIOS that offered the best performance. A clean install of Windows 10 was loaded onto a Kingston 256GB HyperX SSD (the same model and capacity used in other test machines). For RAM, I used a pair of Geil EVO 8GB modules with the timing set to AMD’s specifications for testing on the Tomahawk board. As with all of our builds, we used Founders Edition GeForce GTX 1080 cards. I verified clock and RAM timings on each card before I began testing. Read on for productivity benchmarks on Ryzen 5.

The killer value proposition for folks buying a UMPC type of device is the need for pervasive connectivity to the real internet: webpages that display properly and appear like they should in a normal browser, instant messaging, email, getting necessary data through specialized apps while connected to the internet. That means UMPCs with WiMax, integrated WWAN, pc card access, or mass development of USB EVDO solutions are a must. It also means that software companies must begin coding their applications to take adjust for offline and online usage. People are desiring to move from offline to online to offline with as much transparency as possible. When you examine the market opportunity, at first glance, it appears as if the market growth for UMPCs stays pretty static over the years, and that is pretty much true. However, what I see in the chart is the tremendous growth for smartphones, and then what the following interest area charts show. Smartphones offer  instant access to the internet, email, and more. But people want to do more with data over the internet than smartphones can provide – that is the real opportunity and that is something that UMPCs and developers should aim toward with seamless internet.

In its lawsuit, Qualcomm alleges that Apple “breached agreements and mischaracterised agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm”, reports TechCrunch. The report adds that Apple is accused of interfering with Qualcomm’s manufacturing partners, the ones who use Qualcomm licenses to build Apple devices. Qualcomm’s executive VP and general counsel stated that, “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies.” In its own lawsuit against Qualcomm, Apple alleges that Qualcomm has been involved in price-fixing and that the chip designer has inflated the prices of essential components with its licensing model. Qualcomm’s licensing model charges customers based on the price of the final product being manufactured rather than a fixed price per chip. Apple seems particularly averse to this licensing model, and understandably so. They make some of the most expensive phones in the world, after all. Describing Apple’s lawsuit as a “global attack on Qualcomm”, Rosenberg added that Apple is using its “enormous market power” to extract “unfair” licensing terms from Qualcomm. Qualcomm’s lawsuit also accuses Apple of misrepresenting the performance of Qualcomm’s products. This is in reference to the iPhone 7, which comes in two variants, one with an Intel modem and the other with a Qualcomm modem. Since the Qualcomm chip was more capable than Intel’s offering, Apple deliberately toned down the performance of the Qualcomm chip to match Intel’s. To put the numbers in perspective, the Intel chip is capable of downlink speeds of 450 Mbps, the Qualcomm modem is capable of 600 Mbps. As AppleInsider noted, the Samsung Galaxy S7 running the same Qualcomm modem was twice as fast as on the iPhone 7. Apple’s original lawsuit also alleges that Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebates because of Apple’s cooperation with Korean regulatory authorities, cooperation that might have contributed to the $854 million fine that Qualcomm now faces. Rosenberg, however, stated that Apple “has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” Apple’s original lawsuit follows the US Federal Trade Council’s accusation that Qualcomm charged excessive royalties. Qualcomm was also sued by shareholders for allegedly misleading investors. The Qualcomm versus Apple lawsuits are certainly gearing up to be something spectacular. At stake are billions of dollars in licensing fees and the very foundation of Qualcomm’s income stream.

Scenes from classic experiments show stimulation of a bull's brain to stop it from charging and excitation of a cat's hypothalamus to trigger aggression. A striking case of violent human behavior is then linked to a brain lesion the surgical removal of which restored normal emotional control.

Ltd, AT&T Inc., and NETCOM On-Line Communication Services, Inc. among others. IoT combines hardware, embedded software, communication services, and IT services. IoT helps create smart communication environments such as smart shopping, smart homes, smart healthcare, and smart transportation. The major components of IoT include WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), cloud services, NFC (Near Field Communication), gateways, data storage & analytics, and visualization elements. IoT helps in effective management and monitoring of the multiple interconnected. IoT security can be addressed through network powered technology. The Internet of Things has access to organizations existing operational technology (OT) networks and information technology in addition to multiple devices, sensors and other smart objects. Increasing dependence on the existing network connectivity gives rise to challenges including security threats. The priority and focus of the IT network is to protect data confidentially and secure access, ensuring operational and employee safety. Thus, there is an increased demand for IoT security solutions at workplace. The companies such as Cisco systems are trying to develop the approach that combines physical and cyber security components for employee safety and protection of the entire system. Request to view table of content @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/toc/4982 To ensure the efficient functioning of devices such as smartphones, tablets, and PDAs at workplace, it is crucial to maintain network infrastructure security. The global IoT security market can be segmented on the basis of end-users and geography. Based on end-users, the market can be segmented into utilities, automobiles, and healthcare among others. On the basis of geography the global IoT security market can be segmented on five major regions which includes North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and Middle East & Africa. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4982 The need for the regulatory compliance is one of the major factors driving the market growth. With huge amount of digital information being transferred between people, the government of several economies are taking steps to secure networks from hackers and virus threats by establishing strict regulatory framework. Thus, compliance with such regulations is expected to support the demand for IoT security solutions. Furthermore, with advancements in technologies such as 3G and 4G LTE, threats such as data hacking have increased, which in turn have forced governments across the globe to establish stringent regulatory framework supporting the deployment of IoT security solutions.

Apart from admitting the fact that the company dropped the ball on the Mac Pro, the group went on an said that the company still has great plans for the Mac. In fact, it seems like Apple will be starting with the supposed great plan this year with the release of the iMac 2017. Many Mac fans were a bit distraught last year when Apple failed to release an update to the famous all-in-one computer. At the time, Microsoft just released the Surface Studio and everyone was amazed at the capabilities of the desktop computer, albeit still limited. Somehow, Apple aficionados imagined that the company will be releasing something akin to the Surface Studio. The reality is, it would be very much far from it. iMac 2017 design Anyone expecting to see something excitingly different from the iMac 2017 design should just go ahead and stop right now. Since the release of the tapered-edge iMac back in 2012, nothing much has changed in terms of aesthetics. Sure, Apple managed to redesign the Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse and made them rechargeable but apart from that, it is still the same design. 2015 iMac Retina (via apple.com) Not that there is nothing good about it, but the only possible design change for now is the removal of the thick bezel at the bottom part of the display. Apart from that, Apple might also reduce the size of the bezels; something akin to the rumored micro-bezeled iPad Pro 2. Since Apple is not a big fan of touch or pen-enabled displays on desktops nor laptops, there is a high chance that the current display stand will not change at all. There is absolutely no reason for Apple to redesign the aluminum stand if it will not feature pen support on the display. One obscure possibility is for Apple to introduce a new color for the iMac 2017. Perhaps  a Space Gray variant will get everyone to notice the desktop once again and make it seem more interesting. Performance and hardware configuration According to the Daring Fireball article, Apple is currently working on the iMac 2017 right now. Furthermore, the company has envisioned the new desktop to cater for mostly pro users as a response to its demographics. Unfortunately, nothing much was given in terms of how much of an improvement will be given to the iMac 2017. A recent blog post from Pike’s Universum claims that the iMac 2017 will finally have a server-grade processor. In fact, the post went on and said the Apple is considering the Intel Xeon E5 1200 V6 family of processors. While this may sound very exciting, it should be noted that not all server-grade processors are better than a consumer-grade processor. In some cases, a quad-core overclocked desktop processor can go head-to-head or even perform better than a server processor. Of course, this will depend on what kind of application one is running on a system. iMac vs Surface Studio (via actualapple.com) Let us say, for the sake of argument, that the the server-grade processor on an iMac 2017 is for the best, it also means that the desktop will finally support ECC-type RAM modules. ECC-type RAMs are far superior than regular desktop RAMs due to in-built error correction protocol. Apart from switching to ECC-type RAM, the iMac 2017 is also said to have a minimum of 16GB of RAM. New NVMe storage Another major selling point for any Mac is the storage. Instead of using common off-the-shelf solid-state drives of SSDs, Apple uses a proprietary NVMe storage. In comparison to a standard SSD, NVMes, especially the ones from Apple, are extremely fast. Apple has invested a lot of time and effort in developing its own storage for the Mac. That being said, the iMac 2017 would feature the latest NVMe storage from Apple. And rumour has it that the biggest storage configuration has been pushed to 2TB. New graphics and VR support As for graphics, since virtual reality or VR is becoming bigger and bigger every year, Apple will also take a slice of that cake. According to the same blog post mentioned earlier, the iMac 2017 will finally support VR with the use of AMD Radeon GPUs. Now, since this is Apple we are talking about, there is actually no point at all to dream really big in terms of graphics. This is mainly because Apple is quite strict in keeping its power target in check. There is absolutely no point in hoping for a Vega 10 GPU on the iMac 2017. The best Apple could probably do is an AMD Radeon R9 395X which has a TDP similar to the M version of the same GPU line. An AMD Radeon RX 480 will be totally out of the question since in TDP alone, the graphics cards runs at 150W. On a good note, the graphics card mentioned earlier is capable of VR gaming as well as gaming on high settings. iMac 2017 accessories Although not entirely what one can call news, but it is possible that the iMac 2017 could feature a revamped Magic Keyboard. The said piece of hardware is rumoured to be almost the same as the current MacBook Pro. It will also have support for Touch Bar and Touch ID. Since the Touch Bar and Touch ID were first introduced on the MacBook Pro, many Mac fans started to fantasize the Magic Keyboard having the same functionality. Rendered images of the keyboard even surfaced on the Internet mere weeks after the MacBook Pro came out. Touch Bar Magic Keyboard render by Bas van der Ploeg (via twitter.com) The one thing that made it more of a possibility is the fact that Apple was already granted a patent for the Touch Bar and Touch ID features on the Magic Keyboard. So, it could be that Apple will turn the patent into reality much sooner than expected. Or course, the iMac 2017 will not be complete without new ports. While Apple is already pushing for the USB Type-C interface, it is still possible that the desktop will retain at least a few older USB interfaces. However, the current Thunderbolt 2 will eventually be replaced by Thunderbolt 3. Target release date and price As for the release date, since Apple already said that the iMac 2017 will be released later this year, there is a high likelihood that it will be between September and October. Apple could choose to go all out and launch the new iMac on the same event that it announces the new iPhones. Or it could make a meal out of it and have a separate one weeks after the iPhone launch, which is probably around October. In terms of price, consumers can expect the iMac 2017 to be a bit pricier, especially the top-tier models. A server-grade processor does not come cheap especially if it is coming from Apple. For the entry level, there is a fair chance that it may still start from $1,500 and work its way up for the high-end versions. For more updates on the iMac 2017, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

After earning universal respect within the mobile ecosystem, this successful spec is moving decisively beyond mobile. The MIPI Alliance just last week unveiled MIPI CSI-2 v2.0. The new spec, according to the industry group, can now respond to complex imaging needs of IoT, wearables, AR/VR, drones and automotive systems. We recently caught up with Haran Thanigasalam, Intel senior platform architect and MIPI Alliance Camera Workgroup Chairman via phone, asked him to break it down for us. Below is an excerpt of our conversation. EE Times: Who’s driving the new MIPI CSI-2 v2.0 spec? Haran Thanigasalam: Many original MIPI Alliance members, who were in the mobile business, are now moving into such new fields as IoT and automotive. They’re driving the spec’s evolution. EE Times: What uses are pushing the limits of camera, imaging and vision technologies? Thanigasalam: We are seeing a broader set of vision applications. They include video streaming, image sensors capable of handling multiple data types, and sensor fusion for ADAS. Some of the key features of MIPI CSI-2 v2.0 are very much directed toward what’s now required by Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) cars. (Source: MIPI Alliance) Click here for larger image EE Times: Tell us the key new features developed for CSI-2 v2.0, with focus on automotive. Thanigasalam: There are five. But three are of particular importance to automotive. First is the enhancement of High Dynamic Range and Signal to Noise Ratio. EE Times: Give me an example of how such improvements affect automotive.   Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 2 Next > More Related Links Renesas Opens Autonomy for Cars Robo-Cars Need Relationship Map Israeli's Valens Semi Snags $60 Million in Funding Connecting Cars with (All) Riders Mentor in Robo-Car Race with Mobileye, Nvidia Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Security DARPA seeks SSITH lords to keep hardware from the Dark Side 'Make chips secure', because nobody's thought of that before 12 Apr 2017 at 04:31, Richard Chirgwin America's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency reckons too many vulnerabilities arise from hardware design errors, so it wants experts and boffins to propose better hardware-level security mechanisms. Baked-in security is a vexed question, for good reason: recipe slips can also hard-wire vulnerabilities into a chip. For example, Intel's Security Guard Extensions (SGX) is a favourite target for attack boffins crafting proofs-of-concept against the architecture. Nonetheless, DARPA wants something better than “patch and pray” software security, so on April 21, it's hosting a Proposers Day for its System Security Integrated Through Hardware and Firmware (SSITH – presumably the extra letter is there to avoid getting LucasFilm lawyers' letters). What it wants is “hardware design tools that provide security against hardware vulnerabilities”, for both Department of Defense and commercial systems. They want designers to “limit the permitted hardware to states that are assured to be secure”, without sacrificing performance. Of particular interest in the DARPA program are the seven vulnerability classes known as Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) applicable to hardware but exploitable through software. These are permission/privilege errors, buffer errors, resource management, information leakage, numeric errors, cryptographic errors, and code injection vulnerabilities. Together, DARPA reckons hardware bugs of this type represents 40 per cent of currently known attacks. The program is managed by Linton Salmon of DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office, who in the agency's announcement says software patches to hardware flaws aren't enough. The SSITH program wants to “remove those hardware vulnerabilities in ways that will disarm a large proportion of today’s software attacks.” SSITH is a 39-month program covering “development and demonstration of hardware architectures”; and techniques to measure the security of new hardware designs, including tradeoffs in things like performance, power efficiency, and circuit area. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Vulnerability DARPA More from The Register If you can't beat AI, join it: Boffinry biz baron Elon Musk backs brain-machine interface biz Computers wired into our minds.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 11 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares46 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

For years, the company had tried to convince its hardware partners to create tablets that ran Windows. For all the work it put into the form factor, the company had little to show for it in 2012. The original Surface Pro promised users a tablet that could double as their notebook. It wasn’t until the Surface Pro 4 release that this vision was truly realized, and we have Surface Pro 4 keyboards to thank for that some of the line’s success. Without the best Surface Pro 4 keyboards, Microsoft’s major foray into making its own hardware is just a tablet with an Intel processor inside. It’s the Surface Pro 4 keyboards that allow the device to morph into a notebook. Their glass-like trackpads give users a way to navigate Windows with precision. Their keyboards make it convenient to type long emails and create documents without pecking away on the touchscreen keyboard built into Windows 10. The best Surface Pro 4 keyboards will have you equipped for any situation that comes your way. Why You Need a Surface Pro 4 Keyboard Some people find it astonishing that anyone would need a Surface Pro 4 keyboard. After all, if the point of buying a Surface Pro 4 is to have a powerful, well-made Windows tablet, a keyboard would seem counterintuitive. These people don’t understand Surface Pro’s mandate. These tablets don’t exist to be better at entertainment features than the iPad. They exist to make users more productive and give them the tools they need for any situation that might arise. Hence, the need for a keyboard cover that has a precision trackpad and keys. You use what makes sense, whether that be touch, digital pen or a keyboard. Microsoft makes plenty of Surface Pro 4 keyboards themselves. One of these keyboards has a fingerprint sensor so that users can sign in. This keyboard is meant as a replacement for those that aren’t comfortable signing into their machine with the Surface Pro 4’s Windows Hello camera sensor. Another keyboard has a softer texture than the standard Surface Pro 4 keyboards. This keyboard can also be customized with NFL team logos. All of them have something in common: they don’t come with the Surface Pro 4. Read: 5 Best Surface Pro 4 Alternatives in 2017 Luckily, that leaves room for Surface Pro 4 keyboards from other companies. Two of the most exciting keyboard accessories for Surface Pro 4 to be announced recently aren’t made by Microsoft at all. One offers a more reasonable purchase price than the Microsoft-made covers. The other introduces wireless technology into the mix. Here are the best Surface Pro 4 keyboards. Best Surface Pro 4 Keyboards Surface Keyboard Surface Pro 4 Type Cover Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint Reader Brydge 12.3 Surface Pro 4 Keyboard MoKo Surface Pro 4 Keyboard Surface Pro 4 Signature Type Cover Surface Keyboard - $99   1 / 6 The $99 Surface Keyboard is probably not what you expected to find when you went searching for potential Surface Pro 4 keyboards. It doesn’t lock into the port on the bottom edge of your Surface Pro 4. It won’t protect your screen either. So, what does it offer? The Surface Keyboard offers the Surface Pro 4 typing experience but in wireless keyboard form. It’s designed to complement the Surface Studio, but it’s Bluetooth. It works just as well with any other Windows PC, including the Surface Pro 4. If you are fond of the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover’s keyboard layout and texture, this Surface Keyboard should complement your setup nicely. You can use it at your desk and the Surface Type Cover when you’re away from home.

The dispenser had gold bars and jewellery studded with diamonds and precious stones worth Rs 2.06 crore. A passenger from Tamil Nadu has been apprehended and the role of an airport `insider' is suspected. Sources with the Air Intel ligence Unit (AIU) of the Bengaluru Customs said the officers found the booty while inspecting the airport toilets soon after the arrival of Thai AirAsia flight (FD 137) from Bangkok following a tip-off."During inspection of a diaper disperser in a restroom on Terminal 1, four blocks sealed in carbon sheets and pouch covered in duct tape were found, which had six gold biscuits of 1kg each, 2 gold rods and gold jewellery studded with diamonds and precious stones," said a Customs inves tigating officer. The team immediately examined footages from CCTV cameras in the area and zeroed in on a middle-aged man who was spotted entering the restroom in a suspicious manner. The man, identified as Mohammed Mohideen, a 42-year-old children's goods trader from Tamil Nadu's Ramanathapu ram, was later nabbed near the immigration area. When questioned, he said that he had placed the gold bars and the ornaments inside the diaper dispenser after disembarking from the Thai aircraft, the officer added. AIU sleuths suspect the role of an airport staff as Mohideen tried to flee after placing the smuggled gold, which an accomplice would later collect and hand over to racketeers waiting outside the airport. "We are investigating possible involvement of an airport staffer. Mohideen has claimed he had to hand over the gold to a man outside the airport but hid it in the toilet fearing Customs officials," a senior Customs officer said. The gold bars and jewel lery weighing precisely 6.45kg were seized and Mohideen, who claimed to have travelled to Bangkok a few days ago to buy children's goods for his shop in Tamil Nadu was arrested. He was remanded to judicial custody and sent to jail later on Monday . A probe is under way into the case.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 11 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares46 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Qualcomm Countersues Apple, Says iPhone Wouldn't Be Possible Without its Technologies Qualcomm Countersues Apple, Says iPhone Wouldn't Be Possible Without its Technologies Tuesday, 11 April 2017 (1 day ago) Qualcomm today announced it has countersued Apple in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, nearly three months after the iPhone maker sued the chipmaker for $1 billion in alleged unpaid royalty rebates. Qualcomm, which earlier called Apple's lawsuit "baseless," accused Apple of failing to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to its 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. The chipmaker accused Apple of breaching its licensing agreements, making false statements, and encouraging regulatory attacks on its business in multiple countries. Qualcomm also said Apple has deliberately "chose not to utilize the full performance" of its LTE modem in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Even still, independent testing last year found Qualcomm's LTE chip to significantly outperform Intel's LTE chip in iPhone 7 models. However, Qualcomm said Apple misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using its modems and those using competitor-supplied modems. Qualcomm said Apple made threats to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm, a longtime supplier of 3G and LTE modems for iPhones, said Apple has "launched a global attack" against its company, using its "enormous market power" to coerce unfair and unreasonable licensing terms. Qualcomm said Apple "could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise" without relying upon Qualcomm's "fundamental cellular technologies," adding that Apple "refuses to acknowledge the well established and continue value of those technologies" after a decade of unprecedented growth. “Qualcomm is the world leader in inventing and developing fundamental, ground-breaking mobile technologies that enable the worldwide mobile ecosystem. Today, Qualcomm's patented technologies remain the primary value driver for mobile devices,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm. “The value of our inventions has been proven through hundreds of license agreements, negotiated and renegotiated over almost three decades, with virtually every significant handset maker in history, including the companies in Asia that have manufactured Apple iPhones and iPads. Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” Qualcomm is seeking, among other things, damages from Apple for "reneging on its promises in several agreements" and to "enjoin Apple from further interference" with Qualcomm's agreements with other companies and licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.Tag: Qualcomm Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 1 week ago< > Embed Is Apple Developing iPhone Graphics Chips In House? 00:48 Cnet has reported that Apple is developing its own graphics processors to be used in future versions of products including the iPhone.

Twitter Facebook The growing importance of Time Sensitive Networks Demanding new applications require precisely timed system control By Bob Noseworthy, Chief Engineer, University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (Network World) 12 April, 2017 07:02 - - - - print email Comments We live in a world with self-driving automobiles, and reusable self-landing rockets.   Such complex systems of multiple sensors, computers, and actuators form a Cyber-Physical System (CPS).  Some CPSs will operate at scales that will challenge comprehension.  From autonomous platooning vehicle convoys communicating with each other and highway infrastructure, to Smart Cities coordinating resources (avoiding traffic congestion, coordinating parking, reducing emissions and power consumption), to Smart national power grids and beyond. To enable such automation, precisely timed system control must be possible.  One prime example of the need for such precise timing is what’s known as “sensor fusion”, taking data from two or more sensors that are precisely timed along with the compute node where the data is merged and processed.   Prior to the availability of Time Sensitive Networks (TSN), various proprietary technologies have been used to provide such capability, or even more simplistic but costly approaches have been used, such as precisely measured sensor cabling to ensure a uniform delay from sensor or actuator to controller. However, with an increasing number of IEEE standards adopted, the ability to use a standards-based approach to TSN has grown considerably.  TSN is best viewed as plumbing that provides the three essential elements of precise timing: bounded jitter and latency, and guaranteed bandwidth on a network (Ethernet or wireless or others such as EPON or MoCA). UNH-IOL Key mechanisms enabling a TSN Early IEEE TSN standards (originally referred to as AVB standards) enabled a solution to be deployed with sub-microsecond timing precision, across seven network hops (or more hops with reduced timing precision), with guaranteed worst-case latency, and guaranteed bandwidth.  Initial TSN/AVB standards, completed in 2011, had the essential elements of a TSN, but they lacked optimizations for industrial and automotive environments, such as the need for static rather than dynamic configuration of stream paths and reservations to ensure rapid, robust operation in a known setting. These changes are being driven by industry leading companies (eg: BMW, GE, Intel, Rockwell) who recognize the benefits of establishing a common foundation across a disparate set of industries that share the need for reliable, networked solutions that are broadly supported and adopted. Newer TSN standards are adding features for central control, time synchronization of all network devices, and even-lower latency. To achieve the absolute lowest possible latency, IEEE 802.1Qbv defines a Time Aware Shaper, which defies timed traffic gates which act as stop-lights on different priorities of traffic flowing through a switch.  Imagine you are driving down 7th Ave in Manhattan from Times Square to Canal Street, a 2.7 mile distance that might typically take 22 minutes.  Now imagine that your trip has been planned and scheduled and if you leave precisely when scheduled, traveling at 60mph, then you will arrive at Canal Street 2.7 minutes later  because all traffic lights will turn green just in time to let you through, and all other traffic (cars and pedestrians) will be blocked as you approach and until after you pass.   This in essence is an engineered time sensitive network.   In closed, or tightly controlled environments, such as a car, a robot, a rocket, or similar machine, or collections of machines working together, such engineering is readily possible.   With the controls available in a TSN, these time sensitive flows can be mixed with legacy traffic without impacting the time sensitive application.   When these Operational Technologies start to leverage open standards, convergence with Information Technology can drive benefits such as reduced cost, broader sets of suppliers, and the general promise of the IoT and cloud connected infrastructures enabling greater analytics and predictive analysis on the state of the machine and overall Cyber-Physical System. Several other TSN standards, recently adopted or soon to be finalized, complete the necessary pieces of this technology: * Pre-emption is now defined for Ethernet (IEEE 802.1Qbu), allowing a low priority frame to be interrupted by the transmission of a time sensitive frame, and then the lower-priority frame resumes transmission.  * Solutions to centrally control and manage the TSN (eg: IEEE 802.1Qcc), to schedule the time sensitive traffic using solutions similar to software defined networking.   * Standard methods to greatly improve redundancy and reliability by replicating time sensitive flows through multiple redundant paths in the network and rejoin them at the destination (or within the network) to eliminate duplicates are defined by IEEE 802.1CB.  This standard also enables a path for wireless connections, with their intrinsic lossy nature, to be combatted through channel and band redundancy, significantly increasing the probability of receipt at the receiver.  Combined with recent advancements in validation for wireless timing measurement and fine timing measurement, this makes for a compelling wireless solution with greatly improved reliability. While the suite of TSN features continue to expand and features improve, the set of existing standards provides a rich selection of features to enable standards-based solutions for deterministic, time-sensitive, reliable communications to occur on a network co-existing with legacy traffic.  This TSN foundational layer is thus an appealing solution of great interest to Industrial Networking/Industrial Iot, automotive networking, power/utility grid networks, telecom networks and yes, even the proro AV Networks that spurred the early efforts. The challenge before us all is to grow confidence and understanding in these new technologies and see the potential savings in Capex and Opex from these technologies as they become mainstream in Ethernet solutions in these various markets.   Much work remains to continue to expand the test and measurement ecosystem, prove conformance, and grow understanding among IT and the various OT/AV/Telecom/Utility/Automotive professionals as their worlds continue to merge.  Noseworthy is a Chief Engineer at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) where he advises on and leads various technical development activities within the UNH-IOL’s Testing Services.  He manages TSN-related Testing Services at UNH-IOL including the AVnu Alliance’s Certification, Automotive Networking, Industrial Networking, Pro AV Networking, and IEEE 1588/PTP Test Services. He is also closely involved with test development for C37.238 (1588 Power Profile), the continued evolution of 802.1’s Time Sensitive Networking standards (formerly Audio/Video Bridging), as well as continuously evolving areas such as Open Fabrics Alliance logo program, and Ethernet Fabrics.   7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The acrimony in Apple’s suit and Qualcomm’s response late Monday raises the prospect of Qualcomm losing a big portion of the revenue it gets from one of its biggest customers. For Apple, it suggests doubt about the iPhone’s ability to remain a prestige product without the chipmaker’s wireless technology. “The war between the companies appears to be growing,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. Apple says Qualcomm uses market dominance to illegally overcharge for its wireless technology while Qualcomm argues the iPhone maker is just trying to pay less. The dispute is already threatening Qualcomm’s earnings because contract manufacturers that make the iPhone and pay Qualcomm on behalf of Apple are holding back payments, Rasgon noted.  Qualcomm fell 2.1 percent, the most in more than two months, to $55.35 in New York. That extended Qualcomm’s loss of market value to almost $14 billion since Apple filed its complaint Jan. 20. While Apple has surged in the period on optimism about new iPhones coming later this year, the stock slipped 1.1 percent to $141.63 on Tuesday. While the iPhone was taking the world by storm, the partnership served both well. Qualcomm revenue reached $24 billion last year, from $15 billion when it first began supplying chips to Apple in 2011. In that year, iPhones generated $46 billion in sales for Apple. That soared to $137 billion by Apple’s latest fiscal year. But in 2016, iPhone unit shipments dropped for the first time, making the company focus more on profitability, not just growth. Apple pressured suppliers more to save money, and its battle with Qualcomm is the toughest of these tense negotiations. The two companies accuse each other of lying, bullying and other allegedly illegal practices. Underpinning it all is a dispute over licensing fees that make Qualcomm one of the world’s most profitable chipmakers and shave a few percentage points off Apple’s iPhone margins. “Apple has built the most profitable company in the world, relying heavily on Qualcomm’s patented technologies,” Qualcomm wrote in Monday’s court filing. “Apple achieved its success without contributing much, if anything, to the innovations at the heart of cellular communications.” Apple says Qualcomm is abusing its strength as the major provider of smartphone chips and related patents to suppress competition and extract billions of dollars in licensing fees it doesn’t deserve. While Apple usually taps multiple suppliers or makes components itself, the modem -- a chip that performs the crucial function of connecting a phone to the network and the internet -- is Qualcomm’s preserve. Until 2016, Apple had used the San Diego, California-based company’s parts exclusively for several years. Becoming reliant on Apple has been a tough lesson for some companies. Dialog Semiconductor Plc’s shares fell the most in more than 16 years on Tuesday after an analyst warned Apple will cut back on the use of the company’s power-management chips. Earlier this month, Imagination Technologies Group Plc shares plunged as much as 69 percent after the U.K. chip designer said Apple will stop using its intellectual property in new products. When Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy phones became the main rival of the iPhone, Apple switched manufacturing of its processors from Samsung to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Shedding Qualcomm may be harder. When Apple put the iPhone 7 on sale last year it tried to muzzle its main modem supplier, according Qualcomm’s filing made late Monday. The reason: some versions of the flagship smartphone weren’t using Qualcomm modem chips. Apple worried that comparisons between Qualcomm iPhones and ones using Intel Corp. modems would cause problems. Apple told Qualcomm to avoid public bake offs between the two flavors of the phone, threatened to use its marketing muscle to attack Qualcomm, and warned that its status as a supplier would be in doubt, according to Monday’s filing. In November, Bloomberg News reported that Apple’s decision to use different modems for the iPhone 7 caused the Intel version of the device to perform worse than the Qualcomm model. Apple said at the time there was "no discernible difference" in the wireless performance of any models. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Qualcomm, which owns patents that cover the fundamentals of modern mobile technology, charges phone makers a slice of the selling price of handsets, regardless of whether they use its chips or not. Apple whispered in the ear of regulators around the world, accusing it of misusing this powerful market position, Qualcomm said in its Monday suit. That resulted in antitrust cases, from South Korea to the U.S., that threaten to curtail this licensing business.  According to Apple’s own suit, filed in December, it’s owed billions of dollars it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. On Tuesday, an Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond earlier statements on the suit. Qualcomm sees the fight as a commercial negotiation over licensing fees, but on legal steroids. It still thinks that there’s another way, if Apple acknowledges the role of its technology and pays up. “The second way things like this are resolved is through discussions and business resolutions,” said Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg in an interview. “We’d prefer not to have disputes.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Yes, there has been a predictable — and sometimes entertaining — Twitter outrage, and Rep. Nancy Pelosi predictably called for President Trump to ask for Spicer’s resignation. But when Israel Intel Minister Israel Katz publicly opines, the story takes a significant turn. Originally published in Hebrew, loosely translated Katz’s comments read: Spicer’s statement that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his people is grave and outrageous. There is a moral obligation that precedes policy. We must demand that he apologize or resign. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed tremendous support for President Trump during the election after what can only be considered a very cool relationship with the Obama administration, so in that context, this comment could represent the first political split between the White House and Israel. One suspects this will almost certainly lead to an apology from Spicer, but it’s not unreasonable to see this as the first significant development that will lead to Spicer’s eventual resignation.

These drivers make it possible to use graphics cards from the company’s popular 10-series lineup, which include the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, among other hardware. This release has major implications for legacy Mac Pro, Hackintosh, and eGPU users. It means that we can now use the latest Nvidia hardware to drive our machines graphically. It means taking a relatively underpowered computer like the 13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro, and running games at high settings with respectable frame rates. We plan on testing out the beta drivers more extensively in the future, but for quick testing purposes, we decided to try powering our 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Pascal-based GTX 1050 Ti. What we found was an encouraging sneak peek at the potential of eGPU setups on the Mac. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? I’m traveling right now, but I knew that Nvidia was planning on releasing its Pascal drivers this week. With this in mind, I brought the Akitio Thunder3 eGPU box that I put together for an earlier Boot Camp Windows 10 project. You can read about that project here; I used this box to run games on Windows since there was no Pascal compatibility on macOS at the time. This enclosure is super small, relatively lightweight, and fairly powerful for what it is. It made the perfect travel companion to test out Nvidia’s beta Mac web drivers. That said, I wouldn’t recommend the Akitio Thunder3 for most users, because its small size and lack of power heavily restrict the type of cards that can be used inside. You can, as brought up in this post, modify the case and power supply to drive larger cards, but you might as well buy a larger enclosure like the Akitio Node — another eGPU box that we’ve looked at in the past. Another downside of the Thunder3 is that it doesn’t feature Mac compatibility out of the box. The Thunderbolt 3 chipset that’s used is unsupported on macOS, but it’s possible to use a hack to enable Thunderbolt 3 access for this chipset. Once you have the Thunder3 setup and connected to your MacBook Pro and an external display, it’s just a matter of using goalque’s Automate eGPU script to download the newly-released web drivers and enable the GPU on your MacBook Pro. Note that you should be running macOS 10.12.4. How to enable the Nvidia-powered eGPU on macOS 10.12.4 Open Terminal and type the following commands to download and run goalque’s script: curl -o ~/Desktop/automate-eGPU.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goalque/automate-eGPU/master/automate-eGPU.sh chmod +x ~/Desktop/automate-eGPU.sh cd ~/Desktop sudo ./automate-eGPU.sh Enter your password when requested and press Return. Follow the on-screen instructions, and you’ll eventually be asked to reboot your machine. Once you reboot, you should see macOS on the externally connected display, along with Nvidia’s Driver Manager running in the menu bar. You’ll also notice that the Nvidia card shows up inside System Information under the Graphics/Displays section. I ran a few quick before and after benchmarks using Heaven and found that even a GTX 1050 Ti made a world of difference on my 2016 MacBook Pro with integrated Intel GPU. Before (using Intel Iris Graphics 550 integrated GPU) After (Using GTX 1050 Ti via eGPU) Notice the stark difference in FPS. Using the Intel Iris Graphics 550 integrated GPU, a game with high settings is basically unplayable, whereas the eGPU setup produces respectable frame rates even with the relatively “weak” GTX 1050 Ti. Obviously this is not an extensive test, but it just goes to show at a glance the type of potential offered by an eGPU setup via Thunderbolt 3. That’s just one of the reasons why the release of Nvidia’s new Pascal drivers is so exciting for MacBook Pro owners in particular. Pascal GPUs Keep in mind that Nvidia offers a wide range of Pascal-driven GPUs. Prices range from around $99 for the 1050 all the way up to $1200 for the ridiculously powerful Titan Xp. Most of these GPUs are available from a variety of manufacturers like EVGA, GigaByte, Zotac, and others. GTX 1050 GTX 1050 Ti GTX 1060 GTX 1070 GTX 1080 GTX 1080 Ti Titan Xp eGPU Boxes Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos As mentioned, the uber-small Thunder3 box is not ideal for most setups. Not only is it too small to fit most cards, but it isn’t able to supply enough power to most cards. The GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti that I used are anomalies because their power requirements are low (75W TDP) and they’re small enough to fit inside the enclosure. I personally like the Akitio Node, because it features a generous 400W power supply, and has more than enough room to fit large double-width GPUs. The Node also has the advantage of having the newer TI chipset that works out of the box on macOS without any hacks. Unfortunately the Node is backordered at B&H, and has limited availability at Amazon. Conclusion We’re still very early in the game, but now that Nvidia has stepped up to the plate and provided macOS drivers for its Pascal lineup, the future looks much brighter for eGPUs. There are still some obvious growing pains, such as the lack of an easy way to drive the MacBook Pro’s internal display with the eGPU, but I think that as more people show interest, the parties involved will be more willing to support our efforts. We’ll be back with additional coverage in the coming days and weeks. In the meantime, feel free to share your current and planned setups in the comment section.

The new system aims to fill the insides of the electronics with bouncing water droplets. The method developed by researchers at the Duke University and Intel Corporation is made to specially identify hot spots in high-performance electronics. The mechanism is based on the super-hydrophobic wings of cicada insects that naturally repel water. Trending: Tesla becomes America's most valuable car manufacturer "A better cooling system will enable faster computers, longer-lasting electronics and more powerful electric vehicles," says Chuan-Hua Chen one of the researchers from the team. How does it work? Don't miss: Is 3D printing the future of F1 racing? When water droplets merge on a super-hydrophobic surface, the loss in surface area releases enough energy to make them jump up off the surface. A similar phenomenon happens on the wings of cicadas as the energy release is responsible to lift the water off the wing's surface, taking dust and dirt with it and making the wings self-cleaning. Most popular: What are the mysterious tech devices spotted in Trump's war room? Applying the same technique the researchers created a sealed vapour chamber made of a super-hydrophobic floor with a sponge-like ceiling. When placed beneath operating electronics the vapour condenses into small water droplets that fall onto the super-hydrophobic floor. Then the tiny droplets turn into bigger droplets and jump off the surface, taking heat with them. These droplets then jump toward hotspots where the water vapour will condense first. What's new and how is it better? While there are already cooling techniques in place for electronics, the new technology has certain advantages over them. Thermoelectric coolers that are widely used in electronics cannot target hotspot locations, rendering them inefficient for use over large areas. While some approaches can target hotspots they need additional power inputs. The new droplet cooling technology also has a built-in mechanism for vertical heat escape, something missing in heat spreaders already in use. "Computer processors and power electronics don't perform as well if waste heat cannot be removed. A better cooling system will enable faster computers, longer-lasting electronics and more powerful electric vehicles," say Chen. The mechanism is still at an early stage as the main challenge is to find suitable materials that work with high-heat vapour over long term.

Vulkan 1.0.42's VK_KHR_push_descriptor Now Supported In RADV Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 7 April 2017 at 08:51 AM EDT. 3 Comments The open-source Radeon Vulkan driver "RADV" has picked up support for another one of the extensions that debuted in v1.0.42 back at GDC. At the end of February was Vulkan 1.0.42 as a fairly big update timed for the Game Developers' Conference. VK_KHR_push_descriptor was added as a way to allow descriptors to be written into command buffers. Intel's ANV driver was quick with supporting this extension while the latest Mesa Git now has support for it too. So from Mesa master is now KHR_push_descriptor support. At the same time, VK_KHR_descriptor_update_template was added. That related extension provides an easy means of updating a fixed set of descriptors, also added in Vulkan 1.0.42. The Mesa 17.1 branching is set to happen one week from today so we'll see what other Mesa improvements get merged over the days ahead. Mesa 17.1 will be formally released in May. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Former Compiz Developer: Free Software Desktop Might Enter A Dark Age Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 7 April 2017 at 10:05 AM EDT. 79 Comments With the big shake-up this week at Canonical resulting in abandoning Unity and switching back to GNOME, former Compiz developer and Canonical employee Sam Spilsbury has shared a retrospective on his years of working on Compiz and Unity for Ubuntu. Sam's lengthy blog post covers the ups and downs from his involvement with Ubuntu and specifically working on Compiz/Unity. He wrote at length about the early successes with the desktop, the many fun moments, as well as the low moments of his time at Canonical. While he was initially very excited for Unity 8 and the convergence dream, he mentions that from his outside view over the past year Unity 8 began looking like "Compiz++ on a larger scale." With the repeated delays of Unity 8, he had long been wondering whether it would ever ship. So the announcements this week didn't come as much of a surprise to him. As far as where he thinks Ubuntu or the desktop is heading in the future: Free software on the desktop might enter a dark age soon. There aren’t very many companies in this space now. Intel was out as of halfway through last year. Google is focused on Android and Chrome OS. Novell and Sun folded a long time ago. Nokia fell off a burning platform. IBM is nowhere to be found. And now Canonical is pivoting away too. Samsung’s Tizen is potentially an interesting player, but everyone knows its a plan B. Red Hat remains and so does Endless. An of course there is still Collabora, Codethink, Igalia and other free software contracting firms, though their existence arguably depends on the larger players. But he is not all pessimistic about the future, but acknowledges the potential of the community. Sam ended with, "Lets not forget where the desktop free software revolution came from. It came from ordinary people, you and I, who wanted to make a difference. It came from people who didn’t want to accept the Microsoft and Apple duopoly on computing. Even if the resources start to dry up now, it doesn’t mean that free software is gone forever. Some of the best innovations came during the post-bubble period of 2000-2010 where the software world had become stagnant with Windows XP and IE6. There will always be people who want to do something different. A community will form again. And once everyone has a clearer head, free software will rise again." Sam Spilsbury had been employed by Canonical from 2010 to the end of 2012. Currently he is serving as a software engineer for Endless Computer. You can read his lengthy thoughts on his time with Unity/Ubuntu and the current situation via his personal blog. Do you think the Linux desktop could enter a "dark age"?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News Worldwide Release of AMD Ryzen 5 Desktop Processors for Gamers and Creators Marks Arrival of Market’s Highest-Performance 6-Core Processor /EINPresswire.com/ — SUNNYVALE, CA–(Marketwired – Apr 11, 2017) – Following the global release of award-winning AMD Ryzen 7 desktop processors in March, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today launched all four models of its new high-performance AMD Ryzen 5 desktop processor, introducing disruptive levels of compute performance at a variety of price points. AMD Ryzen 5 processors deliver immersive experiences and high performance innovation to gamers and creators worldwide, with up to 87% more performance when comparing the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X to the Intel flagship Core i5 model, the 7600K1. Featuring outstanding multitasking capabilities, AMD SenseMI Technology, and the powerful and efficient new „Zen” core architecture, AMD Ryzen 5 desktop processors adapt to individual needs with incredible responsiveness and performance. „AMD Ryzen is a proven game-changer, ultimately bringing innovation and competition back across PC market segments, and we are excited to introduce the next tier of AMD Ryzen processors to the market today,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD. „AMD Ryzen 5 revitalizes the mid-section of the desktop market, offering consumers excellent pricing while providing a smooth and impressive overall experience, whether for high-performance gaming or demanding applications.” Availability Starting today there are two 6-core and two 4-core AMD Ryzen 5 models available, all featuring AMD simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology. All AMD Ryzen processors support the new AM4 infrastructure, with motherboard designs already broadly available from top motherboard manufacturers.                                        Product Line   Model   Cores   Threads   Base Clock (GHz)   Boost Clock (GHz)   XFR Clock (GHz)   Included Cooler   TDP1 (Watts)   Price, Sep (USD) AMD Ryzen 5   1600X   6   12   3.6   4.0   4.1   N/A   95   $249 AMD Ryzen 5   1600   6   12   3.2   3.6   3.7   Wraith Spire   65   $219 AMD Ryzen 5   1500X   4   8   3.5   3.7   3.9   Wraith Spire   65   $189 AMD Ryzen 5   1400   4   8   3.2   3.4   3.45   Wraith Stealth   65   $169                                       AMD Ryzen 5 1600X and 1600 models are designed for smooth gaming and broadcasting, and deliver true workstation-class performance in a new market segment. The 1600X and 1600 models are two of the highest-performing and lowest power 6-core desktop processors that consumers can buy, with 12 threads delivering a decisive advantage in multi-core processing capability in its price level. AMD Ryzen 5 1500X and 1400 are designed for performance gaming and processing featuring 4 processor cores with 8 threads for high performance gaming and processing, with AMD SenseMI Technology to analyze and adapt to customer needs. To deliver the best gaming experience possible, the 1500X features up to 200MHz of XFR (extended frequency range) when used with superior cooling — among the largest extended frequency ranges seen on an AMD Ryzen processor to date. The Right Processor for Streamers In the last five years, eSports has grown to be a global phenomenon on track to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2019. In turn, eSports has made broadcasting game footage a major trend, and with certain games being extremely CPU-intensive, simultaneous gaming and streaming is acknowledged to require a multi-threaded CPU design. For this rapidly growing audience of gamers, the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X processor, with 6 cores and 12 threads offers a highly accessible solution for high-quality 1080p/60 FPS/3500Kbps game streaming.

Build Its iPhone Franchise (QCOM) People Are More Satisfied With Microsoft Surface Than Apple iPad (MSFT, AAPL) Why It’s Time to Sell Apple Inc. Stock (AAPL) View All Posts Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) responded to Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) lawsuits by filing its “Answer and Counterclaims” on Tuesday. Still, that didn’t do much to stem its recent bleeding; QCOM shares were down more than 2%. Source: Shutterstock The chip maker alleged that the iPhone maker refrained from exploiting the full potential of its chips in the iPhone 7 on purpose so that they lack in performance compared to the models running on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) chips. Apple “Threatened” Qualcomm to Keep Quiet In a 139-page long suit, Qualcomm stated that Apple “chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the QCOM chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm’s innovation).” When the chips reportedly outperformed Intel’s, the iPhone maker allegedly claimed falsely that there was no significant difference between the two chips. Further, the chip maker stated that Apple has not even revealed to customers the extent to which Qualcomm’s chipsets fare better than Intel’s chipsets. It also alleged that the iPhone maker threatened it to be quiet about the performance differences. The chip maker’s response states that it would not have been possible for Apple to create the iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable entity in the world “without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies,” the chip maker claims. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for Years QCOM stated that it is quite clear AAPL is looking to force it into accepting less value for the patented technologies that have fueled the innovation in cellular technology and enabled Apple to generate over $760 billion in iPhone sales. The chip maker stated that it has put over $40 billion into research and development over the past three decades and has a staff of over 20,000 engineers. The chip maker has a patent portfolio of over 130,000 issued patents and patent applications around the world. Qualcomm Practicing Unfair Trade Tactics Qualcomm also mentioned in the lawsuit that Apple breached their contract by meddling with the agreements and relationships that it (QCOM) had with other contract manufacturers. The lawsuit also claims that the iPhone maker is not paying the money due under a contract related to a high-speed feature of the company’s chip. In its lawsuit filed in January, Apple stated that Qualcomm is misusing its monopoly status in cellular chips and pushed forward “onerous, unreasonable and costly” terms and conditions for customers and competitors. Further, Cupertino-based AAPL stated that the chip maker has charged excessively for its patents and also did not sell the chips to phone manufacturers that refused to license its patent portfolio. The U.S. firm has sued the chip maker in China and the U.K. also. Apple Inc. Stock Will Correct Before Q2 Earnings (AAPL) In recent years, the chip maker has been facing a lot of inquiry over its alleged monopolistic practices. Just two years ago, the company paid China approximately $1 billion to close the 14-month antitrust investigation, notes CNET. In December, South Korea slapped the chip company with a $580 million fine, accusing it of having an “unfair business model” and creating a monopoly with its practices. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also alleged that Qualcomm has dominated the cellular chip market illegally.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News VMware Accelerates Customers’ Data Center Modernization Efforts with New Release of Industry-Leading vSAN /EINPresswire.com/ — PALO ALTO, CA –(Marketwired – April 11, 2017) – VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), a global leader in cloud infrastructure and business mobility, today introduced a new release of VMware vSAN™ featuring industry-first native hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) security, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and up to 50 percent higher all-flash performance. These combined benefits will help customers accelerate their data center modernization efforts. HCI systems are the fastest growing segment in the converged or integrated systems market, according to IDC. (2) By combining software-defined compute and storage capabilities with industry standard Intel Architecture (IA) servers, HCI systems enable customers to simplify IT operations and increase performance while lowering their upfront and ongoing costs compared to traditional storage. VMware vSAN 6.6 will help customers evolve their infrastructure with minimal risk through native encryption, robust availability and the broadest choice of hardware platforms, including cutting-edge flash technologies such as Intel® Optane™ solid-state drives (SSDs). The latest release will also further lower TCO via intelligent operations and cloud-based analytics while delivering the flexibility and performance to support modern applications and hardware. „Since the initial release of VMware vSAN in 2014, customers have turned to vSAN because of its TCO savings and the simplicity of managing compute and storage together,” said Yanbing Li, senior vice president and general manager, Storage and Availability Business Unit, VMware. „VMware vSAN 6.6 is packed with innovations featuring several industry firsts, and will further drive mainstream adoption of HCI by helping customers modernize their data centers to gain a competitive edge through newfound agility.” Evolve Data Centers with Industry-First Native HCI Security vSAN 6.6 is the sixth-generation of VMware’s simple, enterprise-grade native storage for vSphere. The storage platform is ideal for a range of use cases including business-critical and cloud-native applications, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), remote office/branch office (ROBO), and disaster recovery environments. The new release will offer customers an efficient, non-disruptive path to a more secure infrastructure that is highly available for their business-critical workloads. New features will include: Native HCI security: A software-defined, data-at-rest encryption solution featuring simplified key management that is built to protect against unwanted access to data. vSAN 6.6 customers using vSAN Encryption will have the freedom to select any vSAN-certified hardware to further lower hardware costs by avoiding expensive self-encrypting drives (SEDs). Highly available vSAN management: vSAN 6.6 will enable monitoring and management of the storage platform in the event VMware vCenter Server® is offline. Lower TCO with Enhanced Site Protection and Intelligent Operations HCI solutions powered by vSAN are well positioned to help IT teams modernize their data center infrastructure despite shrinking or static budgets and increasing demands from the business and end users. vSAN 6.6 will help customers address these challenges by alleviating the economic stress on businesses and IT through the following functionality: Efficient and economical site protection: vSAN 6.6 will deliver enhanced Stretched Clusters with local protection to provide resiliency against both site and local component failures. These highly available clusters can be deployed for up to 50 percent less than leading traditional storage solutions. (3) Proactive cloud analytics: vSAN Cloud Analytics will introduce a new analytics framework that will initially provide real-time support notifications and custom recommendations to help customers optimize their vSAN environment. The cloud-based analytics can be continuously enhanced with new checks and functionality without requiring any customer intervention. Automated hardware maintenance: Intelligent operations and lifecycle management capabilities will accelerate initial hardware setup, simplify software install, and deliver 1-click controller hardware lifecycle management for a more predictable hardware experience — without sacrificing the broadest choice of hardware. Scale HCI to Support Tomorrow’s Applications and Hardware With technology advancing at a breakneck pace, VMware vSAN continues to deliver an efficient, high-performance architecture that provides customers the flexibility to support modern applications and the latest hardware. VMware vSAN 6.6 will deliver: Faster flash performance: Optimized data service algorithms in vSAN 6.6 will help accelerate flash performance of business-critical and cloud-native applications by up to 50 percent. (3) In addition to existing support for VMware Horizon®, new validated architectures provide support for workloads such as Hadoop, Citrix XenApp, InterSystems Cache and Splunk. Support for next–generation hardware: vSAN is architected to support the latest flash technologies enabling vSAN-powered HCI solutions to adopt new technologies as they arrive on the market without delays and forklift upgrades to their infrastructure. For example, vSAN 6.6 will deliver industry-first support for recently launched Intel® Optane™ SSDs, which can help boost the performance write-intensive applications like big data and streaming analytics. Supporting Quotes „As legacy storage platforms come up for technology refresh, many enterprises are looking to modernize their IT infrastructure and reap the benefits of more scalable performance, easier expansion and management, and lower overall costs. Solutions like VMware vSAN that offer a full complement of enterprise-class data services, including a number of optimizations that take better advantage of optional all-flash performance, offer a highly scalable and resilient storage platform for the next generation of workload consolidation and provide compelling incentives for customers to move more quickly towards the software-defined datacenter.” — Eric Burgener, research director Storage, at IDC „CDW is at the forefront of selling HCI solutions and has been a thought leader on VMware’s vSAN since its launch. CDW’s force of highly skilled, dedicated and certified VMware technical and sales resources continues to drive the acceptance of vSAN in the marketplace. For our customers who want native security and data availability, VMware vSAN 6.6 will provide native encryption and local protection in stretch clusters. We look forward to working with our customers to leverage its potential.” — Neal Campbell, senior vice president, Strategic Solutions and Services, CDW „Clover School District deployed a new VDI platform powered by VMware vSAN and Horizon to enable us to administer standardized tests to students online. By choosing vSAN, we cut our storage costs by 75 percent and saved our staff from having to babysit the storage anymore. We anticipate that the new automation and intelligent operations built into vSAN 6.6 will help us further reduce management time and ensure optimal performance.” — Matt Hoffman, executive director, Technology, Clover School District „Being part of the vSAN 6.6 beta program has allowed us to see firsthand how vSAN is innovating around new features, like native security and simplified operations. We have enjoyed the chance to provide feedback to VMware’s product teams and influence the vSAN roadmap, which can bring value to us and all the 7,000-plus other customers.” — Johan Marais, virtualization manager, Discovery Limited Industry’s Broadest Consumption Options from On- to Off-Premises In conjunction with its expansive partner ecosystem, VMware provides the broadest set of consumption options for its HCI software from turnkey HCI appliances to certified hardware to public clouds. Today, customers can choose to deploy HCI solutions powered by vSAN through Dell EMC VxRail Appliances, fully integrated HCI appliances tailored for ease of deployment. Customers can also choose to deploy vSAN on 200-plus pre-certified VMware vSAN ReadyNodes™ from all major server vendors (15 in total) catering to their deployment needs and vendor preferences. Alternatively, customers can consume vSAN via managed clouds through the VMware vCloud® Air™ Network of providers. Customers seeking the fastest path to software-defined cloud infrastructure can purchase VMware Cloud Foundation™, a new unified SDDC platform for private and public cloud. VMware Cloud Foundation delivers enterprise-ready, highly dynamic cloud infrastructure that is much simpler to operate by integrating VMware vSphere®, vSAN and NSX® into a single interoperable stack with powerful built-in lifecycle management automation (SDDC Manager). For a consistent operational experience across clouds, customers can extend their private cloud to the public cloud via VMware Cloud Foundation. Alternatively, they can begin their VMware Cloud Foundation deployment with one of the cloud service providers in VMware’s growing ecosystem including IBM Cloud today. VMware Cloud on AWS powered by VMware Cloud Foundation will follow later in 2017. Read what partners have to say about VMware vSAN 6.6.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com McAfee Relaunches Anew, Away from Intel's Shadow By Rizal Raoul Reyes PUBLISHED: APRIL 11 2017 Global security provider McAfee announced on April 4 that it has started functioning again as a new stand-alone company that will give strong emphasis on threats coming from the Internet. "Cyber security is the greatest challenge of the connected age, weighing heavily on the minds of parents, executives and world leaders alike," McAfee CEO Christopher Young was quoted in a statement as saying. "As a stand-alone company with a clear purpose, McAfee gains the agility to unite people, technology and organizations against our common adversaries and ensure our technology-driven future is safe." The launch of the rebooted McAfee marks the closing of the previously announced investment by TPG and Intel Corp. to establish a pure-play cybersecurity company with access to significant capital, operational and technology resources. Moreover, McAfee announced that through an agreement with TPG, leading private equity investment firm Thoma Bravo has joined as a minority investor in the company. Intel is retaining a 49-percent equity stake in the new entity. With the entry of its new investment partners, the company said it will provide greater market focus, build its platform and target new financial, operational and technology investments to better address the cybersecurity market's significant global growth opportunity. Intel SVP and General Manager Chris Young will lead the new McAfee as CEO. TPG Partner Bryan Taylor has been named chairman of the Board. "Intel will continue to integrate industry-leading security and privacy capabilities in our products from the cloud to billions of smart, connected computing devices," said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO Bryan Taylor, partner at TPG Capital and chairman of the Board at McAfee, noted McAfee has been dedicated to offering its customers industry-leading cyber-security solutions and has developed a strong branding position to build a solid cybersecurity forces for its clients. "McAfee is a global organization with a 30-year history and a brand known the world over for innovation, trust and collaboration. Given our years of focus on the security software sector, we see great opportunity for McAfee to continue to advance and innovate," said Seth Boro, a managing partner at Thoma Bravo. "Our deep sector knowledge and history of helping build successful businesses will be an asset to the company, and we look forward to working with the management team and our colleagues at TPG and Intel to guide McAfee through its next chapter of growth." Over the past year, more than 30 partners have integrated or planned integrations with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer the industry-endorsed communication fabric providing real-time interaction between applications. © 2017 Business Mirror under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Over 4 Billion Records Leaked in 2016 Next Article > Symantec Says CIA Tools Found Across 16 Countries By Raphael Satter PUBLISHED: APRIL 10 2017 The CIA's cyberespionage toolkit made public by WikiLeaks has been linked to 40 spying operations in 16 countries, an early public assessment of the intelligence agency's global hacking operations, computer security company Symantec said Monday. In a blog post, the California-based Symantec Corp. said the tools in WikiLeaks' recent releases have been linked to the electronic infiltration of international, financial, energy and aerospace organizations across the world. Like many security firms, Symantec draws on data supplied by its clients. Researcher Dick O'Brien declined to provide further details, saying might prompt speculation as to the identity of the people or organizations involved. "I will say, in terms of the regions, the largest region represented in terms of those targets was the Middle East," O'Brien said in a telephone interview. The word "CIA" was mentioned nowhere in Symantec's post, but few if any doubt that that's where the tools come from. When WikiLeaks began releasing them in early March, it gave an unusually explicit account of how the tools had been taken from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence. The U.S. government has since all but publicly accepted the embarrassing claim; about a week later, President Donald Trump told a television host: "I just want people to know the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken." O'Brien said that while Symantec didn't dispute that assessment, pinning the tools on a specific government agency was "straying outside our area of expertise." Intriguingly, O'Brien said one CIA tool was discovered breaking into an U.S. computer -- only to uninstall itself almost immediately afterward. "That, to us, smacks of an accidental compromise," we said. "Our assessment is it was likely a mistake." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Three Huawei MateBook Models With Kaby Lake Processors Expected By Adnan Farooqui on 04/11/2017 09:58 PDT The MateBook is a slim and lightweight Windows 10-powered tablet that Huawei launched back at the Mobile World Congress last year. It didn’t follow up with a successor at the MWC 2017 in Barcelona a couple of months back but that doesn’t mean Huawei has given up on this product. A new leak reveals that Huawei has three MateBook models in the pipeline and that they may be powered by Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Twitter leakster @evleaks has tweeted images of all three models which will apparently be called the Huawei MateBook D, MateBook E, and MateBook X. @evleaks has built up a strong reputation for himself when it comes to leaking unreleased devices so there might be some truth to this rumor after all. Going by the images, it appears that the MateBook E looks the most similar to its predecessor as far as the design is concerned. The other two models appear to look more like conventional notebooks and may offer similar performance. Another report suggests that the MateBook X is going to have a 15 inch display with a 7th generation Intel Core i5-7200U Kaby Lake processor and 8GB of RAM. All three will run on Windows 10 and may even come with the Creators Update out of the box given that it’s unclear when they will be out. Huawei hasn’t said anything about new MateBooks at this point in time so take this with a grain of salt even though all of this looks quite plausible. Pascal + Bell + Watt = Matebooks E, X, & D (/not/ respectively).

Most Popular We're all aware kids play PlayStation or Xbox in their spare time. We may know that they play online with their friends. Some of us may know they sometimes watch gamers playing on YouTube. But for many of us, all this really means is that kids have too much screen time. In fact, gamers are the most followed influencers on YouTube, where three of the top five YouTubers are gamers. While marketers, parents and everyone else were heads-down trying to figure out what to post on Instagram or how to use Snapchat, gamers were amassing huge followings. From this phenomenon, a new industry emerged: esports. Related Stories Inside Esports Star Franchise Optic Gaming A How-To Guide for Esports Branding Behind the Rise of Esports and What It Means for Brands Esports, which originated in social media, has broken out beyond YouTube and into live events at major venues. Two of the largest events to date were the 2016 League of Legends World Championship Semifinals, held at Madison Square Garden, and its finals, held at Staples Center in Los Angeles, which attracted more than 20,000 in-person attendees and another 43 million viewers online. Similarly, the 2016 International Dota 2 Championship, held at Key Arena in Seattle, drew more than 10,000 attendees and 20 million online viewers. Why care? Esports is an example of a developing platform where savvy marketers can reach their most-coveted audience: millennials and Gen Z. Successful marketers need to be aware of contemporary trends and unafraid of creating content relevant for it. Sweet, sharp successes One brand early to esports was Snickers, which last year teamed up with three top Twitch Gamers, an online gaming community owned by Amazon.com. Hosted by more than 1.5 million broadcasters, this community attracts some 100 million visitors per month. Here, gamers livestream their screens as they compete with one another -- while viewers interact in real time. Snickers used the social platform to unconventionally reach their audience by translating its "You're Not You When You're Hungry" campaign into a live broadcast prank. Partnering with the three gamers with major followings of well over 1 million between them, Snicker's brief was "start to play terribly because you're hungry." The hungrier the players got, the worse they played. Finally, each walked out and returned as a different person; only after eating a Snickers did they revert to themselves. Viewer interaction went wild with live-commenting throughout the prank. Similarly, Gillette, positioned around performance and precision, partnered this winter with esports behemoth Electronic Sports League to sponsor the League of Legends Intel Extreme Masters Wolf Championship in Poland, where the brand gave ESL fans the opportunity to customize their own razor handles using 3D printing technology at its RZR MKR Design Studio, as well as providing grooming for all League of Legend competitors. "It's been exciting and eye-opening as we've immersed ourselves in the gaming community and discovered that both professional and amateur gamers have a lot in common with other premier athletes and sports fanatics," said John Mang, VP at Global Gillette, when the company announced the partnership last February. "Gamers at all levels recognize the importance of precision -- split seconds and minute movements make big differences." Technology and manufacturing giant Intel also sponsors Twitch.tv. Intel's involvement in esports pushes its technology as the most reliable brand to play, share, stream and encode at high resolutions, with no lag. Importantly, sponsorships build brand awareness among younger consumers who are unaware their gaming is powered by Intel's technology. To be successful, marketers need to be ready for nontraditional ways and nontraditional platforms to meet their consumers where they are. To be successful and relevant, never forget there's no such thing as a captive audience in today's media. Staying agile and open-minded are the keys to future success. As marketers, we need to engage our audiences on the platforms they're on, whether these resonate with us individually or not. I'm not sure if esports success will ever lead to a Division 1 scholarship for my son, but I do know that marketers who know how to look outside of their day to day world for new opportunities will survive and grow. Successful brands will take risks to evolve and reach their consumers through new platforms, regardless of what they are or where they came from.

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com McAfee Relaunches Anew, Away from Intel's Shadow By Rizal Raoul Reyes PUBLISHED: APRIL 11 2017 Global security provider McAfee announced on April 4 that it has started functioning again as a new stand-alone company that will give strong emphasis on threats coming from the Internet. "Cyber security is the greatest challenge of the connected age, weighing heavily on the minds of parents, executives and world leaders alike," McAfee CEO Christopher Young was quoted in a statement as saying. "As a stand-alone company with a clear purpose, McAfee gains the agility to unite people, technology and organizations against our common adversaries and ensure our technology-driven future is safe." The launch of the rebooted McAfee marks the closing of the previously announced investment by TPG and Intel Corp. to establish a pure-play cybersecurity company with access to significant capital, operational and technology resources. Moreover, McAfee announced that through an agreement with TPG, leading private equity investment firm Thoma Bravo has joined as a minority investor in the company. Intel is retaining a 49-percent equity stake in the new entity. With the entry of its new investment partners, the company said it will provide greater market focus, build its platform and target new financial, operational and technology investments to better address the cybersecurity market's significant global growth opportunity. Intel SVP and General Manager Chris Young will lead the new McAfee as CEO. TPG Partner Bryan Taylor has been named chairman of the Board.

Over 4 Billion Records Leaked in 2016 Next Article > Symantec Says CIA Tools Found Across 16 Countries By Raphael Satter PUBLISHED: APRIL 10 2017 The CIA's cyberespionage toolkit made public by WikiLeaks has been linked to 40 spying operations in 16 countries, an early public assessment of the intelligence agency's global hacking operations, computer security company Symantec said Monday. In a blog post, the California-based Symantec Corp. said the tools in WikiLeaks' recent releases have been linked to the electronic infiltration of international, financial, energy and aerospace organizations across the world. Like many security firms, Symantec draws on data supplied by its clients. Researcher Dick O'Brien declined to provide further details, saying might prompt speculation as to the identity of the people or organizations involved. "I will say, in terms of the regions, the largest region represented in terms of those targets was the Middle East," O'Brien said in a telephone interview. The word "CIA" was mentioned nowhere in Symantec's post, but few if any doubt that that's where the tools come from. When WikiLeaks began releasing them in early March, it gave an unusually explicit account of how the tools had been taken from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence. The U.S. government has since all but publicly accepted the embarrassing claim; about a week later, President Donald Trump told a television host: "I just want people to know the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken." O'Brien said that while Symantec didn't dispute that assessment, pinning the tools on a specific government agency was "straying outside our area of expertise." Intriguingly, O'Brien said one CIA tool was discovered breaking into an U.S. computer -- only to uninstall itself almost immediately afterward. "That, to us, smacks of an accidental compromise," we said. "Our assessment is it was likely a mistake." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

The lawsuit comes after several from Apple served on Qualcomm earlier this year. Qualcomm listed several complaints in a document, including claims that Apple breached agreements and mischaracterised agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads; encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements.  Qualcomm also alleged that Apple chose not to utilise the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems, and threatened Qualcomm to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones.  “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90% of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies,” said Qualcomm executive VP and general counsel Don Rosenberg.  He added that Apple had “launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. “We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.”  Apple had reportedly throttled Qualcomm chips in a bid to keep a uniform experience across the iPhone range.  Qualcomm said it is seeking, among other things, “damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm's agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple”. The Qualcomm lawsuit comes after Apple filed its own lawsuit in January in the US demanding $1 billion from Qualcomm, arguing that it had been overcharged on the use of Qualcomm's patents, with Qualcomm allegedly charging for patents on technologies it had nothing to do with. Apple also filed lawsuits against the firm in the UK and China.

Updated April 11, 2017. Qualcomm fired back late Monday against Apple's legal attack on its patent licensing business -- accusing the world's largest tech company of egging on anti-trust regulators with misleading information and meddling with Qualcomm's long-standing patent agreements with contract manufacturers that build iPhones. Qualcomm also claims Apple violated California's unfair competition law by throttling the performance of Qualcomm's modems and then claiming there was "no discernible difference" in performance between iPhone 7s using Qualcomm's cellular modems and iPhone 7s with Intel chips. Apple threatened to retaliate if Qualcomm publicly made a case that its chips were better. The San Diego wireless giant filed its counter-claims in response to Apple's lawsuit in January in a San Diego federal court. Apple alleges that Qualcomm uses its market dominance in cellular modems to squeeze excessive patent royalties out of smartphone makers. Apple also says Qualcomm is withholding nearly $1 billion it owes Apple in retaliation for its cooperation with anti-monopoly regulators investigating Qualcomm. In its court filing, Qualcomm denies Apple's charges. The San Diego company also contends that Apple is refusing to make payments it owes to Qualcomm. Apple's lawsuit attacks the foundation of Qualcomm's patent licensing business model by challenging the value of its patents and the practice of charging royalties based on the wholesale price of the smartphone instead of the modem chip itself. Patents are a key part of Qualcomm's business. While it makes most of its revenue selling chips used in mobile devices, it earns the bulk of its profit from patent licensing. In court filings, Qualcomm takes pains to paint Apple as a Goliath with immense power over suppliers, saying the company has more money and influence than many countries. Qualcomm contends Apple's aim is to pay less for the Qualcomm intellectual property that allowed Apple to prosper in smartphones with little or no investment in the core cellular technology. "Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world -- capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits -- without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. "Now it has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm." Qualcomm's technology is in nearly all 3G and 4G smartphones, powering the connection between the handset and cellular towers that enables services ranging from mobile emails to social media photo sharing to streaming video. For more than two decades, the company has licensed its cellular know-how to smartphone makers. But recently its licensing business has come under attack. South Korea's anti-monopoly regulator fined Qualcomm more than $850 million and seeks to upend the way it licenses technology. (Qualcomm has appealed in court.) The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has sued Qualcomm over patent licensing. Investigations are under way in Japan, Taiwan and elsewhere. In its court filing, Qualcomm claims Apple played a role in this recent regulatory scrutiny by "intentionally giving government agencies false and misleading information and testimony about Qualcomm. Qualcomm also claims that Apple has interfered with Qualcomm's patent contracts with third party contract manufacturers that build iPhones -- mostly in China. Apple previously reimbursed these companies for patent royalties paid to Qualcomm but has stopped in recent months, according to Qualcomm's court filing. That has led contract manufacturers in some cases to stop paying Qualcomm. The company wants the court to find that its patent deals with Apple's contract manufacturers comply with the rules for licensing standard essential patents and don't violate competition law. It also wants the court to find that it has dealt fairly with Apple with regards to licensing patents. Over the past decade, Apple has rung up $760 billion in iPhone sales, according to court filings. Yet Qualcomm's per-device royalty for its vast portfolio of cellular patents is less than what Apple charges consumers for a basic plastic iPhone case. "Apple can sue Samsung, for example, and claim all kinds of value on a few patents that they sue them on, but somehow claim that our tens of thousands of core technology patents are not worth what the market has said they're worth," said Rosenberg.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Apr 12, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp AT&T buys Straight Path Bloomberg AT&T Inc agreed to buy embattled spectrum-license holder Straight Path Communications Inc in an all-stock deal valued at US$1.6 billion, as the telephone giant seeks to take the lead in the 5G network race. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 gigahertz (GHz) and 39GHz millimeter-wave spectrum — frequencies the US Federal Communications Commission has already approved to power the 5G wireless services. With 5G, faster connections and greater capacity would help carriers like AT&T offer Internet speeds competitive with cable-TV operators while relieving congestion created by consumers who demand Netflix video and live sports streamed directly to their smartphones. The carriers and gear-makers like Ericsson, Nokia Oyj, Qualcomm Inc and Intel Corp are projected to invest a collective US$200 billion a year on 5G, according to IHS estimates, and AT&T is planning to build a 5G network using so-called millimeter-wave spectrum. The deal marks the second acquisition of high-frequency airwaves by AT&T this year. In January, the Dallas-based telecom behemoth purchased FiberTower Corp, which holds licenses for 24GHz and 39GHz bands of airwaves. Straight Path’s spectrum licenses would allow AT&T to better compete with Verizon Communications Inc and T-Mobile US Inc as 5G networks roll out over the next several years. Straight Path has billed itself as a leader in providing high-frequency airwaves for carrying traffic that is expected to grow as the 5G and the so-called Internet of Things blossoms: The company is the third-largest owner of spectrum licenses for airwaves that have been approved by the commission for flexible use with an eye toward 5G. Verizon still has a wide lead against rivals in coverage with 28 GHz spectrum. Wireless carriers use a measurement called megahertz-POP — the amount of bandwidth multiplied by the potential number of people covered by the airwaves. Verizon owns almost 200 billion Mhz-POP of 28GHz spectrum, more than 600MHz on average nationally. T-Mobile controls 97.4 billion and Straight Path has 39.7 billion, a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis said. “Many believe this ultra-high band spectrum will be key in a 5G world,” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a note. “This spectrum is for fixed wireless and is the basis of Verizon’s 5G strategy.” Straight Path had a big incentive to sell following a settlement earlier this year with the commission. After finding the company had misrepresented the progress of putting its spectrum to use, the commission imposed a US$15 million fine and ordered Straight Path to transfer its 28GHz and 39GHz spectrum licenses by January next year and pay 20 percent of the proceeds from the sales. If it does not, the company would have to fork over an additional US$85 million or relinquish those airwaves back to the agency. AT&T is to acquire Straight Path for US$95.63 a share in an all-stock merger designed to be a tax-free reorganization, a statement released on Monday said. That is a 204 percent premium to Straight Path’s closing price of US$31.41 on Jan. 11, the day before the company entered into a settlement with the commission, and a 162 percent premium to its closing price of US$36.48 on Friday.

(AMD) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Why you might want to ignore Goldman's negative call, but don't fall in love with AMD stock either By Ian Bezek, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 11, 2017, 11:20 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Should You Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Should You Buy United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Should You Buy First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Recent Posts: Should You Buy First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Should You Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Should You Buy United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons View All Posts I last covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in December. At the time, I suggested that AMD stock still had promise. However at $10 per share, the stock came with as much risk as upside. Source: Shutterstock Well, at least for now, Advanced Micro Devices has managed to silence the doubters, myself included. Shares have rallied as much as 50% so far in 2017. Improving trends in the PC market and better supply chain checks have further supported the bull case for AMD stock. However, Advanced Micro Devices stock has gone in reverse over the past week, as Goldman Sachs threw some cold water on the upbeat atmosphere. Is this dip worth buying, or should we heed Goldman’s call to avoid AMD here? AMD Stock Cons Goldman Call: AMD stock was trading around $14.50 for most of the past week. However, Goldman Sach’s initiation with a sell rating sent the stock tumbling to as low as $13 on Thursday. Goldman’s analyst Toshiya Hari said that Advanced Micro Devices’ fundamentals are improving; however, that this is already more than priced into AMD stock. Hari also suggested that investors watch competitive pressure from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) closely. While Goldman is clearly a top-tier analyst shop, in Advanced Micro Devices’ defense, I’d note Hari’s bearish case isn’t particularly novel. And unlike recent AMD stock bull calls, Hari didn’t back up the bearish tone with compelling channel checks or other specific warning signs. Really Tenuous Valuation: Just about everyone agrees that Advanced Micro Devices was severely mispriced when it traded under $5 last year. Even bears aren’t aiming that low anymore. However, from a valuation perspective, things are getting difficult to justify in the other direction. On a pure earnings basis, AMD hasn’t earned a net profit since 2011. Its peak diluted earnings for any one year since the turn of the century is just 66 cents a share, implying a 20x price-to-earnings ratio even if it got back to its prior peak earnings. And even that overstates the company’s potential, since management has allowed the share count to balloon in recent years. The company had 547 million shares outstanding a decade ago, but it has now reached almost hit a billion today. Dilution does matter. Intel Will Strike Back: And while AMD’s competitive position is improving, Intel is still dominant. It’s hard to argue that Advanced Micro Devices will hit new record high profits in the current technological environment; and that’s pretty much the only way you can justify today’s stock price. The problem for AMD stock is a simple one, the company tends to be in perpetual catch-up mode with Intel. Yes, Ryzen has pulled mostly even with Intel’s current tech generation, though perhaps not on a video gaming basis. However, Intel is already developing its next-gen architecture that will likely allow it to pull way back ahead of Advanced Micro Devices. Making matters worse, Intel’s new-gen chips will likely cause backward-compatibility problems for programmers, causing AMD’s current line of tech to become obsolete more quickly. AMD Stock Pros Ryzen Launch: The company’s long-awaited Ryzen 7 chip has launched over the past month. This means that next quarter will be the first showing revenues from the new hardware line. While it’s too early to tell how well AMD will be able to steal share from a long-running Intel stronghold, with an up-to-50% price advantage versus Intel’s top-tier Core 7 chips, there’s substantial opportunity. Ryzen’s launch did hit some initial bugs. One of these was a performance issue that impacted operations within Windows 10. However, the company was quick to work on this issue, and announced an upgrade this week offering as much as 21% gameplay performance improvements for Ryzen. Ryzen already competed well with Intel’s chipsets on application performance, and now they’re cutting the gap for video as well. Look for Ryzen to generate substantial revenues later on in 2017 as bugs are ironed out and momentum accelerates.

Google designed this AI accelerator after foreseeing difficulties in using off-the-shelf solutions from the likes of Intel and Nvidia. It developed the TPU remarkably quickly to cater for the boom in voice and image search, and translation services, and more. The TPU was in operation in 2015, just two or three years after development started. Nvidia Tesla K80 Nvidia likes to promote itself as a company at the cutting edge of AI, plus the associated data centre and deep learning technologies. So reading about Google's TPU benchmarks and comparisons in performance to contemporary older Nvidia accelerators like the Tesla K80 might have spoiled Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's morning coffee. Yesterday Jensen Huang wrote a response of sorts via the Nvidia Blog. In a post entitled 'AI drives the rise of accelerated computing in data centres', Huang agreed with Google's assertion that practical AI, for voice and image recognition, translation, and more on the internet today, requires accelerated computing. Accelerators power deep learning which helps create these AIs, and is also being used outside of web tech in areas such as diagnosing cancer and teaching autonomous cars to drive. Nvidia Tesla P40 Turning to the Google TPU benchmark results, Huang highlights the fact that while Nvidia's Kepler-generation GPU, architected in 2009, "helped awaken the world to the possibility of using GPU-accelerated computing in deep learning, it was never specifically optimized for that task". Since that time Nvidia has progressed though Maxwell, and now Pascal architectures implementing "many architecture advances specifically for deep learning". In headline performance terms the "Pascal-based Tesla P40 Inferencing Accelerator delivers 26x its (Kepler's) deep-learning inferencing performance, far outstripping Moore's law," says Nvidia CEO Huang. Google's TPU data said that its chip offered 13x the inferencing performance of the Tesla K80 - by simple maths that makes the Nvidia Tesla P40 is twice as fast as the Google TPU… Nvidia created a comparison table with more performance metrics included, as below: The 'NA' in the above table is there as the Google TPU doesn't run training tasks. We can see great progress in the change from the Kepler to Pascal Tesla accelerators. However Google's custom ASIC still gets its work done at about double the speed, in integer teraops, with remarkable power efficiency - a major consideration in its huge data centres. Nvidia watches rival firms' benchmark comparisons very closely for 'fairness', further evidence comes from back in August last year when it took Intel to task for comparing its new Xeon Phi coprocessor cards with much older Nvidia Tesla K20X (Kepler) accelerators.

All Ryzen 5 processors can be overclocked and automatically boost up to an extended clock speed when paired with an efficient cooling solution. Local pricing for the processors positions them as competitors to Intel’s Core i5 and Core i7 range. The chips are built on AMD’s Zen microarchitecture, which uses a 14nm manufacturing process, and will be available in South Africa on 21 April 2017. The South African pricing for AMD’s Ryzen 5 desktop processors and their specifications are detailed below.

Since then, MSPoweruser, via Hyken Wong on Twitter, has confirmed the product recently cleared Chinese CCC certification. For those unaware, the China Compulsory Certification is a mandatory safety certificate for all new tech products in the country since 2003. It’s essentially a verification that tablets and other devices use safe power wattages for consumer homes. As it turns out, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5 recently passed that test. Surface Pro 5 and Hololens have been passed the China Compulsory Certification.So coming soon. pic.twitter.com/5tbu41ZTtm — Hyken Wong (@hykenblue) April 9, 2017 The listing itself doesn’t tell us much about the device, however. It merely reveals the tablet will use a standard 12V power adapter as established on April 5. The certification is active today and will remain active until Feb. 28, 2022. Read: Surface Pro 5 Will Allegedly Feature Kaby Lake CPU Those who follow tech closely know that domestic or international certifications often come with the expectation of an impending release date. After all, if Chinese officials were able to have hands-on time with the Surface Pro 5 for consumer testing, one would assume the product is nearly ready for its consumer debut. There are currently two schools of thought when it comes to the Surface Pro 5 release announcement. While the tablet was originally anticipated for showcase at a Microsoft hardware event this month, the fact that the Pro 5 is more of an incremental upgrade has put a slight damper on those possibilities. Alternatively, it might debut during the Microsoft’s Build 2016 proceedings in May. We’d imagine a release date will be revealed alongside the device. As stated above, the Surface Pro 5 is believed to be a slight revision of the existing Surface Pro 4. While it’s expected to feature the performance boost of a Kaby Lake CPU, highly demanded features like USB-C connectivity may not be part of the package. The Surface Pro 5 is expected to release in the next few months. Are you excited that the Surface Pro 5 has been certified in China? Have recent rumors curbed your hype level?

With the launch of the AMD Ryzen 5 processors, AMD is attacking the mainstream market at the $169 to $249 price points where most gamers buy processors. AMD believes that Ryzen 5 4-core and 6-core processors will give users a well-rounded feature-rich platform that is competitive with what Intel has on the market. The AMD Ryzen R5 is aimed at the sub-$250 CPU market and feature either 4 or 6-core processor designs with SMT.  The new AMD Ryzen 5 series consists of four processors at launch; the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X, 1600, 1500X and 1400. The flagship 6-core processor is the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X (6-cores and 12-threads at a 3.6GHz base/4.0GHz Boost clock) and  the flagship 4-core processor is the Ryzen 5 1500X (4-core, 8-thread at a 3.5GHz base/3.7GHz boost). AMD sees the Ryzen 5 series being very disruptive at this price point as the Ryzen 5 1600X would be lined up across the Intel Core i5-7600K. AMD is targeting the Ryzen 5 1600X and Ryzen 5 1500X towards PC gaming enthusiasts and those just happen to be the two models that they send us to benchmark for this launch day article.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / AMD’s Ryzen 5 processors have officially launched AMD’s Ryzen 5 processors have officially launched Matthew Wilson 17 hours ago CPU, Featured Announcement AMD is keeping the Ryzen ball rolling this week as its new Ryzen 5 processors are now officially available. Reviews are live and retailers have stock, meaning AMD is now ready to take on Intel’s Core i5 lineup with its impressive new architecture. We have already reviewed the Ryzen 5 1600X and Ryzen 5 1500X processors, coming away with positive impressions. However, for those of you who prefer to buy prebuilt systems, we also have a review up of the Chillblast Fusion Hex system, featuring AMD’s Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and a GTX 1070. For those of you wondering about core counts, clock speeds and pricing, this table shows details all of that: CPU Model Cores/Threads Base/Boost Clock Speeds (GHz) XFR Clock Speed (GHz) TDP (Watts) Pricing Ryzen 5 1600X  6C/12T 3.6/4.0 4.1 95 £249/$249 Ryzen 5 1600 6C/12T 3.2/3.6 3.7 65 £219/$219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4C/8T 3.5/3.7 3.9 65 £189/$189 Ryzen 5 1400 4C/8T 3.2/3.4 3.45 65 £169/$169 All of the CPUs listed are available from today onwards. However, if you are buying a Ryzen 5 1600X, then you will need to budget for your own CPU cooler as it is the only processor in the range to not include a stock one. All Ryzen 5 CPUs support Simultaneous Multithreading Technology, which is AMD’s equivalent to Hyper-Threading. All of these CPUs will also run on X370, B350 and A320 motherboards, which are already available. Be sure to check out our full reviews for more details on performance in compute tasks and gaming, alongside details on thermals and power draw. KitGuru Says: Both Luke and Dom seem to be impressed with what Ryzen 5 has to offer. They do seem like good value when pitted against Intel’s Core i5 lineup.

By Liam Tung | April 11, 2017 -- 13:12 GMT (06:12 PDT) | Topic: Internet of Things With the Creators Update of Windows 10 IoT Core, developers with a Raspberry Pi 3 or 2 will be able fire up Cortana. Image: Raspberry Pi Foundation With the latest Windows 10 IoT Core release, you can now turn your Raspberry Pi into a Cortana-powered personal assistant for the home. Microsoft has enabled Cortana in the Creators Update build for the developer board version of Windows 10, dubbed Windows 10 IoT Core, which is available for download today. More Windows 10 Microsoft's rumored Spring event may focus around Windows 10 Cloud Windows 10 Creators Update: Now Cortana can turn your Raspberry Pi into a virtual assistant Microsoft releases first Windows 10 'Redstone 3' PC test build Hackers are attacking Word users with new Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability Microsoft opens the doors to its Windows Insider for Business program Microsoft starts making available Windows 10 Creators Update, tooling Developers with a Raspberry Pi 3 or 2, MinnowBoards MAX, Intel Joule, or the DragonBoard 410c will be able fire up Cortana once the device has been equipped with a speaker and microphone. The inclusion of Cortana will allow developers and OEMs to build what Microsoft calls a "reactive experience" by having Cortana respond to a query. It also aims to allow the user to skip through multiple steps to complete a task. Cortana on Windows Core IoT is designed to support devices with smaller screens, such as thermostats and refrigerators, according to Microsoft. Cortana's skillset on the Windows 10 IoT Core Creators Update includes: Reminder, To-do list, Traffic/Restaurant, Chit Chat, Dictionary, Finance, Health, News, Reference, Show Times, Calculator, Weather, Entity look up, Events, Sports, and Time zone. You'll be able to ask questions like: "What is the traffic to my home?" or "What song is this?", or ask Cortana to tell you a joke. Exiting Cortana requires the command "Hey Cortana", followed by "Cancel". There are still some important features missing for Cortana on Windows 10 IoT Core to be a practical home assistant. For example, it doesn't yet support music playback, calendar, alarm, and timer. The update could put Microsoft, albeit without its own hardware, in the same space as Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant and its Echo smart speaker. Google is also planning to bring its artificial-intelligence and machine-learning technologies to the Raspberry Pi this year, and recently launched its Actions on Google program to allow developers to build Actions for Google Assistant. Microsoft says any microphone model should work with Cortana, but it's tested several for better speech-recognition quality. These include Blue Microphones Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone, Cardioid; Sound Tech CM-1000USB Table Top Conference Meeting Microphone with Omni-Directional Stereo; and the Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000. To try Cortana on IoT Core, you'll need to say, "Start Cortana on Boot" on the Device Settings of Windows Device Portal and restart the device. You'll also need to sign in with a Microsoft account and consent to using Cortana.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Revisiting NIST’s cybersecurity framework By Tim Starks 04/11/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak A FEW SUGGESTIONS — Trade groups, security firms and civil society organizations on Monday offered a wide variety of feedback about the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s widely acclaimed cybersecurity framework. NIST, a technical standards agency in the Commerce Department, opened public comments on Version 1.1 of the framework in January, and they came flooding in ahead of Monday’s deadline. Story Continued Below The nation’s leading business group warned NIST that its inclusion of new language about measuring cyber risk management is unclear and concerns some of its members. “The framework should make clear that there are no one-size-fits-all methods to employing metrics and administering [supply chain risk management] activities, including within sectors,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in its filing. The group praised NIST for holding a workshop in May to explain its intent but said the agency “may need to hold follow-up gatherings to work through any significant remaining issues.” The Chamber also said the government should consider developing metrics to assess national cyber deterrence, though it acknowledged that this recommendation was “technically outside the scope” of the framework. A broad coalition of privacy and security advocates urged NIST to incorporate the topic of vulnerability disclosure into the framework, including by creating a new subcategory for it. “Processes for receiving, reviewing, and responding to vulnerability disclosures should be considered a basic, and relatively easily achievable, component of modern cybersecurity plans,” read the proposal from groups including Rapid7, Access Now, Symantec and the Center for Democracy and Technology. Meanwhile, the Internet Security Alliance and a leading risk management group said NIST should convene a new multi-stakeholder process on implementing the framework. “Simply asserting that the [framework] is cost effective is unlikely to persuade entities not using the [framework] to adopt it,” ISA and the FAIR Institute said in their filing. The two groups cited research explaining how corporate boards make decisions, and they urged NIST to develop metrics that could demonstrate the framework’s value. Also, Intel and McAfee recommended more outreach to other countries to harmonize global cyber practices. HAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity! Over the weekend your MC host played the finest game of pinball of his life. Sometimes things are OK. Send your thoughts, feedback and especially tips to tstarks@politico.com, and be sure to follow @timstarks, @POLITICOPro and @MorningCybersec. Full team info is below. ALTERING THE DEAL — The United States is working to tweak export controls under the international Wassenaar Arrangement, a State Department official told MC on Monday, but declined to specify what changes are being considered. Last week a pair of industry groups praised the Trump administration for seeking to alter the Wassenaar Arrangement to narrow the definition of “intrusion software,” language that’s meant to keep surveillance tools away from repressive regimes but that many worry could affect sales of authentic cybersecurity products. “We continue to work with our Wassenaar Arrangement partners to refine the control lists to keep pace with technological developments in this and other areas,” the official said when asked about the groups’ praise, adding that the department was consulting with industry technical experts on cyber tools. “The negotiation process unfolds over the course of the year, and any changes require agreement of all 41 participating states. It is inappropriate for us to comment on the negotiations at this time.” REMEMBER RULE 41? — The Justice Department used a recently tweaked criminal procedure to begin taking down a notorious spam and fraud botnet. On Monday, the government announced that it received permission from a federal judge in Alaska to take over the servers controlling the Kelihos botnet and redirect infected machines to new FBI-controlled servers. Once those computers ping the FBI servers, law enforcement will work with private-sector partners like internet service providers to help victims remove the malware. Perhaps most interesting to civil liberties advocates, however, is that the government applied for a warrant under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Last year, the Supreme Court approved DOJ’s proposed changes to Rule 41, letting judges anywhere in the country approve warrants in situations where the target machines’ locations are unknown or varied. That rule change sparked controversy when privacy advocates said it would expand DOJ’s hacking abilities, a claim the government denied. As activists pushed Congress to block the Rule 41 change, DOJ argued that it was a necessary response to botnets and other operations where the physical locations involved don’t fit into traditional court jurisdictions. But during a briefing with reporters after the Kelihos announcement, a DOJ official acknowledged that the takedown operation would have been possible without the changes to Rule 41 and that the government was just being careful in relying on it here. “We felt that it was useful to use that warrant to alleviate any possible doubt about the legality of our actions,” the official said. “We believed that it was better to do everything in this clear way and with the court being very clear about it.” The official declined to estimate how quickly the botnet was breaking apart but said “signs are very good” that there had been a “significant disruption.” SNIFFING OUT INSIDER THREATS — Organizations can better protect themselves against insider threats by monitoring personality traits, stressors, and significant life events of employees through technology, according to a new white paper from the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. “Both goals — improving early warning of vulnerability and understanding individual complexity — entail not only defining psychological models but also seeking methodologies and tools that can assist in swift, continuous identification and assessment,” the document states. “Most efforts to date have focused on characterizing individuals at a specific point in time — during an initial or periodic investigation — but employers now recognize the importance of leveraging innovative technology and data sources to monitor and evaluate individuals on a continuous basis.” The report notes that utilizing certain technological tools to cluster behaviors that might lead an employee to espionage or theft into “families” may “help define an ‘early warning system’ and improve understanding of how individual characteristics and environmental factors may mitigate or intensify concerning behaviors.” START ’EM YOUNG — Military academy cadets this week will have the opportunity to sample what it’s like to serve on the digital frontlines when they compete in the NSA’s 17th annual Cyber Defense Exercise. Participants will defend their computer networks and systems against attacks led by the NSA and others. “Each individual student becomes quickly and acutely aware of the gaps in their knowledge base and how it relates to the education they've received in school,” according to Robert White, an NSA specialist who serves on the squad overseeing the weeklong effort. "They inevitably realize that their academic training is only the beginning of a lifetime of learning in a rapidly changing field.” BROKERING FEW MEANINGFUL SHADOWS — That latest release of NSA hacking tools from the group Shadow Brokers? It’s not that big a deal, according to Tenable Network Security strategist Cris Thomas, aka “Space Rogue.” “The contents of the encrypted data dump seem to be pretty extensive, but include essentially old or esoteric exploits and documentation that have either been patched or made irrelevant,” Thomas told MC via email. “For example, one exploit is for Linux on DEC Alpha. Even in DEC Alpha's heyday, few people ran Linux on it, let alone today.” All in all, “although this latest dump does seem to show the depth and breadth of tools that NSA’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) has access to, nothing indicates that this is fairly current. While the data dump is extremely embarrassing to the NSA, it's unlikely to cause them much discomfort in the area of current operations.” HEAR YE, HEAR YE — Want to catch up with the current and former leaders of the House Intelligence Committee investigation into alleged Russian digital election interference? Rep. Mike Conaway, who is leading the investigation after Chairman Devin Nunes stepped away, is having a few town halls during the Easter break. Nunes is having one, too. To find out about when and where other cyber luminaries of Congress are holding town halls, check out this site. (h/t Morning Tech). TWEET OF THE DAY — A travesty by any definition of the word. RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — “Alleged CIA hacking tools have been discovered in cyber operations against at least 40 targets in 16 countries since 2011, according to the security firm Symantec.” … “The Department of Homeland Security says it is funding two efforts to prevent internet-enabled attacks on phone systems.” QUICK BYTES — Hackers are targeting Amazon’s third-party sellers. The Wall Street Journal. — New York’s financial regulator says other states should use the state’s cybersecurity rules as a model. Reuters. — Another alleged Russian hacker was busted in Spain. NBC. — Suspicions about computer hackers triggering Dallas’ emergency sirens look unwarranted.

Single page Print AMD's Ryzen 5 1600X and Ryzen 5 1500X CPUs reviewed, part one Getting our game on by Jeff Kampman  8:00 AM on April 11, 2017 AMD is wasting no time filling out its Ryzen CPU lineup. Just a little over a month ago, the company's eight-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 CPUs roared into the high-end desktop market, where they delivered a huge boost in bang for the multithreaded buck. Today, the company's Ryzen 5 CPUs take the fight to the $170-to-$250 price range, also known as the meaty middle of the CPU market. AMD's strategy here is the same as it's been for many years: offer more cores and threads than Intel does for the money. This time around, though, the Zen architecture's much-improved IPC and competitive power efficiency could offer much more steak to go with the sizzle. The two Ryzen 5 CPUs I have on the bench today—the Ryzen 5 1500X and the Ryzen 5 1600X—are the highest-performing members of a quartet of Ryzen 5 chips. The Ryzen 5 1500X offers four cores and eight threads for $189, while the Ryzen 5 1600X offers six cores and 12 threads for $249. AMD will also offer lower-priced variants of each of these CPUs with lower clocks and less XFR headroom. The Ryzen 5 1600 takes a 400-MHz haircut across the board, and AMD slices $30 off the price tag of the 1600X for the trouble. The Ryzen 5 1400, in turn, loses 300 MHz of pre-Extended Frequency Range (XFR) clock speed and costs $20 less than the 1500X. Model Cores Threads Base clock Boost clock L3 cache XFR TDP Price Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6 GHz 4.0 GHz 16MB Yes 95W $249 Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 GHz 3.6 GHz 65W $219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.7 GHz $189 Ryzen 5 1400 3.2 GHz 3.4 GHz 8MB $169 To make a Ryzen 5 CPU from the full eight-core die that underpins the Ryzen 7 family, AMD symmetrically shuts off cores across the pair of core complexes (or CCXes) on that die to reach the desired resource complement. In the case of the Ryzen 5 1600 series, that means one core in each CCX is disabled, but the chip retains all 16MB of its L3 cache. The Ryzen 5 1500X loses two cores per CCX to the silicon scythe, but it still keeps all 16MB of L3 from the full die. The Ryzen 5 1400 takes the deepest cuts of the bunch: in addition to losing two cores per CCX, the amount of L3 cache per CCX is halved to 4MB, for 8MB in total. As we hinted at a moment ago, AMD's Extended Frequency Range (XFR) returns on the Ryzen 5 series. Depending on the cooling apparatus one straps on top of a Ryzen 5 1600X, that CPU will run at up to 4.1 GHz Turbo speeds in lightly-threaded workloads, and it can clock up to 3.7 GHz under heavier load. The Ryzen 5 1500X features the most aggressive XFR implementation that AMD has yet shipped. That chip can take advantage of up to 200 MHz of XFR headroom for a 3.9 GHz maximum Turbo speed and a 3.7 GHz all-core speed. The 1600X's 95W TDP might give it more leeway to hit its XFR speeds compared to the 65W 1500X, however. As Intel has done with its recent unlocked Core i5s, AMD won't be including a boxed cooler with the Ryzen 5 1600X as part of the bargain. The company did send along one of its Wraith Max coolers as part of the press kit we received, but the rank and file will be on their own for finding an adequate CPU cooler. The Ryzen 5 1500X comes with AMD's fairly hefty Wraith Spire cooler right in the box, however. Now, for some bad news. While I expect exciting numbers from the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1600X in our productivity benchmarks, those numbers will have to wait for a little bit. I've been battling a severe case of the flu since the middle of last week, so testing and writing for this review has been slow going. After some deliberation, I decided to go ahead and publish gaming benchmarks for the Ryzen 5 family first. I expect that many builders shopping for a CPU in this price range are more interested in a gaming PC than an all-out workstation, so I wanted to get this vital information out the door rather than publish nothing at all this morning. We'll have full productivity numbers for the Ryzen 5 chips soon, but for now, let's get our game on.

In fact, it's a growing business. That's according to developers who license the smart glasses technology from Google Glass' enterprise-focused "Glass at Work" program. Google unveiled the smart glasses at its I/O conference in April 2012 in a high-profile demonstration featuring skydivers, and rolled them out to developers a year later. But the product was pricey at $1,500, and not particularly stylish. Onlookers were also concerned about the glasses recording them without their knowledge, which led to several Glass-wearers being attacked in public. Google discontinued Glass as a consumer product in 2015. But a version for the workplace lives on. "It's a big market today, and it will be an even bigger one in the future," said Brian Ballard, founder and chief executive officer at Upskill, a Google Glass partner that makes augmented reality apps for workers in the field. Its customers — and as of recently, its investors — include industrial giants like Boeing and GE. Upskill works with other smart glasses makers as well, like Intel, Microsoft and Vuzix. Ballard declined to comment on how many units it has deployed, but he did say it is targeting companies that will need "thousands of these devices in the field to do one job." Where Google could boost the business further and stand out from competitors, he says, is by adding advanced computing, like machine learning, to its offering. An example might be in incorporating computer vision technology so field workers simply have to snap photos for the purposes of documentation. Augmedix, a San Francisco-based start-up with nearly 1,000 employees, built its business off smart glasses. Unlike Upskill, the vast majority of its customers — doctors at large hospitals — are using Google Glass. CEO Ian Shakil said the company expects to deploy 1,000 Google Glass devices by the end of the year. Augmedix sells its application to 12 hospitals, including Dignity Health, Sutter Health and TriHealth, to help doctors transcribe notes from patient interactions. Doctors wear the glasses during consultations and transmit video to medical scribes, who take notes. That way, the doctors are freed up to focus on the patients. Shakil wouldn't tell us how much the company pays Google but says it's in the realm of $1,500, which is the price Google charged developers for the original product. Augmedix, which raised $23 million in December, is poised to triple its growth year over year, said Shakil. Thus far, he said, most patients seem open to their doctors wearing the device: "We've already done tens of thousands of patient interactions."

(NYSE: VMW), a global leader in cloud infrastructure and business mobility, today introduced a new release of VMware vSAN™ featuring industry-first native hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) security, lower total cost of ownership (TCO), and up to 50 percent higher all-flash performance. These combined benefits will help customers accelerate their data center modernization efforts. HCI systems are the fastest growing segment in the converged or integrated systems market, according to IDC. (2) By combining software-defined compute and storage capabilities with industry standard Intel Architecture (IA) servers, HCI systems enable customers to simplify IT operations and increase performance while lowering their upfront and ongoing costs compared to traditional storage. VMware vSAN 6.6 will help customers evolve their infrastructure with minimal risk through native encryption, robust availability and the broadest choice of hardware platforms, including cutting-edge flash technologies such as Intel® Optane™ solid-state drives (SSDs). The latest release will also further lower TCO via intelligent operations and cloud-based analytics while delivering the flexibility and performance to support modern applications and hardware. „Since the initial release of VMware vSAN in 2014, customers have turned to vSAN because of its TCO savings and the simplicity of managing compute and storage together,” said Yanbing Li, senior vice president and general manager, Storage and Availability Business Unit, VMware. „VMware vSAN 6.6 is packed with innovations featuring several industry firsts, and will further drive mainstream adoption of HCI by helping customers modernize their data centers to gain a competitive edge through newfound agility.” Evolve Data Centers with Industry-First Native HCI Security vSAN 6.6 is the sixth-generation of VMware’s simple, enterprise-grade native storage for vSphere. The storage platform is ideal for a range of use cases including business-critical and cloud-native applications, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), remote office/branch office (ROBO), and disaster recovery environments. The new release will offer customers an efficient, non-disruptive path to a more secure infrastructure that is highly available for their business-critical workloads. New features will include: Native HCI security: A software-defined, data-at-rest encryption solution featuring simplified key management that is built to protect against unwanted access to data. vSAN 6.6 customers using vSAN Encryption will have the freedom to select any vSAN-certified hardware to further lower hardware costs by avoiding expensive self-encrypting drives (SEDs). Highly available vSAN management: vSAN 6.6 will enable monitoring and management of the storage platform in the event VMware vCenter Server® is offline. Lower TCO with Enhanced Site Protection and Intelligent Operations HCI solutions powered by vSAN are well positioned to help IT teams modernize their data center infrastructure despite shrinking or static budgets and increasing demands from the business and end users. vSAN 6.6 will help customers address these challenges by alleviating the economic stress on businesses and IT through the following functionality: Efficient and economical site protection: vSAN 6.6 will deliver enhanced Stretched Clusters with local protection to provide resiliency against both site and local component failures. These highly available clusters can be deployed for up to 50 percent less than leading traditional storage solutions. (3) Proactive cloud analytics: vSAN Cloud Analytics will introduce a new analytics framework that will initially provide real-time support notifications and custom recommendations to help customers optimize their vSAN environment. The cloud-based analytics can be continuously enhanced with new checks and functionality without requiring any customer intervention. Automated hardware maintenance: Intelligent operations and lifecycle management capabilities will accelerate initial hardware setup, simplify software install, and deliver 1-click controller hardware lifecycle management for a more predictable hardware experience — without sacrificing the broadest choice of hardware. Scale HCI to Support Tomorrow’s Applications and Hardware With technology advancing at a breakneck pace, VMware vSAN continues to deliver an efficient, high-performance architecture that provides customers the flexibility to support modern applications and the latest hardware. VMware vSAN 6.6 will deliver: Faster flash performance: Optimized data service algorithms in vSAN 6.6 will help accelerate flash performance of business-critical and cloud-native applications by up to 50 percent.

The most famous of the world’s largest computer manufacturer’s brand names – besides the Moto brand acquired during the Motorola takeover – are Yoga and ThinkPad. While the former had been used exclusively for consumer branded produces the latter had been the business market top dog for many years. Until 2013, that is, when Lenovo first created the ThinkPad Yoga and brought these two together. The first model, a 12 inch convertible based on Intel’s Haswell processors, was followed by the ThinkPad Yoga 14 and ThinkPad Yoga 15 a year later. In 2016 Lenovo discontinued the latter again and three new models were introduced: the ThinkPad Yoga 260, the ThinkPad Yoga 460, and the much more expensive ThinkPad X1 Yoga. And the times, they are a-changin’. With its 2017 Kaby Lake generation Lenovo has once more revised the Yoga line-up from scratch. Based on customer feedback, according to which customers found the Yoga 260’s 12.5 inch display too small and the Yoga 460 too large, Lenovo did the only sensible thing: they scrapped both Yoga models and replaced them with a single ThinkPad Yoga device alongside their X1 Yoga: the 13.3 inch ThinkPad Yoga 370. Its mission remained unaffected: to attract business customers and students alike for whom the X1 Yoga is too expensive.

By Agamoni Ghosh Updated April 11, 2017 11:13 BST Latops tend to heat up when kept on for long hours Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images Scientists have developed a new water droplet system that may help in keeping our electronics like laptops and mobile phones cool. The new system aims to fill the insides of the electronics with bouncing water droplets. The method developed by researchers at the Duke University and Intel Corporation is made to specially identify hot spots in high-performance electronics. The mechanism is based on the super-hydrophobic wings of cicada insects that naturally repel water. "A better cooling system will enable faster computers, longer-lasting electronics and more powerful electric vehicles," says Chuan-Hua Chen one of the researchers from the team. How does it work? When water droplets merge on a super-hydrophobic surface, the loss in surface area releases enough energy to make them jump up off the surface. A similar phenomenon happens on the wings of cicadas as the energy release is responsible to lift the water off the wing's surface, taking dust and dirt with it and making the wings self-cleaning. Applying the same technique the researchers created a sealed vapour chamber made of a super-hydrophobic floor with a sponge-like ceiling. When placed beneath operating electronics the vapour condenses into small water droplets that fall onto the super-hydrophobic floor. Then the tiny droplets turn into bigger droplets and jump off the surface, taking heat with them. These droplets then jump toward hotspots where the water vapour will condense first. What's new and how is it better? While there are already cooling techniques in place for electronics, the new technology has certain advantages over them. Thermoelectric coolers that are widely used in electronics cannot target hotspot locations, rendering them inefficient for use over large areas. While some approaches can target hotspots they need additional power inputs. The new droplet cooling technology also has a built-in mechanism for vertical heat escape, something missing in heat spreaders already in use. "Computer processors and power electronics don't perform as well if waste heat cannot be removed. A better cooling system will enable faster computers, longer-lasting electronics and more powerful electric vehicles," say Chen. The mechanism is still at an early stage as the main challenge is to find suitable materials that work with high-heat vapour over long term. The team is hopeful it will be able to find a practical way of developing this technique for industrial use and says it can performance of electronics across the board including electric cars.

Data Center Storage Still no flash in a flash as chip supplies remain fried At least that's what HPE tells us 11 Apr 2017 at 09:39, Chris Mellor Five months after the Reg first reported that HPE, Cisco – and even Dell EMC – were being punched hard in the supply chain by worldwide flash chip shortages, it's still a problem for at least one vendor. A Reg reader forwarded this alert message from an HPE system configurator: ALERT! Due to an industry-wide shortage, all non-recommended SSDs are expected to be out of stock, as well as some recommended SSDs. Please consult your HPE representative for availability. Smartphones and digital cameras/camcorders are using more flash and the foundry operators – Samsung, Toshiba/WD, Intel/Micron and SK Hynix – can't produce enough flash chips to meet that demand as well as the need for SSD flash. It has been suggested that supply might get less constrained around the mid-year point. An HPE spokesperson said: “As we said on our first quarter earnings call, industry-wide demand for NAND storage is constrained due to rapid growth from not only commercial IT products, but also consumer products such as mobile phones and cameras. As such, certain HPE Solid State Drives (SSDs) are supply constrained, and customer orders using the constrained SSDs may experience extended lead times. HPE has recommended alternative SSDs to improve delivery times for our customers." Back in November, we wrote that vendors were quoting customers "elongated lead times – in some extreme cases by more than four months". In a note to its customers – seen by us last year – HPE had warned to expect shortages to "continue through Q1 2017 or longer." It would appear that it's going to be "longer", then. We heard Oracle might be similarly constrained and checked late last week. An Oracle spokesperson declined to comment. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments MORE Oracle Ssd HPE More from The Register The only thing worse than working at CSC?

Business Technology Qualcomm fires back against Apple lawsuit over patent licensing Qualcomm processor Brent Lewin/Bloomberg A Qualcomm baseband processor sits inside a smartphone sold as an Apple iPhone 4S in 2014. A Qualcomm baseband processor sits inside a smartphone sold as an Apple iPhone 4S in 2014. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg) Mike FreemanContact Reporter Qualcomm accuses Apple of meddling with its patent agreements with contract manufacturers that build iPhones. Qualcomm fired back late Monday against Apple’s legal attack on its patent licensing business -- accusing the world’s largest tech company of egging on anti-trust regulators with misleading information and meddling with Qualcomm’s long-standing patent agreements with contract manufacturers that build iPhones. Qualcomm also claims Apple violated California’s unfair competition law by throttling the performance of Qualcomm’s modems and then claiming there was “no discernible difference” in performance between iPhone 7s using Qualcomm’s cellular modems and iPhone 7s with Intel chips. Apple threatened to retaliate if Qualcomm publicly made a case that its chips were better. The San Diego wireless giant filed its counter-claims in response to Apple’s lawsuit in January in a San Diego federal court. Apple alleges that Qualcomm uses its market dominance in cellular modems to squeeze excessive patent royalties out of smartphone makers. Apple also says Qualcomm is withholding nearly $1 billion it owes Apple in retaliation for its cooperation with anti-monopoly regulators investigating Qualcomm. In its court filing, Qualcomm denies Apple’s charges. The San Diego company also contends that Apple is refusing to make payments it owes to Qualcomm. Apple’s lawsuit attacks the foundation of Qualcomm’s patent licensing business model by challenging the value of its patents and the practice of charging royalties based on the wholesale price of the smartphone instead of the modem chip itself. Patents are a key part of Qualcomm’s business. While it makes most of its revenue selling chips used in mobile devices, it earns the bulk of its profit from patent licensing. In court filings, Qualcomm takes pains to paint Apple as a Goliath with immense power over suppliers, saying the company has more money and influence than many countries. Qualcomm contends Apple’s aim is to pay less for the Qualcomm intellectual property that allowed Apple to prosper in smartphones with little or no investment in the core cellular technology. “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world – capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits – without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Now it has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm.” Qualcomm’s technology is in nearly all 3G and 4G smartphones, powering the connection between the handset and cellular towers that enables services ranging from mobile emails to social media photo sharing to streaming video. For more than two decades, the company has licensed its cellular know-how to smartphone makers. But recently its licensing business has come under attack. South Korea’s anti-monopoly regulator fined Qualcomm more than $850 million and seeks to upend the way it licenses technology. (Qualcomm has appealed in court.) The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has sued Qualcomm over patent licensing. Investigations are under way in Japan, Taiwan and elsewhere. In its court filing, Qualcomm claims Apple played a role in this recent regulatory scrutiny by “intentionally giving government agencies false and misleading information and testimony about Qualcomm. Qualcomm also claims that Apple has interfered with Qualcomm’s patent contracts with third party contract manufacturers that build iPhones – mostly in China. Apple previously reimbursed these companies for patent royalties paid to Qualcomm but has stopped in recent months, according to Qualcomm’s court filing. That has led contract manufacturers in some cases to stop paying Qualcomm. The company wants the court to find that its patent deals with Apple’s contract manufacturers comply with the rules for licensing standard essential patents and don’t violate competition law. It also wants the court to find that it has dealt fairly with Apple with regards to licensing patents. Over the past decade, Apple has rung up $760 billion in iPhone sales, according to court filings. Yet Qualcomm’s per-device royalty for its vast portfolio of cellular patents is less than what Apple charges consumers for a basic plastic iPhone case. “Apple can sue Samsung, for example, and claim all kinds of value on a few patents that they sue them on, but somehow claim that our tens of thousands of core technology patents are not worth what the market has said they’re worth,” said Rosenberg. “That is what they are trying to take from us here. That is why we have to fight as hard as we can to prove the continuing value of our contributions.” ALSO: Apple's lawsuit against Qualcomm signals escalating war on business model Under Trump administration, FTC lawsuit against Qualcomm could disappear Qualcomm faces FTC lawsuit over patent licensing Qualcomm slapped with $865 million fine from S.

Qualcomm countersuit claims Apple ‘refuses to acknowledge’ the value of its technology Posted yesterday by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber isn’t welcome in Italy anymore | Crunch Report Apple filed a billion-dollar royalty lawsuit against Qualcomm in January and today the chip maker hit back with a legal case of its own against the iPhone maker which, it claims, has refused to acknowledge the value of its technology. In the original suit, Apple claimed that Qualcomm — which makes money from licensing its patents to technology makers — was charging it for patents “they have nothing to do with.” That, Apple said, included TouchID, display panels and camera components. Apple also accused Qualcomm of inflating prices through its licensing model. “Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies,” Qualcomm executive VP and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. In more specific details, Qualcomm claimed Apple had “breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm,” adding that the phone maker “interfered” with its manufacturing partners that build the iPhone and iPad and use Qualcomm licenses. Things get more dramatic with the iPhone 7. There are different versions of the device in the U.S. running modem chips from both Intel and Qualcomm. Apple had previously suggested that the Intel-powered devices were superior and were therefore being pared back to ensure that customers had the same quality regardless of the internals. Qualcomm has, unsurprisingly, not taken too keenly to that. The firm said that Apple “chose not to utilize the full performance” and then “misrepresented the performance disparity” between it and Intel’s tech. Further, Qualcomm claimed Apple threatened it from going public to explain that its tech was actually behind the superior iPhone. “[Apple] has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry,” Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, added. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Qualcomm Founded 1985 Overview Qualcomm is an American fabless semiconductor company that designs, manufactures, and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and services.

On the topic of Everend’s unique artistic style, team member Megan Daniels explains that “We had three to four strong digital painters on our team, so we really wanted to play that up with a very painterly style.” With its earthy colors and interesting textures, Everend boasts an abundance of beautiful landscapes, the likes of which invite players to explore and discover. Along with stunning visuals, Everend has an intriguing storyline as well. Telling the story of a young, injured owl lost in a cave, players have to help the owl find her way home. . . with some twists involved. To get an idea of what the game is like, a player’s initial experience will be as follows: “You awake with a start, only to find yourself in a dark and dreary cavern, all alone and feeling very confused. Your last recollection is of being in the loving embrace of your mother, but she is now simply nowhere to be found. You rack your brains for anything, anything that might explain how you may have found yourself in a place like this, but fall short in this attempt, for nothing will come to mind. But wait . . . oh yes, that’s right – the volcano. It erupted. And now you are here. All alone. “You quickly decide that the first order of business is to pick a direction and start walking (after all, doing something must be better than doing nothing). This soon proves to be a more difficult task than you initially had thought, for all too frequently you find yourself struggling to avoid the protruding stalagmites that scatter the puddle-ridden ground of the cave. Fortunately, this task does not prove impossible, for your way is dimly lit by the glow cast by the luminescent mushrooms that speckle the cavern walls. “You turn the corner and gasp with discomfort as a blinding flash of white light assaults your unprepared eyes. Squinting, you can just make out the form of a large shimmering owl towering over you, enticing you to come near. . .” Sound interesting?

Now it has officially launched this series of CPUs mainly meant for home and business users. This CPU series consists of four different models - the Ryzen 5 1600X, Ryzen 5 1600, Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400. Jim Anderson, senior vice president, and general manager, Computing and Graphics Group, AMD says, "AMD Ryzen is a proven game-changer, ultimately bringing innovation and competition back across PC market segments, and we are excited to introduce the next tier of AMD Ryzen processors to the market today. " These new processors is said to deliver better experiences and high performance. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Ryzen 5 1600X The six-core model by name Ryzen 5 1600X is priced at Rs. 18,199 and is capable of running two threads in the single core. Clocked at 3.6GHz, it is having a boost speed of 4.0GHz. It has 95W TDP and takes the advantage of AMD's eXtended Frequency Range technology. This technology uses embedded sensor network to clarify whether to push itself beyond the boost speed of 4.0GHz on request. Also Read: Lam Research India: One of the players in Semiconductor space It does so by identifying if there is enough power and thermal headroom to satisfy the demand. Since Ryzen 5 1600X is designed keeping in mind that user may use a beefier cooler, it doesn't offer a stock cooler in it. It is the first model in the Ryzen 5 series to not include this option. It looks like 1600X is a tough competitor for Intel's Core i5 model.   Ryzen 5 1600 The Ryzen 5 1600 is another six-core model which is available at a lesser price of Rs. 15,799. It is having a base speed of 3.2GHz and designed to go up to 3.6GHz on request. It has a TDP of 65W and provides AMD's Wraith Spire cooler in it. Ryzen 5 1500X Another model by name Ryzen 5 1500X is a quad-core processor which has the ability to run eight threads. This model is priced at Rs. 13,799. Also Read: Snapdragon 835: Meet the powerful Qualcomm processor With the power to run between the range of 3.5GHz and 3.7GHz, it has 65W TDP ratings. It comes with Wraith Spire cooler which is provided in 1600 model as well.   Ryzen 5 1400 The Ryzen 5 1400 is another quad-core CPU with the same capability as Ryzen 5 1500X. But it is available for the little lesser price than the former with a price tag of Rs. 12,199. This model runs between 3.2GHz and 3.4GHz. Even the TDP ratings are same as 1500X. This model is featured to work with the more compact version of Wraith Stealth cooler.   Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! You can refer the image below for more detailed specification of all the four series. The company is expecting this new series to be more disruptive than its predecessor Ryzen 7 model.

It was also the month where Microsoft's blocking of updates on devices running 7th generation silicon on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 is up in full swing. We talked about Microsoft's decision to block updates on Windows 7 or 8.1 machines with 7th generation Kaby Lake or Ryzen processors before. Microsoft's reasoning is that the latest hardware requires the latest version of Windows for support. It should not come as a surprise that Microsoft recommends that users upgrade their PCs to Windows 10 for continued support of the new processor generation. The company rolled out updates in March that would block Windows Update from working correctly on systems with 7th generation cpus. Back to the April 2017 Patch Day. The first screw up by Microsoft on the aforementioned Patch Day was that the company's blocking of updates for systems with 7th generation processors suddenly blocked a 6th generation cpu as well as reported by Woody first. Microsoft notes: If the PC uses an AMD Carrizo DDR4 processor, installing this update (KB 4015549 (the Win7 Monthly Rollup), KB 4015546 (the Win7 Security-Only patch), KB 4015550 (the Win8.1 Monthly Rollup), KB 4015547 (the Win8.1 Security-Only patch) will block downloading and installing future Windows updates. Microsoft is working on a solution, apparently. Microsoft's Lifecycle Policy Faq has this to say about AMD Carrizo processors. Under What is the support policy for prior generations of processors and chipsets on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 it writes: Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will continue to be supported for security, reliability, and compatibility on prior generations of processors and chipsets under the standard lifecycle for Windows. This includes most devices available for purchase today by consumers or enterprises and includes generations of silicon such as AMD’s Carrizo and Intel’s Broadwell and Haswell silicon generations. This is remarkable. Not only is Microsoft blocking a 6th generation PC (temporary or not), it also highlights that the update blocking patches are included in the security-only update as well. The distinction between security and monthly rollup patches should be clear, but it is not. Security-only updates should only include security patches (and updates for those patches), while the monthly rollups should include everything. Microsoft pushes non-security updates to the security-only update packages however. Microsoft's decision to include the cpu blocking update in the security-only update ensures that updates will be blocked for good on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 machines running 7th generation processors. Are workaround available to install future patches on affected systems? I don't have access to a 7th generation cpu, and cannot say therefore if third-party update solutions will continue to work.  It is clear that you should not install the patches that include the blocking code obviously. Now You: What is your take on this?

April 12, 2017 at 6:55 am # I've converted one more of my old Windows boxes to Linux because of follies like this. Reply M$Spy April 12, 2017 at 7:08 am # That's it, time to permanently turn off updates. Reply beemeup4 April 12, 2017 at 7:24 am # Microsoft knew full well that security patches were the last haven for people who wanted a secure system AND a stable system and often opted NOT to install "feature" updates that seem to have a growing trend of breaking things like a certain rollup package that completely killed Intel bluetooth devices and I'm not sure if they (MS) or Intel ever released a fix for that claiming that fault lay with the other party or some such nonsense, meanwhile users were just left hanging. So of course Microsoft started attaching non-security elements to security patches which were completely unrelated to the security flaw being fixed, and... surprise surprise once very reliable security updates became potential system breakers just like their feature update brethren. if you think for a second that this wasn't completely intentional, you are naive. That "X" button being changed from "Cancel" to "Accept" on the Windows 10 upgrade box was no accident. Now there's this fiasco with "unsupported CPUs", which should be for many the last straw especially for those with even an inkling of computer history. Back in "the beginning" operating systems were written for specific hardware so there was no interoperability and even upgrading hardware required a system rewrite. Extremely quickly they realized this was completely impractical and could not scale, so they eventually standardized on the X86 instruction set which we use to this day. But now Microsoft goes "fvck decades of history, let's tie software with hardware again because users are idiots". Fvcking DOS can run on Kabylake but MS wants us to think Windows 7 and 8.1 somehow "doesn't"?! Just another maddeningly transparent attempt at shoving Windows 10 down people's throats. This kind of practice goes against everything I stand for, so I won't use Windows 10 out of pure principle. It is the ONLY meaningful way to say "NO", or in more polite terms, "FVCK YOU MICROSOFT".. Reply Gary April 12, 2017 at 7:47 am # I hope someone with a lot of money decides to sue Microsoft over its refusing to allow more powerful computers to run the operating system the user wants and receive updates. If a computer will run the system, it should be the users prerogative whether or not it gets installed. The only thing Microsoft should do is update their software and make the updates available for all legal users of their operating system. The hardware is quite frankly none of their business. Just like its none of their business how someone uses their computer. If they want data, then the operating system should be completely free. And offering a free upgrade to a paid operating system does not change the fact the software was still paid for. Microsoft has gone off the deep end with their strong armed tactics to get people to upgrade to 10. Reply [email protected] April 12, 2017 at 8:26 am # I just received this shitty updates on newly installed ryzen system. Oh, this bastards worked hard to make installation nearly to impossible, but I make it. Fuck to all of them. I hope that in future somebody will make the patch which substitute cpu id to trick freaking windows update.. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Frankly, I've never seen so much drama unfold so quickly in the tech community -- what an exciting time to be a PC enthusiast! As we begin to recover from the roller coaster ride that was Ryzen 7, we now have Ryzen 5 to address. Getting the ball rolling, AMD has announced four models in its more affordable series, including a pair of six-core CPUs as well as two quad-core models. The 1600X is configured similarly to the Core i7-6800K and stands as the flagship of AMD's Ryzen 5 family, boasting six cores and 12 threads with a base clock frequency of 3.6GHz and a boost speed of up to 4GHz. Like all Ryzen CPUs, the 1600X is unlocked, but we wouldn't necessarily expect to squeeze much more out of the stock settings given what we've seen from Ryzen 7. AMD says the 1600X will be almost 70% faster than the Core i5-7600K when measuring multi-threaded performance in Cinebench, though that isn't a huge surprise considering the Ryzen part has two more cores plus eight threads. Alongside the 1600X is a second six-core part known as the 1600, which comes downclocked by 400MHz but is nonetheless completely unlocked. As was the case when we reviewed the 1700X and 1700, it's likely that the 1600 will be a much better buy than the 1600X. However, we only have the 1600X on hand for today's testing. The 1500X and 1400 represent AMD's new four-core/eight-thread Ryzen 5 parts and these come clocked even lower out of the box. The 1500X operates at a base clock of 3.5GHz with a boost of 3.7GHz and the 1400 runs at 3.2GHz but can boost to 3.4GHz (and again, both are unlocked). For those wondering, the 1500X and 1600 will ship with the Wraith Spire cooler while the 1400 comes with the smaller Wraith Stealth cooler. Unfortunately, we only have one quad-core model on hand for review and that's the higher-clocked 1500X. Price-wise, the 1600X is set at $250 alongside the Core i5-7600K, though we suspect you may be better off buying the standard 1600 for $30 less at $220. Folks seeking a sub-$200 Ryzen 5 chip have the 1500X and 1400 to pick from at $190 and $170, prices that compete with lower-end (locked) Core i5s and higher-end Core i3s such as the $170 unlocked 7350K, which we know to be terrible value. By the way things look on paper, the Ryzen 5 1400 should have Intel's entire Kaby Lake-based Core i3 range begging for mercy while the locked Core i5 models should be equally if not more rattled. In the first of what will likely be many write-ups about Ryzen 5, we'll be pitting the 1500X against the locked Core i5-7500 and the 1600X against the unlocked 7600K. The Core i7-7700K, 6900K and 1800X will be included purely for comparison's sake, and although we haven't had time to add results for the six-core 6800K, we think it's unnecessary anyway. Given Ryzen's pricing scheme, Broadwell-E can be considered a write-off at this point.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) — The UNSC will vote on a draft resolution submitted by the United States, United Kingdom and France on the April 4 chemical attack in Syria on Wednesday at 3pm, the representative said. "The vote is scheduled for Wednesday at 3pm," the representative said. It was earlier reported that a new draft of Security Council resolution on the recent chemical attack in Syria was circulated by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. On April 4, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces said some 80 people were killed and 200 injured earlier that day in a chemical weapons attack in Khan Shaykhun, Idlib province, blaming the Syrian army for the incident. © AP Photo/ Carolyn Kaster Mad Dog’s Proof: I Saw Intel on Syrian Chemical Attack MyselfThe Syrian foreign minister denied the government’s involvement in the Idlib incident. The United States, France and the United Kingdom proposed a draft resolution condemning the attack and claiming it was carried out by the Syrian government forces. Among other things, it emphasized the need for the Syrian government to provide investigation teams with information on flight plans, flight logs, names of all individuals in command of all helicopter squadrons and provide access to relevant air bases. Russia submitted its own draft resolution on conducting a proper investigation into the incident. It also suggests forming an investigation team "based on the principle of a broad-based and balanced geographical representation" that should have safe and secure access to the site of the incident.

Great presentation and personality. Action that is both creative and accessible. Free with purchase of Oculus Touch controllers. Cons Repetitive level design. Replay value reliant on grinding for in-game rewards. Very brief single player experience. Bottom Line Well-executed action and native mod support shine in this great looking, if brief, shooter that is sometimes mired by repetition. By Alice D. Newcome-Beill Many Oculus Rift games allow you to point a gun and shoot stuff with a reasonable level of competency and effect. This is not a novel concept, so Robo Recall is reliant on other merits to set itself apart from its competition. The game's biggest draw, besides its fun and accessible robot-shooting action, is its built-in mod support, a feature that has been absent from native Oculus Rift titles. The native mod support, combined with the accessibility of the tools provided by Robo Recall's developer, Epic Games, make creating additional content not only easy, but encouraged, as well. The action-packed Robo Recall is available on the Oculus store for $29.99, but it's free for anyone who has purchased the Oculus Touch controllers. //Compare Similar Products Compare Mass Effect: Andromeda (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Superhot VR (for Oculus Rift)   %displayPrice%%seller% Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% For Honor (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Halo Wars 2 (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Disc Jam (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Double Dragon IV (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dead Rising 4 (for PC)   %displayPrice%%seller% Employee of the Month Robo Recall puts you in the shoes of an employee of the Robo Ready Corporation, a person tasked with recalling formerly obedient robotic servants that have recently revolted against their former masters. In this case, when you think robot uprising, don't think bleak future with mountains of skulls being crushed under the weight of our mechanical overlords. Robo Recall's mechanical adversaries have a personality best described as snarky, or shade throwing, rather than spiteful, titanium death machines from some post-nuclear dystopia. This witty and irreverent tone prevails throughout the game and lends some much needed personality to what would otherwise be another shooting gallery experience. Robo Recall's gameplay is divided into a series of levels that task you with tackling a variety of objectives. This includes capturing robots without destroying them, protecting an important piece of hardware, or simply wrecking as many enemies as you can within an allotted time. Each level can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to complete, but with a total of only 9 levels, this makes for a very brief single-player experience. However, the levels are intended to be played multiple times to improve your score and complete in-game challenges as you aim to top the leaderboard. Batch Recall Robo Recall's combat encourages creativity, improvisation, and occasionally a little sadism, not unlike Superhot VR. The shooting feels good and works remarkably well, but your bare hands can be just as deadly. Shooting an enemy mid-air and throwing its lifeless shell into the face of a charging bot is a feeling that never gets old. You can also add insult to injury by tearing off an enemy's arm and beating them with it. A versatile teleportation mechanic, while sometimes a little disorienting, offers some of the most dynamic mobility in a VR shooter. These experiments in violence ultimately impact your final score, which reflects how creatively you dispatched your enemies and how efficiently you accomplished your objectives. How well you do ties into the progression system which unlocks new weapons and upgrades. While the game rarely surprises you with new mechanics, you may surprise yourself from time to time as you come up with increasingly interesting ways to dismantle enemies. Robo Recall's gameplay may come across as slightly derivative to anyone who has played a VR shooter, but the game's production values and personality set it apart from the crowd. This familiarity also has the added benefit of making the game remarkably accessible. Overall, the spontaneity and irreverence of the combat combined with dopamine-fueled combo chains evoke a style reminiscent of Hotline Miami, but without the punishing difficulty. In fact, it's difficult to recall a time when I felt legitimately challenged by Robo Recall. Once you have an understanding of your full range of abilities, the game has a difficult time stopping you. Still, this is exactly what made my fleeting experience with Robo recall so much fun. Performance Review Epic Games' first-hand experience in developing the Unreal Engine software framework really shines through in Robo Recall, resulting in one of the best looking titles available on the Oculus Platform—a game that runs at a smooth and steady 90 frames per second. I ran Robo Recall on the Razer Blade Pro gaming laptop, and rarely experienced any dropped frames, even while running the game at max settings. There are some flexible graphics options for lower end machines, but Oculus recommends at least an Intel i5 processor and a Nvidia GTX 970 GPU (or equivalent). Robo Recall hits another keynote for VR by being the first title with built-in mod support. While some VR titles are able to cooperate to some extent with user created content, Robo Recall makes creating and implementing mods remarkably easy with the Robo Recall Mod Kit that is made available on the Epic Games site. The Robo Recall Mod Kit is built around the Unreal Engine's Blueprints Visual Scripting System, which means that all of the tools developers used to make Robo Recall are made available to users. This gives anyone the freedom to make new content. This can range from simply tweaking the numerical values associated with different assets, to creating completely new levels with custom enemies and weapon models. The mods currently available do little to fundamentally change the core gameplay experience, but free content regularly produced by the Robo Recall community promises that the game will likely expand well beyond its original design. Ultimately, it will be interesting to see how Robo Recall's community-based content develops. The VR community's attention span has remained notoriously short, but perhaps a lack of community support is what was missing from the equation. Summary of Benefits None of these minor shortcomings detract from the veritable buffet of violence that Robo Recall serves up. Sure, other shooters have done what Robo Recall does, but rarely has it felt this good. The brevity of the Robo Recall experience does lend itself to becoming repetitive as you grind for unlocks. However, these small setbacks are handily countered by mod support that adds fresh, new wrinkles to gameplay that feels great and is immensely gratifying.

NXP Semiconductors NV, the industry leader, has agreed to be acquired by Qualcomm Inc in a $47 billion deal to retain its lead in the fast-growing automotive chips market. And more recently, Intel Corp agreed to buy Israeli autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Kure said Renesas, which bought U.S. chipmaker Intersil Corp for $3.2 billion this year, is constantly reviewing its list of potential acquisition targets, comprising around several dozen names in fields such as sensors and security. To be ready for major acquisitions, Kure said the company would probably need to raise capital by issuing shares “at some point” in the future. “We want to be prepared to move when necessary,” he said. According to data research firm IHS, Renesas had an automotive chip market share of 9% in 2016, ranking after NXP with 12.6% and Infineon Technologies with 9.5%. (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 11, 2017 9:19 pm UTC Enlarge / Nvidia's Pascal-based GTX 1060. Mark Walton reader comments 48 Share this story Last week, when Nvidia announced its new top-end Titan Xp GPU, it also said that it would be releasing macOS drivers for the new card and the company's entire Pascal-based GPU lineup. Today, it has released version 378.05.05.05f01 of its Mac driver, a beta that will allow Macs (and sort-of Macs) to support those cards for the first time. The driver should support all Pascal-based graphics cards under macOS Sierra, including the GTX 1050, 1050 Ti, 1060, 1070, 1080, and 1080 Ti, as well as the Titan X and Titan Xp. It also supports many older GeForce and Quadro GPUs going all the way back to the GeForce 8000 series. Further ReadingNvidia delivers new and improved Titan Xp—3,840 cores, 550GB/s memory bandwidth These drivers are good news for Mac users who want to use the newest, best GPUs, but they shouldn't be taken as a sign that Apple is working to put any Pascal-based GPUs in upcoming Macs. Nvidia has maintained macOS drivers for older Maxwell-based GPUs even though Apple never shipped them in any Macs (every new Mac starting from the 2013 Mac Pro has used Intel's and AMD's GPUs exclusively). The list of Macs that can officially use these new GPUs is small—just a handful of older Mac Pros with PCI Express slots, at least until Apple puts out new iMacs, MacBook Pros, or Mac Pros with Nvidia GPUs—but unofficially, people use these drivers for all sorts of things. They can enable support for Nvidia GPUs in external Thunderbolt GPU docks, and they're also popular in the "Hackintosh" community as a way to use newer, better GPUs than Apple officially supports inside Mac clones built with standard PC components. These systems violate Apple's license agreement for macOS, but that hasn't kept vibrant online communities from springing up around custom-built "Macs."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 April 2017 by Military News AR Gaming Market – Trends and Forecasts: Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio’s latest report on the global AR gaming market provides an analysis on the most important trends expected to impact the market outlook from 2017-2021. Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Ujjwal Doshi, a lead research analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on media and entertainment services sector, says, “The market is growing rapidly as the technology is still new and has high potential. The unique user experience created through the AR technology is the major factor for the adoption of AR gaming in the mobile gaming industry. It is estimated that the availability and downloads of AR gaming apps will be the highest in 2017.” In 2016, the global AR gaming market was valued at USD 89.18 million. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 151%, to reach USD 8,960.11 million by 2021. The rapid growth of the market is due to the rise in the number of mobile gamers globally. In APAC countries, such as China, South Korea, and Japan, the use of the AR technology is rising in the gaming segment. It is expected that many leading companies like Facebook, Google, NVIDIA, and Microsoft will launch AR apps that will provide unique interaction with the physical world. Request a sample report: https://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=56137 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the global outsourced software testing market according to Technavio media and entertainment research analysts are: Growing investments through crowdfunding Several AR vendors have used crowdfunding to raise capital for their projects. This has benefitted the market in several ways. Firstly, it increases awareness among potential customers. Secondly, it encourages new vendors to enter the market, which in turn, increases competitions and decreases prices. Thirdly, vendors will have a better idea about the demand for their products. They will be able to involve potential buyers at the product development stage by directly communicating with them. “Though smart glasses for gaming have not yet been fully commercialized, the funding will aid developers to design advanced smart glasses for gaming. This will increase the popularity of AR gaming and AR game downloads, which will contribute to market growth,” according to Ujjwal. Increasing adoption of depth-sensing cameras Depth-sensing cameras contain sensors that can scan objects in 3D. This creates new possibilities for gaming and photography. Users can scan their home environment with a 3D camera to build a terrain that can be used for AR gaming. 3D sensors can be integrated with existing devices or can be built into new devices. In 2014, Metaio announced the launch of 3D depth sensor support for mobile devices in 2015 and demonstrated the 3D scanning process of the environment. Google and Intel have invested heavily in this technology, and the first batch of smartphones with this technology is expected to be launched in late 2017. Growing collaboration with mobile AR content providers Mobile devices give many opportunities for vendors to innovate and enhance real-world experiences. One such innovation is the AR technology that creates a digital layer over the physical world, providing consumers with a more immersive experience. Vendors in the AR technology environment are partnering with different vendors across the supply chain to support and expedite the progress of the AR technology. The key vendors are as follows: Augmented Pixels Aurasma Blippar Catchoom Infinity Augmented Reality Qualcomm Technologies Total Immersion VividWorks Wikitude Zappar Browse Related Reports: Become a Technavio Insights member and access all three of these reports for a fraction of their original cost.
