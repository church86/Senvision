Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

By: Steven Bassiri | Guides | Posted: 1 week, 2 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [MSI Gaming Build Part Selection] Page 1 [MSI Gaming Build Part Selection] Page 2 [MSI Z270 Gaming M7 Walkthrough] Page 3 [MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB Walkthrough] Page 4 [Build Tips for the Beast] Page 5 [MSI's CLICK BIOS 5 and BIOS Update] Page 6 [Fan Control and RGB Setup] Page 7 [Automatic and Manual CPU Overclocking] Page 8 [GPU Overclocking and Final Overclocking Results] Page 9 [MSI's Software] Page 10 [Finale] MSI Gaming Build Part Selection   Your browser does not support HTML5 video playback.     We decided to team up with MSI to bring you our first sponsored build guide featuring the MSI Z270 Gaming M7 and MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB. The purpose of this build guide is simple; we will go over the component selection, physical build optimization, UEFI optimization, software optimization, and finally overclocking.   The guide will offer both a shallow and deep dive into the build so that both novice and experienced users can optimize each part to get every last drop of performance. If you have never built a computer before, this guide doesn't necessarily cover how to build a computer, but MSI's motherboard manual does. Pages 3 to 12 of MSI's Z270 Gaming M7 manual detail how to build a PC.     The guide will focus on two of MSI's top products; the GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB featuring the Twin Frozr VI cooler (Review Here) and the Z270 Gaming M7 motherboard (Review Here). MSI is one of the top vendors for enthusiast-grade motherboards and graphics cards, and that's because of their commitment to producing gaming oriented products.     The build we are going to walk-through has been designed and optimized to feature some of the fastest available components, and these two products are some of MSI's best and most popular. The graphics card has been optimized to operate at extremely low noise levels while providing top notch performance, while the motherboard is designed to support the latest technologies and easy configuration (including overclocking).     The rest of this build was done with components I chose to reduce bottlenecks and optimize compatibility; you can change the part selection depending on your needs. I will discuss each part, why I chose it, and what you might want to change.     Test Setup   CPU: Intel Core i7 7700K - The LGA1151 socket paired with an Intel Z270 chipset motherboard can take full advantage of the 7700K and 7600K. If you don't do much in terms of multithreaded work, the 7600K might be a preferable alternative. The IPC of Skylake (6700K) and Kaby Lake (7700K) are almost identical, and you can use either CPU. However, the 7700K overclocks much easier and supports a few more features (Optane).   Motherboard: MSI Z270 Gaming M7 - The MSI Z270 Gaming M7 is one of the most popular MSI gaming motherboards, offering many great features for its price. It has almost every modern feature you could want and offers many unique MSI features. When you buy a vendor's most popular product, you are almost guaranteed they will support it better than their more unpopular ones and that the community approves of it.   Cooler: Corsair H115i GT - Buy from Amazon - I used this cooler because I had an extra, but I wanted to make sure to use a double radiator AIO. While some users prefer to use their custom built water cooling setups, I decided to go AIO to save time and peace of mind (leaks). I have been a fan of Corsair's AIOs, and their performance is good enough to overclock Intel's 10-Core 6950X, so it should be good enough to cool our 5GHz 7700K. You can use whatever cooler you like, just remember that the overclocking limiter for modern Intel CPUs tends to be cooling.   Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum (4x4GB) 3200MHz - I had this kit on-hand, as the 32GB version just replaced it in my review test-bench. Memory compatibility is one of the most common issues that leads to failed boots, instability, and just random problems. If you want to be 100% sure that the kit you purchase won't cause problems, stick to MSI's Memory QVL.   Video Card: MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB - Based on NVIDIA's famous Pascal architecture, this GTX 1080 offers 8GB of GDDR5X, a hefty Twin Frozr VI cooler, and custom PCB. Cooling is what sets many GPUs apart, and MSI is known for having some of the highest performing and quiet coolers around.   Storage - Boot Drive: Samsung 950 Pro 256GB - Samsung makes some of the fastest NVMe-based M.2 SSDs, and MSI's motherboard can take three of them at the same time. The Samsung 950 Pro is an excellent choice for a boot drive, so is the 960 Pro. If you are on a budget, Intel's 600p offers a lot of storage for a small price. I highly recommend you get an SSD (SATA or PCI-E) for the general experience enhancements they provide.   Storage - Game and Movie Storage: Intel 750 400GB U.2 - I wanted to highlight the U.2 connector onboard, and I had an extra Intel 750 on-hand I had been itching to use in a multi-purpose build for local file storage (I use a NAS for local permanent storage). I realize that 400GB isn't enough for a large game collection (I mean, AoS is 86GB alone), so you might want to replace the 750/add a 2TB storage drive. I will warn you right now; some SATA ports will be disabled when some M.2 ports are used, that is not MSI's fault but rather a platform limitation to allow for M.2 RAID. I will cover how the ports are switched on the next page.   Case: Corsair Carbide 400C - The Carbide 400C is a compact, elegant, and well-built case. It has great cooling potential, easily fits a dual radiator AIO, and I like the tinted side panel. It doesn't have any front bays for optical drives or other devices, so if you need those or want a bigger case, you might want to choose something else.   Power Supply: Corsair RM1000x - The RM1000x offers fully modular cabling, 80+ Gold certification, a 10-year warranty, and a zero RPM fan mode. Power supplies are one of the first things to go on high-performance PSUs, so look for something with a decent warranty. The RM1000x is overkill for this build unless you plan on adding a second GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB in the future for SLI, which is why I chose it. If you are not planning to upgrade down the line, stick with a 600-800W PSU with a good name, solid efficiency, and a good warranty.   OS: Microsoft Windows 10 - Buy from Amazon - Do we really have an option these days? In my opinion it's a decent OS, and the learning curve is short if you have never used it.   Monitor: ASUS PA328 ProArt 32" 4K - Buy from Amazon - It's the monitor I use daily, and this build will replace my daily rig. The machine we are building will be able to play games at 4K (3840x2160), so a 4K monitor isn't a bad idea.   Keyboard: Corsair K70 LUX - Buy from Amazon - Also part of my daily machine. It has RGB LEDs too, and they are tastefully done.   Mouse: Corsair M65 PRO RGB - Buy from Amazon / Read our review - Also part of my daily machine.     Pricing   The cost of our configuration is roughly $2,200, but your number could differ greatly. Our configuration uses one of the most expensive AIO coolers, a very expensive PSU, and about $500 of storage. The motherboard costs roughly $239.99, while the GPU costs $629.99. You might also choose to go with cheaper memory if you want to save a few dollars.   I would estimate on the low-end you could build this system for close to $1500, and at the high-end, you could easily spend over $3000 by adding in another GPU in SLI, higher density memory, better cooling, more storage, and so on.

Photo: Steve Humphreys Model Sarah McGovern has been caught in the latest Revenue swoop. Ms McGovern has paid €37,355 to the taxman for the underdeclaration of income tax, including a €7,000 penalty. Others named as tax defaulters include disgraced former judge Heather Perrin. The solicitor from Malahide in Co Dublin was declared bankrupt last November, owing more than €500,000 to the Revenue Commissioners and €572,000 to Ulster Bank. The former district court judge was convicted in 2012 of deception and sentenced to two-and-a-half-years in prison. She had been found guilty of trying to deceive an elderly client out of half his €1m estate. The latest defaulter's list shows a €233,000 settlement made by Ms Perrin on foot of a court-determined penalty. Meanwhile, the company behind Dr Quirkey's Good Time Emporium - the Dublin slot machine business controlled by the parents-in-law of former Miss World Rosanna Davison - has been slapped with another penalty. Dublin Pool and Juke Box Limited was last caught by the taxman in 2013. That year, it made a €803,000 settlement for the underdeclaration of VAT. Former judge Heather Perrin (60) . Picture: Collins Courts It is just one of a number of firms and individuals hit in the Revenue Commissioners' latest haul from tax defaulters that has netted the Exchequer €11m. Also snared by the Revenue during the final three months of 2016 was restaurateur Barry Canny, who owns the well-known Peploe's bistro on Dublin's St Stephen's Green. He was ordered to pay a total of €38,904 on foot of a Revenue audit case, for the underdeclaration of income tax. The former boss of chip maker Intel, the legendary businessman Craig Barrett, complained in 2004 that he paid the equivalent of $200 for dinner at Peploe's for himself and his wife. Mr Canny hit out at Mr Barrett's criticism at the time, saying the tech boss "should think about the tax breaks he's getting" in Ireland for Intel. The largest settlement made with the Revenue Commissioners in the latest period was for €983,000. That was made by landlord David O'Connor of North Main Street, Cork. It was for the underdeclaration of income tax and VAT. He was also a director of Suits Distributors, a major supplier of suits and casual wear that went into liquidation in 2013. Farmers, publicans and hauliers were also among those who made recent settlements with the Revenue Commissioners.

Highlights from in and around the world of Texas politics Associated Press | AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Hundreds of transgender-rights supporters packed the Texas Capitol on Tuesday, seeking to speak out against a North Carolina-style "bathroom bill" that has drawn opposition from sports leagues and companies such as Facebook. The bill would require transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. But unlike in North Carolina, where the law known as HB2 passed a year ago with broad Republican support, the Texas bill has split conservatives and faces a tougher road. More than 400 people who jammed the Capitol to speak on the bill created a scene that rivaled the intensity and emotion to a vote last month over a ban on so-called "sanctuary cities" that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials. But whereas that divisive proposal passed over occasional protests in the Senate gallery, lawmakers this time gathered in a small committee room that made for easier crowd control. The sheer turnout threatened to stretch the meeting past midnight and could delay a vote until early Wednesday. But Republican House Speaker Joe Straus again made clear he has little appetite for the bill even if it does clear the Senate and, on top of that, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott hasn't given a public endorsement. "They have their agenda, we have ours," Straus said. Straus stopped short of declaring the bill dead on arrival with three months of lawmaking still remaining in Texas. But he has repeatedly denounced it as bad for the Texas economy while standing with corporate opponents that include Google, Amazon, American Airlines, Microsoft, Intel and Hilton. The National Football League and National Basketball Association have also said that passing the bill could give them second thoughts about bringing big events such as the Super Bowl and All-Star game back to Texas. ___ VOTER ID TRANSPARENCY A state lawmaker wants to shine a light on how Texas spends millions of taxpayer dollars to educate the public about its controversial voter ID law. Democratic Rep. Justin Rodriguez is proposing legislation that for the first time in Texas calls for transparency of spending for voter education campaigns by requiring the Texas Secretary of State's office to produce data showing results after each general election. The state's chief elections office has contracted with public relations giant Burson-Marsteller to produce voter ID publicity efforts, but has refused to disclose where it placed television and radio spots as part of a $2.5 million campaign, nor reveal the names of roughly 1,800 community groups that partnered with the state for the 2016 elections. Rodriguez, a Democrat from San Antonio and member of the House budget writing committee, says Texas officials shouldn't be allowed to hide information about an important public education campaign_especially given widespread confusion over changes to the Texas law leading up to November's election. "These are public dollars," said Rodriguez, who is planning to file his bill Wednesday. "I hate that this has kind of become an adversarial deal with the secretary of state's office, but we want to make sure that money is being spent correctly." A spokesman for Secretary of State Rolando Pablos, appointed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, did not return a request for comment but the office has previously said the materials were not released because of an ongoing voter ID lawsuit. Several top House Republicans authoring a proposal to revise to the current voter ID law also declined to comment, also citing the pending litigation. Rodriguez's proposal, according to a draft copy, would require Texas to produce detailed reports related to voter education programs. That includes disclosing markets and spending levels for advertising buys, the names of organizations promulgating state materials and the estimated number of voters reached, among other things. ___ SCHOOL FINANCE PROPOSAL HITS COMMITTEE Debate has begun on a bipartisan bill pumping $1.6 billion extra into classrooms as part of major changes to how Texas funds public education. Sponsored by Houston Republican Rep. Dan Huberty, the proposal increases per-student funding about $200 to $5,350, while adding money for transportation and educating dyslexic students. It also tweaks the current "Robin Hood" system to decrease funding that school districts in wealthy areas share with poorer districts. Huberty's Public Education Committee heard the bill Tuesday, calling it a "first step" toward fixing school finance. Lawmakers aren't required to overhaul the school finance system because Texas' Supreme Court declared it flawed but constitutional last summer. The proposal should pass the House but could stall in the Senate, which is focused on vouchers offering public funding for private schools. ___ LAWMAKERS SEEK FACILITIES FUNDING FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS Bills in the Texas House and Senate would authorize state facilities funding for charter schools. Charters are public schools whose students are subject to the same academic accountability standards as those in traditional public schools. But they don't get state funding to pay for buildings and facility maintenance. New Braunfels Republican Sen. Donna Campbell is proposing to shrink those funding gaps. She's also a leading proponent of "school choice" voucher plans seeking to offer public money for students attending private schools. Campbell said Tuesday that traditional public schools get an average of $1,400 per student annually for facilities, while charters get none. Democrat- and Republican-supported House bills also are seeking charter school facilities funding. Advocates say nearly 250,000 students attend Texas charter schools, and 140,000-plus are on waitlists for them. ___ ON DECK The House and Senate both have floor sessions scheduled for Wednesday morning but more attention will again be focused on committee work. The House State Affairs Committee is taking up a hot-button bill mandating that fetal remains from abortions and miscarriages be cremated or buried. That comes after a federal judge blocked a Texas health department rule seeking to mandate the same thing. ___ QUOTE OF THE DAY "I never give up on anyone," Texas House Speaker Joe Straus when asked Tuesday if he's lost hope Gov. Greg Abbott will heed Straus' previous calls and clarify if he fully supports the "bathroom bill" or not. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It is, after all, how the salaries get paid, and how funds are raised for re-election and looking after the country, often in that order. Consider the UK as an example. Starting in April, there will be a new set of tax regulations based on the IR35 guidelines. With the uncertainty surrounding this change there has been a rush of IT contractors leaving government positions, in many cases over half, halting a wide range of projects. This has been happening for over a year now with, as an example, the Ministry of Defence losing 30 out of 32 contractors last year. When the process of government is stopped because of taxes imposed, you're probably doing something wrong. The Galaxy S8 will be out by the end of April in two versions, a 5.8-inch screen full-rectangle and a 5.6-inch screen with rounded corners, along with 64GB of RAM with microSD support for up to 256GB extra. It will also come with 4GB of RAM, 12MP dual lens rear and 8MP front cameras, water- and dust-resistant IP68, iris and fingerprint scanner, wireless charging and a Quad HD+ Super AMOLED display. The latter is an 18:9-ratio screen probably something like 1440x2880 pixels -- so, a lot. As usual all of this may or may not be true when it comes to the real thing. You can expect, however, that the S8 will feature a number of improvements over the S7. Samsung has recently announced a new virtual-reality device, the Gear VR, a couple of new tablets and the Galaxy Book that runs Windows instead of Android. The Galaxy Book comes in 10.6-inch (1920x1280 pixels) and 12-inch (2160x1440) versions, including keyboard covers and the S-Pen. The 10.6-inch version comes with 4GB RAM and 64 or 128GB storage with the Intel's dual-core 2.6 GHz m3 processor. The 12-inch version has a dual-core 3.1 GHz i5 processor, 4 or 8GB RAM, and 128 or 256GB storage. Both versions support microSD cards. Today's hacking story comes to us from Apple and ESET. If you haven't yet upgraded to version 6.4.168.0 then you should. Also, who numbers their products with an IP address? If you don't, then you get root-level remote-code execution on a Mac by intercepting the ESET antivirus package's connection to its back-end servers, insert yourself as a man-in-the-middle, and exploit an XML library hole. Yes, Apple Macs can indeed be hacked. It's beginning. There is a "feature" in Windows Insider Preview Build 15042 that allows administrators to block the installation of any Win32 application not sourced from Microsoft's software marketplace. This feature potentially makes Microsoft like, well, Apple. An Insider Build is not necessarily the same as the one seen by the public, and this "feature" has not yet been confirmed as part of the April Creator's Update. It is also a feature that would be immediately disabled by a large number of non-company users such as game players. A conspiracy theorist may conclude that it will start as optional, and then become mandatory, then permanent, and finally the option will be removed. According to Huawei's European president, Samsung and Apple phones are overpriced. I would note that the latest Huawei offerings have skyrocketed in price, to where they're not all that far behind the one's so named. Huawei does spend less on marketing, however. Huawei has been gradually improving its products to the point where they now compete in the upper end of the market. Huawei has two top-end streams, the Mate for the business user and the P series for the artier person who wants to take photos. Huawei does have a great fast-charge system that after half-an-hour will give an average day's use, whatever the definition of that is. It is amazing what you can find while surfing the net. Before the Samsung Note and its issues, Boeing had patented a battery-powered personal-device case with a built-in fire-suppression system. With the move from flight manuals to tablets, the aim of the patent was for devices in plane cockpits, where it would take steps if the unit started to heat up or burst into flames. But the device is clearly useful for airlines, because we know many have moved their flight manuals from paper to tablet computers. Giving those devices a place to rest that also prevents them from bursting into flames seems a worthwhile innovation. I wonder if we will see similar devices for our smartphones? In this week's "irony much?" segment, a group from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) in Darmstadt, Germany, called TeamSIK looked into the safety of Android-based password managers. These are applications you use to safely store and track all your passwords. Looking at nine of them, the verdict was: not all that safe. If you happen to be using My Passwords, Informaticore Password Manager, LastPass, Keeper, F-Secure KEY, Dashlane, Hide Pictures Keep Safe Vault, Avast Passwords or 1Password, they were all found to have vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to get all your passwords.

House homeless vets now. By John O. King, opinion contributor - 03/07/17 07:00 PM EST 53   © Getty Mr. President, you like to make deals. Well, now that you’re president, make this deal. Fix our nation’s problem with homeless veterans, tonight.  Here’s how. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates there are almost 50,000 homeless veterans. The number of homeless vets has been declining, but it’s still too high. Your predecessors — George W. Bush and Barack ObamaBarack ObamaDem senator: Trump at zero credibility after wiretap claims Obama reportedly spending a month in French Polynesia Overnight Cybersecurity: Trump standing by wiretapping claim | Cyber gets boost in Trump budget | Bad bots on the rise | McDonald's Twitter hack MORE — didn’t remedy this problem in their 16 years of combined time in the White House.  They could have. But they didn’t. Why? They lacked leadership . ADVERTISEMENT The VA currently budgets about $500 million a year to assist both homeless and at-risk vets and their families. That amount competes within the VA budget and the VA’s budget competes with other programs across the $4 trillion a year Federal budget. That competition is part of the typical way the Federal budget is put together each year. That’s part of the problem. You need to break this cycle of incompetence.   Homeless Vets is an easy problem to fix. How? Treat the problem like the national emergency it is. Just like a hurricane or earthquake, attack the problem—immediately . You’re a businessman. Use your skills and business acumen. Call in all those major hotel chain CEO buddies of yours and, using a joint public-private partnership, secure an agreement from them to commit their low-cost hotel brand subsidiaries to make available up to 50,000 rooms nationwide on a nightly basis to identified homeless vets and their families in exchange for a guaranteed occupancy rate at about 30 percent discount to their commercial prices. The hotel industry is averaging about 64 percent occupancy, so rooms are available nightly, and any imbalance across the various brands can be managed by them. Almost pure profit, why wouldn’t they participate? And we fix it, tonight. Keep the feds out of the bureaucracy business by using existing local social welfare agencies to coordinate the effort, and have them provide other supporting social services, such as medical assistance and job training. Keep the Vets themselves involved and monitoring the process by having local Vets organizations rate the local social services agencies and hotels. How to pay? As National Emergency, latch onto the pending FY 2017 supplemental budget request. Have Congress immediately add $274 million to the currently pending supplemental appropriation request. This amount represents a $30/day, discounted low-cost hotel for 50,000 Vets for half a year (starting 1 April 2017). That’s about the same amount as the cost overrun on ONE of the Navy’s new Littoral Combat Ships (that can’t actually combat anything, and is costing twice its advertised price). Have your Office of Management and Budget (OMB) add twice that amount for inclusion in the VA’s FY 2018 budget for a full-year program while a more definitive plan is worked out to fix this problem permanently. That could mean training homeless Vets for some of those jobs you’re bringing back to America. With a 2017 projected trade deficit of $443 million and an average U.S. wage of about $45,000, that’s about 9.8 million jobs you need to bring back. Start with the auto industry, which accounts for half this deficit and 4.4 million of those jobs to be brought home. After housing homeless Vets tonight, we can retrain them for good paying jobs with built-in health care, so we permanently fix this problem. Plus, there’s a lot of waste in the Federal budget. I know. As a Pentagon budgeteer, weeding out the excess and reapplying it to other DoD priorities was my job for 30 years. And while the last president said he’d review the entire Federal budget one line item at a time, it doesn’t appear that he did.  If he did, he’d have found lots of that waste that could be used to fix homeless Vets (or cut taxes) while we fix this problem working with industry and government. So, it’s up to you to fix this easily solvable problem. Time for some leadership, Mr. President. Time to make this deal. John O. King is a retired Pentagon senior budget analyst.

TANG The Philadelphia Inquirer As the son of immigrant scientists – and as a scientist myself – I am deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s immigration policy. As the leader of a tech-based, economic development organization, I’m even more apprehensive about the policy’s impact on innovation, entrepreneurship and America’s ability to compete on a global scale. I’m saddened to see this blunt-force policy affect the fate of the immigrants who have been stopped at our borders and turned away, as well as the impact on hopeful new visa applicants. Regardless of rumored changes, the policy has already sent a troubling signal to the rest of the world. We cannot forget that America was built on the twin bedrocks of immigration and entrepreneurship. Imagine starting over in a new country and using your wits and grit to launch a company, provide for family, and succeed. That was the experience of many of our grandparents and parents. Today’s immigrant entrepreneurs (often fleeing persecution in their native countries) continue that tradition of bootstrapping as they create new technologies and products. They embody the American Dream. Yet in the clamor of today’s 24/7 cycle of cable and internet news, their contributions are often overlooked and their voices are frequently missing from our nation’s rancorous debate over immigration. Imagine what life would be like without immigrant entrepreneurs such as Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone and founded what is now known as AT&T; or French-born E.I. DuPont, who founded the chemical giant in my home state of Delaware; or Intel founder Andy Grove, who was born in Hungary and revolutionized the semiconductor industry. Google Today’s immigrant entrepreneurs include Sergey Brin of Google, Elon Musk of Tesla, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani. Together, their companies employ more than 70,000 people. At my organization, the University City Science Center, nearly one-third of the 58 companies in our business incubator were founded by someone born outside of the United States. Entrepreneurs such as Yasmine Mustafa, a Palestinian immigrant, whose startup ROAR for Good is developing wearable technology to prevent attacks on women. And Indian immigrant Mihir Shah, whose company, UE LifeSciences, is disrupting breast-cancer diagnostics around the globe. Yasmine, Mihir, and their fellow immigrant entrepreneurs are creating technologies and products that are transforming the world – and our economy. And they are a force that is moving America – their adopted homeland – forward. Here are some amazing statistics: Immigrants account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population. Yet, they represent more than a quarter of America’s entrepreneurs. Nearly one-third of venture-backed founders are immigrant entrepreneurs. More than half of America’s startups valued at $1 billion or more were started by immigrants. We need these brilliant people with their bright ideas, the companies they form, and the jobs they create. When immigration and entrepreneurship intersect, magic can – and often does – happen. We cannot afford to see that magic disappear. Stephen S. Tang is the president and CEO of the University City Science Center in Philadelphia and co-chairman of the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. He wrote this for the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd., which runs Snapdeal, is looking to raise approximately $300 million, of which $100-150 million could be from SoftBank, a report by The Economic Times stated, citing four unnamed sources. In January, Snapdeal and SoftBank were in discussions to raise fresh funds but at a lower valuation ranging between $3 billion and $4 billion. SoftBank had pared down its investment value in Snapdeal in November last year. “We are well capitalised and not engaged in any active financing discussions,” a Snapdeal spokesperson had said at that time. The e-commerce firm had last raised funds in February 2016, securing $200 million (Rs 1,362 crore) at a valuation of $6.5 billion from Canada-based Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and Singapore-headquartered investment firm Brother Fortune Apparel. In total, Snapdeal raised around $1.65 billion from about two dozen investors. These include SoftBank and SoftBank-backed Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, global online marketplace eBay Inc., the Indian ad-for-equity investment arm of media firm Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd, and venture capital investors such as Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital and Kalaari Capital, among others. VCCircle had last week reported that Snapdeal is in talks to sell FreeCharge with several strategic companies, including fintech firms Paytm, PayPal and PayU, after talks with private equity investors fell through. The company is seeking a valuation of $400-$500 million for the same. Snapdeal has been working towards reducing ballooning operational costs to check widening losses. The e-tailer had more than doubled its losses to Rs 2,960 crore (around $436 million) for the financial year ended 31 March 2016. The firm’s consolidated loss widened to Rs 3,315 crore from Rs 1,328 crore in 2014-15. Last month, Snapdeal founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal said they will not take salaries for an undisclosed period, after laying off over 600 people from the company. Rival Flipkart is also suffering from valuation woes. Just last week, Macquarie Group-owned Optimum Fund’s decided to lower the value of its holdings in the company by 3.26%, which sees Flipkart’s valuation at just $10 billion. Like this report?

Film News Ghost In The Shell hits Paris Fashion Week with special Viktoria Modesta performance By Paul Heath - Mar 8, 2017 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Viktoria Modesta Paris Fashion Week performance for Ghost In The Shell. Last night, The Hollywood News was invited to a special event in Paris, France to celebrate the upcoming release of Ghost In The Shell, the new adaptation of the classic Manga starring Scarlett Johansson. The event was held on the last night of Paris Fashion Week 2017 and featured a very special performance from bionic artist Viktoria Modesta. You can see that Viktoria Modesta Paris Fashion Week performance in our exclusive video below. The event was coordinated by the folks at Tumblr and featured creations from designers using technological advances to innovate the world of fashion and technology. The exhibition featured garments that react to adrenaline, display video content, adjust the temperature of the wearer or change shape when they sense different sounds. There was also a headline performance from Viktoria Modesta, the ‘Bionic Pop Star’ who’s single Prototype inspired elements of this event through its exploration of fashion, art and technology. Modesta, who is also the face of Channel 4’s Born Risky disability initiative, performed her track Prototype at the event, which you can see in the video below. The Latvian born singer and model wears an extensive range of alternative prosthetic legs, regarding them as fashion items. Her approach to her disability makes her perfectly placed to explore the intersection of wearable technology and humanity – prevalent themes of Ghost in the Shell. Hollywood costume designers, Chromat were also on hand to exhibit their Adrenaline Dress. Powered by Intel, the piece is composed of printed panels interlinked into an expandable carbon fibre framework which mimics the body’s ‘fight or flight’ reaction and changes shape to empower the wearer. There were also pieces from the likes of Wisewear, Cute Circuit, EMEL+ARIS, Silvia Fado and Ying Gao. Take a look at them via our image gallery below. Check out that full gallery of images from the evening below, and the Viktoria Modesta Paris Fashion Week performance of Prototype above. Ghost In The Shell opens in cinemas on March 30, 2017.

It is sitting right between the T470 and the flagship model ThinkPad X1 Carbon in Lenovo’s 14-inch lineup. The construction is a bit more compact compared to the regular ThinkPad T470, but the biggest difference is the weight. Our test model is significantly lighter thanks to more expensive materials, which improves the mobility. However, the ThinkPad T470s is one of the systems that Lenovo hardly updated this year, and the basic construction is identical to the previous ThinkPad T460s. The differences are limited to the implementation of a USB-C port and Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors. Our test sample is also equipped with a different WQHD panel. Our sample carries the designation 20HGS00V00 and represents the high-end campus model for 2,099 Euros. It is equipped with the fastest ULV Core i7 processor Intel currently offers, a WQHD panel, 16 GB RAM and a generous 1 TB NVMe-SSD from Samsung. There is no corresponding Topseller version for regular customers so far, but it should be a couple of hundred Euros more expensive. A corresponding model in Lenovo’s online shop currently retails for almost 2,850 Euros.

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 HYDERABAD: Homegrown smartphone maker Smartron has secured undisclosed financing from Sanjay Jha, the chief executive of GlobalFoundries, one of the world's largest contract manufacturers of semiconductors. Including Jha's investment, Smartron has raised about Rs 100 crore since its inception in 2014. The company is in advanced talks with investors for another Rs 200 crore that it plans to use primarily for research and development. "(Jha) has a lot of experience and expertise in the semiconductor and mobile space. He also ran Motorola Mobility (before joining GlobalFoundries),“ said Smartron chairman Mahesh Lingareddy. "His governance would help the company go in the right direction." Jha, who joins former India cricket captain Sachin Tendulkar as an investor in Smartron, was earlier an investor in and chairman of Soft Machines, a chip-design company cofounded by Lingareddy and sold to Intel last year for nearly $300 million. Jha will join Smarton's board of directors. Hyderabad-based Smartron, founded by Lingareddy, Narsi Reddy and Rohit Rathi, has so far launched a smartphone and a convertible laptop. It plans to launch several other products in the coming months, including a smartphone targetted at Tendulkar's fans. Smartron, which expects to earn revenue of Rs 50 crore for the 2016-17 financial year, recently invested in a Chennai-based automotive startup, Volta Motors, and has about five more deals in the pipeline. The investments are to encourage startups to build products on the Smartron platform. "It could be an investment or a complete acquisition, keeping (the target company) as independent entity with a minority or majority stake or a commercial relationship," said Reddy, managing director of Smartron. "We are talking to a few of them right now from the verticals of health, energy, agriculture, etc." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 8 March 2017 | MYT 10:58 AM China's ZTE pleads guilty, settles with US over Iran, North Korea sales International incident: ZTE acted contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests, the Commerce Department said. — Reuters NEW YORK: Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp has agreed to pay US$892mil (RM3.9bil) and plead guilty to criminal charges for violating US laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran and North Korea. While a guilty plea deals a blow to ZTE's reputation, the resolution could lift some uncertainty for a company that relies on US suppliers for 25% to 30% of its components. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade US embargoes by buying US components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. In addition, it was charged in connection with 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea. "ZTE Corporation not only violated export controls that keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran's, they lied ... about their illegal acts," US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. ZTE agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, obstruction of justice for an elaborate cover-up, and making a material false statement for claims it was complying with regulations The investigation, spearheaded by the US Department of Commerce, followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known US technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier. The Justice Department noted one Reuters article in its statement announcing the plea deal on Tuesday.  "ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company," ZTE chief executive Zhao Xianming said in a statement. The company's guilty pleas, which must be approved by a judge, will take place in US District Court in Texas. The Shenzhen-based company has a US subsidiary in Richardson, Texas. In March 2016, ZTE was placed on a list of entities that US firm could not supply without a license. ZTE acted contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests, the Commerce Department said at the time. Commerce will recommend that ZTE be removed from that list if the company lives up to its deal and a court approves its agreement with the Justice Department. ZTE warned last month the penalties could impact its results. The company has a market capitalisation of about 60bil yuan (RM38.7bil), according to Thomson Reuters data. It has continued to do business with US suppliers under a temporary general license that was extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring March 29. ZTE purchases about US$2.6bil (RM11.57bil) worth of components a year from US technology companies, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm , Microsoft and Intel are among its suppliers. Items shipped in violation of US export laws included routers, microprocessors and servers controlled under export regulations. Authorities said executives at ZTE approved the scheme to prevent disclosure of the sales. The scheme included a data team that destroyed or sanitised materials involving ZTE's Iran business after March 2012. "Despite ZTE's repeated attempts to thwart the investigation, the dogged determination of investigators uncovered damning evidence," said Douglas Hassebrock, director of the Commerce Department office that led the investigation. Last year, Commerce released internal documents showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE replaced executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president. Last month, it announced that Shi Lirong, who stepped down as president in April, resigned as a non-executive director. The company on Tuesday agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which could be activated if there are further violations. A denial order would bar the receipt of US origin goods and technology. The denial order is key to keeping ZTE in line, said Eric Hirschhorn, former Under Secretary at the Commerce Department, who was involved in the investigation. “If the suspension is removed, they’ll probably be put out of business,” he said.  ZTE also agreed to three years of probation, a compliance and ethics program, and a corporate monitor. The settlement includes a US$661mil (RM2.9bil) penalty to Commerce; US$430mil (RM1.9bil) in combined criminal fines and forfeiture; and US$101mil (RM449mil) paid to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The action marks OFAC's largest-ever settlement with a non-financial entity. ZTE also agreed to an additional penalty of US$300mil (RM1.3bil) to the US Commerce Department that will be suspended during a seven-year term on the condition the company complies with requirements in the agreement. In addition to being one of the world’s biggest telecommunications gear makers, ZTE is the number four smartphone vendor in the United States, selling handset devices to US mobile carriers AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp. —  Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Google ramps up investment in fibre cable, training Africans Twitter swastika hack comes at fragile time for company Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

The group is opposing a "bathroom bill" that would require people to use public bathrooms and res... By PAUL J. WEBER Associated Press AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Hundreds of transgender-rights supporters packed the Texas Capitol on Tuesday, seeking to speak out against a North Carolina-style "bathroom bill" that has drawn opposition from sports leagues and companies such as Facebook. The bill would require transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. But unlike in North Carolina, where the law known as HB2 passed a year ago with broad Republican support, the Texas bill has split conservatives and faces a tougher road. More than 400 people who jammed the Capitol to speak on the bill created a scene that rivaled the intensity and emotion of a vote last month over a ban on so-called "sanctuary cities" that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials. But whereas that divisive proposal passed over occasional protests in the Senate gallery, lawmakers discussing the bill in committee this time gathered in a smaller room that made for easier crowd control. Large numbers of bill supporters also turned out in droves and waited throughout the day and evening to tell lawmakers why they support it. Among them was the superintendent of a tiny Texas school district that sued last year over former President Barack Obama's attempts to strengthen transgender rights in public schools nationwide. President Donald Trump has since rescinded those school orders. The sheer turnout stretched the meeting for hours but the bill's clearing the committee was a near certainty. Still, Republican House Speaker Joe Straus again made clear he has little appetite for the bill even if it does clear the Senate and, on top of that, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott hasn't given a public endorsement. "They have their agenda, we have ours," Straus said Tuesday. Straus stopped short of declaring the bill dead on arrival with three months of lawmaking still remaining in Texas. But he has repeatedly denounced it as bad for the Texas economy while standing with corporate opponents that include Google, Amazon, American Airlines, Microsoft, Intel and Hilton. The National Football League and National Basketball Association have also said that passing the bill could give them second thoughts about bringing big events such as the Super Bowl and All-Star game back to Texas. The hazy future of the bill prompted Senate Republicans to launch a new campaign this week with religious leaders to drum up more conservative support. They also flew in North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who championed his state's bathroom bill and accused the media of creating a false picture of economic upheaval. The NCAA canceled seven championship events in North Carolina after HB2 passed, PayPal canceled expansion plans and then-Gov. Pat McCrory lost his re-election race to a Democrat in a state otherwise controlled by Republicans. Forest told Texas lawmakers his state was on an economic rebound and claimed that North Carolina landing the 2018 World Equestrian Games will offset the NBA and NCAA pulling out. "They don't want to tell our narrative. They want to tell the narrative of our opposition," Forest said. ___ Associated Press Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Paul J.

Barry Huang, Reuters NEW YORK - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp has agreed to pay $892 million and plead guilty to criminal charges for violating US laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran and North Korea. While a guilty plea deals a blow to ZTE's reputation, the resolution could lift some uncertainty for a company that relies on US suppliers for 25 percent to 30 percent of its components. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade US embargoes by buying US components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. In addition, it was charged in connection with 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea. "ZTE Corporation not only violated export controls that keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran's, they lied ... about their illegal acts," US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. ZTE agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, obstruction of justice for an elaborate cover-up, and making a material false statement for claims it was complying with regulations The investigation, spearheaded by the US Department of Commerce, followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known US technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier. The Justice Department noted one Reuters article in its statement announcing the plea deal on Tuesday. The original report can be read here: here. "ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company," ZTE Chief Executive Zhao Xianming said in a statement. The company's guilty pleas, which must be approved by a judge, will take place in US District Court in Texas. The Shenzhen-based company has a US subsidiary in Richardson, Texas. In March 2016, ZTE was placed on a list of entities that US. firm could not supply without a license. ZTE acted contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests, the Commerce Department said at the time. Commerce will recommend that ZTE be removed from that list if the company lives up to its deal and a court approves its agreement with the Justice Department. ZTE warned last month the penalties could impact its results. The company has a market capitalization of about 60 billion yuan ($8.7 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data. It has continued to do business with US suppliers under a temporary general license that was extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring March 29. ZTE purchases about $2.6 billion worth of components a year from US technology companies, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel are among its suppliers. Items shipped in violation of US export laws included routers, microprocessors and servers controlled under export regulations. Authorities said executives at ZTE approved the scheme to prevent disclosure of the sales. The scheme included a data team that destroyed or sanitized materials involving ZTE's Iran business after March 2012. "Despite ZTE's repeated attempts to thwart the investigation, the dogged determination of investigators uncovered damning evidence," said Douglas Hassebrock, director of the Commerce Department office that led the investigation. Last year, Commerce released internal documents showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE replaced executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president. Last month, it announced that Shi Lirong, who stepped down as president in April, resigned as a non-executive director. The company on Tuesday agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which could be activated if there are further violations. A denial order would bar the receipt of US origin goods and technology. The denial order is key to keeping ZTE in line, said Eric Hirschhorn, former Under Secretary at the Commerce Department, who was involved in the investigation. “If the suspension is removed, they’ll probably be put out of business,” he said. ZTE also agreed to three years of probation, a compliance and ethics program, and a corporate monitor. The settlement includes a $661 million penalty to Commerce; $430 million in combined criminal fines and forfeiture; and $101 million paid to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The action marks OFAC's largest-ever settlement with a non-financial entity. ZTE also agreed to an additional penalty of $300 million to the US Commerce Department that will be suspended during a seven-year term on the condition the company complies with requirements in the agreement. In addition to being one of the world’s biggest telecommunications gear makers, ZTE is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, selling handset devices to US mobile carriers AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) InsideGov | Graphiq Posted: Tuesday, March 7, 2017 5:51 pm | Updated: 6:07 pm, Tue Mar 7, 2017. Hundreds pack Texas Capitol for transgender bathroom debate Associated Press | AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Hundreds of transgender-rights supporters packed the Texas Capitol on Tuesday, seeking to speak out against a North Carolina-style "bathroom bill" that has drawn opposition from sports leagues and companies such as Facebook. The bill would require transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. But unlike in North Carolina, where the law known as HB2 passed a year ago with broad Republican support, the Texas bill has split conservatives and faces a tougher road. More than 400 people who jammed the Capitol to speak on the bill created a scene that rivaled the intensity and emotion of a vote last month over a ban on so-called "sanctuary cities" that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials. But whereas that divisive proposal passed over occasional protests in the Senate gallery, lawmakers discussing the bill in committee this time gathered in a smaller room that made for easier crowd control. Large numbers of bill supporters also turned out in droves and waited throughout the day and evening to tell lawmakers why they support it. Among them was the superintendent of a tiny Texas school district that sued last year over former President Barack Obama's attempts to strengthen transgender rights in public schools nationwide. President Donald Trump has since rescinded those school orders. The sheer turnout stretched the meeting for hours but the bill's clearing the committee was a near certainty. Still, Republican House Speaker Joe Straus again made clear he has little appetite for the bill even if it does clear the Senate and, on top of that, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott hasn't given a public endorsement. "They have their agenda, we have ours," Straus said Tuesday. Straus stopped short of declaring the bill dead on arrival with three months of lawmaking still remaining in Texas. But he has repeatedly denounced it as bad for the Texas economy while standing with corporate opponents that include Google, Amazon, American Airlines, Microsoft, Intel and Hilton. The National Football League and National Basketball Association have also said that passing the bill could give them second thoughts about bringing big events such as the Super Bowl and All-Star game back to Texas. The hazy future of the bill prompted Senate Republicans to launch a new campaign this week with religious leaders to drum up more conservative support. They also flew in North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who championed his state's bathroom bill and accused the media of creating a false picture of economic upheaval. The NCAA canceled seven championship events in North Carolina after HB2 passed, PayPal canceled expansion plans and then-Gov. Pat McCrory lost his re-election race to a Democrat in a state otherwise controlled by Republicans. Forest told Texas lawmakers his state was on an economic rebound and claimed that North Carolina landing the 2018 World Equestrian Games will offset the NBA and NCAA pulling out. "They don't want to tell our narrative. They want to tell the narrative of our opposition," Forest said. ___ Associated Press Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Paul J.

Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, speaks as the Senate State Affairs Committee begins to debate Senate Bill 6 at the Texas Capitol, Tuesday, March 7, 2017, in Austin, Texas. The the transgender "bathroom bill" would require people to use public bathrooms and restrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) AUSTIN, Texas – Hundreds of transgender-rights supporters packed the Texas Capitol on Tuesday, seeking to speak out against a North Carolina-style “bathroom bill” that has drawn opposition from sports leagues and companies such as Facebook. The bill would require transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. But unlike in North Carolina, where the law known as HB2 passed a year ago with broad Republican support, the Texas bill has split conservatives and faces a tougher road. More than 400 people who jammed the Capitol to speak on the bill created a scene that rivaled the intensity and emotion of a vote last month over a ban on so-called “sanctuary cities” that don’t co-operate with federal immigration officials. But whereas that divisive proposal passed over occasional protests in the Senate gallery, lawmakers discussing the bill in committee this time gathered in a smaller room that made for easier crowd control. Large numbers of bill supporters also turned out in droves and waited throughout the day and evening to tell lawmakers why they support it. Among them was the superintendent of a tiny Texas school district that sued last year over former President Barack Obama’s attempts to strengthen transgender rights in public schools nationwide. President Donald Trump has since rescinded those school orders. The sheer turnout stretched the meeting for hours but the bill’s clearing the committee was a near certainty. Still, Republican House Speaker Joe Straus again made clear he has little appetite for the bill even if it does clear the Senate and, on top of that, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott hasn’t given a public endorsement. “They have their agenda, we have ours,” Straus said Tuesday. Straus stopped short of declaring the bill dead on arrival with three months of lawmaking still remaining in Texas. But he has repeatedly denounced it as bad for the Texas economy while standing with corporate opponents that include Google, Amazon, American Airlines, Microsoft, Intel and Hilton. The National Football League and National Basketball Association have also said that passing the bill could give them second thoughts about bringing big events such as the Super Bowl and All-Star game back to Texas. The hazy future of the bill prompted Senate Republicans to launch a new campaign this week with religious leaders to drum up more conservative support. They also flew in North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, who championed his state’s bathroom bill and accused the media of creating a false picture of economic upheaval. The NCAA cancelled seven championship events in North Carolina after HB2 passed, PayPal cancelled expansion plans and then-Gov. Pat McCrory lost his re-election race to a Democrat in a state otherwise controlled by Republicans. Forest told Texas lawmakers his state was on an economic rebound and claimed that North Carolina landing the 2018 World Equestrian Games will offset the NBA and NCAA pulling out. “They don’t want to tell our narrative. They want to tell the narrative of our opposition,” Forest said. ___ Associated Press Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report. ___ Follow Paul J.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 8 March 2017 US investment level in Malaysia may grow further by david tan Kamala: ‘US companies here produced for the global market and therefore make decisions according to the commercial environment.’ Ambassador says the companies make independent decisions GEORGE TOWN: The level of US investments in Malaysia will be maintained or grow further, says US ambassador Kamala Shirin Lakhdhir. In an exclusive interview with StarBiz, Lakhdhir said that US companies in Malaysia made independent decisions based on the business environment and needs of the supply chain. “US companies here produced for the global market and therefore make decisions according to the commercial environment. “They have been here for decades and are still around because the Malaysian government has been very supportive in facilitating their investments. “This why companies such as First Solar is committed to expanding in Malaysia,” she said. She said the feedback received from the US companies so far had been positive. “The US investments here will either be maintained or grow further,” she added. Lakhdhir was responding to a question on whether the US, under the presidency of Donald Trump, would prompt US investments to flow back home. On whether the US is moving towards a protectionist economy, Lakhdir said the US has a global economy. “The US economy is not just based on oil and gas. A huge amount of the US economy is driven by trade in Asia-Pacific. Let’s not change that. The new administration affirms and understands that,” she added. Lakhdhir said many of the US companies had large markets with customers worldwide. “First Solar, Intel and the medical device companies over here are some examples. They have a global perspective and are fundamental to the US economy,” she said. On the future of bilateral trade with Malaysia, Lakhdhir said there was focus to deepen and expand the bilateral relationship to the benefit of both parties. On Malaysia’s investments in the US, she said Top Glove and Sime Darby were among the big investors in the US.

In keeping with SanDisk's recent trends for mainstream consumer SSDs, the WD Black uses a Marvell controller (the 88SS1093, also seen in the Plextor M8Pe) and uses SanDisk's 15nm TLC NAND flash. And yes, the blue PCB is another SanDisk hallmark, even though it clashes with Western Digital's branding for the drive. Western Digital and SanDisk are relatively late in bringing a consumer NVMe SSD to market. They're clearly intending for the WD Black SSD to be a fairly mainstream product by using TLC NAND and pricing it below high-end SATA SSDs. In the SATA space SanDisk has made very effective use of their planar TLC and the SanDisk X400 and WD Blue are the best in their class. Having taken their time developing the WD Black, we expect another solid performer. However, time is running out for planar TLC the WD Black may turn out to be a short-lived product before being replaced by a successor with 3D NAND. All four major NAND manufacturers plan to ship 64+ layer 3D NAND this year with TLC parts up to 512Gb, and if things go according to plan for at least two or three of them we should see the NAND shortage start to fade and prices and capacities improve. WD Black PCIe SSD Series Specifications Capacity 256GB 512GB Form Factor M.2 2280 Interface PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe Controller Marvell 88SS1093 NAND SanDisk 15nm TLC Sequential Read 2050 MB/s Sequential Write 700 MB/s 800 MB/s Random Read (4 KB) IOPS 170k 170k Random Write (4 KB) IOPS 130k 134k Power Peak 8.25 W Idle 5.5 mW Endurance 80 TBW 160 TBW Encryption none Warranty 5 years MSRP $109 $199.99 Buy Western Digital WD Black 512GB on Amazon.com The WD Black comes in only the two capacities that should be most popular: 256GB and 512GB. A 128GB PCIe SSD risks squandering much of the advantage of the faster interface due to the low number of NAND dies being a bottleneck, and 1TB PCIe SSDs are still expensive enough to be substantially less popular. A 1TB version would also need to be a double-sided M.2 module, which would limit compatibility with some laptops. As expected for a TLC SSD, the rated read performance is much higher than the write performance, though Western Digital does still give the WD Black a very nice looking random write rating. The endurance ratings for the WD Black are a little lower than I'd like to see given that even a TLC-based PCIe SSD is something of a premium product, but the five year warranty is quite reasonable. Western Digital is currently taking pre-orders for the WD Black at MSRP and projecting a ship date of March 14, while there are already some third-party Amazon sellers offering it above MSRP. The MSRPs are about 10% higher than the current prices for the Intel SSD 600p, the current cheapest and slowest PCIe SSD. For this review we will be comparing the 512GB WD Black primarily against other PCIe SSDs of similar capacity, and against a handful of the better SATA SSDs currently on the market. Some specific competitors to keep an eye on: The Plextor M8Pe uses the same Marvell controller and Toshiba's 15nm MLC counterpart to the 15nm TLC used by the WD Black. The WD Blue uses the same NAND as the WD Black, but a Marvell SATA SSD controller instead of the PCIe NVMe controller. The Intel SSD 600p based on Intel 3D TLC NAND and Silicon Motion's SM2260 controller is currently the cheapest and slowest NVMe SSD. The Samsung 960 EVO is the TLC PCIe SSD that's positioned above the WD Black in the market, and is the more mainstream of Samsung's current NVMe offerings.

POST A COMMENT 35 Comments View All Comments jjj - Wednesday, March 08, 2017 - link At least it beats the Intel lol Such a pity that SSD makers are messing around with slow options. As NAND prices rise, the controller becomes a smaller % of the costs so offering great perf per $ is easy, as long as you have the perf and they don't. I do have a bit of an objection to the way you talk about the 960 EVO in your conclusions. You haven't tested the 500GB version or at least it's not in the graphs or bench and it's hard to be accurate in estimating its perf due to the SLC cache. A review for it would be nice and maybe the very popular MyDigitalSSD. Reply Gothmoth - Wednesday, March 08, 2017 - link slow options are not bad if they would give me 2 TB for 200$... :) but this is just crappy stuff. Reply jjj - Wednesday, March 08, 2017 - link Slow options with PCIe x4 drives so these things that offer too little over SATA. They make sense for OEMs in laptop and SFF, lower mechanical volume but the opportunity to make a buck is bigger with faster drives right now. Reply ImSpartacus - Thursday, March 09, 2017 - link Yeah, pcie drives busy doubt make sense for the budget market at the moment. It's just an unnecessary cost for a use case that doesn't need the extra benefit. 2.5" sata drives can get too cheap and are too versatile. Reply theuglyman0war - Sunday, March 12, 2017 - link Whats everyone complaining about? It's a.... OOPs! Read the that 800MB/s as if that was 800GB size for $199.. LOL! nevermind... Reply Samus - Thursday, March 09, 2017 - link I'd as clueless as everyone else as to why non-3D TLC is even a thing, especially in a product not limited by SATA. Reply Bruce427 - Monday, March 13, 2017 - link ** A review for it would be nice [on] the very popular MyDigitalSSD. ** I agree. I have one of their 480GB BPX models ($187.32) in one of my PCs and I cannot tell much difference between it and the Samsung 512GB 950 Pro. The MyDigitals are probably the best performing lower priced NVMe drives. They also have a 5 year warranty and huge endurance (TBW) ratings. Reply Mathieu Bourgie - Wednesday, March 08, 2017 - link Reading the introduction: 'In the SATA space SanDisk has made very effective use of their planar TLC and the SanDisk X400 and WD Blue are the best in their class. ' Sure, the Sandisk X400 is a leading TLC drive, but how is the WD Blue the best in its class (and what class is that?). From your own review of the WD Blue SSD: 'Unfortunately, the WD Blue is slower than the X400 on most other tests' and it has a 3 years warranty instead of 5 years for the Sandisk X400. Reply highlnder69 - Wednesday, March 08, 2017 - link Not sure who would want to Pre-Order such a horrible performing SSD. Reply dgingeri - Wednesday, March 08, 2017 - link At least they priced it about right. It's more expensive than the Intel 600p, but far less expensive than the 960 EVO and slightly less expensive than the M8Pe. This part of the market is odd. Usually, the fastest performing parts are FAR more expensive for just a small return on performance. In SSDs right now, the differences in price are fairly small, but the differences in performance are huge. I think the 960 EVO is about the best deal for a SSD, and this thing is just a shame to the "Black" label.

In Korea, self-driving technology has also been at the forefront of the country’s leading automaker and advanced technology firms. SK Telecom has been working with Germany’s BMW to implement faster data transmission in connected cars, while LG Electronics joined hands with Volkswagen last year to develop the company’s next generation of smart vehicles. Hyundai’s Ioniq autonomous concept car (Yonhap) Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is also developing the country’s first autonomous test driving ground, K-City, which is expected to open in October. Some luxury automakers including Mercedes-Benz and BMW are striving to take their autonomous technology one step further. Not only do the two German auto powerhouses seem to be striving to make manual driving a thing of the past, but they are looking to drastically alter how the public views the concept of a car. On the other hand, major Asian automakers Hyundai Motor Group and Nissan have adopted more simplistic and practical approaches. Both companies are working toward equipping standard vehicles with self-driving options, as opposed to a complete vehicle overhaul -- a move attributed to making autonomous cars more affordable to the general public. Late last year, the country’s largest automaker unveiled the prototype for its flagship self-driving car, the autonomous Ioniq. While its outward appearance is indistinguishable from an ordinary car, one of Hyundai’s biggest concepts for the future Ioniq is to develop a model that is affordable to the average consumer. The vehicle is equipped with the necessities of autonomy, including forward-facing radars and lane keep assist cameras, using a lower-cost platform with integrated LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology. Last month, Hyundai Motor Group tapped former GM researcher Lee Jin-woo to head the company’s research and development for autonomous technology. It is expected to introduce self-driving vehicles into the market by 2020. Nissan took its autonomous driving technology to the streets of Europe for the first time last week, testing out its latest ProPilot technology in London. The Japanese automaker pledged to create a zero-emission and zero-fatality future of mobility. ProPilot is a self-driving technology designed for highway use to maintain a car in a single lane. Taking things a step further, Nissan is developing its own multilane autonomous driving technology, which can automatically change lanes on highways. It is expected to introduce the technology sometime next year.

By 2020, the automaker says it plans to release technology capable of autonomous driving in urban roads and intersections. Future models of both the Nissan Qashqai and Leaf are slated to be equipped with ProPilot. On the other side of the autonomous spectrum, luxury car brands Mercedes and BMW are not only giving their vehicles’ technology an advanced futuristic facelift, but the exterior and interior of automakers’ future autonomous models look like they’ve been plucked straight out of a science-fiction movie. With the upcoming Benz F 015, the “driver” is no longer facing the road. In fact, in this luxury model, passengers in the front and back seats are facing one another, separated by a small coffee table, in what the company refers to as the future of cars becoming a living space. Equipped with Benz’s Intelligent Drive, the technology has been reportedly in the works for the past 15 years. “Anyone who focuses solely on the technology has not yet grasped how autonomous driving will change our society,” said Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz, on the company’s homepage. “The car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a mobile living space.” Interior view of the F 015 autonomous concept vehicle by Mercedes-Benz (Mercedes-Benz) Equipped with Benz’s Intelligent Drive, the technology has been reportedly in the works for the past 15 years. “Anyone who focuses solely on the technology has not yet grasped how autonomous driving will change our society,” said Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz, on the company’s homepage. “The car is growing beyond its role as a mere means of transport and will ultimately become a mobile living space.” Fellow German car company BMW is also looking to make a big splash in the autonomous vehicle industry by combining its auto-pilot technology with luxury. BMW is working in collaboration with Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company that develops vision-based driver assistance systems.

Offered with the company’s “ease mode,” the vehicle’s smart companion takes over all of the driving responsibilities, allowing the driver to become a passenger. Using its multi-widget function, the driver can then use the car’s windshield as a multimedia screen to surf online and connect to social media. According to BMW’s timeline, the company is projecting to have a complete line of fully-autonomous cars by 2021. The company also announced it would introduce a fleet of 40 self-driving prototypes ready to be tested on the roads by the second half of this year.
