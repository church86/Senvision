Guru3D.com » News » Intel 300 series chipsets to integrate USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Gigabit WIFI Intel 300 series chipsets to integrate USB 3.1 Gen 2 and Gigabit WIFI by Aritra Das on: 04/17/2017 08:35 AM | Source | 14 comment(s) Intel is going to release two new platforms in the coming months which consists of  the X299 HEDT based CPUs and the other is the mainstream Coffee Lake based CPUs.  The upcoming Intel mainsteam chipset is known as the 300 series and we can expect that the top end chipset would be called Z370 which ironically sounds similar to AMDs X370 chipset. Intel 300 series desktop processor motherboard will be based on the current LGA 1151 socket. Earlier rumours stated that the 300 Series chipset's Coffee Lake-S processor will provide 6 Cores 12 threaded CPUS, which is Intel's first in the mainstream platform to enhance the number of processors and threads.  AMD has already put forward their 8 Cores 16 Threads and 6 Cores 12 threads CPUs at price point lower than Intel, although there are a few bugs, but the performance is quite good for the money. Now, intel is pushing forward its new CPUs. At this stage, Intel 300 series processors will be have integrated USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10Gbps) and Gigabit Wi-Fi which are some nice additions to this new platform.   It is rumoured that Intel will release their Coffee-Lake CPUs in the later half of 2017.

And why wasn't USB 3.1 Gen2 natively on Z200 series to begin with!?

Just delay it until there are enough features that make it worth it for the previous platform owners? Because that seems like a poor business decision and ****ty for everyone else who now has to wait because someone who bought Z270 is upset that they are being tempted by two new features.

Gigabit WiFi in an enterprise/office setting will be hugely popular. Places where it is difficult to run cable but needs network connectivity, etc. MorganX Newbie Posts: 24 Joined: 2015-03-30 #5421490 Posted on: 04/17/2017 02:59 PM While I "think" I'm done with Intel once ITX Ryzen Mobos are available, this is a good evolution of the chipset. Built-in WiGig will be great, and hopefully with 3.1 Gen 2 USB-C becomes a PC standard.

As for the new features, they are cool, nothing more. eddward Newbie Posts: 12 Joined: 2013-10-01 #5421509 Posted on: 04/17/2017 04:03 PM Quote: Originally Posted by H83 So from what i understand, the new chipset will maintain the current socket 1151, does this means that there´s a small chance that Cannonlake cpus will work on current Z170/Z270 boards??? As for the new features, they are cool, nothing more. First of all Cannonlake has to come to the desktop segment. I really think they will jump straight to Ice Lake as the first 10nm desktop SKU. And even if Cannonlake desktop will appear in 2018, these Z170 boards will be ~3 years old so basically out of support anyway. slyphnier Master Guru Posts: 304 Joined: 2009-11-30 #5421517 Posted on: 04/17/2017 04:54 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Matt26LFC OK now this 300 series platform I feel is taking the piss a little Is there any reason why CoffeeLake won't work on Z200 series!?

I don't understand. The fact that the 200 series itself does not have features such as USB 3.1 (gen2) and is a 2017 chipset itself is astonishing.

I dont use neither like wifi on desktop, but is a MUST. It s a joke needing an ethernet cable this days. Most casual pc users dont even know what an ethernet cable is or how is connected. Hope they put wifi on every 300 chipset. Tvs, streaming media players, phones, consoles, even the freaking fridge has wifi. But the most advanced and productive piece of technolgy on your house, been lacking wifi for more than 10 years. Shame on you manufacturers.

Trish Damkroger, an Intel veep and general manager for technical computing initiatives – that's HPC in Intel-Speak, this week sent an email to partners and customers in which she says: Starting today, Intel will contribute all Lustre features and enhancements to the open source community. This will mean that we will no longer provide Intel-branded releases of Lustre, and instead align our efforts and support around the community release. The email, sighted by The Register, goes on to say: “These changes are designed to increase Intel’s involvement in the community and to accelerate technical innovation in Lustre. For the community as a whole this will mean easier access to the latest stable Lustre releases and an acceleration of the technical roadmap. “Intel will be heavily involved in producing the Lustre community releases and expects there to be the same high level of quality that customers have come to expect from the Intel-branded releases,” Damkroger adds. “Furthermore, Intel will be publishing community maintenance releases for a designated Long Term Stable (LTS) release so that users can easily access an up to date 'latest and greatest'.” That LTS release will be Lustre 2.10, due in May 2017. Users of Intel-branded will be offered help to upgrade to 2.10. Intel is also continuing its Lustre support business. Chipzilla's already set the ball rolling by popping its Hadoop Adapter for Lustre and HPC Adapter for Mapreduce/Yarn(HAM) onto GitHub. Damkroger promises more code will appear there soon. Does this matter? Lustre users probably won't much care. The community edition proceeds apace and will continue to benefit from Intel's input. Indeed, Chipzilla has good reasons to keep Lustre humming so its HPC customers continue to love its Xeons and keep their roaming eyes off those cute little Power chips and ARMs. And let's not forget that the HPC community is not exactly short of big brains knowledgeable about deep-level file system wonkery, so should be able to consume and integrate whatever Intel keeps tossing into the Lustre code base. Long story short, the file system does not look to be on death row, even if it has lost a prominent commercial distribution. Symbolically, however, this seems a substantial decision. Intel's already bailed from an OpenStack collaboration and killed its Developer Forum event. Binning its own Lustre distribution and those other changes starts to look a bit like getting rid of some dead wood and/or spring cleaning. That the company is also throwing the kitchen sink at artificial intelligence further suggests Intel is engaging in a significant mid-course correction. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments MORE Intel Lustre More from The Register Quantum takes on GPFS and Lustre in commercial HPC market Analysis Colliding parallel file access products 5 Comments DDN shines up EXAScaler Lustre box with new software Intel software speeds HPC distributed file work Lenovo intros monster disk box You might need a forklift for this mofo 14 Comments Start massaging your wallet: DDN buffs up EXAScaler Lustre HPC storage rig ISC ES14K can be all flash or a disk-flash combo and has Intel SW inside Lenovo soups up storage for supers servers DDN buddy-up A-OK for HPC MacBook killer?

 Intel could be down $400 million when Cloudera goes public Julie Bort Apr. 18, 2017, 6:38 PM 4,501 facebook linkedin twitter email print Al Bello/Getty Late Monday afternoon, IPO-bound startup Cloudera released a price range for its IPO, and the news was not great. It expects to price shares between $12 - $14 each, which, at the high end, would value the company at $1.79 billion. That's less than half of its last valuation back in 2014 as a private company, which came in at a whopping $4.1 billion. And one investor, Intel, will really feel the sting of that lower pricing and could be down as much as $400 million, as pointed out by CNBC. In May, 2014, Intel paid roughly $30 a share to buy a stake in Cloudera, pouring about $742 million into the young company, founded six years earlier. It bought half of those shares from the company and half from earlier investors. Intel then bought more shares from other stockholders for a total of $766.5 million, according to the S-1 forms the company filed with the SEC. This was Intel's "single largest data center technology investment" to date, it said at the time. It was an especially sweet deal for those early shareholders because just two months earlier, March, 2014, the company's shares sold to other investors for less than half of what Intel paid, $14 apiece, according to the database that tracks such matters, Pitchbook.  Cloudera had just raised $160 million series F round from a bunch of big name late stage investors like T. Rowe Price, Google Ventures, Fidelity Investments and others. When that round finished two months before Intel took a stake, Cloudera was valued at $1.76 billion. It was Intel's investment that more than doubled Cloudera valuation in a mere couple of months. At $14 a share for the IPO, (what the other investors paid in 2014), Intel's $766.5 million stake in Cloudera could be worth $348.2 million. Of course, that's assuming there aren't any special terms to the preferred shares that Intel bought from Cloudera or some of its early investors, which might offer some downside protection or other benefits. All told, Cloudera raised about $1.05 billion from private investors. VCs and some employees made a killing, thanks to Intel We don't know all the investors who cashed out with Intel's generous $30 per share offer, though Accel and Greylock Partners were in the group. Both were early investors who bought at least some stock for as little as $0.39 per share or $0.49 per share in early rounds, according to Pitchbook. Mike Olson Some Cloudera employees sold shares to Intel, too, including cofounder Mike Olson and CFO Jim Frankola, the S-1 revealed. Olsen will still own about a 4% stake after the IPO, although some of that is in new stock granted to him. But here's the bummer for Intel. Back in 2014 when Intel took its massive leap of faith on Cloudera, the tech that Cloudera sold, known as Hadoop, was super hot. It allowed companies to store massive amounts of data on lower-cost commodity hardware, particularly servers built with Intel's chips. It looked like it would become the next Oracle. Intel not only bought a stake in the company, but it partnered with Cloudera to make its software work better with Intel's tech, and helped Cloudera sell to other global companies. On top of that, Intel itself became a huge Cloudera customer. It spent over $15 million on Cloudera's software over the past three years and has committed to spending $14 million more on it in future years, the S-1 says. Flash forward to 2017 and other technologies are eating Hadoop's lunch, such as one called Spark, created by the founders of a startup known as Databricks and (heavily backed by IBM). Even Cloudera has moved to offer big data technologies other than Hadoop. More than that, cloud computing has swooped in. Companies are increasingly storing their big data projects in Amazon, Microsoft or Google's cloud and not buying software to build their own. While Cloudera has 500 of the largest 8,000 companies, it says, there's a real question mark as to how many more of those 8,000 will go the build-at-home route and buy software such as Cloudera's. Even if they do, there are now lots of options to choose from. Intel is standing pat Intel hasn't given up. According to the prospectus, Intel could buy up to 10% of Cloudera's IPO shares. Intel's data center president Diane BryantIntel And, if another strategic partner wants to swoop in and buy a bigger stake in Cloudera, Intel's stake would increase to match the new buyer's. In other words, Intel has immense control over this company, almost like an acquisition, without an actual acquisition. And of course, if public investors think Cloudera has a sunny future, the company could opt to raise its opening price and Intel's stake won't take quite such a big haircut. Here's what investors are looking at: Revenue of $261 million in its fiscal 2017, up from $166 million in 2016. Gross profit (before research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses) of $174 million in 2017, up from nearly $91 million in 2016. Net loss of $187 million in 2017, narrowed a bit from $203 million in 2016. Sales and marketing expenses also increased from $161 million in 2016 to $203 million in 2017.

Windows 10's power-throttling feature will benefit battery-hungry laptops Only Insiders get to try it for now, though. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 19 April, 2017 07:02 0 - - - - print email IDG Microsoft claims that Windows 10's new power-throttling feature will boost battery life by about 11 percent, though you'll need a modern laptop to take advantage of it. Microsoft introduced the new feature to slow down background apps in January, as a trial feature for a subset of users running Insider versions of Windows 10. While power-throttling is still limited to Insiders, the recent Build 16176 made it more widely available.  There's one catch: Power throttling leverages Intel's Speed Shift technology, which debuted in Intel's sixth-generation (Skylake) Core chips that began shipping in late 2015. Current laptops with AMD processors won't be able to take advantage of the power savings, a Microsoft representative confirmed, though that could change in the near future: The representative added that the company's "working on expanding support to other processors as well over the next few months." Microsoft Here's what apps will look like when throttled. Windows 10 power throttling appears to work in a somewhat similar manner to the Game Mode that appeared in the stable version of the Windows 10 Creators Update. It looks at the processes that your PC is currently running, and attempts to identify what you're currently using and what you have running in the background. (In Game Mode, of course, the foreground app is a game.) Microsoft Windows 10's power slider. According to a blog post by Bill Karagounis, Microsoft's director of program management for the Windows Insider Program and OS fundamentals, Windows is smart enough to know that even apps playing music in the background shouldn't be throttled. Users will also have some control over which applications are throttled. In the Taskbar, for example, the power icon will pop up to expose a slider, where users will have the ability to choose between Battery Saver, Recommended, or Best Performance. The latter setting will turn off power throttling completely, as will plugging your laptop into a wall socket. Users will also have the option of manually configuring apps to select their battery use in the new Insider Builds: go to Settings > System > Battery, then select each app. You'll need to make sure you toggle the Managed by Windows setting to Off. Why this matters: Building free battery-boosting technology Windows is a terrific perk for laptop users, even if it's only currently available to Insiders who own modern Intel-powered PCs.  Why e-Sports Athletes Love MSI More from MSI Gaming Australia Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Weiss EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Instead, Intel says it will hold smaller, targeted events for AI, 5G and other topics as it transforms into a data-centric company. Related Media Andy Grove, longtime Intel chief and "father of Silicon Valley," dies at 79 Intel Owns 95 Percent of the Cloud and You Didn't Know it – Until Now Advertisement After 20 years of annual Intel Developer Forum conferences around the world, Intel said it is dropping the large-scale event and replacing it with smaller events that cover specific technology markets, including 5G, AI, autonomous driving and more. Intel announced the move on its website on April 17 as it thanked past attendees for their participation and unveiled the retirement of the IDF conferences. IDF 2017 was scheduled to be held in San Francisco before it was cancelled. Agnes Kwan, an Intel spokeswoman, told ITPro that the IDF conferences continued to be successful for the company, but that the move is being made as Intel transforms itself from a PC-centric company into a data-centric operation. Last year the event had 6,000 attendees from around the world. Past IDF events had been held in San Jose and Palm Springs, as well as in China, Taiwan and in Moscow. "Attendance hasn't been dropping and it was a very successful event for us for the past 20 years," said Kwan. "It has served its purpose." A major motivation for the changes is that Intel is getting involved in more technologies beyond PCs, such as artificial intelligence, 5G and autonomous driving and this requires a change in the events the company holds, she said. "The scope of our business has become so diverse that we need to re-evaluate our portfolio of events," said Kwan. "We will retire IDF but move to different, smaller events to get our messages across and reach our audiences." As part of this strategy, Intel recently held a targeted Technology and Manufacturing Day in San Francisco in March where the company talked about their silicon process technology, and an AI event several months ago which focused on the topic with a targeted audience, according to Kwan. "We're also going to other industry events that are to us, including the recent Los Angeles Auto Show," and another executive spoke at the SXSW event in March, she said. "We're going to new events which are targeting the new technologies Intel is getting into. Rather than having a big flagship event, we are now looking at new venues to target." Several IT analysts told ITPro they think that Intel's move makes sense, while another analyst said he thinks it is a mistake. "As Intel has become a far broader and more diversified organization, fitting all its business concerns into a single tent or general purpose vision has become increasingly problematic," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "At the same time, the developers and developer communities IDF was designed for have also evolved. Crafting more targeted events and engagements is a better approach for both Intel and its developer partners." Intel and the overall technology industry are hugely different today than when IDF launched back in 1996, continued King. "It's also important to acknowledge that vendors mainly sponsor and participate in events that meet their strategic needs, and depart if or when those situations change. Apple leaving MacWorld in 2011 is a good example, as was Microsoft's decision to stop participating in CES keynotes after 2012."   At the same time, "there's still a place for large scale, monolithic IT conferences like Salesforce's Dreamforce and Oracle's OpenWorld, but those companies' go-to-market strategies and customer engagements are far narrower than Intel's," said King.   Rob Enderle, principal analyst at Enderle Group, agreed. "With the emergence of virtualization, the need to focus directly on developers for a chip maker was substantially reduced," said Enderle. "Given no firm has unlimited resources and IDF was expensive in both funds and man hours, they are focusing instead on emerging markets like AI, drones, and autonomous markets as well as increasing their demand generation efforts for existing products instead." Enderle said he believes that "it is the end of an era for a lot of events like this" because they are more cost-effective ways to provide customers with information on products nowadays. "I think Intel has realized they need to step up and focus a bit more on the future than on entrenched practices if they are to benefit from the opportunities that are to come so they aren't dragged down by the past."   Another analyst, however, Dan Olds of Gabriel Consulting Group, told ITPro he thinks Intel is making a bad move by dropping its big annual event.   "IDF was the one event a year where Intel could trot out all this stuff and have the attention of the world on them," said Olds, who attended several of the conferences over the years. "It was the big tent event for them. As an analyst, you heard so much about it and it gave Intel a chance to set their agenda for the coming year." By changing its focus instead to smaller, targeted events in various locations Intel is "going to scuttle a lot of the impact they had with IDF," said Olds. "I imagine with several smaller events that not as many people will be able to get to them and they won't have the same impact." Attendees were always willing to carve out time to attend the event in the past, he added, but Intel is making that tougher. "I think it's always a mistake to give up a big platform like IDF, particularly for no compelling reason. It's not like it was going down in attendance and not like customers didn't want to go." Interestingly, in March Intel hired a new chief strategy officer, Aicha S. Evans, who is responsible for helping the company make its transformation from its historic background as a PC-centric company into a data-centric company, according to a recent announcement. Evans previously worked as an Intel senior vice president and was responsible for wireless communications for the past nine years. She joined Intel in 2006.  It will interesting to watch how Evans works to make more transforming changes in the future.

MSI's Leopard Pro series of 15.6" and 17.3" laptops capitalize on the capabilities of Intel and Nvidia's latest silicon to offer capable gaming performance in thin form factors. The Leopard Pros can be outfitted with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050, GTX 1050 Ti, or GTX 1060 3 GB graphics cards to go along with Intel seventh-generation Core i7 processors. A pair of SO-DIMM slots let the machines take in as much as 32 GB of DDR4 memory. MSI says the laptops come with a single 16 GB DDR4 SO-DIMM installed, so those in need of maximum memory bandwidth might want to plan on installing a matching stick right away for dual-channel goodness. Networking connectivity comes by way of a Killer Gigabit Ethernet controller paired with an Intel 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2 combo card. MSI didn't say much about storage options, other than mentioning that the machines have a single M.2 slot and a 2.5" drive bay. Some Leopard Pro models sport a SteelSeries-branded keyboard with per-key programmable RGB LED backlighting. The machines come with 1920x1080 displays, and there are options for 120-Hz panels. Regardless of hardware selection, the 15.6" models cram everything into a chassis measuring 15.1" x 10.2" x 1.1" (or 38 cm x 26 cm x 2.9 cm) and weighing 4.8 lbs (2.2 kg). The 17.3" models are bigger but almost as thin, at 16.5" x 10.6" x 1.2" (42 cm x 27 cm x 2.9 cm), and tilt the scales at 6 lbs (or 2.7 kg). The Leopard Pros have already been let out of the bag, and their prices range from $1230 to $1600 depending on the configuration.

Thinks It Can Outdo Intel Corp, Samsung This contract chipmaker believes that its 5-nano tech, slated for production in 2020, will be more efficient than competitors' technologies available in a similar time frame. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 18, 2017 at 12:46PM On Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) most recent earnings call, the company spent some time defending its competitive positioning relative to chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after the latter claimed at a recent event that its 10nm technology is a full generation ahead of competing 10nm technologies, including TSMC's. In response to Intel's competitiveness claims, TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said that "the most important [thing] is that we are offering the best solution to our customers' product roadmap." Image source: Intel. What I thought was more interesting was the following question and answer pair from the call between analyst Michael Chou and Wei: Chou: Just a follow-up question, sir. Can we say your power consumption efficiency in your 5-nanometer in 2020 will be ahead [of] all the competitors, including, for instance, IDM? Can we say that? Wei: We have confidence to do that, yes. Without context, this exchange might not mean too much. However, once it's put into context, you'll see that TSMC is making some pretty aggressive claims vis-a-vis its competitiveness relative to both Intel and rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). Providing context When Chou refers to "IDM," he's talking about integrated device manufacturers. IDMs are companies that design and manufacture their own chips. This stands in contrast to TSMC, which is a pure-play contract chip manufacturer. Samsung is an IDM as well, as it designs and builds its own smartphone processors, but it also manufactures chips for others. Intel is mainly an IDM, though it has been trying for years to build out its contract chip manufacturing business (with little commercial success). At any rate, what TSMC is claiming here is that its 5-nanometer chip manufacturing technology, which it says will go into mass production in 2020, will offer better power efficiency than the technologies that both Intel and Samsung will bring to the market. Business implications If TSMC achieves what it claims it will, then that'll have some interesting implications vis-a-vis its competition with both Samsung and Intel. Samsung is a direct contract chip manufacturing competitor. Both TSMC and Samsung compete for fabless chipmakers (that is, chip companies that design chips but rely on third parties to manufacture them), so if TSMC can offer better technology to customers, then it improves its odds of winning that business. It should be noted, however, that it takes more than good technology to win contract chip manufacturing business. The comparison with Intel is more interesting. To some extent, having potentially superior technology to Intel will help TSMC defend itself from contract chip manufacturing customer/order losses to Intel. That's important, but TSMC hasn't really been losing serious share to Intel, anyway. The more interesting thing here is that many of TSMC's customers are now looking to compete head-to-head with Intel in its core data-center processor and even personal computer processor markets. To the extent that TSMC can enable those challengers to Intel, those challengers (and TSMC) could benefit at Intel's expense, as better manufacturing technology could allow said challengers to build compelling enough products to help them capture share from Intel.

I figure desktop and laptop CPUs (so, not including servers) alone make up more revenue than all of the other mentioned products combined: * Intel is not known for their AI; meanwhile, companies like Google and IBM (both of which produce their own processors) have made newsworthy AIs. * Intel recently acquired companies like Altera, which as far as I'm concerned, were doing fine without Intel. FPGAs generally aren't a big sellers. * Though I personally see the benefits of Optane, it doesn't seem to be very appealing to most people. * Intel is trying WAY too hard when it comes to IoT. ARM and Arduino platforms have generally been more appealing, due to costing less and being simpler to set up. * What was the last truly innovative and noteworthy wireless technology Intel released?

They have to diversify, their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off. So what exactly do they do? How do they make money selling CPUs? People here love to say "well they could try increasing performance more than 5% each generation" or something - but for 90% of the market, more performance isn't even necessary. Like if Intel released a processor tomorrow that's 500% faster, I would upgrade 0 machines at my office, because no one here does anything that requires more than an i3. So yeah, they are behind in all this stuff - but if they don't start diversifying they die anyway. Nvidia recognized this as they were in the same boat. They had vast majority of GPU marketshare - the only way to increase revenue was to either charge customers more or utilize their products and find new avenues for revenue. They were just smart enough to get into the AI/Cars/Etc before anyone really realized how big of a market it was. Intel was too slow and now they are playing catch-up in a bunch of areas, but they don't really have a choice.

I completely get what you're saying, but many people seem to forget that Intel still makes around $11 billion in net revenue per year. I'm sure almost all of that is coming from CPUs, SSDs, NICs, and motherboards. Note how none of those are the products Intel is changing their focus toward. If Intel sticks with what they're known for, they will still remain over-powered for many more years. They have the money to really make a difference, but instead they're either playing it safe, or, they're dumping all their money into markets where they're severely behind. There are plenty of tech markets out there that don't have much competition, yet Intel decides to join the ones that are very competitive, well-established, and don't yield much interest to either the general public or industries.

You're absolutely right - Intel isn't going to save themselves by continuously making faster CPUs. It's exactly that mentality why Intel is losing sight of what they should be doing - improving efficiency. We don't need faster CPUs anymore. We don't need more threads. What we need is to keep up the same performance while lowering the wattage. Intel is so blinded by "moar iz better!" that they had to drop out of the smartphone market. Their phone CPUs were over-complicated, over-powered, and were way too expensive. From what I recall, some had thermal problems too. Even AMD is putting more of an effort toward efficiency. As much as AMD is just a little ant that could be squished at the whim of Intel, I suspect they'll last longer as a company, because they're forced to adapt in order to stay afloat. Intel never needed to know how to do that, and these decisions they're making exemplify that.     schmidtbag View Public Profile Find all posts by schmidtbag   (#6) Amaze Maha Guru     Videocard: Gigabyte 970 G1 1550/7800 Processor: Intel 2500K @4.5 Mainboard: Gigabyte Z68XP-UD3P Memory: 8GB Corsair Vengeance LP Soundcard: Realtek 889 PSU: Coolermaster v700 Yesterday, 20:28 | posts: 2,098 | Location: Norway Intel must be desperate now.

The company said in a short statement on its website that the event has been "retired" with immediate effect, before directing developers to its Resource and Design Centre. It wrote: "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum.” Related: Best PCs Intel has been shifting its business focus from tradition PCs to other, emerging technologies recently, and this latest move shows it's doing all it can to branch out. The annual developer forum was a popular event on the developer calendar, with Intel using it for major announcements. Previously, IDF has been used for CPU announcements such as Skylake and Kaby Lake, as well as other launches including storage products such as Optane. Intel's Skylake processor range was announced at IDF This year's event was previously set to take place in San Francisco in August, but will now no longer go ahead according to the company's website. The news of IDFs cancellation follows Intel previously announcing the event would not occur in China, though the US version was still expected to go ahead. An Intel spokesman spoke to AnandTech, with the site reporting: "With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information." The spokesman suggested the company will be focusing on "new ways to communicate with the audience," hinting that there would be more "targeted" events held in the future. Not having to adhere to a schedule dictated by one large event will allow Intel to make announcements more freely in the future. That said, developers will likely react to the decision negatively, as they will now need to attend several events to learn how to develop for new platforms, rather than the one big developer forum. Google is set to hold its own Google I/O event next month, while Apple will soon be gearing up for its Worldwide Developer Conference event in June. Are you sad to see IDF go?

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Microsoft’s ‘no update’ policy in effect for Ryzen and Kaby Lake systems on Windows 7/8.1 Microsoft’s ‘no update’ policy in effect for Ryzen and Kaby Lake systems on Windows 7/8.1 Matthew Wilson 17 hours ago CPU, Featured Tech News, Operating Systems A couple of weeks ago, we learned about Microsoft’s plans to lock down system updates for those using AMD’s new Ryzen and Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors on older versions of Windows. This essentially meant that while you could install Windows 7 or 8.1 on a system featuring one of the latest Intel or AMD CPUs, you would miss out on all updates, leaving your system without the latest security updates. Now, this policy is in effect, with a new message popping up for users attempting to update their older OS. If you are running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on a PC featuring one of Intel or AMD’s new CPUs, then you may start to see the following message pop up: “Your PC uses a processor that is designed for the latest version of Windows. Because the processor is not supported together with the Windows version you are currently using, your system will miss important security updates”. You will then be encouraged to install Windows 10. This policy will apply to future CPU releases from Intel and AMD too. However, there is no doubt that Windows 7 purists will figure out a way to block and avoid the pop-ups entirely. Still, it is worth considering the security aspect of things. KitGuru Says: This news shouldn’t be too surprising as Microsoft gave plenty of warning. However, I imagine Windows 7 and 8.1 users aren’t going to be too happy about receiving a new batch of pop-up messages in regards to upgrading to Windows 10.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 3 Best Dividend Stocks in Silicon Valley We break down the income-investing case for three of Silicon Valley’s elite companies -- Apple, Intel, and Cisco Systems. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 18, 2017 at 9:33AM The terms "Silicon Valley" and "dividends" typically share something of an oil-and-water relationship. As the fertile crescent of innovation today, the San Francisco Bay Area churns out high-growth companies that tend to eschew the traditional. On the seemingly opposite end of the spectrum, companies known for paying dividends are often the very members of the establishment that Silicon Valley start-ups seek to unseat. However, as many of Silicon Valley's most successful upstarts have grown into corporate titans in their own rights, companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) have transitioned to become mature, dividend-paying stocks. Let's delve further into why Apple, Intel, and Cisco are some of the Bay Area's best income-producing stocks to buy today. Image source: Apple. Apple Though Apple only started paying a dividend in 2012, the world's largest technology company did so with a bang, not a whimper. Over the past five years, Apple has increased the dollar values allocated to its capital return program, which includes funds for both share buybacks and dividends, from an initial $45 billion to $250 billion at present. As of Apple's most recent 10-Q filing, $49 billion remained unused in its capital return program. Apple has tended to increase its dividend payments during its second-quarter reports, which are due to be released on May 2. My guess is Apple will raise its dividend and further expand its capital return allocation during its upcoming report. The company currently carries $246 billion in cash and investments -- or $159 billion on a net-cash basis -- and it generated $65 billion in cash flows over the past 12 months. Furthermore, Apple's redesigned iPhone 8 will likely trigger another massive smartphone upgrade cycle that will provide the tech giant further financial windfalls in the coming year. The company's shares currently yield an unassuming 1.6%. However, because of the Mac maker's embarrassment of riches, Apple seems poised to continue to return capital to its shareholders at an increasingly aggressive clip in the years to come. Intel The leading supplier of chips to the PC and server industries, Intel has gradually shifted into a mature company as those two industries have also aged. Thankfully for income investors, Intel's transition into corporate adulthood and its uber-profitable business model have shifted the company's focus to driving shareholder returns through dividends and stock buybacks. Intel has increased its dividends per share from $0.07 in 2000 to $1.04 in 2006, which translates to an average dividend growth rate of 17.2% per annum. While the company hasn't shown a commitment to the kind of steady, annual dividend increases that investors love, as evidenced by its overall dividend growth, Intel has been an income investor's delight for many years. And Intel has already raised its dividend as part of its most recent earnings report. Looking to its overall return profile, the company's sales growth prospects have recently improved. The company recently agreed to purchase autonomous-vehicle chipmaker Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) to help further expand its exposure to this booming market. Intel certainly paid a pretty price for the Israeli start-up -- $15.3 billion, all told -- but the move materially expands Intel's growth opportunities, which had been pretty negligible prior to the deal. Overall, Intel is clearly one of the top dividend stocks in the Bay Area today. Cisco Systems The world's largest maker of networking equipment, Cisco Systems resembles Intel in many ways. It too is a mature company that has prioritized capital return to an impressive degree, making it another one of Silicon Valley's best dividend stocks. A relative newcomer to cash distributions, Cisco Systems only began paying its dividend in 2011, but, like Intel, it has shown a remarkable commitment to increasing those payouts. In fact, the company has raised its dividend every year, most recently increasing its 2017 payout by 11% as part of its first-quarter earnings release. Cisco has increased its total dividend payments each year from $0.24 in 2011 to $1.07 over the last 12 months, which translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of $28.3%. The company's shares currently trade at an appreciable discount to the market, trading hands at 16 times 2016 earnings, though Cisco is expected to grow its earnings per share by an average rate of 10% over the next five years. Furthermore, the bull thesis for Cisco stock, its current yield of 3.2%, its payout ratio of 53%, and its cash-laden balance sheet make Cisco a safe candidate to continue increasing its payouts for years to come.

The conference was initially scheduled to be held in August in San Francisco. The Intel Developer Forum (IDF) was used by the company to showcase new Intel chip architectures, as well as other developments by the company. Intel made the announcement via a post on the official IDF 2017 website in which it states, “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” Speaking to Anandtech, the company stated that the main reason for the cancellation of the conference is Intel’s switch from a PC-centric company to a data centric company. It says that with the rise of other fields like AI, IoT, wireless communication, and more, IDF was no longer needed. However, Intel did say that it plans on finding new ways to communicate via targeted events. These would be similar to other events like AI Day, or be connected to partner events.

Tech Search Search Autonomous VehiclesChinese Search Behemoth Baidu Set to Launch Self-Driving Car Technology in July WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: April 19 PoliticsWhite House Meeting on Paris Climate Deal Has Been Postponed PoliticsBernie Sanders Urges Democrats to Reach Out to Trump Supporters PointCloud Intel Pulls Plug on Annual Developer Conference Barb Darrow Apr 18, 2017 Chip giant Intel is axing the Intel Developer Forum, a nearly 20-year-old annual event at which the company showed off the latest-and-greatest gizmos running Intel hardware. The show was Intel's largest tech showcase at which the company's top execs typically took the stage to demonstrate what the company's technology could power. Last year, for example, Intel used IDF to show off an array of virtual reality gear. The news of the cancellation was disclosed on the IDF website: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. The post also directed customers with questions to talk to their Intel (intc) representative. Fortune contacted Intel (intc) for additional comment, but a company rep told tech news site Anandtech, which first picked up on the cancellation, that Intel is fast evolving from what was once a PC-centric company to one with more diverse offerings. The spokesperson said there will be more focused events going forward, like last November's Artificial Intelligence Day. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The IDF news comes a week after Fortune reported that Intel was pulling its investment in the OpenStack Innovation Center, which it founded two years ago with partner Rackspace. It's not all that unusual for a tech company to change up big customer and partner events as needs change. In 2011, for example, Microsoft (msft) melded its Professional Developers Conference (PDC) with other tech events and it has since morphed into Microsoft Build. Microsoft PDC, however, was never strictly speaking, an annual event. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

No More IDF, Intel Scuttles Signature Tech Conference IDF 2008.Rico Shen/Wikimedia Tuesday, April 18, 2017 6:10 AM UTC 0 comments The Intel Developers Forum (IDF) has been a running trend for the global chip makers for over two decades. It was meant to be an event where the company and other developers could show off the technologies that they have developed. This is no longer the case since Intel recently scrubbed the event and canceled the scheduled 2017 conference. What’s startling about this development, however, is the fact that it was so discreet despite the significance of the event. On the IDF website, the company posted a short announcement that barely qualifies as a snippet. “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward,” the announcement reads. “Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” As Tom’s Hardware reports, the scrapping of the event might actually make sense when considering Intel’s current state. When the conference was first started, Intel was largely a microchip manufacturer. These days, it has expanded to a lot of fields, including data centers and even autonomous driving. This made the IDF, which lasted only three days, too cumbersome to be effective at delivering a concise message. This doesn’t mean that Intel has completely given up on hosting events either. It’s more likely that the company will simply hold several events throughout the year, with different conferences having specialized topics. For the publishing companies covering these events, the change is welcome. It will result in more opportunities to cover the full line-up of products and services that are showcased during the events. More often than not, the recent IDFs have been far too complex for the media to really get a sense of. Focused-driven conferences would solve this problem.

Guru3D.com » News » Intel Cancels Intel Developer Forum Intel Cancels Intel Developer Forum by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 04/18/2017 08:08 AM | Source | 8 comment(s) And that's now and in the future. We are a bit puzzled as to what is going on with Intel these days, last year here in the Netherlands and well, many other spots in the EU, they cancelled all press-agencies and press contacts. E.g. sampling + info retrieving through Intel is gone. Now we get our info and samples through other ways then Intel these days, but it is indicative as to the why, how and what is going on with Intel. They just do not want to communicate with media anymore. This morning news reaches us that the yearly technology event IF, the Intel Developer Forum now is scrapped. here developers, media and analysts always have been briefed on new and upcoming technology.     "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions." It seems and feels like Intel is shifting and stepping away from the processor industry. Ian from Anandtech got a response back from Intel: I just got off the phone with Intel, discussing why IDF is being cancelled. The main reason I was given is that Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two-to-three years, especially as they are changing from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information. As a result, the decision has been made to find new ways to communicate with the audience (media, developers and companies) and the ecosystem with targeted events. These will be like the recent AI Day or Manufacturing Day, or be connected to partner events, or involve separate geocentric events. So rather than have one big melee on everything, Intel is set to split its message across several different areas in the hope that it accurately digs deep enough into every area. I was told that Intel wants to find a better way to present the experiences in each of the fields, and this is the way to do that. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

I don't understand why they're taking this approach. I also don't see what suggests Intel is stepping away from the processor industry, and more importantly, why. That's like if Yamaha suddenly stopped making musical instruments and strictly focused on motorcycles - sure, they could do that, but they're losing a huge source of profit. I figure desktop and laptop CPUs (so, not including servers) alone make up more revenue than all of the other mentioned products combined: * Intel is not known for their AI; meanwhile, companies like Google and IBM (both of which produce their own processors) have made newsworthy AIs. * Intel recently acquired companies like Altera, which as far as I'm concerned, were doing fine without Intel. FPGAs generally aren't a big sellers. * Though I personally see the benefits of Optane, it doesn't seem to be very appealing to most people. * Intel is trying WAY too hard when it comes to IoT. ARM and Arduino platforms have generally been more appealing, due to costing less and being simpler to set up. * What was the last truly innovative and noteworthy wireless technology Intel released? Widi/Mirrorlink don't count - that's basically just a glorified Wifi + VNC. * Nvidia and other ARM brands are also way ahead when it comes to automotive. It just seems to me that if Intel really is shifting away from CPUs and toward these other things, they're going to doom themselves. Turanis Maha Guru Posts: 1020 Joined: 2014-08-15 #5421860 Posted on: 04/18/2017 03:27 PM Looks like they need to work pretty hard to acomplish many things in today's tech world.IoT sucks,anyway. Intel is a Goliath with clay feet,unfortunately (Im looking,aswell,at M$$$).Big company,big money stock,but only few useful ideas. They need to broke in pieces to work at today's useful tech.They think too much in the past,because they dont have a visionary CEO.

They have to diversify, their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off. So what exactly do they do? How do they make money selling CPUs? People here love to say "well they could try increasing performance more than 5% each generation" or something - but for 90% of the market, more performance isn't even necessary. Like if Intel released a processor tomorrow that's 500% faster, I would upgrade 0 machines at my office, because no one here does anything that requires more than an i3. So yeah, they are behind in all this stuff - but if they don't start diversifying they die anyway. Nvidia recognized this as they were in the same boat. They had vast majority of GPU marketshare - the only way to increase revenue was to either charge customers more or utilize their products and find new avenues for revenue. They were just smart enough to get into the AI/Cars/Etc before anyone really realized how big of a market it was. Intel was too slow and now they are playing catch-up in a bunch of areas, but they don't really have a choice. schmidtbag Maha Guru Posts: 1438 Joined: 2012-11-10 #5421877 Posted on: 04/18/2017 04:12 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Denial They have to diversify because their market for PC's is not only saturated (they have what, like 90%+ marketshare?) but the PC market itself is dwindling and clearly charging more to increase profits just pisses everyone off.

Intel was too slow and now they are playing catch-up in a bunch of areas, but they don't really have a choice. I completely get what you're saying, but many people seem to forget that Intel still makes around $11 billion in net revenue per year. I'm sure almost all of that is coming from CPUs, SSDs, NICs, and motherboards. Note how none of those are the products Intel is changing their focus toward. If Intel sticks with what they're known for, they will still remain over-powered for many more years. They have the money to really make a difference, but instead they're either playing it safe, or, they're dumping all their money into markets where they're severely behind. There are plenty of tech markets out there that don't have much competition, yet Intel decides to join the ones that are very competitive, well-established, and don't yield much interest to either the general public or industries.

You're absolutely right - Intel isn't going to save themselves by continuously making faster CPUs. It's exactly that mentality why Intel is losing sight of what they should be doing - improving efficiency. We don't need faster CPUs anymore. We don't need more threads. What we need is to keep up the same performance while lowering the wattage. Intel is so blinded by "moar iz better!" that they had to drop out of the smartphone market. Their phone CPUs were over-complicated, over-powered, and were way too expensive. From what I recall, some had thermal problems too. Even AMD is putting more of an effort toward efficiency. As much as AMD is just a little ant that could be squished at the whim of Intel, I suspect they'll last longer as a company, because they're forced to adapt in order to stay afloat. Intel never needed to know how to do that, and these decisions they're making exemplify that.

However, having previously advised that its San Francisco event would still go ahead this year despite the cancellation of its event in China, it now seems that is no longer the case. In its most recent announcement on the IDF website, the company said: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. While the news may come as a shock, it pays to remember the many notable announcements made at IDF over the years, which have included: 2004: Intel's move to incorporate AMD's 64-bit instruction set into its Xeon CPUs at the risk of threatening its own 64-bit Itanium market 2005: A significant shift in the company's desktop CPU strategy, eventually culminating in Conroe, AKA the Core 2 Duo CPU, which Intel claimed delivered up to 40% more performance and 40% less power consumption compared to the Pentium D 2006: A proclamation that the company would deliver Teraflop CPUs within five years, although it appears that we are still waiting for those to materialize 2011: A partnership between Intel and Google to bring x86 support to Android while also providing a demonstration of an Atom-based smartphone running the OS 2013: The reveal of Atom-based Bay Trail processors for Windows 8.1 tablets, which would hit the market just a few years before Intel ultimately pulled out of the smartphone and tablet race Some may find it somewhat disappointing that Intel is seemingly deserting faithful developers and partners by dropping IDF in the face of a tough PC market over the last couple of years. While it appears that the company is planning to distribute its communication efforts across a number of areas to help ensure that there is sufficient depth of coverage, it remains to be seen if this change of strategy will be worth IDF's sacrifice.

After 20 years, Intel has announced that it will no longer be hosting its annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF), which showcases the latest news from the company. The axing of the event has been made due to the waning appeal of the IDF amid the slowing PC market and a shift in focus for Intel towards other avenues of revenue, such as data centres and AI. IDF started in 1997 as a small gathering in San Jose but quickly expanded and moved to San Francisco’s Moscone Centre. The Event was scheduled for mid August, according to the Moscone Centre’s calendar, though now this will no longer be happening. The company released a statement on its website today saying: “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. “Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” Another sign that the company was veering away from its IDF conference came last year following the announcement that it would no longer be holding its partner event in China as of 2017. This year the company has also made the decision to pull support from both the International Science and Engineering Fair and the national Science Talent search. Agnes Kwan, spokesperson for Intel, said: “Our CEO has been talking about Intel no longer being a PC-centric company, but a data-centric one. We are in areas like AI (artificial intelligence), VR (virtual reality) and IOT (intenet of things). Wherever there is data, you will see us there.” “We have a new audience that validates our portfolio. We are looking into more and different events to get our message across such as industry conferences.” The company has said that it will counter this cancellation with more appearances at smaller conferences, such as the recent Manufacturing Day event where they argued that Moore’s Law is still in full effect despite slowing product cycles.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel cancels entire Developer Forum program ahead of this summer’s IDF17 04/17/2017 at 11:42 AM by Brad Linder 1 Comment After nearly two decades, chip maker Intel has decided to scrap its annual Intel Developer Forum conference. The news was posted to the IDF17 website, despite the fact that the company had previously planned to hold an event in San Francisco from August 15th through August 17th. In recent years Intel had actually held two annual IDF events: one in San Francisco and one in China. This year’s Chinese event had already been canceled, but now it looks like the San Francisco event is off as well… forever. While it looks like IDF is done, Intel is directing developers to its Resource and Design Center website for more information about building hardware and software for use with Intel products. The company will also continue to make announcements at other tradeshows and hold it own smaller events throughout the year, focused on specific product categories. Intel says the move comes as the company is moving away from a focus primarily on PCs to one that is producing a wider range of products including automotive technologies, Internet of Things products, wireless communications, artificial intelligence, and storage, among other things. I guess the idea is that it’s hard to cover everything in a single event when attendees may only be interested in a subset of those things. IDF may have been aimed at developers, but Intel also had a habit of announcing new products including the company’s latest chip technologies, virtual reality technology like Project Alloy, or storage products like the recently-launched Intel Optane memory solution. But Intel doesn’t necessarily save all of its announcements for IDF: the company often holds big press events at CES, Computex, and other industry events throughout the year. via AnandTech Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Intel cancels entire Developer Forum program ahead of this summer’s IDF17" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Industry CPU Components News 2 Intel Developer Forum (IDF) tradeshow discontinued by Mark Tyson on 18 April 2017, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadghl Add to My Vault: Today Intel announced that it has retired its own tradeshow format, which has been running for nearly 20 years. There will be no IDF17 San Francisco this year, despite the event being listed in the Moscone Centre calendar, for 15th - 17th August. Intel has previously stated that it won't be hosting an IDF event in China this year. The first Intel Developer Forum was held in 1997, and it began as a biannual US-only event for developers from around the globe. At its peak there were three events per annum in total; two in the US, and one in China. More recently the IDF went back to biannual scheduling - with one event per year in the US, and the other in China. Intel's official announcement regarding the cancellation of future IDF events is rather brief and uninformative. The chipmaker says that it has "evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward". It goes on to direct the bewildered to its Resource and Design Centre website which hosts documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. Instead of the IDF presentations, announcements, discussions, and the meetings with fellow developers worldwide - you can now look at a website. Tech site AnandTech got some more information out of an Intel representative, regarding the cancellation of IDF. "The main reason I was given is that Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two-to-three years, especially as they are changing from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company," wrote an AnandTech reporter. Due to its wider portfolio of interests, a large all-encompassing event like IDF isn't as suitable as a range of smaller more targeted events for AI, IoT, wireless comms, PCs etc. It will be interesting to see how Intel's event portfolio changes in the coming months.

Intel confirmed the cancellation and said that the company will make a more detailed announcement at a later time. Intel's IDF shows began in 1997. The event allowed the CPU giant to showcase and talk about its latest technology, innovations and platforms and has already become important development guidance for the IT industry. Sources from the upstream supply chain noted that Intel has already informed them about the cancellation of the two IDF events. In the future, Intel is planning to host specific technical forums or product launch conferences for its products and supply chain partners. Intel's new PC platforms in the future will all be unveiled at major IT events including Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, CES in the US and Gamescom in Germany, while its new manufacturing process or wafer technologies will be discussed during specially hosted events such as Intel Technology and Manufacturing Day, hosted at the end of March in San Francisco.

Hosted in San Francisco, the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) was designed to provide developers with the latest information for Intel’s chipsets and serve as an event to unveil new products. Intel has used IDF to launch processors like Skylake or Kaby Lake, and even some of its networking and storage solutions. Intel was scheduled to hold IDF in August this year, but a note on the company’s site has revealed the conference has been canceled. “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward,” says Intel. “Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum!” Anandtech reports that Intel is cancelling its developer forum as the company has been changing its focus over the last few years. Intel is attempting to shift away from its PC reliance towards a focus on data with AI, IoT, wireless communications, and automotive areas. The end of IDF is a reminder of Intel’s struggles. Intel, like Microsoft, missed a huge mobile opportunity just as the PC market was set to decline. The majority of PCs, including Apple’s range of Macs, use Intel’s chipsets, but millions devices more use ARM-based processors inside smartphones. Intel announced at IDF last year that it will start building ARM-based smartphone chips, but we’ve not seen the results of this production line change just yet. Intel is now expected to hold separate events for its announcements in the future, instead of revealing them all in a single event like IDF.

In a short post on its website, Intel says it has "evolved its event portfolio" and "decided to retire the IDF program moving forward". It continues to say that after "nearly 20 great years" there are now resources on its website and a resource and design area that can be used by developers. Although Intel does not give any direct reason for cancelling the show, a spokesperson told AnandTech that as the firm has been focusing on data in recent years, the event does not fill its current needs.

Intel has decided to “retire” its annual IDF convention and turn its attention to dedicated events that focus on each of Intel’s key areas. Given the changing face of the PC industry, Intel’s priorities have apparently shifted to other areas, including IoT, smart cars, cloud computing, etc. As a result, Intel believes that IDF, which was originally home to all of Intel’s major product announcements and offered a glimpse into Intel’s roadmap, is not necessary any more. Anandtech spoke to Intel and discovered that Intel doesn’t intend to do away with trade shows entirely. Instead, Intel will apparently focus on specific events, like an AI Day for discussing AI advancements, a Cloud Day for discussing its cloud offerings, etc. These events will include partner events or location-centric events, says Anandtech. Intel now wants to find new ways of communicating with its community. While Intel’s logic makes sense, it’s sad to see IDF go. This was the one event in the year where one could holistically experience all of Intel’s offerings and its plans. To be fair, the PC space is dying a long, slow death and Intel has hit a wall as far as product development is concerned (AMD’s still playing catch-up) and its product lifecycles have been stretched considerably. Still, it’s certainly going to be a little bit harder to keep track of all the goings on at Intel from now on.

Intel is cancelling its Intel Developer Forum (IDF), embracing its overall strategic pivot (which began a year ago) from being a maker of chips for PCs to being a maker of chips for data centres and the internet of things (IoT). In the mid-1990s, both Intel and Microsoft dominated the PC revolution, as the first of what would one day be billions of internet users found their feet with beige boxes and 56k modems. As PCs became sleeker and more refined with the dawn of the cloud era, Intel and Microsoft were prepared to dominate once again but, tragically for them, they were wrong-footed by the smartphone revolution and neither company was nimble enough to correct its course. Intel’s big gamble on the age of machines But that all changed for Intel in 2013 when its CEO, Brian Krzanich, took the reins. Last year, he embarked on a blitz of cuts that saw 11pc of the company’s global workforce laid off. He also set out his strategic vision for the company, which involved transforming it from a PC company to being the intrinsic link between the cloud in the data centre, 5G and IoT. At the core of this is Intel’s enduring edge in 14nm and 10nm microprocessors and the evolution of Moore’s Law. The surest sign yet that Intel is burning its old PC boats on the beaches in order to march forward is its decision to cancel its long-running Intel Developer Forum. “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF programme moving forward,” the company announced overnight. “Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on Intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers and developers. As always, our customers, partners and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” The IDF, similar to Apple’s WWDC or Microsoft’s Build conference, was the scene for annual product announcements, including CPUs such as Skylake. This signals that Intel is becoming less and less about definitive products and milestones, and more about the sinews and vessels that carry data in a new emerging world of AI, mixed reality, 5G, data centres and IoT. Rather than one developer event, it is possible that Intel could branch into several specific developer genres. The PC era is dead. Long live the machines era.

There's nothing to worry about. We're all good. Allegedly. It emerged just before the Easter weekend that Intel has turned off the money tap to the OpenStack Innovation Center (OSIC), a 2,000-node facility it ran with Rackspace to develop and improve OpenStack for big biz. The center was set up by Intel and Rackspace just two years ago, and funding was supposed to run into 2018, but the chip giant has now quit, we're told. So that's basically the end of the OSIC. Its shutdown sparked fears over the weekend that Intel was cutting all ties with the OpenStack movement, which would deal a hammer blow to the open-source cloud platform. It comes as Intel scraps its annual IDF technical conference in California. On Monday, the OpenStack Foundation, which has two folks on the OSIC's governing board, pretty much confirmed Fortune's earlier report that the plug is being pulled on the center, estimating that about 45 Rackspace workers will lose their jobs if they cannot find another role within the company. Neither the foundation nor Intel and Rackspace, however, want to spread the message that a big breakup is imminent, and all are moving to at least create the appearance that Rackspace and Chipzilla are both committed to backing the technology. "Intel and Rackspace are very proud of the accomplishments of our joint teams working in OSIC and of its contributions to the OpenStack community," an Intel spokesperson told El Reg. "Both companies believe strongly in the future of OpenStack and will continue to contribute to, and collaborate in, the community." About those accomplishments. You can find at least some of OSIC's open-sourced code repositories here, a lot of which haven't been touched in months. Intel's OpenStack page on 01.org hasn't been updated in months, either. The OSIC's news page died at the end of 2016. Rackspace, meanwhile, pointed to a blog post earlier this month by senior VP of strategy and product Scott Crenshaw, in which he claimed that OpenStack business has never better. "OpenStack deployments are growing. It is becoming a standard cloud platform for corporations of all sizes, which are consistently growing their usage of OpenStack," Crenshaw said. "That trend is born out at Rackspace, where we're seeing dramatic growth in our customers' usage of OpenStack." The OpenStack Foundation points out that both Intel and Rackspace are major sponsors for its annual summit next month (Intel's 01.org doesn't even acknowledge the conference, though) and even without the OSIC, it will have multiple clusters for engineers to test out new code. "Fortunately, the infra team is already integrated with six other cloud providers in a dozen regions all over the world, and is preparing for life without OSIC," said OpenStack Foundation's chief operating officer Mark Collier on Monday. "We believe any disruption to the development process will be minimal." ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Intel Rackspace Openstack More from The Register Jumpin' AppFlash!

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Tag: Intel Devleopler Forum Intel IDF is No More Posted on April 18, 2017 by Gil Russell - Business, Chips, Cloud Computing, Desktops, Events, Laptops, Mobile, News, Servers Intel has decided to end its annual Intel Developer Forum, including IDF 17 expected in August this year. Intel posted the following on its webpage; “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” Intel announced earlier that it would not be sponsoring an IDF event in China this year. It was still expected in the US with a “new format”.  Prior to today’s announcement, Intel’s IDF page stated: “We are making changes to the Intel Developer Forum. This fall the event in San Francisco will have a new format and we will not be hosting an event in China. More details to come soon.” It added to “keep checking this page in the middle of March for updates”.  No update was made in the middle of March, in fact, “keep checking this page” disappeared with today’s announcement permanently cancelling IDF. IDF was nearly 20 years old and had its origins in the early 1990s as a quarterly update as a service to its PC customers run by sales staff until 1995 when Intel Corporate decided to pick up the venue as an annual industry wide event. Intel’s business has grown into separate and distinct segments whose management felt that IDF no longer served them as a direct means of communicating their message. The rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, automotive, IoT, and wireless communications diminished the delivery of any direct message emanating from any one group. Intel is now deciding how to find new ways of disseminating information to their respective audiences (media, developers and customers). How the company works through this process is still to be determined. TechEye Take The fact that Intel’s Data Center Group was not happy over the amount of support it provided to other disparate groups at Intel has been an open secret for a least the last couple of years. It is somewhat of a surprise that the separation did not occur sooner. Nevertheless, the fact remains that much of what made up IDF is considered to be necessary for the industry financial and strategic technology analysts to understand the company’s Data Center Group’s direction in the Enterprise and Cloud Market segments. But that’s Diane Bryant’s problem now. What is not clear is what Intel has planned to replace something that was working but not in all the right ways to satisfy certain marketing types in messaging their customers, their investors and the industry at large.

Unfortunately, most of the advancement in performance only happen on a desktop level. Furthermore, for gaming fans who also like being portable and mobile, the choices are pretty limited. With the release of the latest Intel Kaby Lake processors, gaming has never been more exciting. Now, even gaming laptops are equipped with the latest processors from Intel to deliver the best portable gaming performance. In the spirit of mobility, these gaming laptops need to pack all the gaming performance in a small amount of space. The sad thing is, it comes with a price and a very big one indeed. Fortunately, not all gaming laptops will rob a typical gamer with all of his or her savings. There are still quite a few who can offer a pretty decent gaming experience while not trying to break the bank. That said, here is a list of Intel Kaby Lake gaming laptops that you can buy for under a thousand dollars. Before we dive even deeper, perhaps it is best to set some ground rules. First of all, as mentioned already, all gaming laptops would need to have any version of the Intel Kaby Lake line of processors. Next, for the sake of graphics performance uniformity, all laptops should have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or its Ti equivalent. Finally, the price should not go beyond $1,000. Dell Inspiron 15 7000 The first laptop on the list is the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. While one might think that this is not exactly marketed as a gaming laptop, it sure fits earlier requirements. This 15-incher sports an i5-7300HQ paired with an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti. The processor runs at 2.5GHz. Meanwhile, memory and storage are at 8GB and 256GB SSD, respectively. The 15.6-inch display has a resolution of 1920×1080. The Dell Inspiron 15 700 is priced at a decent $799. Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (via dell.com) Acer Aspire VX 15 The Acer Aspire VX 15, just like the Dell Inspiron is a 15-inch gaming laptop with a radically designed chassis. The combination of black, red, and silver gives it a very authoritative look when it comes to gaming. It has almost the same specifications as the Dell Inspiron apart from the graphics card installed. Instead of the Ti version, it has the standard NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics card. However, to compensate for the minor difference, the on-board graphics memory is twice as much, 4GB, than the Dell Inspiron. The Acer Aspire VX 15 has the same size and display resolution as the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. However, it is a bit more expensive at $918. Acer Aspire VX 15 (via acer.com) HP Omen 15t While the HP Omen 15t may look somewhat lacking when it comes to graphics, it compensates with CPU instead. This HP gaming laptop is equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 2GB of RAM. Fortunately, the processor is an i7-7700HQ running at 2.8GHz. It has the same amount of RAM, 8GB. However, storage wise, it has a standard 1TB platter running at 7,200 RPM. The HP Omen 15t is priced at $899. HP Omen 15t (via store.hp.com) Alienware 13 In all honesty, the Alienware 13 could be considered as the runt of the litter when it comes to the list so far. This 13-inch laptop has a display resolution of 1366×768, very much inferior from the ones listed earlier. What is worse, it is quite difficult to justify the $999 price tag when compared to the likes of Acer and HP. However, for those who are partial with the brand, perhaps the Alienware 13 is not such a bad gaming laptop. In terms of specs, the Alienware has an Intel i5-7300HQ and NVIDIA GTX 1050 with 2GB of RAM. RAM is set to 8GB while the SSD storage is only at 180GB. Alienware 13 (via dell.com) Origin EON15-S Origin is undoubtedly a newcomer when it comes to gaming laptops. However, since last year, it has made quite a headway when it comes to performance gaming. Its latest iteration, the Origin EON15-S boasts an Intel i7-7700HQ and an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of RAM. Unfortunately, it would seem that the cheaper version will be equipped with an i5-7300HQ instead. On the other hand, the Origin EON15-S comes with a wide range of available upgrades. These upgrades include various types of RAM, storage, as well as a number of different processor SKUs. The base configuration is priced at $999. Origin EON15-S (via originpc.com) Asus Strix GL553VD One might argue that the Asus Strix GL553VD does not belong in the list of gaming laptops under $1,000. This is due to the fact that the original price for it is at $1,099, slight above the limit. However, Asus was kind enough to slash $100 off the original price thereby making it fit the bill on our list. The Asus Strix GL553VD is equipped with an i7-7700HQ and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 4GB of RAM. System memory is at a whopping 16GB, the biggest in the list so far. However, storage is a 1TB spinning platter rated at 7,200 RPM. As mentioned, the Asus Strix GL553VD is now priced at $999. Asus Strix GL553VD (via store.asus.com) Choosing between these gaming laptops can be one of the toughest decisions one can make. However, in terms of performance-to-cost ratio, the HP Omen 15t is a good bet. Meanwhile, the Acer Aspire VX 15 comes at a close second. For anyone looking for massive performance gains, the Asus Strix GL553VD is a good choice, but battery life is a bit of a pain. On the other hand, the newest gaming laptop is the Origin EON15-S. The design is quite good as well as the build quality. Performance is also top-notch, and if you are not satisfied with the base performance, it also comes with a number of upgrades. Finally, there’s the Alienware 13. While not really that spectacular in terms of specs, it still is pretty decent. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The IDF is a twice-a-year event from Intel, one hosted in China, and another in the US. Normally, Intel would use the event to showcase its up-and-coming technology and products. Now, its seems like the CPU maker is shaking things up in terms of its product announcements. Previously, Intel has used the Intel Developer Forum to introduce is newer line of products. From the Optane storage to the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, the event has served a number of purposes. This is why it comes as a shock for anyone expecting to go the upcoming IDF 2017, as it will no longer happen. In addition to the San Francisco leg of the event, Intel has also announced that it will no longer host the IDF in China. Nevertheless, supporters and developers can still expect an event from Intel sometime this year. Image from IDF 2016 (via intel.com) In recent years, Intel’s product roadmap has been experiencing some serious delays. While the company still strives to push for new product releases, it still finds itself between a rock and a hard place when it comes to actual release dates. To those who are unaware, the current Kaby Lake processors were already delayed in launch as well as official release. This has affected device manufacturers like Apple and Microsoft in coming up with a new product. This is also the reason why the current MacBook Pro and Surface Book iterations are still on Skylake architecture. According to Intel’s website, It would seem that the yearly event is no longer suitable for its products. The delays on its new processor products did not help in carrying out consumer expectations at all. Furthermore, Intel has more things to worry about now that AMD is once again back in business.

Here’s why.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Advertisement Intel is officially canceling its Intel Developer Forum, or IDF — an annual gathering of tech enthusiasts eager to hear what Intel is cooking up. IDF began in 1997 as a wee event, nothing too sophisticated and grand, in Palm Springs, California. Over the years, the show acquired a larger following, owing in part to the boom in the PC market. Its expansion eventually propelled it to move to San Francisco, with the event increasingly accruing more sophistication and significance over time. Why Is Intel Canceling Its Annual Developer Forum? The cancelation, though a bit of a gut-punch for developers looking forward to it every year, paves the way for a more targeted series of events that's more evolved and specific. Speaking to AnandTech, an Intel spokesperson said the move signals Intel's expansion into other markets, ventures: it's no longer exclusively a PC staple with its chips because it's also moving toward other technologies, such as virtual reality, for instance. "Intel has been transforming from a PC company and becoming much more diversified — we are in AI, 5G, autonomous driving," Agnes Kwan, an Intel spokesperson, told the Silicon Valley Business Journal. "The scope has really grown. As our business evolves, we need to reach new audiences and use different ways to reach them." A Focus On Targeted Messages To that end, big annual one-offs are no longer efficient for Intel in the efforts to spread its messages. Instead, as an attempt to communicate its technologies more effectively, it'll rely on more specific niche events that cater to specific audiences, such as those more keen on a particular category of devices or a specific Intel enterprise. "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward," reads the official announcement. This way, Intel can transition from compacting all the news it needs to share in one big event into parsing, dividing, and distributing its messages to the people who'll most likely listen. It also helps Intel introduce products at any point of the year of its choosing instead of collating a few announcements, which runs the risk of a relatively "thin" event. This is because Intel's announcements and unveilings are less frequent than, say, Apple's. So scattered events would be more fitting for its overall schedule, since often there's just nothing new to announce. It's worth noting that Intel's IDF is a major component of its ability to unveil developments in a grand way, so the impact of canceling it is hard to determine, especially if it has yet to share very detailed plans on how replacement events will be handled moving forward. Needless to say that you should expect to hear Intel news moving forward. Instead of an array of news hitting you all at once, Intel will more economically slice the bulk as it sees fit, or at least that's the concept Intel is implying with its statement. All told, the decision to nix IDF is not much of a shocker, since it closely mimics an increasing Silicon Valley trend where heavyweights such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft have steered away from one-off events toward divided affairs that involve unveilings and showcases of a particular product. IDF has been Intel's home for high-profile announcements, ranging from CPUs, storage products, and networking fabrics. Do you frequent Intel's annual IDF events? Troubled by its cancelation?

Supplier TI Computers www.ticomputers.com.au Price $2420 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel i7 7700K @ 4.8GHz • Asus Strix 8G Geforce GTX1070 • Asus Strix Z270H Gaming • Noctua D15 Cooler • 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 Kingston RAM • 250GB Samsung 960 EVO SSD • 2TB Seagate 7200rpm HDD • Cooler Master MasterBox5 Case • 750W Cooler Master Modular PSU • 22 x DVDRW Burner Tweet Email this Print this Feedback 5GHz and 700fps? Yes please! With Intel’s 7th generation CPUs and accompanying Z270 motherboard chipsets making their way onto the market, this new offering from TI Computers is indicative of the new standard for gaming PCs. Before we talk about the innards let’s briefly look at the outside. The chassis has a nice large side window for looking in at the glowing RGB-lit graphics card. Interestingly, three-quarters of the front facia acts as a dust filter and is easily removed with one hand without needing to tilt the chassis at all. Behind this filter is a single 120mm intake fan. Up top there’s a giant 170mm² vented area with screw holes for fans, although none are fitted due to the bulk of the HSF. Out the back there’s a 120mm exhaust fan, and down the bottom there’s a removable PSU dust filter. Heading inside, the system is based around Intel’s new Z270 platform, which for the first time gets a trick previously reserved for the X99 platform: dual M.2 slots! Only one is occupied here leaving room for expansion. The included M.2 SSD is one of the heroes of this build; Samsung’s latest TLC based 256GB 960 EVO, which - unlike the Pro models - is cheap enough to get you onto the luxurious NVMe bandwagon with thousands of MB/s transfer rates rather than just hundreds. And does it show! Booting is near instant, with programs and games loading at ludicrous speeds too. The other hero in this system is the CPU, Intel’s i7 7700K, which is effectively just the 6700K with a 200-300MHz speed boost providing 4.2GHz base and 4.5GHz turbo clocks at stock. But this wasn’t enough for the folks at TI Computers and each one of these PCs gets a custom overclock to suit what each individual 7700K can handle (as each CPU’s capabilities can vary). In our case, it came clocked at 4.9GHz (for two-core loads) or 4.8GHz (for four-core loads) using a little under 1.3 volts, which is respectable indeed. During the entire time we had this system the overclock was solid and the system remained very cool and quiet. The only issue detected was with a tool we use for stress testing called y-crunche,r which is very sensitive and can easily show CPU overclock instabilities, which it did in this case. Dropping the overclock 100MHz or upping the core voltage easily fixed this rather minor issue though. Speaking of upping voltages, to see just how far the CPU had been pushed from the shop we ramped up the voltage and started increasing the multiplier even further. It turns out the CPU was basically maxed out already as we could only squeeze a further 200-300MHz extra before becoming extremely unstable at 5.2GHz. So, given the extra juice required to get there the overclock from the shop was good, but 5GHz would’ve been nice to see and easily achievable. Sticking with the overclocking theme, the GTX 1070 graphics card comes with a 180MHz overclock from the factory. Using Asus’s overclocking utility and setting everything to maximum (+20% power, +91MHz core and +480MHz memory speeds) the card handled it like a champ and thanks to Nvidia’s Boost 3.0 technology pushed the clocks higher still to a surprising 2126MHz (266MHz above factory clocks) while remaining extremely quiet thanks to its custom triple fan cooler design, which never exceeded 70°C, boosting our fps in general by a further 5%. The graphics card also has a zero RPM ability, which stops its fans when idling, further reducing noise. The only problem with the card we found was some coil whine when pumping out more than 300fps (up to 700fps even) in the 3DMark Cloud Gate benchmark, but it was still quiet enough that that regular audio from games would easily drown it out. As we’re talking about benchmarks let’s talk about how this machine performs. We tested it in the pre-overclocked state it was given to us in, as well as with the CPU at 5.1GHz and the GPU at the maximum supported. Running PCMark 8’s Home conventional benchmark it scored 4825 points and 4850 with our custom overclock. In 3DMark Cloud Gate (DX11) it scored 37068 points and 38448 with our custom OC. In 3DMark Time Spy (DX12) it achieved 6169 points and 6473 with our custom OC. Some solid scores indicating this system would handle any 1440p gaming with ease. For a pre-overclocked system to be this quiet, is astounding, and is a testament to a well thought out build that delivers on all fronts.

Stewart Mitchell investigates whether this is indicative of a longer-term slump. When Intel released its seventh-generation Core processor range in January, many were left unimpressed by the performance of its top-end desktop processors. Kaby Lake, Intel’s codename for the range, provided a significant boost for mobile devices, but the desktop risks being left to fester, despite Intel’s assurances to the contrary and the re-emergence of AMD as a force in the CPU market.  “We know performance matters,” said Intel’s client computing vice president, Navin Shenoy, talking about the latest generation of chips. “It’s why we continue to focus on improved performance, delivering double-digit productivity performance increases – up to 20% for performance and gaming notebooks and 25% for desktops.” Yet most third-party benchmarks published to date have found that the high-end processors are not significantly faster than existing CPUs, especially if those sixth-generation parts were overclocked. While Intel has increased the clock frequency of processors with Kaby Lake, there are minimal architectural changes and many of the performance improvements on chips using the company’s 14nm technology rely on optimising specific tasks, such as video decoding and memory management. “Looking at the core CPU benchmarks, Kaby Lake doesn’t really provide much of a noticeable performance enhancement over [its predecessor] Skylake,” said Mark Hung, an Intel specialist at research firm Gartner. “Given the slowdown in Moore’s law, Intel decided to make a third generation [of 14nm chips] by making further architectural refinement. A lot of the improvements were made with Skylake, so there wasn’t much room to make further optimisation.”  When PC & Tech Authority queried the discrepancy between Intel’s 25% performance increase claim and external benchmarks, the company contested reports that performance improvements were minimal, but appeared to backtrack on the scale of the gains on offer. “Intel’s 7th Gen Core family is expected to provide high single-digit gains on productivity performance,” the company said in a statement, while pointing out that there were bigger improvements in specific areas such as 4K video.  “Seventh-gen Intel Core processor graphics deliver additional 3D graphics performance, driven by process and architecture improvements, when compared to sixth-gen Intel Core processor graphics. These improvements range into double-digit increases,” the company added. Holding fire? Has Intel lost interest in the niche desktop, or is it simply biding its time until it can perfect the Cannonlake 10nm process due at the end of the year? At least part of this bottleneck in desktop performance is due to the increasing difficulty of “obeying” Moore’s Law, and, according to analysts, Intel has tried to squeeze more from the 14nm production process and left itself little headroom for improvement.  Historically, the company has worked on a “tick-tock” cycle, where the firm moves to a new process one year and then refines that process the year after. For example, Ivy Bridge in 2012 saw chip production move to a 22nm process, which was the tick, and a year later the company improved the performance with the Haswell architecture, the tock. Then Intel moved on to the 14nm process.  “Haswell was a great desktop product in many respects, and then things started to change when Intel moved to 14nm,” said David Kanter, an analyst with the Linley Group research company. “The process was more geared to improving low power operation instead of maxing out peak performance. “The 14nm process that brought us Broadwell really did great things for mobile, and it was pretty good for servers, but the high-end desktop wasn’t super impressive.” Skylake followed in the traditional “tock” cycle, but the benefits were less pronounced than earlier revisions, and Kanter believes the company ran out of headroom when it needed to release another upgrade on the same production process. “It’s the third generation, and the problem is that Intel’s planning cycles are long and it didn’t have the option to redesign the CPU and make it faster because of the development cycles,” he said.  Diverted focus While technical issues have played a part in the arrested development of top-end desktop chips, there are good reasons why Intel has chosen to focus on other areas of its business.  Research figures for 2016 released by research companies IDC and Gartner both highlighted that PC sales had shrunk for the fifth year in a row, and within this dwindling market, laptops continue to far outsell desktops. That’s reflected in the improvements made to the processors. “If you look at client PCs, really the vast majority of them are laptops, and there the design considerations are very different,” said Hung. “Power efficiency and video-encoding performance are much more important than raw CPU performance.” Kanter agrees that Intel is merely following the money trail. “For consumers, the high-end desktop chip is still between $400 and $1,000 and that’s probably going to stay the same,” said Kanter. “Gamers will pay that, but the issue is how often do they upgrade and how much are they going to spend on their CPU? “Intel is a tech powerhouse, but it’s also focused on the bottom line. The data centre market is more lucrative than the high-end gaming market.” One-horse race Another reason Intel hasn’t been pushing the performance barriers is that it doesn’t have to: there’s no credible competitor forcing the company to up its game. Intel’s biggest rival, AMD, has lately switched its focus to GPUs – although it is set to challenge Intel on the desktop once more with its Ryzen chips later this year. Experts say that Intel has effectively been competing with itself for a number of years. “If Intel can produce something that’s really amazing and all of a sudden PC buyers want to upgrade every three years instead of every five, that moves the whole market, and that’s more important to Intel than what AMD is doing,” said Kanter. And despite promising early benchmark results from Ryzen, AMD is not expected to challenge Intel on high-end performance. “The world is waiting to see what frequencies the Ryzen gets, because if AMD can come in with a noticeably better frequency and better per-core performance that would be really surprising,” said Kanter.  “My expectation is that it will come in with something that looks roughly competitive with Ivy Bridge or Haswell, so maybe 20% behind, and at a competitive price – although AMD has been keeping its cards close to its chest.”  Either way, analysts believe that Intel will remain the dominant presence on the desktop for some time. “The desktop market is still significant and it’s important to Intel because it’s a very high-margin business and there will be some high-performance features,” said Hung. “I don’t see Intel stepping away from desktops in the near future.”  Related Articles MacOS Beta code points to new Kaby Lake models Review: Intel 600p SSD 512GB Intel shelves its Developer Forum after 20 years Intel's Optane aims to give hard drives the speed of SSDs Alien Covenant teaser reveals possible AMD Ryzen-powered Surface Pro 5 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  david kanter  |  intel  |  kaby lake  |  performance  |  processors   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Project Cars 2 will have new Rallycross content     How to: Expand your PS4 storage space with an external hard drive     Hands-on: Nintendo Switch is the console you’ve been waiting for     Essential software tools for superior overclocking     First AMD Ryzen benchmarks appear   More in Atomic (1 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: Asus ROG GR8 II gaming PC << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Unigine ships graphics benchmark with 8K, VR support << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (3 of 10 articles) NEWS Palit's new GTX 1080 Ti GameRock video card goes quad-fan << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (4 of 10 articles) FEATURE Stop the clocks: has Intel run dry on the desktop? << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (5 of 10 articles) NEWS New Android OS blocks ransomware using system-type windows << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (6 of 10 articles) NEWS Ryzen 3 processor specs leak online << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (7 of 10 articles) NEWS AMD's Radeon 5-series cards pop up online << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (8 of 10 articles) NEWS New AMD Radeon drivers boost Oculus and SteamVR support << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (9 of 10 articles) NEWS MSI doubles down on RGB lighting with Mystic Light Sync << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (10 of 10 articles) REVIEW One Minute Review: Asus ROG Spatha gaming mouse << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest Competitions   Win!!!

Introduction, value and design 2. Performance, battery life and verdict Our Verdict Between the screen that bounces with each touch and a housing that feels hollow, the price tag doesn’t match the build quality of the LG gram 13 despite its incredible battery life. For Fantastic battery life Fast fingerprint sensor Thin screen bezels Against Weird fingerprint sensor placement Awkward camera placement Build quality doesn’t match price With portable and powerful laptops priced below the psychological barrier of $1,000 now somewhat of a commodity, the premium segment is one where a device has to live up to its price tag. Typically, manufacturers set themselves apart from the pack with design, and unique features (fingerprint unlock, excellent battery life, etc.).  The LG gram 13 we reviewed costs much less than Apple’s 12-inch MacBook and comparably to Dell’s XPS 13. On the spec sheet, the gram 13 is more similar to Dell’s offering than Apple’s MacBook, having far fewer ports and a different class of processor (Intel Core i5 for LG vs. Intel Core m5 for Apple). That said, we find that the LG gram 13 struggles to live up to that four-digit price point, especially when stacked against comparably-priced Ultrabooks. Spec Sheet Here is the LG gram 13 configuration sent to TechRadar for review:  CPU: 2.5GHz Intel Core i5 -7200U (3MB cache, up to 3.1GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2133MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS LCD touchscreen Storage: 256GB SSD Ports: HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0, USB 3.0 Type-C, microSD reader, headphone/mic jack Connectivity: Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8265; Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 1.3 megapixel camera Weight: 2.07 pounds (921g) Size: 12.1 x 8.3 x 0.6 inches (307 x 211 x 15cm; W x D x H) Price, availability and value LG currently sells two variations of the LG gram 13. One version  – the version we received – has a touchscreen, while the other variant comes in white and lacks a touchscreen and fingerprint sensor. The touchscreen version costs $1,099 (about £885, AU$1,465), with the touch-free model discounted to $999 (about £804, AU$1331).  We were unable to find any models with improved specs or the option to personalize the LG gram 13’s internals.  Furthermore, out of the US, UK, and AU LG web stores, the LG gram 13 was only listed in the US store. The good news is that LG uses third-party sites, such as Amazon or B&H Photo to fulfill orders of the gram 13. In other words, if you live in a country where LG doesn’t expressly offer the gram 13, you can try to order through another seller.  As for whether you should, well, we’ve found comparably-priced laptops with far stronger build quality (but not better battery life) than what’s on display here – we’ll just say that for now. Design LG touts that the exterior of the gram 13 as made of a “nano carbon magnesium alloy;” a metal compound that feels more like plastic than the aluminum shell competing higher-end laptops typically use, but also tends to be lighter. With the lid closed, the gram 13 measures a mere 0.6 inches (15.24 mm) tall at its thickest point. On the right side of the laptop is where you find a microSD card reader, headphone/mic jack, and a USB 3.0 port.  The left side of the laptop is home to the charging port, another USB 3.0 port, a full HDMI port, and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. Additionally, this is where you can find two indicator lights – one a charging indicator, the other a hard drive activity light.  With the lid open, the first thing you’ll notice is a black rectangle in the upper-left corner of the trackpad. Admittedly, at first we thought the rectangle was yet another sticker – such as the “Powered by Intel” decal or Energy Star assurances – we would have to remove. After a few seconds, however, we quickly realized it was the fingerprint sensor. It’s an odd place for one, considering you’re not likely to scan your finger as often as you’ll use the tracking surface for everything else. It doesn’t get in the way, per se, but we found ourselves ignoring the upper left portion of the trackpad altogether.  Just above the keyboard, lodged into the laptop hinge, is a 1.3-megapixel webcam, relocated from the more traditional location of above the display. By moving the camera down, LG was able to use smaller bezels to on the sides and top of the screen. The same, unfortunately, can’t be said about the bezel below the screen.   In total, the gram 13 weighs 2.07 pounds – or 939 grams, if you were curious. It’s incredibly light and doesn’t bog down a backpack as you trek from meeting to meeting or class to class. In comparison, Apple’s MacBook weighs 2.03 pounds (921 grams), while Dell’s XPS 13 weighs 2.7 pounds (1,225 grams).   Fingerprint ID is a fine bonus Setup and use of the gram 13’s fingerprint sensor is similar to that of any modern smartphone with a similar feature – in fact, it closely resembles the process LG uses on its flagship smartphones.  After touching, lifting, and replacing your finger on the sensor, the gram 13 learns your fingerprint and uses Windows Hello to unlock your computer with a touch, instead of a password.  Windows Hello is a convenient way to streamline the login experience, either when switching user accounts or signing in after the gram 13 has been turned off.  We didn’t have any issues with the scanner recognizing a finger, with very little time elapsed between a touch of the fingerprint sensor and the computer unlocking. Muffled speaker placement One design choice we have to question is the location of the stereo speakers on the gram 13. Each speaker is located on either side of the device, with two nondescript ports barely noticeable.  During our testing, the speakers were often muffled or inadvertently covered up when using the gram 13 on a lap, or even by placing an arm next to the side of the unit.  Even when the speaker ports are left unblocked, the sound quality and volume is rather weak and quiet. Listening to music often required a volume setting of 70 or higher just to hear at a comfortable level. 1 2 Current page: Introduction, value and design Next Page Performance, battery life and verdict Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Intel IDF is No More Posted on April 18, 2017 by Gil Russell - Business, Chips, Cloud Computing, Desktops, Events, Laptops, Mobile, News, Servers Intel has decided to end its annual Intel Developer Forum, including IDF 17 expected in August this year. Intel posted the following on its webpage; “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” Intel announced earlier that it would not be sponsoring an IDF event in China this year. It was still expected in the US with a “new format”.  Prior to today’s announcement, Intel’s IDF page stated: “We are making changes to the Intel Developer Forum. This fall the event in San Francisco will have a new format and we will not be hosting an event in China. More details to come soon.” It added to “keep checking this page in the middle of March for updates”.  No update was made in the middle of March, in fact, “keep checking this page” disappeared with today’s announcement permanently cancelling IDF. IDF was nearly 20 years old and had its origins in the early 1990s as a quarterly update as a service to its PC customers run by sales staff until 1995 when Intel Corporate decided to pick up the venue as an annual industry wide event. Intel’s business has grown into separate and distinct segments whose management felt that IDF no longer served them as a direct means of communicating their message. The rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, automotive, IoT, and wireless communications diminished the delivery of any direct message emanating from any one group. Intel is now deciding how to find new ways of disseminating information to their respective audiences (media, developers and customers). How the company works through this process is still to be determined. TechEye Take The fact that Intel’s Data Center Group was not happy over the amount of support it provided to other disparate groups at Intel has been an open secret for a least the last couple of years. It is somewhat of a surprise that the separation did not occur sooner. Nevertheless, the fact remains that much of what made up IDF is considered to be necessary for the industry financial and strategic technology analysts to understand the company’s Data Center Group’s direction in the Enterprise and Cloud Market segments. But that’s Diane Bryant’s problem now. What is not clear is what Intel has planned to replace something that was working but not in all the right ways to satisfy certain marketing types in messaging their customers, their investors and the industry at large. Now the entire world+dog is left in the lurch of the wonder gap of what will happen next…, Tags: IDF 17, IDF 2017, IDF Cancelled, intel, Intel Devleopler Forum Search for: Recent Articles How Turkish trolls tried to kill movie Turkish genocide film 'The Promise' was nearly killed off by a Turkish news board determined to wipe[...] Vacuum outfits suck on Roomba law suit IRobot, the maker of the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, is suing its rivals for nicking its patented[...] Google opens up Android in Russia Google will open up Android  to Russian rival search engines as part of a deal to settle a two year [...] Another buyer is kicking Toshiba’s tyres The state-backed fund Innovation Network of Japan is looking at the auction of Toshiba’s chip unit.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Bben unveils Apollo Lake-powered PC stick 04/14/2017 at 11:25 AM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Chinese device maker Bben unveiled a line of tiny computers with Intel Apollo Lake processors at CES in January. This week the company is going even smaller. Notebook Italia caught up with Bben at the Hong Kong Global Sources Exhibition and got an early look at a new PC stick featuring an Intel Celeron N3450 quad-core processor. The PC-on-a-stick has the same basic design as an Intel Compute Stick, with an HDMI connector built into one end of the miniature computer, allowing you to plug the whole thing straight into the HDMI input on a TV or monitor. This model does appear to be a bit on the chunky side for a PC stick, but it’s still a a fully functional computer in a pocket-sized package. It has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, a headset jack, and a dedicated power jack (unlike some models, this PC stick doesn’t use a USB cable for power). There are also two vents on the back of the device to help keep the system from overheating, and there’s a small fan inside the case. Intel’s N3450 processor is a 1.1 GHz quad-core chip with support for burst speeds up to 2.2 GHz. It has a 6 watt TDP, but should use less power under most circumstances, making it compact, low-power option for turning just about any display into a media center or adding a web browser to your TV. I suppose you could also do some light gaming too, but the Apollo Lake platform is a low-cost, low-power solution, so don’t expect stellar performance on games with bleeding edge graphics. This sort of PC stick could also be useful in commercial environments, where it can be combined with a variety of displays to create digital signage, point-of-sales, or other commercial or enterprise solutions. Intel currently has no plans to offer a Compute Stick with an Apollo Lake chip. The company’s latest models either feature a lower-power Atom x5 Cherry Trail chip or a more powerful Core M Skylake processor. So it’s up to third-party companies like Bben to offer something in between, like this Celeron-powered model the company is showing off. It’s not available for purchase yet, but some of the company’s other Apollo Lake-powered products are available from the Bben store at AliExpress.

That makes it too expensive for the form factor because most people would go for a cheap i3 laptop or nuc/brix option.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Federal Appeals Court Upheld a Jury Verdict for Apple in a case brought by Conversant | Main | Apple to Release Two New iMacs in Q3 and is Testing a Third Model that's a Server-Grade iMac for Late Q4 » April 17, 2017 End of an Era: The Intel Developer Forum (IDF) is Officially Dead   Intel has officially announced the end of their IDF events that covered PC developments that were in the works at Intel. It was an event I rarely ever missed; though admittedly, the IDF events did seem to be a little lost over the last few years and I had stopped covering the event for a lack of real news. In January Patently Apple killed off the "Intel Events" category from our side bar. And yet, it still seems like a loss to officially hear Intel's announcement today. Just as PC's were about to be revived with Apple's modular Mac and Microsoft's new Surface Studio, the company at the epicenter of the PC revolution is admitting that it's no longer a priority.      Intel's announcement states that "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions."   Intel's IDF event that was scheduled for August 15-17 at the Moscone center is now cancelled.   Intel's product focus is moving toward Artificial Intelligence, Smart vehicles, Optane products, the Internet of Things (IoT), communications and so forth. New forms of events will be created and hopefully there will be at least one PC oriented event in the mix. But for now, Intel wants to drop the IDF events so that they can reinvent a new image for the company with emphasis beyond PCs.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Luckily one exists, and all the digging around the dll files has already been done for you. Apparently a March 16 update includes the following line in the changelog: Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update. Github user Zeffy has come up with a few solutions for you, and has documented his whole cyber-sleuthing process. If you want to skip straight to the patches which fix the issue, head here. Zeffy recommends you create a system restore point before beginning. But all the information is included on how these fixes came to be, so you can also try doing them yourself — either because something went wrong, or for education, or for fun. These fixes aren't for novice computer users, but I'll try to include some extra information to bring the skill requirements for this down a notch. The first (as well as easiest & best) method applies to Windows 7 x64 users: Patch wuaueng.dll and change dword_600002EE948 (see this line) which is at file offset 0x26C948, from 0x01 to 0x00. This makes IsDeviceServiceable(void) jump over its entire body and return 1 (supported CPU) immediately. This is my preferred method. Note: these offsets are only for the Windows 7 x64 version. To edit these dll files, you'll need a decompiler like ILSpy, .NET Reflector, or dotPeek. Then you'll have to use a program such as Visual Studio to edit the code. For more information on these tasks, check out the Wikihow. The second method is below: Patch wuaueng.dll and nop out all the instructions highlighted here in IsDeviceServiceable(void), this will enable the usage of the ForceUnsupportedCPU of type REG_DWORD under the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Test\Scan (you will most likely have to create this registry key). Set this value to 0x00000001 to force unsupported CPUs, and back to 0x00000000 to change the behaviour back to default. You will probably need to restart your PC or restart the wuauserv service in order for changes to apply. This behaviour is undocumented and could be removed in future updates.

Even though it would cost more to collect the GST than the tax would raise the government wants to kick start this exciting new initiative (not) on 1 July 2017.

Supplier Asus www.asus.com.au Price $2199 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel 7th Gen Core i7-7700 (quad-core, HyperThreading, 4.2GHz Turbo); GeForce GTX 1060; 16GB DDR4 memory; 256GB Samsung M.2 SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Mini-PCs are all the rage. We’ve been inundated with mini-PCs of late, with tiny towers packing SLI systems, shoeboxes that are VR ready, and now this relatively affordable PS4-sized package. We can thank both Intel and Nvidia for dropping the energy requirements – and resulting thermal output – of its products for this revolution in PC shrinkage. And yet, we still end up paying quite a lot more for a system that underperforms similarly priced, yet larger, PC gaming towers. The Asus ROG GR8 II is the perfect example of this quandary. With an interior capacity of just four litres, this PC is smaller than a Playstation 4. You might think that makes it the perfect PC to stash in your AV unit, but there’s a slight hitch. It can only be operated in an upright position. The entire cooling solution has been designed for the unit to be operated vertically, drawing in fresh cool air from the bottom, and expelling the hot air from the rear and top. Lay it down horizontally and that design goes out the window, yet even when vertical it’s a little loud, measuring 51dB during our sound test. It’s a shame, as the design is rather eye-catching, and would look lovely next to your amplifier.  Given the small size, we can’t expect a huge amount of I/O options. Adorning the front are twin USB 3.0 ports, along with the usual mic-in/headphone out jacks. Looking to the rear reveals twin USB 2.0, one USB 3.1 Type A and one USB 3.1 Type C; sadly the latter does not appear to support Thunderbolt as there’s no mention of it in the specs, where it would usually be called out in bright, bold letters. Video is handled courtesy of the custom Asus graphics card within, with twin HDMI 2.0b and a single DP1.4. Audio can be delivered via the rear over S/PDIF optical, or a single 3.5mm audio jack. Finally there’s a single Gigabit Ethernet connector, and Kensington lock, though why you’d need the lock in the environment this thing is going to live in seems a bit redundant.  As well as the standard Ethernet connector, full 802.11ac Wi-Fi is integrated, and it’s nice to see that it supports MIMO. However, it’s a rather basic 2x2 antennae setup, so don’t expect to make the most of your AC5300 router. However, this can be combined with the unit’s Ethernet via Asus’ interesting GameFirst IV technology. This teams all of your network connections to deliver maximum throughput, so you can combine both the wired and wireless connections. Looking inside the case reveals a box that doesn’t offer a lot of room for upgrades thanks to its crowded capacity. In fact, Asus has had to build a custom version of the graphics card to fit, which is based on Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. This has been paired with Intel’s high-end i7-7700 CPU, which seems a bit of an odd mix. This is basically one of Intel’s flagship CPUs, hitting a Boost speed of 4.2GHz across all four HyperThreaded cores. It’s a problem we’ve seen in other systems recently – combining a top-end CPU with a mid or lower end GPU. We’d have much preferred to see a slightly slower CPU such as the 7500 paired up with the much more powerful GeForce GTX 1070. Sure, the  price would jump by a couple of hundred dollars, but the performance would be significantly improved. 16GB of RAM is fine, but the long-term storage is a bit on the scarce side, with just a single 256GB Samsung M.2 drive. A spare 2.5-inch drive bay will accommodate a larger SSD or HDD, but you’re going to need to fork out for that yourself.  Given the price, it’d be easy to build a faster system in a full-sized case for the same price, but that’s not really applicable for those who don’t want to get their hands dirty. Still, we wish Asus had gone for a slightly more sensible CPU/GPU balancing act. Related Reviews Review: Corsair One Pro gaming PC Review: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti - single card 4k gaming!

Furthermore, the Cupertino company also acknowledges the fact that most users of the iMac are professionals. In line with this, Apple is revamping the all-in-one desktop computer to cater to professional users. According to Digitimes, Apple is already preparing the manufacturing of the iMac 2017. In a report posted yesterday, the website said that just like current generation iMac, the new iMacs will be manufactured by Quanta Computers starting on May 2017. Unfortunately, the report did not specify exactly how many units Apple ordered from Quanta Computer for the upcoming line of iMacs. Perhaps the most promising feature of the new iMac 2017 is the hardware focused on professional use. Last year, some reports suggested that the iMac could potentially sport an Intel Xeon processor instead of a normal desktop version. It seems like this will not be a reality, at least according to the Digitimes report. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) The report yesterday said that the iMac 2017 will sport the later Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor. At the moment, it is still unclear if it will support newer server-grade processors with more than four cores. However, one thing for sure is that the new iMac will finally support ECC type RAM. This will give the upcoming iMacs a more robust build as these memories have in-built error detection and correction. In addition to the Xeon processor and ECC memory, it looks like the iMac 2017 will be the first iMac to finally move to an entirely NVMe storage technology. For those who are unaware, the current generation iMacs still rely on spinning disk hard drives. However, it has an option to include a second NVMe drive on the iMac. This makes use of the Fusion technology from Apple. The new storage configuration will surely give the iMac 2017 an unprecedented increase in data throughput as NVMe storage is known for very fast read and write speeds. At the moment, it is still uncertain when the actual release of the new iMacs will be. But since Apple already said that they will come this year, once can only surmise that it will be between September and October; either on or after the launch of the iPhone 8.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Tech Roundup: QCOM Answers Apple, GOOGL Answers DoL, WDC Objects Shutterstock photo Last week saw Qualcomm QCOM filing counterclaims against Apple AAPL in their ongoing patent-related lawsuit, Alphabet GOOGL defending itself against gender inequality allegations by the Labor Department, Western Digital WDC objecting to Toshiba’s chip unit sale to Broadcom AVGO and much more. So let’s jump to the details- Qualcomm Replies to Apple In counterclaims filed in a California Federal court, Qualcomm has indicated that Apple is playing needlessly dirty in an attempt to keep costs down. The point of contention, as has often been in the past, is standard essential patents (SEPs), on the basis of which much of modern day telecommunications takes place. The companies that contributed technology to form the standard are required to license the technology to others on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. But what constitutes FRAND has been debated about a lot because companies offering this technology obviously want to be paid more, especially from companies like Apple that make super normal profits. While on the other hand, the companies that license want to point to all their other innovations built on top of the standards and argue that the standards are just a very small part of the end product and so don’t deserve a good price.  Qualcomm’s complaints are mainly about Apple failing to engage in good faith negotiations over its 3G and 4G patents while also seeking to use both these and its 5G technology at a fraction of the cost that other smartphone vendors are apparently willing to pay. „Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well-established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm” reads the complaint. It also says that Apple made „false statements” to the Korean FTC and encouraged Samsung to go after it to force Qualcomm to change its licensing model. The KFTC investigation ultimately led to an $865 million fine on Qualcomm. Note that Apple doesn’t use Qualcomm technology directly but through its manufacturing partners, which have licensing deals with Qualcomm, some going back to before Apple started using its technology. If Apple withholds payments to its partners they might hold out on payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm may be able to get its agreements enforced in court but it leads to unnecessary and wasteful litigation on multiple levels. This is exactly what Apple is doing according to Qualcomm. Qualcomm further says that Apple „acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets” and later falsely claimed that there was „no discernible difference.” Google’s Fight with the Labor Department The U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) has made a sweeping statement that it had „found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” and DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received „compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” In a detailed response to the allegation, Google’s VP of people operations, Eileen Naughton said that the claims had been made „without any supporting data or methodology.” She also explained the salary analysis system Google currently employs: „Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee’s new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings…The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees’ gender data. An employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale.” The model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers which is done to eliminate „statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation”. Naughton also said that Google’s methodology is available to other businesses if they want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay. This has been going on since Sep 2016, after which a case was filed in January, asking for its compensation data. Things came to a head after Google failed to comply with a routine audit. Western Digital Objects Toshiba is under pressure to sell its memory chip business after accounting irregularities related to its Westinghouse nuclear project put it into financial trouble. But Western Digital, which recently acquired SanDisk, is in a JV with Toshiba and has also invested billions of dollars in that business. WDC says that Toshiba didn’t have the legal right to split the chip business and it also deserves prior and confidential negotiating rights in case of its sale as a result of this agreement. It also objects to a sale to Broadcom, despite it being the highest bidder because of unsavory dealings with that company.

This was the 10 th straight quarter of PC shipment declines. Business PCs did better than consumer PCs as expected. The spoilers remain largely the same: shift to mobile devices and emerging markets, and a longer replacement cycle.

The BIS reportedly says that this phone will be different from international versions. Apple recently discounted the 4-inch phone to Rs. 19,999, which is expected to help it gain share in the mid-range market. Wistron-owned ICT Service Management Solutions, based in Yeshwantpur, Benguluru has been commissioned for the manufacturing. MKM Optimistic on Alibaba Cloud Growth : MKM analysts have issued a highly optimistic report about Alibaba’s BABA cloud business. They estimate that the business could be worth $20 billion today with the potential to grow to a $65-70 billion valuation over the next 4-5 years. The optimism is driven by data supplied by the analysts: 60K developers are working on the platform, AliCloud has 765K paying customers (up 100% year over year), it has 2.8 million total customers; after large enterprises, which use state-owned infrastructure, AliCloud is the largest private player with 70 of the largest 100 startups using its services. Also, Alibaba has been investing in the business for the past eight years, which is reportedly three years short of Amazon and four years longer than Alphabet’s Google. New Technology/Products AMD Ryzen 5 Release : AMD started selling its Zen-based Ryzen 5 processors (four core/eight thread and six core/twelve thread) into the channel some time back and now, these products are available to consumers. The processors reportedly compare well with Intel’s Kaby Lake-based i5 chips (four core/four thread) going by the considerable number of reviews comparing the two. As may be expected, Intel’s chip is more expensive when you consider the fact that it has fewer threads and cores, but single-core performance is better. On a net basis, while AMD still lags Intel slightly on performance, it’s packing in more compute power at lower costs that is likely to go down well with consumers. Gamers are the biggest drivers of consumer PC sales right now so both Intel and AMD have their work cut out.  Microsoft Tools for Hybrid Cloud Migration : Microsoft MSFT has come out with three new tools that in very broad terms, will help enterprises evaluate the savings generated from moving corporate workloads to Azure, the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit in the Azure Management Portal that can save them up to 40% on their Windows server licenses and Azure Site Recovery to facilitate the process of migrating virtual machines to Azure. Microsoft is en route to delivering annualized commercial cloud revenue of $20 billion by 2018 and its pace of growth indicates that the once unreal target is now within reach. Microsoft Launching Minecraft Marketplace : The Minecraft development team apparently can’t keep up with the demand for customizations and levels and so it’s getting on board independent developers that will supply these and other customizations through the in-game store. The good thing for developers is that Minecraft maker Mojang, now owned by Microsoft is willing to pay out 50% of what the creation generates, with 30% going to Apple, Google, or Microsoft’s app stores and itself retaining the rest. Minecraft is an insanely popular title, having sold 121 million copies worldwide, with 55 million unique monthly players (figures from Microsoft). As of now, nine businesses have been approved for selling feature packs with prices ranging from $1-10 per creation. Microsoft will sell Minecraft Coins that can be used to buy items.  Microsoft intends to eventually make the purchases sync across devices and platforms. Microsoft Ends Support for Vista : Microsoft has officially withdrawn support to its unsuccessful Windows Vista launched in 2009. While some people did buy systems based on the OS, most were dissatisfied and what’s more, Vista was the reason that most XP users simply refused to move on. All that is well behind us and both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have been received well. Microsoft says, Windows Vista users „will no longer receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft.” So that ends the matter. Google Home Services, Food Delivery App for India : Google has launched an app called Aero in Bengaluru and Mumbai, India that will allow people to connect with home service providers like plumbers, electricians and the like. It will also allow users to search for nearby restaurants and schedule food delivery. M&A and Collaborations Microsoft, eBay, Tencent Invest in India’s Flipkart : Microsoft, eBay and China’s Tencent joined earlier investors Naspers Group, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners and DST Global for a share in Flipkart, India’s largest ecommerce company. The three companies together invested $1.4 billion. Ebay sold its Indian operations to Flipkart and added $500 million for its share in the company. The company is now valued at $11.6 billion. Microsoft Buys Deis : Microsoft spent an undisclosed amount of money to buy San Francisco-based software startup Deis that was reportedly acquired by Engine Yard back in 2015. The startup has developed an open source tool based on the Kubernetes container management system that Google developed and then open sourced. Microsoft initially agreed to work with Google on Kubernetes back in 2014 but also backed competing platforms Mesos and Docker Swarm. But Kubernetes has gained ground so in February, Kubernetes became available on the Azure Container service as well. The reason this is all so significant is because containerization is extremely important for information stored in the cloud since it creates a virtual box of code that can be shared and moved between applications and across clouds as needed. „At Microsoft, we’ve seen explosive growth in both interest and deployment of containerized workloads on Azure, and we’re committed to ensuring Azure is the best place to run them,” Scott Guthrie, EVP cloud and enterprise group at Microsoft wrote in a blog post. Google to Invest In LG Display : South Korea’s Electronic Times has reported that Google has offered to pay LG Display up to $880 million (one trillion KRW) as its contribution toward a production line for flexible OLED panels for use in second-generation Pixel phones. LG is considering the offer. Google’s Pixel, which has the appearance and features of a premium device and has been marketed as such, will fall back in the race with Samsung and Apple on features if it doesn’t get some OLED screens of its own. So Google’s needs are clear: it also doesn’t need to get into a deal with Samsung, which uses OLED in its own phones and is also in an agreement to supply to Apple. So it’s trying to find another supplier.  Some Numbers Facebook Announces Monthly Advertisers : Facebook FB has announced that the number of advertisers on its platform has grown from 4 million to 5 million between September and now. Businesses with mobile pages now total 65 million while businesses with Instagram profiles are up to 8 million. Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail. Unsurprisingly, around 75% percent of advertisers are in its fastest-growing markets, which are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Nearly 50% of advertisers create ads on mobile devices. Facebook Messenger Users : Facebook Messenger, which the company spun out in 2014 and then enhanced with games, a chat bot platform, voice calling, video calling, as well as a revamped camera with masks, frames, stickers and effects now has 1.2 million users. That’s up from 700 million users when it was spun out and 600 million users on the hot Facebook-owned platform Instagram. Sell These Stocks.

The fourth annual event will also showcase the latest developments and research in telecommunications, machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things (IoT). The invitation-only summit, at New York University'sTandon School of Engineering, is jointly organized by NYU WIRELESS and Nokia, and the IEEE Communications Society will broadcast the proceedings. The event features international thought and research leaders from Nokia, Verizon, National Instruments, Intel, Qualcomm, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and others.  "With nearly every major carrier launching 5G wireless field trials this year, this is a watershed moment in the next telecommunications revolution," said Theodore (Ted) S. Rappaport, the Ernst Weber/David Lee professor of electrical engineering at NYU Tandon and founding director of NYU WIRELESS. In recent months major carriers, including Verizon and AT&T, announced trials in nearly a dozen cities for both mid-band and the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bandwidth for which Rappaport and NYU WIRELESS conducted seminal research. Government and industry bodies such as the FCC, 3 [rd] Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU) have also recently set new benchmarks aimed at taking mobile data speeds to new limits. "Behind the blistering pace of research and development of technology — from microchips with phased-array antennas to vehicle-to-vehicle communications in self-driving cars — is the expectation that ultra-fast connectivity delivering huge data rates is just around the corner," said Rappaport. "NYU WIRELESS' industrial affiliate sponsors, including Nokia, AT&T, Qualcomm, Straight Path Communications, and Verizon are fulfilling those expectations, and NYU WIRELESS is pleased to play a key role as well, with breakthrough research proving that mmWave transmissions can deliver 5G in many more settings than anticipated." A report from Nokia Bell Labs Consulting predicts that by 2020, global demand for digital content and services on mobile and portable devices will increase 30 to 45 times from 2014 levels. The study estimates that there will be over 46 billion Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices by 2020, with audio and video streaming accounting for 79 percent of the total increased consumption. NYU WIRELESS, which conducted the world's first radio channel measurements proving that the mmWave spectrum holds vast potential to improve wireless communications, was one of only two academic institutions recently chosen by the FCC to help test, debug, and provide feedback on a new web-based portal that lets researchers apply for the program experimental license, a new paradigm that will reduce barriers to experimentation for universities, research laboratories, health care institutions, and manufacturers. NYU WIRELESS is also the first to receive a program experimental license. Summit Highlights Driven by this year's theme, "How Close is 5G to Commercial Reality," the Brooklyn 5G Summit will focus on end-to-end system design, regulations and pre-commercial systems. In addition, the conference will address various use cases for 5G in the evolving IoT space by inviting selected start-up companies to share their work. Presentations by industry leaders will include Theodore (Tod) Sizer, vice president of mobile radio research at Nokia; Durga Malladi, senior vice president of Qualcomm; Seizo Onoe, chief technical officer of the prominent Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo; Ken Steward, senior fellow at Intel; Gaurav Bansal, senior researcher at the Toyota InfoTechology Center; and HongBeom Jeon, executive vice president of KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom), which will introduce 5G to the Olympics at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Many of the industry affiliate sponsors of NYU WIRELESS are testing breakthrough 5G systems and platforms. Several will demonstrate prototypes and explain their advances. NYU WIRELESS will demonstrate: Groundbreaking research on 5G transmission in the mmWave spectrum, promising up to 40 times today's data transmission rates The latest tools for designing 5G systems, including its widely used NYUSIM open-source channel software simulator (with over 7,000 downloads to date) A new real-time network emulation tool for evaluating virtual reality and other applications over realistic mmWave channels A phased-array antenna system for measuring mmWave directional channel dynamics A new dual architecture channel sounder with 2 GHz RF bandwidth throughout the mmWave spectrum, and a channel sounder on a chip To watch the live stream April 19-21, register at https://register.comsoc.org/brooklyn-5g-summit-2017.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Cloudera Inc., a data-software company, faces a cut in its $4.1 billion private valuation as it heads toward an initial public offering. The Palo Alto-based company set a price range Monday of $12 to $14 a share, which would give it a market capitalization of $1.79 billion at the high end of its range. The company was last valued at $4.1 billion in a 2014 investment round, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company, which uses open-source software called Hadoop to analyze large amounts of data, plans to sell 15 million shares to raise up to $242 million. It has granted underwriters the option to buy up to 2.25 million additional shares of stock. Cloudera CLDR, +0.00%  has been approved to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CLDR. The filing was previously listed under the name “Project Thunder.” Don’t miss: The IPO market is back, baby! Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Allen & Company LLC are the lead underwriters on the offering. Here are four things to know about the company: Losing less money as revenue grows Cloudera recorded revenue of $261 million for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2017, up from $166 million in the year-earlier period. The company pared its net losses between the two years, with a net loss of $187.3 million in 2016 compared with a net loss of $203.1 million in 2017. Think you would win an argument with a robot? Watch this.(1:46) Osaka University and NTT Laboratories recently created the first "discussion dialogue" androids - the only robots that have human-like independent cognitive abilities, as opposed to scripted speech. The net losses for both years include $63.6 million in 2016 and $21.7 million in 2017 of stock-based compensation. The 2017 loss also includes a noncash charge of $21.6 million related to the company’s donation of common stock to the Cloudera Foundation, a nonprofit arm. The down round In its last private funding round, in May 2014, Intel Corp. INTC, +0.80%  paid $30.92 per share for 11.99 million shares, more than double the high-end of Cloudera’s expected public price range. The last funding round was at a valuation of $4.1 billion, while Cloudera’s market capitalization, based on shares outstanding, would be $1.79 billion at most. Rohit Kulkarni, head of research at SharesPost, points to the declining share price of HortonWorks Inc. HDP, -0.37%  , one of Cloudera’s competitors, as rationale for the down round. HortonWorks, which is also a big data software company that focuses on Hadoop (hence the ticker symbol HDP), went public in December 2014 and has seen its share price decline about 60%. The declining valuation also points to the larger disconnect between private market and public market valuations, said Lev Mass, a venture partner at XSeed Capital, who helped spin off Hadoop Group into Hortonworks. Cloudera’s revenue, at $261 million, alongside its cash burn model do not help its cause. “Just like Hortonworks had to do when it went public a few years ago, they will probably need to take a valuation haircut. Their revenue doesn’t justify their valuation and Hadoop maturity is still in the early phases,” Mass wrote in an email. See also: MuleSoft’s post-IPO gains have created a scary valuation Hortonworks had a market capitalization of about $662 million at IPO time based on its issue price, compared with its private market valuation of close to $1 billion. The competitors Competition in the data-management space has been heating up. Cloudera points to legacy players such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. HPE, +0.11% and Oracle Corp. ORCL, +0.52% as well as increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, +0.20% Amazon Web Services AMZN, +0.20% Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, -0.04% GOOGL, -0.13%  Google Cloud GOOG, -0.04% and Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, -0.14% Azure. As for players solely focused on the data space, Cloudera is comparable with companies such as Hortonworks, Tableau Software Inc. DATA, +2.84%   and Teradata Corp. TDC, -0.23% Tableau’s stock was up 0.6% since its first day of trading May 17, 2013, as of Monday’s close. Teradata’s stock was up 20% since its first day of trading on Sept. 12, 2007. Read more: Next wave of tech IPOs looks nothing like Snap Amid the competition, Cloudera—which claimed more than 1,000 customers in its prospectus—sees a total addressable market of $65.6 billion by 2020. The Intel relationship Intel plays an integral role in Cloudera’s business, as both an investor and a partner. Cloudera has a strategic partnership with Intel to “optimize” its software in Intel’s processors and other systems. Intel has indicated an interest to buy up to 10% of shares of the common stock offered in the IPO, according to the prospectus. The company owns more than 22% of Cloudera’s outstanding stock before the offering, but that percentage would be diluted to 19.4% if the offering goes off as planned. Two of Cloudera’s other venture backers, Accel and Greylock, owned 16.3% and 12.5% of the company ahead of the offering, which is expected to fall to 14.4% and 11.1% respectively. As a group, all executive officers and directors will retain 23.2% after the offering. The company is led by Chief Executive Thomas Reilly, a former Hewlett-Packard security-software executive, and Chief Strategy Officer Michael Olson, a co-founder and former Oracle executive who also serves as chairman. Both men ended up at their previous employers after the large tech companies acquired their previous software startups.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Cloudera Inc., a data-software company, faces a cut in its $4.1 billion private valuation as it heads toward an initial public offering. The Palo Alto-based company set a price range Monday of $12 to $14 a share, which would give it a market capitalization of $1.79 billion at the high end of its range. The company was last valued at $4.1 billion in a 2014 investment round, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company, which uses open-source software called Hadoop to analyze large amounts of data, plans to sell 15 million shares to raise up to $242 million. It has granted underwriters the option to buy up to 2.25 million additional shares of stock. Cloudera CLDR, +0.00%  has been approved to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CLDR. The filing was previously listed under the name “Project Thunder.” Don’t miss: The IPO market is back, baby! Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Allen & Company LLC are the lead underwriters on the offering. Here are four things to know about the company: Losing less money as revenue grows Cloudera recorded revenue of $261 million for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2017, up from $166 million in the year-earlier period. The company pared its net losses between the two years, with a net loss of $187.3 million in 2016 compared with a net loss of $203.1 million in 2017. Think you would win an argument with a robot? Watch this.(1:46) Osaka University and NTT Laboratories recently created the first "discussion dialogue" androids - the only robots that have human-like independent cognitive abilities, as opposed to scripted speech. The net losses for both years include $63.6 million in 2016 and $21.7 million in 2017 of stock-based compensation. The 2017 loss also includes a noncash charge of $21.6 million related to the company’s donation of common stock to the Cloudera Foundation, a nonprofit arm. The down round In its last private funding round, in May 2014, Intel Corp. INTC, +0.80%  paid $30.92 per share for 11.99 million shares, more than double the high-end of Cloudera’s expected public price range. The last funding round was at a valuation of $4.1 billion, while Cloudera’s market capitalization, based on shares outstanding, would be $1.79 billion at most. Rohit Kulkarni, head of research at SharesPost, points to the declining share price of HortonWorks Inc. HDP, -0.37%  , one of Cloudera’s competitors, as rationale for the down round. HortonWorks, which is also a big data software company that focuses on Hadoop (hence the ticker symbol HDP), went public in December 2014 and has seen its share price decline about 60%. The declining valuation also points to the larger disconnect between private market and public market valuations, said Lev Mass, a venture partner at XSeed Capital, who helped spin off Hadoop Group into Hortonworks. Cloudera’s revenue, at $261 million, alongside its cash burn model do not help its cause. “Just like Hortonworks had to do when it went public a few years ago, they will probably need to take a valuation haircut. Their revenue doesn’t justify their valuation and Hadoop maturity is still in the early phases,” Mass wrote in an email. See also: MuleSoft’s post-IPO gains have created a scary valuation Hortonworks had a market capitalization of about $662 million at IPO time based on its issue price, compared with its private market valuation of close to $1 billion. The competitors Competition in the data-management space has been heating up. Cloudera points to legacy players such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. HPE, +0.11% and Oracle Corp. ORCL, +0.52% as well as increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, +0.20% Amazon Web Services AMZN, +0.20% Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, -0.04% GOOGL, -0.13%  Google Cloud GOOG, -0.04% and Microsoft Corp.’s MSFT, -0.14% Azure. As for players solely focused on the data space, Cloudera is comparable with companies such as Hortonworks, Tableau Software Inc. DATA, +2.84%   and Teradata Corp. TDC, -0.23% Tableau’s stock was up 0.6% since its first day of trading May 17, 2013, as of Monday’s close. Teradata’s stock was up 20% since its first day of trading on Sept. 12, 2007. Read more: Next wave of tech IPOs looks nothing like Snap Amid the competition, Cloudera—which claimed more than 1,000 customers in its prospectus—sees a total addressable market of $65.6 billion by 2020. The Intel relationship Intel plays an integral role in Cloudera’s business, as both an investor and a partner. Cloudera has a strategic partnership with Intel to “optimize” its software in Intel’s processors and other systems. Intel has indicated an interest to buy up to 10% of shares of the common stock offered in the IPO, according to the prospectus. The company owns more than 22% of Cloudera’s outstanding stock before the offering, but that percentage would be diluted to 19.4% if the offering goes off as planned. Two of Cloudera’s other venture backers, Accel and Greylock, owned 16.3% and 12.5% of the company ahead of the offering, which is expected to fall to 14.4% and 11.1% respectively. As a group, all executive officers and directors will retain 23.2% after the offering. The company is led by Chief Executive Thomas Reilly, a former Hewlett-Packard security-software executive, and Chief Strategy Officer Michael Olson, a co-founder and former Oracle executive who also serves as chairman. Both men ended up at their previous employers after the large tech companies acquired their previous software startups.

Pepsi By Huda Hassan Apr 18, 2017 The revolution will not be canned. That’s what we learned recently when Pepsi removed a tone deaf protest-themed ad featuring Kendall Jenner after receiving widespread criticism. Many called out the advertisement exactly for what it was: an attempt to capitalize off socio-political liberation movements and gain a cut of the real work being done for, and primarily by, people of color — in particular, thanks to the clear connection between the ad's conclusion and the widely-shared image of Iesha Evans, a young black woman who was photographed last year while she was arrested by two police officers in riot gear during a Black Lives Matter protest in Baton Rouge. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Unfortunately, Pepsi is not the first multinational corporation to release racially charged and offensive advertisements. It probably won't be the last either. There is a long tradition of the advertising industry using lazy and derogatory stereotypes to promote products to large audiences. (Many also present whiteness as a trope for communities of color to aspire to.) Today, some of these racist archetypes are subtle — like, say, when Gap Kids included a young black girl as a passive token in a clothing ad — while some are a lot more overt. The following is a list of just some of the many racist advertisements that we’ve observed in recent years. 1. When Sony used a "white is coming" tagline. Advertising a white-colored PlayStation Portable in Europe, Sony ran billboards showing a white woman dressed in white grabbing a black woman’s face — basically assault, then. The white woman is positioned as powerful and determined, whereas the black woman looks docile and submissive (and blending in with the background, even). Twitter Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Although a decade old, the ad made its rounds on the Internet last week after the Pepsi-motivated conversation about racist advertisements in media — in other words, a reminder that conversations about racism in media have not changed. 2. When Intel just, no, this is really bad why did it happen?! Intel released an advertisement for a desktop processor in 2007 showing a business-attire dressed white male surrounded by six muscular black men — who are all bowing down in a sprinter's pose that is easily also read as one signifying servitude. The advertisement reads “maximize the power of your employees.” Intel Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It did not take long for audiences to recognize the not-so-subtle reference to slavery; this becomes particularly troubling when we consider the historical relationship between the slave trade and the ad industry, who worked in concert with one another in the commodification of black bodies as property to be bought and sold. The enslaved were either advertised in newspapers as purchasable property or identified as missing property when they escaped their slave masters. (By the way, Intel later apologized for its “insensitive” and “insulting” ad.) 3. When Dunkin' Donuts used blackface. Dunkin' Donuts In promotion of a "charcoal donut" (which sounds awful?), Dunkin' Donuts aired commercials using blackface in Thailand in 2013. Despite criticism for an ode to a historically anti-black tradition in media, Dunkin' Donuts' chief executive in Thailand initially publicly defended the campaign, though a spokesperson for Dunkin’ Brands later gave a statement to The Guardian acknowledging the company’s mistake: "Dunkin' Donuts recognizes the insensitivity of this spot and on behalf of our Thailand franchisee and our company, we apologize for any offense it caused... We are working with our franchisee to immediately pull the television spot and to change the campaign." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. And when PopChips used Brownface. Remember PopChips' infamous 2012 advertisement with Ashton Kutcher playing “Raj”, a Bollywood producer who is “looking for the most delicious thing on the planet"!? Instead of hiring an Indian or South Asian actor, PopChips painted Kutcher in brown face. Popchips/YouTube The $1.5 million ad was pulled after receiving backlash and an apology was issued to remind PopChips fans that the company “embrace[s] all types of shapes, flavors and colors, and appreciate all snackers, no matter their race or ethnicity.” Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 5. When Burger King offended the Mexican government. In 2009, Burger King released an ad for a new item to their menu: the "Texican Whopper." Guess how that worked out? The commercial showed a tall, lanky American cowboy and a petite Lucha libre wrestler sharing their new fave fast good— ostensibly an attempt to demonstrate a new cross-border relationship. The cowboy assists the Mexican around the kitchen, helping him reach high shelves, before the commercial’s unidentified narrator says: "The taste of Texas with a little spicy Mexican.” SeriousEats The offensive ad received backlash from Mexico’s government about the metaphorical size of the wrestler, but also the presence of Mexico’s flag in the commercial. 6. And when eMobile offended the President. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below eMobile Racist advertisements are not just US-centric, but rather, a transnational issue. In 2008, eMobile released a commercial in Japan that showed a monkey dressed in a suit at an election rally, standing amongst an audience that is holding multiple signs that say “Change” — a significant component of then-incumbent President Obama’s campaign. The ad was later pulled after receiving backlash for its overt racism. 7. When KFC dabbled in very bad taste stereotypes. Hoping to appeal to an Australian audience in 2010, KFC debuted a cricket-themed ad campaign. Wait no, it was also horribly racist though. The ads featured a visibly agitated white male cricket fan who is outnumbered by a crowd of black people (who, to be clear, also just wanted to watch some cricket). KFC/YouTube Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Describing it as "an awkward situation," the white man pulls out a box of KFC chicken to feed the black people, before stating “too easy.” A voiceover for the actor then calls KFC chicken a “crowd pleaser.” 8. And when KFC did it again. Unfortunately, KFC’s ad team isn’t too creative with their selection of racist stereotypes. KFC released an ad in 2014, ostensibly telling the story of a South African woman who relocates to Bangkok. As she navigates her way through the city and her new school, she's visibly displaced and disheartened — until at the courtyard of her new school she is approached by her colleague who, due to language barriers, licks three of her fingers. The two of them then run off together... to a KFC. The camera zooms in on the Black girl's face as we see her express delight for the first time as she enters into the restaurant and, alas, takes a bite of some chicken. Of course, the ad received backlash but was not removed. 9. When Qiaobi laundry detergent ads suggested black people could, literally, be cleaned of their ethnicity. Qiaobi/YouTube Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Qiaobi, a Chinese laundry brand, ran an ad in 2016 which featured an Asian woman and a black man (who appears to be playing a decorator, and is streaked in paint). After being called in for what seems like a kiss, the woman shoves a detergent pod into the man's mouth and puts him in her washing machine. After being washed and dried, he emerges — to the woman's delight — as an Asian man. Qiaobi later apologized. 10. And when Taco Bell literally ran an ad featuring a white man throwing trash at a black woman, come on now!? A Deutsch ad for Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa in 2017 was edited after it received backlash for showing a white man throw garbage at a black woman walking down the street with a baby stroller (at the 0:04 mark in the video below). The original version ignited enough criticism for TacoBell to issue an apology before releasing a second, edited version of the commercial. The company said they had “no intention of upsetting anyone” and apologized to those who were offended. These age-old racist ideas are, seemingly, common sense (and commercial!) ideas to those who populate the room during ad campaign pitch meetings: white men. It’s also the reason why only five percent of advertisements include people of color. How can advertisers write people of color into existence — and accurately at that — if there are no people of color occupying these spaces? This legacy of racism in the advertising industry can only possibly begin its end when we see radical changes to who has a seat at the table. Follow Huda on Twitter.

This means that the venerable mATX ROG “Gene” is nowhere to be found under the new Z270 chipset, so we can assume it’s being partially replaced by mating together the ASUS Pro range and ROG Gene, birthing the ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING—perhaps the “G” stands for “Gene”? In any case, although not a “Gene” in naming, ASUS seems to have treated it as such buy cramming enough high end goodies to make micro-ATX PC builders drool. At $199 or R3500 locally, ASUS have kitted it out with SLI/CFX support, ROG Supreme FX 8-Channel HD audio, WiFI 802.11, two M.2 sockets, front panel USB. 3.1 C, 3D printing options, and as with all Z270 chipsets, support for Intel Optane Memory. So, without wasting time hoping for a Zuma impeachment, let’s take a look at the ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING: It’s all in the Genes As someone who does have “the feels” with the older red and black ROG Gene colour scheme, the new Z270G GAMING sports a more neutral black and grey scheme. Aesthetically, it seems blander, but pragmatically it will make the board much easier to blend in with whatever colour scheme you have for you PC, and the AURA LED lighting by the chipset heatsink will assist in that endeavour. Accessory wise, ASUS have kitted you out with a coaster, 3D printing mount package, RGB extension cables, SATA cables, M.2 screws, SLI High Bandwidth Bridge, IO shield, ROG STRIX stickers, WiFi Antenna and CPU installation tool.Feature-wise, ASUS have a reputation for taking everything good in their regular ATX size motherboards and dumping it all into an mATX form factor without visible compromises. The Z270G is cut from that same cloth, with well designed spacing around the board making it easy to connect everything without popping popping a vein. I find it quite beneficial to build a PC within a case and not a test bench since only in a case can you get a feel for board layout and design, and although you’ll need a massive rear case backplate opening to access the NVME drive, everything else on the board is well spaced and not in each others way. Fan headers are dotted around the board, with a dedicated Pump fan header for AIO coolers, as well as a RGB header and temperature sensor header. A missing element that does remind us that this is not a “pure” overclocker motherboard is the clear absence of any overclocker friendly features, such as LN2 jumpers, MemOK, start/reset buttons or a POST code display. What we get, instead, are RGB headers and 3D printing mounts, firmly cementing the type of consumer ASUS are aiming for. Whereas competitor’s high-end mATX boards may be a fair bit cheaper (Gigabyte Z270MX for example), they do compromise on some things a performance user might want, such as dual M.2 NVME support. Since Kaby-Lake offers 24 PCI Express lanes (4 more than Skylake), the boffins at ASUS were wise enough to engineer a feature to take advantage of the extra 4-PCI-Express lanes,and have managed to fit a second M.2 on the underside of the STRIX Z270G GAMING motherboard. So, if you’re a power user who wants two NVME drives in your mATX build, ASUS ingenuity has you covered. ASUS have given two full sized PCI-E slots which operate at X16/X0 with one card, or X8/X8 with two cards. The slots are steel reinforced, and although it would take a force greater than anything you’d subject a motherboard to break the PCI-Express, the silver does add some much needed contrast to the colour profile. For an m-ATX There are six SATA 6G ports, and it looks like the U2 port is finally DOA for ASUS, as none of the ASUS Z270 boards have it. There is some limitation to the SATA 6GB ports that do share bandwidth with the M.2 slots, so if you have two M.2 devices, you will not be able to use all the SATA storage options. Besides the presence of 3rd Party USB 3.1 in Skylake, we never got native USB3.1 support. Kaby-Lake now offers that, and although USB 3.1 Type A/C are not uncommon on rear ports on motherboards, ASUS have provided a USB 3.1 20-pin header providing front panel support—only a few motherboards out now offer that, and ASUS are one of them. On the IO port, you have the Wi-Fi connector, USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C, HDMI, Displayport, 7.1 Audio output with S/PDIF and 1GBit Lan. BIOS and Software: ASUS Cleans up nice ASUS’ EUFI software is, in most enthusiast circles, highly regarded. They have a GUI and layout that offers something an overclocker will be comfortable with, and also something for the “Auto” everything someone who might have heard of a BIOS once upon a time. It’s the same EUFI that ASUS have used since last generation, and has loads of overclocking options and overclocking profiles. This slideshow requires JavaScript. The software suite that ASUS provide is more or less the same they’ve offered for years, bar a version upgrade or two. We have Sonic Studio III, RamCache II, GameFirst IV, Sonic Radar III. The software you’ll probably use the most is the ever excellent Dual Intelligent Processor 5. This suite allows you to overclock, auto overclock and and create fan profiles using Fan Xpert 4—it also has loads of other programs like TPU, Digi+VRM. It’s probably the only software I’d never uninstall from a software bloat standpoint, as it’s just far too good to get rid off. System Setup & Overclocking Since Critical Hit does not have a previous Z270 board to match up against, I thought it best to measure a Kaby-Lake system against at least a Skylake, if only to see what an optimisation generation provides for users. I tested the Z270G up against it’s immediate ancestor, the Z170 Gene VIII. I also used the 6700K at 4.5GHz in the Gene board, while I tested the Z270G with the 7700K. Although the board is a capable overclocker, as mentioned earlier, there are extreme overclocking features that some may pine for in past GENE mATX boards. Skylake: Core i7 6700K @ 4.5GHZ ASUS Z170 RAMPAGE Gene VIII 4x4GB G-Skill DDR4 @3200MHz Samsung 850 Evo 250 + OCZ Vertex 4 256GB Windows 10 X64 Anniversary Edition NVIDIA Drivers 378.66 (GTX1060 3GB) ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING: Core i7 7700K @ 4.5GHZ + 4.8GHZ OC ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING 4x4GB G-Skill DDR4 @3200MHz OCZ Vertex 4 256GB Windows 10 X64 Anniversary Edition NVIDIA Drivers 378.66 (GTX1060 3GB) Overclocking Intel’s 7700K on the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G Gaming was as simple as it was on the Z170 boards of last—although the motherboard effortlessly applied the best settings to allow me to reach 5GHz at 1.31v with XMP enabled, my woeful Cooler Master D92 was not able to keep temperatures in line, and it was not stable. I was able to get it to 4.8GHz stable, and even at this speed, the chip ran quite hot (84 C) when stress testing. Regardless, this board was still able to get this chip to 5GHz, with only high temperatures causing instability. Benchmarks This slideshow requires JavaScript.   Gaming Benchmarks This slideshow requires JavaScript. As you can see, the benchmarks show a considerable sombre affair—more or less, the Z270 and 7700K team up to deliver performance that when compared to Skylake at equal clockspeeds, is ever so slightly quicker.  Where the Kaby-Lake, and specifically the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING, allow you to gain an extra edge is in overclockability, which although is also down to the CPU silicon, this motherboard’s ability to effortlessly spit out an decent overclock with very little effort can’t be overlooked. Final Thoughts & Conclusion: Gene-etically Modified for gamers and modders Although there is no official au revoir from ASUS on their GENE series of boards, the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING does fill the market spot usually reserved for the GENE. And it does so with aplomb and plenty of features under the hood. It serves a need that addresses a diverse range of needs within the PC gaming market—3D modding features for the hobbyist 3D printer; AURA and RGB headers for the aesthetically inclined; enough overclocking bells and whistles to extract  performance while even throwing in an ingenious rear-mounted M.2 port in case you want to RAID up two NVME drives. The broader issue of whether or not Kaby-Lake, and the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING motherboard is a sound upgrade investment to make from Skylake is not as forthcoming a recommendation—unless you need two NVME drives and want front panel 3.1 support, moving from Skylake based system makes little sense. However, if you are in the market for a new system, the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING comes out striding the line between the historically overclocking focused ROG brand and the more gamer friendly STRIX branded motherboards. The absence of overclocking niceties definitely sealed its fate—this is not a GENE replacement, even though it occupies the same price point. ASUS have pivoted their traditional high end mATX board, trading in their OC features for WiFi, 3D Printing support and RGB options to attract more gamers and modders to this motherboard. There are some features that could have still remained, such as a POST code display as that’s not necessarily only used by overclockers, but taking a step back from my Gene-coloured glasses, the trade-offs do somewhat make sense. Overclockers might find more value in the “pure” overclocking ASUS APEX motherboard, while gamers and PC builders will find more value in this high end board that is great at serving varied needs, for non-extreme overclockers and PC builders. ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING Summary Although it comes in at a historically mATX ASUS GENE price, the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270G Gaming pivots away from pure overclocking bells and whistles and offers more gamer friendly, power user and PC building features. 9 TagsAsusASUS ROG STRIX Z270G GAMINGFeaturehardwareHardware Reviewkaby lakemotherboardReviewtech Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Want more stuff like this?

By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | April 18, 2017 -- 18:38 GMT (11:38 PDT) | Topic: Windows 10 Microsoft rolled out its second "Redstone 3" test build for PCs on April 14. On April 18, officials went public with one of the under-the-cover features in that build: Power Throttling. Power Throttling (a temporary, not final, name for this feature) is in the Insider Preview build 16176 for Fast Ring PC testers. Microsoft executives said this feature uses "modern silicon capabilities" to run background tasks in a more power-efficient manner. Microsoft officials first talked up intentions to provide this kind of battery-saving feature in January, when the company was testing the Windows 10 Creators Update. In Build 15002 of the Creators Update. Microsoft officials said they were experimenting with power throttling with some, but not all, testers. In early experiments, Microsoft executives said Power Throttling showed up to an 11-percent savings in CPU power consumption for "some of the most strenuous cases." Since then, Microsoft has continued working on this feature, which officials said should "help many of you see a nice boost in battery life." Today's blog post noted that Power Throttling currently only works with machines with Intel's Speed Shift technology, which is in Intel's sixth generation and beyond Skylake/Kaby Lake Core processors. Microsoft is working to support other processors with Power Throttling "over the next few months." Power Throttling is designed to work with apps out of the box, Microsoft officials said, but developers can and may do some fine tuning with some new programming interfaces that Microsoft will provide in upcoming test builds.

13:38 ET Share this article BROOKLYN, N.Y., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Leaders in wireless, automotive, academia, and government will gather at the annual Brooklyn 5G Summit April 19-21, 2017 to explore how close the industry is to deploying commercial products and services for the next-generation of wireless communications. The fourth annual event will also showcase the latest developments and research in telecommunications, machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things (IoT). The invitation-only summit, at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, is jointly organized by NYU WIRELESS and Nokia, and the IEEE Communications Society will broadcast the proceedings. The event features international thought and research leaders from Nokia, Verizon, National Instruments, Intel, Qualcomm, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and others.  "With nearly every major carrier launching 5G wireless field trials this year, this is a watershed moment in the next telecommunications revolution," said Theodore (Ted) S. Rappaport, the Ernst Weber/David Lee professor of electrical engineering at NYU Tandon and founding director of NYU WIRELESS. In recent months major carriers, including Verizon and AT&T, announced trials in nearly a dozen cities for both mid-band and the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bandwidth for which Rappaport and NYU WIRELESS conducted seminal research. Government and industry bodies such as the FCC, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU) have also recently set new benchmarks aimed at taking mobile data speeds to new limits. "Behind the blistering pace of research and development of technology — from microchips with phased-array antennas to vehicle-to-vehicle communications in self-driving cars — is the expectation that ultra-fast connectivity delivering huge data rates is just around the corner," said Rappaport. "NYU WIRELESS' industrial affiliate sponsors, including Nokia, AT&T, Qualcomm, Straight Path Communications, and Verizon are fulfilling those expectations, and NYU WIRELESS is pleased to play a key role as well, with breakthrough research proving that mmWave transmissions can deliver 5G in many more settings than anticipated." A report from Nokia Bell Labs Consulting predicts that by 2020, global demand for digital content and services on mobile and portable devices will increase 30 to 45 times from 2014 levels. The study estimates that there will be over 46 billion Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices by 2020, with audio and video streaming accounting for 79 percent of the total increased consumption. NYU WIRELESS, which conducted the world's first radio channel measurements proving that the mmWave spectrum holds vast potential to improve wireless communications, was one of only two academic institutions recently chosen by the FCC to help test, debug, and provide feedback on a new web-based portal that lets researchers apply for the program experimental license, a new paradigm that will reduce barriers to experimentation for universities, research laboratories, health care institutions, and manufacturers. NYU WIRELESS is also the first to receive a program experimental license. Summit Highlights Driven by this year's theme, "How Close is 5G to Commercial Reality," the Brooklyn 5G Summit will focus on end-to-end system design, regulations and pre-commercial systems. In addition, the conference will address various use cases for 5G in the evolving IoT space by inviting selected start-up companies to share their work. Presentations by industry leaders will include Theodore (Tod) Sizer, vice president of mobile radio research at Nokia; Durga Malladi, senior vice president of Qualcomm; Seizo Onoe, chief technical officer of the prominent Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo; Ken Steward, senior fellow at Intel; Gaurav Bansal, senior researcher at the Toyota InfoTechology Center; and HongBeom Jeon, executive vice president of KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom), which will introduce 5G to the Olympics at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Many of the industry affiliate sponsors of NYU WIRELESS are testing breakthrough 5G systems and platforms. Several will demonstrate prototypes and explain their advances. NYU WIRELESS will demonstrate: Groundbreaking research on 5G transmission in the mmWave spectrum, promising up to 40 times today's data transmission rates The latest tools for designing 5G systems, including its widely used NYUSIM open-source channel software simulator (with over 7,000 downloads to date) A new real-time network emulation tool for evaluating virtual reality and other applications over realistic mmWave channels A phased-array antenna system for measuring mmWave directional channel dynamics A new dual architecture channel sounder with 2 GHz RF bandwidth throughout the mmWave spectrum, and a channel sounder on a chip To watch the live stream April 19-21, register at https://register.comsoc.org/brooklyn-5g-summit-2017.

Big data software provider Cloudera has filed an amended document with the US stock market regulator to issue an initial public offering (IPO) with an expected price range of $12 to $14 a share. The company plans to issue 15 million shares of common stock in the public issue. In the filing, the company said that Intel has indicated an interest in buying up to 10% of the shares to be issued in the offering. Its shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker symbol “CLDR”. Cloudera intends to use the proceeds from the IPO to meet working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. The company offers its software platform on a subscription basis with a focus on selling to 8,000 global corporate enterprises as well as large public sector organizations. For the fiscal year ending 31 January 2017, the company earned 73% of its total revenue of $261m from Global 8000 customers. Cloudera said: “Our customers continue to expand their usage of our platform. The net expansion rate for our subscription revenue was 142% as of January 31, 2017. “A growing, vibrant ecosystem has developed around our platform, and many third‑party developers have primarily standardized on it, building more than 100 industry-specific use cases, or applications, using our proprietary technology.” READ MORE: Cloudera IPO: An argument against open source business? Incorporated in Delaware in 2008, the company employed 1,470 full‑time employees as of 31 January this year. In May 2014, the company received an investment of approximately $741.8m from chipmaker Intel, which later increased it to $766.5m by the end of January 2017. After the completion of the IPO, Intel is expected to hold 19.4% of outstanding shares in the company. In February 2015, Hadoop open source software distributor Cloudera acquired self-service data analytics firm Xplain.io, in a move to broaden its offerings toenterprise customers. The acquisition was expected to enable Cloudera to assist customers in speeding up their enterprise data hub (EDH) deployments and facilitate the addition of more data and more complex workloads (automation, optimisation, self-service) to their Cloudera environments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Brooklyn 5G Summit Showcases Advanced Research and Technology Fueling 5G Wireless Drive To Commercial Reality BROOKLYN, N.Y., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Leaders in wireless, automotive, academia, and government will gather at the annual Brooklyn 5G Summit April 19-21, 2017 to explore how close the industry is to deploying commercial products and services for the next-generation of wireless communications. The fourth annual event will also showcase the latest developments and research in telecommunications, machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things (IoT). The invitation-only summit, at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering, is jointly organized by NYU WIRELESS and Nokia, and the IEEE Communications Society will broadcast the proceedings. The event features international thought and research leaders from Nokia, Verizon, National Instruments, Intel, Qualcomm, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and others.  „With nearly every major carrier launching 5G wireless field trials this year, this is a watershed moment in the next telecommunications revolution,” said Theodore (Ted) S. Rappaport, the Ernst Weber/David Lee professor of electrical engineering at NYU Tandon and founding director of NYU WIRELESS. In recent months major carriers, including Verizon and AT&T, announced trials in nearly a dozen cities for both mid-band and the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bandwidth for which Rappaport and NYU WIRELESS conducted seminal research. Government and industry bodies such as the FCC, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU) have also recently set new benchmarks aimed at taking mobile data speeds to new limits. „Behind the blistering pace of research and development of technology — from microchips with phased-array antennas to vehicle-to-vehicle communications in self-driving cars — is the expectation that ultra-fast connectivity delivering huge data rates is just around the corner,” said Rappaport. „NYU WIRELESS’ industrial affiliate sponsors, including Nokia, AT&T, Qualcomm, Straight Path Communications, and Verizon are fulfilling those expectations, and NYU WIRELESS is pleased to play a key role as well, with breakthrough research proving that mmWave transmissions can deliver 5G in many more settings than anticipated.” A report from Nokia Bell Labs Consulting predicts that by 2020, global demand for digital content and services on mobile and portable devices will increase 30 to 45 times from 2014 levels. The study estimates that there will be over 46 billion Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices by 2020, with audio and video streaming accounting for 79 percent of the total increased consumption. NYU WIRELESS, which conducted the world’s first radio channel measurements proving that the mmWave spectrum holds vast potential to improve wireless communications, was one of only two academic institutions recently chosen by the FCC to help test, debug, and provide feedback on a new web-based portal that lets researchers apply for the program experimental license, a new paradigm that will reduce barriers to experimentation for universities, research laboratories, health care institutions, and manufacturers. NYU WIRELESS is also the first to receive a program experimental license. Summit Highlights Driven by this year’s theme, „How Close is 5G to Commercial Reality,” the Brooklyn 5G Summit will focus on end-to-end system design, regulations and pre-commercial systems. In addition, the conference will address various use cases for 5G in the evolving IoT space by inviting selected start-up companies to share their work. Presentations by industry leaders will include Theodore (Tod) Sizer, vice president of mobile radio research at Nokia; Durga Malladi, senior vice president of Qualcomm; Seizo Onoe, chief technical officer of the prominent Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo; Ken Steward, senior fellow at Intel; Gaurav Bansal, senior researcher at the Toyota InfoTechology Center; and HongBeom Jeon, executive vice president of KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom), which will introduce 5G to the Olympics at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Many of the industry affiliate sponsors of NYU WIRELESS are testing breakthrough 5G systems and platforms. Several will demonstrate prototypes and explain their advances. NYU WIRELESS will demonstrate: Groundbreaking research on 5G transmission in the mmWave spectrum, promising up to 40 times today’s data transmission rates The latest tools for designing 5G systems, including its widely used NYUSIM open-source channel software simulator (with over 7,000 downloads to date) A new real-time network emulation tool for evaluating virtual reality and other applications over realistic mmWave channels A phased-array antenna system for measuring mmWave directional channel dynamics A new dual architecture channel sounder with 2 GHz RF bandwidth throughout the mmWave spectrum, and a channel sounder on a chip To watch the live stream April 19-21, register at https://register.comsoc.org/brooklyn-5g-summit-2017.

In response, President Trump tweeted support for his daughter and Kellyanne Conway told everyone to "go buy Ivanka's stuff" on TV. Some stores have followed Nordstrom's lead, while others are carrying the brand as usual. Here's who's doing what, according to the AP.

Follow Axios Dave Lawler 2 hrs ago Featured Dem Ossoff falls short in Georgia, Trump takes credit Bill Barrow / AP Democrat Jon Ossoff — a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker powered by $9 million in donations — got by far the most votes in the special election to fill HHS Secretary Tom Price's House seat in Georgia, but fell short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright. He'll now face Republican Karen Handel in a runoff in June. The results with 86% reporting: Ossoff 48.6%, Handel 19.5%,16 candidates splitting the rest.t Why it matters: This special election was viewed as a referendum on President Trump, and Trump himself got involved with a series of tweets bashing Ossoff. Ossoff did better than expected but not well enough to win outright, so both sides will declare it a victory. Politics Link copied to clipboard. Axios 3 hrs ago Featured Trump admin certifies Iran is complying with nuclear deal Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP The Trump administration has certified Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal and extended sanctions relief, per the AP. The State Dept say a further review is underway which "will evaluate whether continuing to lift sanctions would be in U.S. national security interests." Why it matters: President Trump has repeatedly attacked the deal as one of the worst ever struck in history, though he did say during the campaign that once such a deal was reached, it had to be followed. This will upset many conservatives, though, who want to rip up the deal. Politics Link copied to clipboard. Dave Lawler 4 hrs ago Featured WSJ: Fox News preparing to drop O'Reilly AP Citing sources "close to the situation," the Wall St Journal reports that Fox News is "preparing to cut ties" with Bill O'Reilly, with a final decision potentially coming within days. NY Mag had previously reported that the Murdochs, who own the Journal as well as Fox News, were leaning toward taking O'Reilly off the air. The background: The scandal surrounding O'Reilly developed quickly after a NY Times report that five women had been paid to settle lawsuits against him, with another woman coming forward today to accuse the O'Reilly Factor host of sexual harassment. O'Reilly's lawyer claimed today that "far-left organizations" had conspired to damage the reputation of Fox's biggest star. Business Link copied to clipboard. Axios 5 hrs ago Featured Trump: "You always have to be concerned" about nuclear war with North Korea AP Trump did an interview with local affiliate WTMJ today on his visit to Wisconsin, and here's how he responded when asked if Americans should worry about nuclear war with North Korea:" "Look, you always have to be concerned. You don't know exactly who you're dealing with. I had a great great meeting with the president of China and that meeting tells me a lot and you've seen a lot of things happen. They have a pretty good power, not a great power perhaps, but a pretty good power over North Korea. We're gonna see what happens. It's a very, very tricky situation."

Christopher Matthews 6 hrs ago Featured Computers to be smarter than man by 2050, says AI expert German computer scientist Jürgen Schmidhuber—who has contributed to various AI innovations like speech-recognition technology—predicts artificial intelligence will surpass that of humans by the year 2050. "[AI] will see little point in getting stuck to our bit of the biosphere," he tells the Guardian in an interview Tuesday. "They will want to move history to the next level and march out to where the resources are. In a couple of million years, they will have colonised the Milky Way." What happens before that? Schmidhuber is building an electronic brain consisting of one billion neurons—or one one thousandth the number contained in the human cortex. He calls his project "true AI," one that can function much like a baby by "setting themselves little experiments in order to understand how the world works," according to the Guardian. "We aren't that many years away from an animal-like intelligence, like that of a crow or a capuchin monkey," he says. Not everyone is convinced: One scientist told the Guardian that Schmidhuber is setting up AI to disappoint, much like the vaunted Segway, which was promoted as an invention as important as the PC, but ended up at best a niche product, and at worst a laughingstock.

Dean Heller should expect a fierce blowback from social conservatives after he defended Planned Parenthood in a rowdy town hall meeting Monday afternoon. Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America, fired the first public warning shot in our article. Less than 24 hours later, Heller was singing a different tune. Here's Heller on Monday afternoon: "I will protect Planned Parenthood." "I have no problems with federal funding for Planned Parenthood." Here's Heller on Tuesday, via his spokeswoman Megan Taylor: "Senator Heller has worked hard to improve women's access to health care and the quality of care they receive. While he doesn't have a problem with many of the health care services Planned Parenthood offers to women, he is opposed to providing federal funding to any organization that performs abortions and is supported by taxpayers' dollars; he has a long record that reflects his position."

Ina Fried 8 hrs ago Featured Petsmart gobbles up Chewy.com for a reported $3.35 billion Petsmart announced Tuesday it is buying online rival Chewy.com in a deal that values the online pet food seller at $3.35 billion, according to Recode. Chewy will remain led by current CEO Ryan Cohen and operate "largely" as an independent subsidiary of PetSmart, whatever that means. Big Bite: The reported price tag would make the deal larger than Walmart's Jet purchase and the biggest e-commerce-only acquisition ever, Recode said. Technology Link copied to clipboard. Jonathan Swan 8 hrs ago Featured Trump's growing trust problem PSB A new national poll shows President Trump continuing to slip on two key dimensions: "keeping his promises" and "getting things done." Why this matters: "Trump is now better described by what he's doing wrong than by what he's doing right," says Margie Omero, who runs polling at PSB Research. "And we see three months of shrinkage on two dimensions that once defined him...If he continues to lose ground with his own base, he may paint himself into a corner." Keep reading ... words PSB, a Democratic-aligned firm, has been measuring changes in Trump's performance relative to expectations. In February, more voters said Trump was exceeding their expectations on these two factors, according to that month's national poll of 800 voters. In each of the two months since, however, he's dropped and in the April survey more felt the President had let down rather than exceededtheir expectations. The PSB poll reinforces a trend in the Gallup survey released Monday: "45% say Trump keeps his promises, down from 62% in February." Uh oh: Trump's image has tumbled even among his own base (which still views him far more favorably than the country at large.) According to PSB just 38% of Trump voters now say he's keeping promises more than expected, down from 58% in February and 50% in March. And 43% of Trump voters say he's getting more things done than expected, a drop of nearly 20 points since February. Show less Politics Link copied to clipboard. Shane Savitsky 8 hrs ago Featured Facebook's safety chief on Cleveland, mental health outreach Bob Herman / Axios At an Axios Future Shapers event in Chicago this afternoon Antigone Davis, Facebook's Head of Global Safety Policy, discussed Facebook's outreach following posts indicating potential self-harm, and commented on the murder in Cleveland from which video was posted to Facebook. Keep reading ... words The reaction to Cleveland: "For all of the people who work at Facebook, our heart goes out to the families. For us, we want to really look at this as an opportunity to figure out how we can do better." The Internet is nicer than you think: When Facebook users post using distressed or sad emojis, Davis said that analytics have found that their friends tend to skip the like/react button and post longer and more empathetic comments. Facebook's outreach for posts involving self-harm: The company has provided options for users to flag content they suspect suggests self-harm — allowing them to reach out to their friends directly or to a help line for advice — while also suggesting mental health resources directly to users who have had posts flagged in the past or use flagged phrases. Davis said that Facebook's hope is to eventually use artificial intelligence to provide these resources in real time.

Chuck Rego is Chief Architect for Intel. Over the last decade, huge growth in demand for Internet and mobile services has driven rapid transformation in digital businesses.  This growth has been highly disruptive, and it has created new business opportunities and challenged the status quo.  In the data center, two forces have created much of this change:  the evolution of virtualization and the rise of cloud computing. Latest-generation technologies in computing hardware and software platforms, including but not limited to unified computing, pervasive virtualization, containerization, new rack designs, disaggregation of compute resources, improved telemetry and analytics have all added to lowering the total cost of ownership (TCO) but also greater return on investment (ROI).  This has set the stage for agile infrastructure and a further explosion in the number and type of instrumentation metrics available to today’s data center managers. Optimization, as applied to data centers, means always having the right amount of resources, to cost-effectively enable the business use of those data centers. Right resourcing means, in effect, enough to get the data center “job” done, but not so much as to waste money. Everything from enough power and floor space to enough “computes,” and everything else. Easily said, but increasingly challenging to accomplish. It used to be that one would optimize any given data center resource by measuring resource utilization; for example, how busy a CPU is, and then make a considered determination of what level was sufficiently busy to be upgraded or extended, or sufficiently non-busy to warrant consolidation. This approach was used, and useful, for everything from CPUs, memory and other server metrics, to things like power consumption, where metrics like PUE (power utilization effectiveness) were created and applied. However, these types of optimizations were always done in domain isolation – silos in effect. On the software side, pervasive virtualization, containerization and software automation have completely changed the measurement landscape. The increasingly rich metrics embedded in server chipsets open exciting new possibilities. Metric That Matters #1: Transaction Throughput and Response Time Because high levels of virtualization abstract the real hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) from the workloads using them, and those resources are ever more dynamically allocated to the workloads running upon them, the measurement of specific resource utilization is becoming increasing unrelated to how those workloads actually perform. This has driven an explosion in the adoption of Application Performance Management (APM) solutions that measure how much work applications are getting done and how quickly they are responding. This, at the end of the day is one of the key metrics of today’s data centers: how much business work is being accomplished and how responsively.  And, where such metrics are simply not available, reasonable proxies need to be found; typically anything that can measure “waiting” in and across the environment. Metric That Matters #2: Cost – Especially OpEx In a perfect world, one would be able to completely cost-optimize the entirety of the infrastructure used to deliver applications and services in an acceptably performant fashion. In other words, if each and every transaction is simultaneously cost AND performance optimized, and, importantly can be kept in that state, then one has reached the pinnacle of data center optimization. This implies a need to have a good basis for OpEx costing; a mechanism by which to allocate/ascribe a cost measure to transactions.   Again, because of the dynamic complexity of the environment when considering the “map” from transactions to the underlying supporting infrastructure, some type of management framework is clearly required to accurately accomplish this allocation. To be useful, system management frameworks need to be as dynamic and scalable as their underlying systems.  Management tools built on industry standards and open source reference implementations provide powerful automation solutions that increase performance, boost efficiency, and speed time to market.  New power and cooling management and metrics provide monitoring, optimization and prediction, capabilities all leading to reduced cost of ownership. Research now suggests that in many real world applications, storage performance is the main limiter of application performance.  New rack designs enable large gains in storage performance and cost without imposing a significant cost burden.  Like compute and network resources, storage resources are now increasingly software defined. Over the last few years, quantum leaps in technology and telemetry availability has provided excellent proxies for determining costs.  Metrics such as dollar-per-watt, power-per-transaction, dollar-per-VM, performance-per-watt, and many other performance metrics provide details in the actual operational expense of running the data center. Summary The closer that data centers can get to complete instrumentation of important metrics like transactional response time and throughput, the lower the overall associated costs will be to successfully deliver those business services, and the more efficient such data centers can become.

LLVM Clang 3.9.1, Clang 4.0 & GCC 6.3 With Intel's Clear Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Software on 18 April 2017. Page 1 of 4. 5 Comments A few days back Intel's Clear Linux updated their LLVM Clang compiler from 3.9.1 to the recent 4.0.0 release, following Beignet getting LLVM 4.0 support. Here are some before/after benchmarks as well as fresh GCC benchmarks. Clear Linux ships both LLVM Clang and GCC and switches between the default compiler when building its packages/bundles depending upon which compiler is known to do the best for the particular workload. As far as the default compiler exposed, GCC is the default. I ran some tests of Clear Linux 14620 that shipped with GCC 6.3 and and LLVM Clang 3.9.1 followed by upgrading to Clear Linux 14640 to get the distribution's LLVM Clang 4.0 build. (Note there was also a small update to its Linux 4.10 kernel with that build too.) I ran this fresh Clear Linux compiler comparison on an Intel Core i7 6800K Broadwell-E box. The CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS were maintained the same throughout testing of "-O3 -march=native." All benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

View All Pages While AMD’s Ryzen has disrupted Intel’s long-running hegemony in the CPU market, AMD has been relatively subdued in the GPU market of late resulting in Nvidia’s continuing dominance of market share, particularly at the mid-range and beyond. AMD has today taken steps to change this with two “new ” GPUs for its RX 500 series, the RX 570 and RX 580, hoping to attract new customers in the mid-range market. Enthusiasts expecting to see a brand new graphics architecture (or product) may be disappointed since the RX 580 and 570 are, for all intents and purposes, lifted from the RX 400 series with only incremental tweaks. The RX 580, the focus of this review, is based on the 14nm Polaris RX 480 while the RX 570, also launching today, is based on the RX 470. Enthusiasts looking for something truly new will have to continue waiting for AMD Vega which is expected out at some point later this year. This launch draws striking similarities to AMD’s release of the R9 390X and R9 390 back in 2015, which were based on the R9 290X and R9 290, respectively. AMD faced criticism at the time for the move since it had been very active in the process of rebranding and re-releasing existing GPUs as new products. AMD waved away criticism of the R9 390X and R9 390 stating the GPUs were new given the frequency increases, increased video memory and power management tweaks. The RX 580, and RX 570, are new in so far as they are built from a refined 14nm FinFET process to achieve better typical clock speeds. AMD has also made some tweaks to the power management to reduce power consumption and increase power efficiency under a number of scenarios including multi-monitor, multimedia playback and system idle. AMD has been able to achieve this by adding a third intermediate memory state to reduce power consumption, which sits alongside two existing memory states. To over-simplify, the current Polaris GPU effectively has two memory states, low and high, and most GPU activities (including having a second display) alter the memory state from low to high, increasing power consumption in the process. The new third intermediate memory stage now means the refined Polaris GPU has low, medium and high. In many cases a load activity can increase it to medium, before high, thus resulting in lower overall power draw. AMD is using the RX 500 series launch as a platform to introduce a new feature it’s calling Radeon Chill, which effectively reduces the frame-rate when the user is in-game but idle or AFK (away from keyboard) and then increases the frame-rate again when the user becomes active. It also caps “excessively high” frame rates to further reduce power consumption. AMD doesn’t specify how it achieves reductions in frame-rate, presumably it does this through a clock speed reduction, but the end result is still less power consumption. This new setting can be turned on or off from the AMD Settings included in the driver package and a long list of games is initially supported including Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends and Dota 2. In this review we are assessing Sapphire’s take on the RX 580, the Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ OC Limited Edition graphics card with 8GB of video memory. Any KitGuru readers feeling a sense of Déjà vu right now can refer back to our previous review on the Sapphire RX 480 Nitro+ OC graphics cards to confirm their suspicions. Sapphire has left its previous design mostly unchanged with the release of the RX 580 Nitro+ Limited Edition. Certainly, that is no bad thing for prospective customers since the Nitro+ cooler was already effective with good build quality and a sturdy backplate. Clock speeds on the Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ are more aggressive out of the box to reflect the higher clocking capability of the RX 580 versus the RX 480 which will result in more performance. Our sample ran out of the box at 1450MHz on the core, up from 1342MHz on the RX 480 Nitro+ OC 8GB graphics card. That’s a 108MHz increase in frequency, equating to 8%, while the memory remains unchanged at 2000MHz actual, 8000MHz effective. Given that the RX 580 brings no Instructions Per Clock (IPC) improvement, we should expect to see that the only additional performance the RX 580 brings over the RX 480 stems from it’s increased frequency. If both were clocked identically then performance would be identical. The out of the box frequency can be changed by toggling between two different BIOS modes using a switch. Silent sets the core at 1411MHz while Boost ups this to 1450MHz. Since it requires minimal user effort to enable the faster Boost setting, we tested throughout our review using this mode.

AMD has not been clear about whether or not the RX 480 and RX 470 will be officially discontinued from today, however, we imagine this will be the case and so there may be bargains to be had for buyers of “old” RX 480 and RX 470 stock.

Check Also MSI is offering up to £94 cashback on motherboards and GPUs Whenever you are looking to upgrade or build a whole new rig, it is always … Herbrecht Von Jeromen “AMD’s RX 580 struggles to overcome Nvidia’s GTX 1060 which is generally a better performer and considerably more power efficient. In short, the RX 580 is the less desirable option of the two, even if board partners like Sapphire have done a stellar job in presenting the graphics card in a refined and well-built package.” Why this? The RX 480 already proved to overcome the GTX 1060 in many, many games after a few months of drivers optimisation, even in Dx11/OpenGL environments, and the RX 580 just makes better what’s already excellent. Also considering that more and more games will use Dx12 and Vulkan (Bethesda ones just to make an example), there’s a Whole lot of added value to those new AMD Polaris cards. I can’t find this review as an accurate one. fewtcher “even in Dx11/OpenGL environments” – yeah, no. It doesn’t. And RX 580 costs $260-270, GTX 1060 6GB costs $240-250. Even if they are equal in performance, a 1060 is the better choice. campdude You can’t SLI the 1060. The 580 will crossfire. I don’t negotiate on this type of feature. It increases resale value (people will still want this card for its crossfire performance while the 1060 will be dead) They are not equal in performance if you could grab a used one for cheap. BUT crossfire is not for everyone. I enjoy it though. fewtcher You grabbing a second 580 will come up equal to me selling the 1060 and getting a 1070. And I’ll still have better performance than you. campdude Look at the benchmarks. You are under-estimating crossfire. I admit crossfire is game specific. BUT the RX 480 performs like a GTX 1080. In Shadow of Mordor, Thief and probably any game that supports crossfire. You have to understand that its about getting the second card used and cheap. campdude http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/7770/amd-radeon-rx-480-crossfire-beating-geforce-gtx-1080-4k/index4.html Freeman4096 Not a single mention of Freesync or Vulkan? Embarrassing for a tech review. everybody who reads this articles already knows that rx480> gtx1060. Only the non-readers (80 percent of buyers) think otherwise. But the point then is- why to try to fool us? Rocky40 Yea I was wonder why the 580 numbers were so below the 1060 when we already knew th3 480 was able to get very very close or beat the 1060 or just match it. I noticed this on a few reviews and was WTH. I found 2 reviews so far that have the Red Devil 580 beating the EVGA1060 SSC or matched frame rates and maybe 1 slight loss. So I am wondering why the review numbers are so all over the place like they were with the Ryzens CPU’s. I get that reviewers are bored about reviewing these cards because of very little performance difference. But it seems a lot of sites numbers are off or suspect. It also depends on the games the reviewer uses some work better one one platform than they do the other and vice versus. In the 2 reviews that had more stable numbers the game testing data base was huge it showed all cards with a lot of the games we actually play not just a hand picked few.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Origin launches a gaming laptop with $999 starting price 04/17/2017 at 12:47 PM by Brad Linder 5 Comments These days it’s not uncommon to find notebook computers that sell for under $200. But if you want a gaming laptop you usually need to pay well over $1000 for a machine with the latest CPU, graphics and display technology. Now Origin is bucking the trend (a little) with a gaming laptop that sells for $999 and up. It’s called the Origin EON15-S and it’s a 15.6 inch laptop with a full HD IPS matte display, an Intel Kaby Lake processor, and NVIDIA GeForce 1050 graphics. An entry-level model features an Intel Core i3-7100H dual-core processor, 8GB of DDR4-2133 memory, 120GB of solid state storage, and Windows 10 Home software. That should be enough for basic gaming. But you can also configure the system with up to a Core i7-7700HQ quad-core CPU, up to 32GB of 2,666 MHz memory, Windows 10 Pro, and up to 6TB of storage (thanks to a 2.5 inch drive bay and an M.2 PCIe slot). A fully decked out model can set you back more than $4,000… so it’s clearly the entry-level price that makes the EON15-S special, not the price of higher-end versions. The notebook weighs about 5.1 pounds, measures about an inch thick, and offers up to 6 hours of battery life. While that makes it a bit less portable than most of the systems I cover on Liliputing, it’s not bad by gaming notebook standards.

Also, it should be noted that this comes with a GTX 1050 Ti in the base model (the $999 version), which is about 15-30% faster in games at 1080p. That’s not a bad deal at all, esp. from a company like Origin that typically makes expensive boutique gaming laptops.

My Favorite Features/Changes Of The Linux 4.11 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 18 April 2017 at 06:28 AM EDT. 12 Comments With Linux 4.11.0 being released as soon as this weekend, here's a look back at the changes I found most exciting about this next kernel feature release. What personally excites me the most about Linux 4.11 include: - Some AMD/RADV performance improvements, likely due to the TTM memory management improvements made this cycle. - The Realtek ALC1220 is now supported. Normally, audio codecs don't get me excited, but the ALC1220 is used by many AMD Ryzen and Intel Skylake motherboards. Meaning with Linux 4.11 there will now be working audio. - The Intel DRM driver finally enables frame-buffer compression by default for Skylake and newer, which can provide some power-savings. - Better support for Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 and should be working on more systems now. - The new statx system call. - Various Raspberry Pi mainline improvements. - Various file-system improvements. And much more as covered by our earlier Linux 4.11 feature overview. 12 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics. Michael is also the lead developer of the Phoronix Test Suite, Phoromatic, and OpenBenchmarking.org automated benchmarking software.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Cloudera Sets IPO Pricing, Terms By Paul Ausick April 17, 2017 11:45 am EDT Print Email Tweet Big data software firm Cloudera on Monday filed an amended Form S-1/A with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO) to issue 15 million shares of common stock in an expected range of $12 to $14 a share. At the midpoint of that range, Cloudera would raise $195 million at an implied market cap of around $1.66 billion, based on 128 million shares outstanding. Underwriters for the IPO have been granted an overallotment option on an additional 2.25 million shares. Underwriters include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Allen, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Stifel, JMP Securities and Raymond James. In the filing, Cloudera said that Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) has indicated an interest in acquiring up to 10% of the IPO shares. If Intel were to do so, the chipmaking giant would hold about 21% of Cloudera’s outstanding shares following the offering. Cloudera’s open source-based Hadoop data management platform plays in the same league as Hortonworks Inc. (NASDAQ: HDP) and Box Inc. (NYSE: BOX), neither of which has been able to hold onto its IPO pricing. Hortonworks is down about 60% since its 2014 IPO, and Box is down nearly 30% since its IPO, according to Barron’s. Cloudera’s valuation had declined from $30.92 per share, the amount Intel paid in 2014, to $17.85 in Cloudera’s most recent awards to employees last month. From a one-time valuation of around $4 billion to less than $2 billion is not a particularly good sign for investors.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 April 2017 | MYT 2:01 PM Intel to stop hosting the annual Intel Developer Forum by lee kah leng A file photo of an Intel employee talking about the Yuneec drone and its ability to avoid obstacles at the Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco. IDF is no more. — Intel Corporation Intel Corporation, the world’s largest semiconductor chip maker, has pulled the plug on its Intel Developer Forum which has been held annually for almost two decades. Over the years, the conference has been the main event where the company shares the latest trends in the tech world, details on its product development and its plans for the future with industry players around the world. "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions," Intel said in a statement on its official blog. This means that this year’s conference which was to be held in San Francisco on Aug 15 to 17 will no longer be taking place. According to popular tech blog Anandtech, Intel is said to have have shifted its focus from a PC-centric to a data-centric company, which led to the decision.

The products were introduced (for some reason) at the Coachella Festival and hit key price points for all users. Pavilion Notebooks The Pavilion notebooks come in three offerings: 14, 15.6 and 17.3 inch. The display options available are either HD (720p, non-IPS) or FHD 1080p (IPS/non-IPS), while the design is updated with a diamond-cut trackpad and a tilted hinge display. Under the hood, you get Intel chips ranging from Celeron to Core i7, as well as AMD processors (either E2 or A10 APU). The choice for dedicated GPU ranges from Nvidia’s GeForce 940MX to AMD’s entry level Radeon series. Further, a combo of both SSD and HDD can be had for 512 GB and 1 TB capacities, respectively. Meanwhile, for the ports you get a USB-C, USB 3.1, HDMI and an SD card slot. At the top is an optional Windows Hello-compatible IR sensor. The battery is said to last up to 10 hours of usage, while fast-charging is supported as well, which is a major plus. As for the price, the 14, 15.6 and 17-inch versions will start at $700, $600 and $630, respectively, based on your bundle of specifications. Pavilion X360 Convertibles Other than the more ‘conventional” offerings, HP also took towards updating its convertible lineup. The three convertibles will be available in 11.6, 13 and 14-inch variants, with the touch-enabled display being available in both HD-ready and FHD versions. The good thing is that HP packs a stylus with each of these systems. Under the hood, you’ll find Intel’s silicon ranging from the lowly Pentium N4200 to the premium Core i7. Storage will be available in both SSD and HDD options, while there’s option for both discrete Radeon and GeForce graphics. For connectivity, you get USB-C on larger models, HDMI, SD card, audio jack, and a Kensington port alongside the optional Windows Hello support. The 11-inch version is decidedly lower on specs than others, missing out on a Full HD display, dedicated graphics as well as USB-C ports, though, it makes up for it in the price game. Battery life on the convertibles is said to last up to 12 hours, with fast-charging available out-of-the-box. Pricing for the convertibles starts at an alluring $349. No word on a Pakistani release for the two series.

The image appears to describe the upcoming 300-series chipsets intended for use with the chip giant's "Cannon Lake" processor family. Most notably, the chips are rumored to include support for USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Source: Benchlife Aside from the two new features, the rumored 300-series chipsets look to be pretty similar to existing 200-series offerings. That means they include connectivity for up to 24 lanes of PCIe 3.0, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, and six 6Gbps SATA ports. Benchlife goes on to say that much like previous generations, there will be a range of chipsets in the 300-series including the whole alphabet soup of Z, Q, H, and B-series models with progressively-reduced capabilities. If this info checks out, you can bet that Wi-Fi will be one of the first things to go as you move down the product stack. The site also says that Intel's next Core chips will be again built on 14-nm technology, something we heard earlier this year. According to that earlier report, it's possible that Cannon Lake desktop processors could come out on a 14-nm process, while mobile processors use a 10-nm process. The new rumors today pertain to the desktop chipsets ("-S" platform), but the benefits of integrating Wi-Fi into the mobile chipsets should be obvious. Benchlife says the desktop Cannon Lake processors are scheduled for release in Q4 of this year. Tags: CPUs Chipsets Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The X370 Gaming Pro Carbon-AC, X370 Gaming Plus, B350 Gaming Plus, and B350 Krait Gaming all belong to the company's Performance Gaming family, marking them as enthusiast-class hardware with an emphasis on stylish design. MSI says the X370 Gaming Pro Carbon-AC is the new flagship for its Socket AM4 Performance Gaming lineup. This board is fundamentally unchanged from the standard X370 Gaming Pro Carbon, except that MSI now throws an Intel Wi-Fi-plus-Bluetooth adapter in the box. With that said, this high-end offering sports a trio of PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, a pair of USB 3.1 ports, and a pair of M.2 sockets. Realtek-powered eight-channel audio and an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller complement the package. As befits a top-tier model, the X370 Gaming Pro Carbon offers onboard RGB LED lighting. Compared to the flagship model, the B350-chipset version of the Gaming Pro Carbon sacrifices two SATA ports, an M.2 socket, and SLI support. This board otherwise retains its bigger brother's accoutrements, including the USB 3.1 ports. The X370 Gaming Plus and B350 Gaming Plus bear the same edgy black-and-red color scheme common to most of MSI's gaming hardware, and are very similar in appearance as well as function. Almost all of the differences between the two boards come down to their chipsets' feature set. The X370 Gaming Plus comes with three PCIe x16 slots, six 6 Gbps SATA ports, and a pair of USB 3.1 ports. Meanwhile, the B350 Gaming Plus only has a pair of PCIe x16 slots, four SATA ports, and no USB 3.1 ports Both boards use Realtek controllers to provide LAN and audio functionality, and have a single PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 socket. The B350 Gaming Plus does offer some connectivity that its bigger brother doesn't have: two legacy PCI slots. Neither of these boards offers LED lighting. Finally, the B350 Krait Gaming is a little bit fancier than the B350 Gaming Plus above. The Krait is similar to the Gaming Plus in its basic layout, meaning you get two PCIe x16 slots, four DDR4 DIMM slots supporting up to 3200 MT/s, four 6 Gbps SATA ports, and an M.2 socket with four lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity. Since the B350 chipset doesn't offer USB 3.1 support, MSI added an ASMedia controller powering USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports at the rear panel. Lastly, there's backside white LED lighting to provide an ambient glow behind your motherboard. All five boards support for MSI's Mystic Light Sync via onboard RGB LED control headers. MSI didn't announce any prices for the new boards or say when they'll be available. We wager that they'll be showing up at e-tailers any moment now, though.

Caffe2 appears to be product driven, and is geared towards deploying machine-learning systems into smartphone applications and onto large-scale clusters. It differs from PyTorch, another software framework from Facebook that is more research oriented as it allows programmers to experiment with different neural network architectures more easily. Using AI in production is tricky, and Caffe2, written in a mix of Python and C++, tries to alleviate the pain. Facebook has been working with Nvidia to integrate Caffe2 into the graphics chip giant's deep-learning developer libraries so the framework can take advantage of hardware acceleration on Nv's GPUs. We're told, for example, Caffe2 is nippy on Facebook’s Big Basin OpenCompute AI servers that pack 64 Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs. Intel, Microsoft and Amazon have also stepped up to make sure Caffe2 is optimized for their systems and services. Meanwhile, Qualcomm’s Neural Processing Engine (NPE) software development kit supports Caffe2 and Google’s TensorFlow. This library glues software to the neural network math unit built into its top-end Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, which is appearing in smartphones, tablets and notebooks this year. Code using the engine will therefore gain a performance boost via the on-chip acceleration. The NPE dev kit will be available in July. It’s a sensible move, considering Qualcomm designs chips used in millions and millions of Android devices, and Facebook is investing heavily in augmented reality, a technology that will manipulate photos and video taken with smartphones. That's going to require some machine-learning processing to identify objects and meddle with them – hence the marriage between Caffe2, Qualcomm, and Facebook. And, hey, if that means developers using Facebook's tech to produce apps to rival SnapChat – the image-fiddling toy that's cool with the kids and in the way of Mark Zuckerberg's world domination plans – so much the better. “Augmented reality is going to help us mix the digital and physical in all new ways and that's going to make our physical reality better," Facebook CEO Zuckerberg told his social network's F8 conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. Caffe2 doesn't just add cartoon doodles over images. It's hoping to be more general purpose, allowing developers to create chatbots, hook up IoT devices, use machine translation and speech, and image classification algorithms for medical applications. Caffe, a predecessor of Caffe2, was developed by Yangqing Jia while he was a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. Jia is now a research scientist and leads Facebook’s efforts in building a general platform for its AI applications. ® Tips and corrections 1 Comment MORE Facebook Ai Deep Learning More from The Register Hacker cracks Facebook with remote code execution bug ImageMagick exploit earns chap US$40k bug bounty 13 Comments Oculus Drift: VR gaming boss out at Facebook Less-than-rosy Palmer leaving Zuck's $2bn lawsuit magnet 9 Comments NY court slaps down Facebook's attempt to keep accounts secret from search warrants Jurisdiction a problem for The Social Network™ 37 Comments Facebook's 'delightful' AI Clippy the Paperclip creeps into Messenger What fresh hell 35 Comments Facebook ‘Happy Birthday’ lawsuit rolls on Could be costly for Zuck.

Baidu will offer a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services, and will open source code and capabilities in obstacle perception, trajectory planning, vehicle control, vehicle operating systems and other functions, as well as a set of testing tools, it said in a statement. The project called Apollo, after the U.S. moon missions, could help speed up the development of self-driving cars, making the technology available sooner to smaller car makers and users at a more competitive price. Until now car makers and tech companies have been pursuing the development of self-driving cars independently or in close-knit alliances, guarding their inventions protectively as the ongoing lawsuit between Alphabet's Waymo and Uber Technologies indicates. “An open, innovative industry ecosystem initiated by Baidu will accelerate the development of autonomous driving in the U.S. and other developed automotive markets,” said Qi Lu, Baidu’s group president and chief operating officer in a statement. Baidu’s bid to create a standard platform will depend largely on how many partners sign on to the project. “What strikes me at first is the lack of any partners that have signed on. Open sourcing something is interesting, but only if other people join you,” said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. This is the challenge that currently faces Intel and BMW, who are trying to create an open platform for self driving cars, he added. In July last year, BMW, Intel and Mobileye said that they would work together to arrive at an industry standard and define an open platform for autonomous driving. Baidu has been testing its autonomous cars both in China and in the U.S. In 2015, it said it had tested a fully autonomous car in Beijing on a route that had mixed roads in a variety of environmental conditions. The company also received permission last year from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test its cars in the state, and tied with Nvidia for the development of a self-driving platform for companies in China and abroad. Baidu plans to first open its autonomous driving technology for restricted environments in July and will later share its technology for cars running autonomously in simple urban road conditions towards the end of the year. It plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads over time by 2020. It wasn’t immediately clear which areas of self-driving technology Baidu will continue to control over time. The company did not also disclose what was its revenue stream from the project. “How they make money is unclear but like Google with TensorFlow, I believe it's to get everyone building on their AI frameworks or that they own the data that they can monetize in numerous ways,” Moorhead said. Baidu did not immediately comment. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Blacktech Week Marlon Nichols, co-founder of Cross Culture Ventures, Chris Bennett, founder of Soldsie.com and Wonderschool, and Brian Brackeen, founder of Miami-based startup Kairos, talk about startup life at a VC in Residence fireside chat at WeWork. 1 of 2 Technology April 16, 2017 8:25 PM What would a venture capitalist say about that? Startups get a chance to find out By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Access to capital is lacking — that’s a common refrain among Miami area entrepreneurs, and particularly in minority communities. So Derick Pearson and Felecia Hatcher, founders of Code Fever and Blacktech Week, thought let’s bring the venture capitalists here. At a recent conference Pearson talked Marlon Nichols, co-founder and managing partner at Cross Culture Ventures and former investment director at Intel Capital, into agreeing to be Code Fever and Blacktech Week’s first VC in Residence. The program, thought to be one of the first of its kind, will have top venture capitalists spend a month in Miami advising and guiding black, Latinx and Caribbean entrepreneurs. Nichols, who generally splits his time between offices in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, took up residence at WeWork earlier this month and has been holding office hours, fireside chats and lunch and learns that will continue throughout the month to help sharp founders think through the businesses that they are building. It wasn’t a hard sell and the arrangement is benefiting both sides of the table. “You can’t beat coming to Miami in April, but more importantly, Miami is rich in culture and our investment thesis is about understanding global culture to try to predict where consumers are going to spend their dollars,” said the Jamaican-born Nichols in an interview last week. He leads one of the relative few black-led venture capital funds in the U.S. “Black and Latinx cultures have been known for early adopters, so for understanding what is going on in those communities as well as the Caribbean community, Miami is a melting pot. For me it is a lot of learning.” The new VC in Residence program is one of a number of Code Fever initiatives, which include producing Blacktech Week and Weekend, and it recently received $1.2 million in Knight funding. Entrepreneur-in-residence programs are commonly hosted at universities and accelerators to support entrepreneurs, solve problems and help innovate. Code Fever believes that borrowing from this model and inviting VCs to spend a month in residence in communities where there’s little access to funding can help reshape the way black communities are valued in the innovation sector. It’s a big challenge. Only about 1 percent venture capital funding goes to black founders, and only 13 black women founders in the entire nation have raised a million dollars or more in venture capital. In the half-hour office hour visits so far, Nichols has met with tech startups developing products or services for student debt, media content, cloud-based secure storage, educating inmates, dentistry and others. Most of the entrepreneurs are not yet at the stage for venture capital or do not have appropriate businesses for that kind of funding, but the door is still open. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them. Marlon Nichols, Cross Culture Ventures Some were interested in advice for preparing themselves for investment, others wanted mentorship on starting up or just wanted to talk strategy. And it hasn’t been all tech — Nichols met with a cupcake entrepreneur who wanted to talk about the best way to grow her business. And when companies are ready for investment, he wants to know about them. “I think gone are the days when all investments happen in Silicon Valley. ... Amazing companies can be created any where in the world and I want to keep my finger on the pulse of that. ... The biggest thing I will get out of this is developing a network here – with entrepreneurs I will keep in touch with, with angels here and organizations. They will help be eyes and ears for great investment opportunities here.” Nichols is also holding frequent fireside chats, bringing in entrepreneurs who have experience starting and growing companies. “The best resource for new entrepreneurs is successful entrepreneurs as well as unsuccessful entrepreneurs,” he said. “There is just a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from both.” Last week, Nichols hosted entrepreneurs Brian Brackeen of Miami-based Kairos and Chris Bennett of Wonderschool and Soldsie.com for a fireside chat, dinner and networking. Bennett grew up in Miami but moved to San Francisco in 2009. While both entrepreneurs have raised millions in venture capital and angel funding and gave advice on that, they also dished on the realities of startup life — including 180-degree pivots, botched pitches with important VCs, building and overbuilding without reaching product-market fit and somehow keeping a team focused through the toughest months. We also learned that Brackeen wakes himself up at 3 a.m. because he does his best work then, but don’t bother him at 3 p.m. — that’s nap time. Bennett is a big proponent of accelerators – he participated in NewME and 500 Startups — and he said he would do another one today. He also said the benefit to Silicon Valley is there are so many entrepreneurs, engineers and investors to learn from. “Talk to as many VCs as you can, because you learn what they care about. ... The best way to get ready for talking to VCs is to join an accelerator. The next best way is to surround yourself with entrepreneurs who have been successful and learn from them,” he said. Brackeen is bullish on the 305, including on the number of angels in South Florida and the growing infrastructure such as co-working spaces and accelerators — and maybe soon, innovation districts. “You can have the same success as a San Francisco company if you find the right people, find the right lawyer, find the right investors. There is not one model for the result,” he said. See more of their conversation here.   Coming up on Tuesday is a lunch and learn with Silicon Valley startup attorney Brian Patterson and a fireside chat with Diishan Imira, CEO and co-founder of Mayvenn. Pearson and Hatcher plan to bring more VCs down. Find more information about the VC in Residence program at blacktechweek.com/funding. For his part, Nichols said he has been impressed so far with the potential of Miami. “Successful ecosystems have universities spinning out technologies and talent, investors and angel groups, accelerators and co-working spaces — and challenges unique to those communities, that is the biggest thing. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them.” Nancy Dahlberg; @ndahlberg READ MORE: Blacktech Week receives $1.2 million in Knight funding to expand entrepreneur programs LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 15 days ago Moby microbe 1:25 15 days ago Moby microbe 5:13 4 months ago Mark Cuban: AT&T, Time Warner merger needed for competition with major tech companies 0:37 7 months ago A laser-powered robot caterpillar View More Video Technology Thumbs-up for electronic sports at the 2022 Asian Games Trump targets visa program he says hurts American workers Google search of town turns up gun-toting wedding photo Facebook wants to augment your reality Lawmakers push bill authorizing robot deliveries Technology Technology Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Miami Herald Rewards Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us NewsMedia in Education Public Insight Network Reader Panel Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Google+ Mobile Apps & eReaders Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Media Kit Commercial Printing Public Notices Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 April 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Don’t worry, driverless cars are learning from Grand Theft Auto As hyper-realistic videogames are able to generate data that’s very close to what AI agents can glean on the road, some researchers are now deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. — AFP In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realised there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix.  The blockbuster videogame is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co to Alphabet Inc’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway.  If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas – and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day.  “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the US in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.”  As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic videogames are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error.  Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector.  The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.)  The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team.  Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation.  Quick Brown Fox  Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.”  At Toyota Motor Corp’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions.  For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer.  A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written.  Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly travelling. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Phone app nabs Coachella festival cellphone thief Would you buy a new car online?

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. MacBook kicked off the future of Apple laptops — but what's the future of the 12-inch MacBook? In March of 2015, Apple introduced the all-new 12-inch MacBook. Not Air. Not Pro. And certainly not at the old, white, plastic MacBook's pricepoint. This was tomorrow's laptop today... As long as tomorrow you was willing to sacrifice power in the name of ultra-mobility. More shocking was its ports. More precisely, it's lack thereof. Gone was MagSafe, Apple's convenient, tumble-preventing, dent-saving connector. Gone was old-school USB-A. Nowhere was Thunderbolt. Instead, Apple introduced USB-C to Mac. And just one. That's the past future, though. What could Apple have in store for the 2017 MacBook? When will Apple update the MacBook? Here's the previous update schedule: March 2015: MacBook with Intel Broadwell CoreM March 2016: MacBook with Intel Skylake CoreM and rose gold color option March 2017 has come and gone without a new MacBook. No Intel Kaby Lake CoreM update so far this spring. Apple could drop a new MacBook at any time. If the updates are iterative, we could wake up to a press release and an updated web page any morning this spring. If there's anything that requires stage time at an Apple Keynote, though, we're looking at June 5 and WWDC at the earliest and September after that. Will the next MacBook get Touch Bar and Touch ID? Touch Bar has proven to be divisive. Apple seems to have anticipated really high attraction levels for Touch Bar. While some people like it, many others do not. So, will Apple stick with Touch Bar the way the company did all-USB-C, and push it out across the line? Or will Apple retrench and rethink its approach to touch? Touch ID, on the other hand, is pure win. It's such a convenience on MacBook Pro that not having it on the next MacBook would be a letdown. The only reason it might not be a lock is price point — it's essentially an embedded Apple Watch so it adds the cost of an Apple Watch, or about $300, to the bill. It's possible Apple could do what it did with MacBook Pro and offer MacBook (Escape) and MacBook (Touch Bar) options, the former with traditional function keys, the latter with OLED. Otherwise, fingers crossed Apple can figure out how to save a few dollars elsewhere and get Touch ID in and under budget. And a Force Touch Bar, right? Love the way you think! Touch Bar is begging for Force Touch, but it's unclear that would debut with a new MacBook rather than the next generation, Kaby Lake MacBook Pro. What about biometric different? Face or iris scan? Apple would have to figure out how to fit a much better camera in that razor-thin lid first, but year. Once iPhone gets a smart camera, there's no reason MacBooks shouldn't get it either. Windows alread does facial recognition to unlock and it'd be great on a Mac. That way, Apple Watch Auto Unlock, Touch ID, and Face Unlock could be in a three-way race! More USB-C? Like — gasp! — two? Apple was adamant that MacBook was the future of laptops. The company wanted to create a MacBook that was entirely wireless. Since wireless charging wasn't an option, though, Apple had to include at least one wire. So, it made that wire a multi-tasker. USB-C can both charge and carry data. Since one was infinitely more than none, that was enough, right? Wrong. Not only isn't wireless charging a thing yet, MacBooks still don't have LTE, and Bluetooth still isn't good enough to support real, diverse peripherals. The future, as always, is a beautiful lie. There are no doubt power and design constraints that may make two USB-C ports more challenging than one in a MacBook, especially when it comes to where they can be mounted on that tiny motherboard. I'd love them on both sides, like on the higher end MacBook Pro, so I can charge from either side. I'd settle for them both on one side. It would show Apple can still bring us the future but in a way that mitigates the real pain points of the present. And they'd be USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, right? RIGHT? Did I mention how much I love the way you think? Look, no blogger should ever substitute their fantasies for engineering realities. But if Thunderbolt 3 is possible on MacBook Pro, it'd be outstanding to have it on MacBook. Consistency is absolutely a customer-facing feature. You mentioned LTE, any chance...? I've always suspected getting LTE in a MacBook was more about the extortion-level licensing fees Qualcomm charges than any real philosophical or technical hurdles within Apple. The current round of lawsuits only deepens those suspicions. I very much hope we get LTE-equipped MacBooks and soon. We may just have to let the lawsuit dust settle first. Any chance it could run iOS, have a full multitouch display, and support Apple Pencil? Been snooping in the product labs again? That's more of a strategic decision for Apple than a technical one. Both MacBook and iPad Pro tackle the problem of ultra-light computing from different directions. Currently, macOS lacks a touch-first interface and that would take time and resources to build out (see Windows 8). Arguably that time and those resources would be better invested in making iOS a better primary computing platform on iPad and larger screens in general. iOS also lacks a pointer system, though adding selection (like on Apple TV) and cursor (like in text editing mode), seems like far less work. (Again, not an engineer, so everything seems both easy and impossible to me!) A MacBook that's essentially an iPad Pro with a proper keyboard, SurfaceBook-style, would be incredibly interesting to me. Apple prototypes everything, so we'll have to see what's interesting to them. But it'd be killer at coffee shops and on planes. I'm just saying... Jet black? (Product) RED? Ha! I knew that was what all this was coming to! MacBook is currently the only laptop from Apple that comes in color. (Sorry, MacBook Pro, silver and space gray aren't colors). Gold debuted with the original and rose gold came last year. I'm not sure if the Jet Black process scales or holds up to MacBook. I'd love to see it, microabrasions, and all. (Product Red) at that size would be a lot of red. Maybe too much red? Apple treats color finishes like features because that's how we treat them. We get as excited for new colors — more excited even — than we do for new configurations. Personally, I'd like to see how Apple would handle Space Blue or Space Purple. What do you want to see from the next MacBook? The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a bold new machine that pushes the future of displays, ports, and input, but it's also one that risks leaving many traditional Mac users behind. Whether that's ultimately good or bad, we'll have to wait in see. For now, it's your turn. What do you want to see in Apple's next Mac laptop?

A LOWER PRICE!! :-) That's what's holding us back, more than anything else. Well, that, and the keyboard to some extent. Here, we thought that the MacBook Air was like typing on a brick! Still, it'll beat the onscreen iPad keyboard. The only other feature we'd really want would be a second USB-C slot.

Most of the time it's laying mostly dormant with OS features such as AppNap, that's why the fans don't kick in unless you're doing something resource intensive. The fans only really kick in for me if I'm playing a game, installing an OS/large app update, and probably would kick in if I was doing something like video editing though I don't do that. You can always click the battery icon to see what applications are using a lot of power. Also, I'd rather see the iPhone have USB-C instead of Lightning, as opposed to having a Lightning port on the Mac, considering USB-C is a standard and Lightning is proprietary. 0 5 months ago Reply Isaiah Heart Price. Isaiah Heart. 2 5 months ago Reply cyberbob859 Have to agree with others that what needs to be changed is the price. I went to the Apple Store online, and priced out a 13" MacBook Pro (without the Touch Bar) and just went with the lowest end configuration (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD). I included AppleCare (I get it for completely new design changes), and a USB C to USB A dongle (which I will need to attach older peripherals.) With tax, this came out to almost $1800 US. And this is for the lowest end MacBook Pro (which, IMO, with this configuration and specs, should probably be more accurately designated a MacBook Plus.) Wow. This is simply more money than I'm willing to spend. I really don't know what Apple is trying to accomplish. Reading comments here and on other sites on the web, I see two general themes - for general consumers/prosumers, the price is too high. For true professionals, the hardware (especially RAM) isn't good enough. Maybe Apple is just trying to push the general consumer to an iPad Pro, so the whole story won't be told until next year when the iPad line is updated along with the iMac. 3 5 months ago Reply paulrubin3 The MacBook Pros are simply too expensive. No more. No less. They were already too expensive before and were literally many hundreds too expensive over this past year given how obsolete some of the internals were but now they're $300-$500 more than before when they were $100-$300 too much to begin with. That's problem number one. The MacBook Air was overpriced at $999 and now it goes into the holiday season just as overpriced and more obsolete. A token $100 cut was an absolute necessity and there really should have been some upgrades made to the internals even at that price. The 12" MacBook needs to go down $200. There are other laptops with similar components and specs with some additional functionality. $1099 and $1299 for the two models was another must have and if those two devices don't replace the MacBook Air (and get upgraded internally) by this time next year, look for Mac laptop sales to fall off 25% or more. And there's zero reason to have the previous gen 13" MacBook pro at $1299. Apple needs to cut prices of its obsolete stuff like it does the iPhone. 2 5 months ago Reply bunkrich I want a lightning in port. Now no wired headphones with both the iPhone and new Macs.

I personally don't mind them being separate, however I want to see a more "desktop-os" approach to the iPad Pro at least, that means at least a file-system, and some actual Pro apps (Logic Pro, Final Cut Pro) as well as development tools such as Xcode 2 5 months ago Reply GGIBS For the price they are asking I feel that a 4K screen is not an unreasonable ask. Yes you don't need 4K on a 15 inch screen but you don't "need" it on a 21.5 inch screen either.

People were living a #donglelife back then, but only on Thunderbolt 1.0. I could understand the MacBook Nothing giving you no legacy options; the legacy options were to buy other MacBooks. For the Pro machine though, there's been no concession for it. Apparently Phil Schiller has said that powering 32GB RAM would be too costly on battery life. Well then fatten up the machine with more batteries then! They probably could've achieved the appropriate level of battery life and still come in thinner and lighter (just) than the old design. Other than that I'd go for: 1x legacy USB-A Charger to magsafe-ify the Thunderbolt 3/USB-C connector on the male end (still allows any of the 4 ports to take power HDMI 2.0 - yes this will output only 4K, but the old system used 1080p HDMI with Thunderbolt 1 or 2 supporting higher resolutions 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK I don't know why legacy ports are needed on a next-generation MacBook, it should have just next-generation ports. They should just do the same as they did with the iPhone 7 and include the adapters in the box 0 5 months ago Reply DirkUs47 I think for the first of a new-generation MBP, in the here and now, a level of transition should've been considered. They are answering the question of, "What do I do with my gazillion USB peripherals?" by telling you to spend a bit more money (on top of thousands) on dongles. For the iPhone going to Lightning, aside from chargers, USB cables and speaker docks, there wasn't much in the way of different peripherals. This made the transition easier. For USB-A to USB-C, there are so many more devices people have invested in over close to 20 years. Even for Firewire, they included the FW400 6 pin and FW800 9 pin on the same system even though there were so few (comparative to USB) devices in existence and the Firewire market switched to 9 pin very quickly. Whether as you say, include adaptors in the box (the price of these machines would allow that), or build in some legacy ports, they should've addressed the current day landscape better. I still maintain that HDMI 2.0 would've been a good idea. The now old MBPs included HDMI as a user requested feature. 2011 and prior required a dongle from miniDP or mini-DVI to HDMI. They could've continued down that path, but they allowed concession for that port. They've essentially gone back to the 2011 idea of "buy a dongle" when it comes to video out. My girlfriend has a 2011 MBP and she's annoyed when I can hook up my 2012 rMBP to a TV with no fuss. Unless TVs will include video in via type-C in addition to HDMI on mass as a standard feature, we're going backwards. 0 5 months ago Reply Ultimate_Nick I would of kept an Hdmi port because thats the most common one for connecting a monitor and now we have to buy an adapter Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Technically you're not using any more cables than before.

How many VMs are you running at once? 1 5 months ago Reply smart_burro TL;DR - Make the MBP a 2 in 1 that runs both macOS and iOS or iOS that incorporates macOS features. More port options. Apple Pencil support. Fix the **** Mac App Store. 1. The Touch Bar is a welcome addition, but I want a 2 in 1 device from Apple. They don't need to add a touch interface to macOS to do this. Instead make the screen detachable and capable of running a modified version of iOS. Or just make a version of iOS that supports a trackpad, has finder or something similar, and incorporate other macOS features on the software side. Also, start making Apple Pencil compatible with all Mac and iOS devices. I would be willing to pay the combined price of a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro just so I could have 1 device for all my needs. With their release of the Surface Studio and Surface Book Microsoft is starting to beat Apple at their own game. The updates to the MBP are great, but given how long it's been since Apple done a significant refresh of the MBP I was expecting much more. It's a sad day when Windows PC manufacturers are out innovating Apple. 2. Add back the SD card slot. I have a micro SD adapter that allows me to add 128 GB of additional storage to my current MBP, sits flush with the case and is aluminum so you can't even tell it's there. Removing the SD card slot just means I will need yet another adapter. 3. More ports. 4 USB-C ports is nice, but since so many devices have yet to make the switch it would seem logical that Apple would include a legacy USB port and HDMI. Yes I know there are adapters and dongles, but too many and the Mac becomes a cluttered mess. 4. In lieu of a touch friendly interface it would be cool if they replaced the trackpad with an OLED screen that you could use the Apple Pencil to draw on. 5. Bring the True Tone display to the MBP, and every other product with a screen. 6. "Hey Siri". Im not a fan of having to click something or use a keyboard shortcut to access Siri on the Mac. Hey Siri is great on the iPhone and Apple Watch and would be a welcome addition to macOS. 7. On the software side, get serious about the Mac App Store or shut it down. The quality of apps on the store is hit or miss due to many devs deciding to pull their apps or not sell future versions through the store. Rapid Weaver is a prime example of this. Rapid Weaver 5 is still being sold ok the App Store for $89 while Realmac Software is selling Rapid Weaver 7 on their website but not on the App Store. Apple really needs to come up with a solution that allows trial periods and discounted upgrades to new versions. Devs are what make Apple's devices so good.

Topping out at 16GB works against Apple's theme of "Macbook Pro as workstation", especially for demanding "Pro" workflows like 4k video production, high-resolution photo and image editing, software development running N+1 virtual machines with a side of Xcode, etc. Having toes (cough, entire limbs) in those waters, the extra RAM really does make a difference. This generation of Macbook Pro leaves the high-end to the ever-slower cycle times for the iMac and Mac Pro. Supporting 32GB RAM wouldn't have been a 100% win either, since still there's real value to Apple's push for thinner and lighter. It's hard to handle the svelte Macbook and not imagine a Macbook Pro that gives that same featherweight impression.

Now only real pros (i.e. people who make money from their laptop) can afford to pay the high price of the new MacBook Pros. 2 5 months ago Reply n8ter#AC Maybe they're ceding that market to Microsoft. I actually think that may be a factor, now that Windows actually has fantastic hardware out there in the MacBook Air and Pro price points. It's probably getting harder to sell the laptops, so now they have to be more targeted in who they're selling to the MBP to. I agree with you. I'm sort of the same type of user as you, and it's why I got an iMac and was planning on getting a MacBook (initially got one, but returned it for the iMac since I already had a Windows Notebook). There's no way I can justify buying these inflexible machines over something like a Surface Book or even a Surface Pro - never mind the amazing options coming out of Dell, HP, ASUS, and Lenovo. As a faux-professional, I also find myself using Windows more, as it has more options for that kind of software compared to OS X. You have options for Corel, Cyberlink, Magix, etc. which simply do not exist on macOS; and this often ends up costing you more money if you go with macOS as well. Maybe it was just a failed experiment on my part, but I did install Windows 10 in Boot Camp during the promotion with my Windows 7 Key, just to make sure I could always "switch back" on the desktop without buying a new machine (or a Retail Windows License) ;-) I'm starting to get the itch to reinstall it, but I don't want my Mac to feel lackluster because I never run macOS on it, Lol. May just sell and replace it. If I get rid of the Mac, then I'm going to have to get rid of the iPhone as well, as it works poorly with non-Apple devices/OSes. 0 5 months ago Reply Bounou The surface book is not really a cheaper alternative to the MacBooks, dollar for dollar you will get more performance from the MacBook Pro 15", of course the surface book does quite a few things the MacBook does not. 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK The main thing the Surface Book does that the MacBook Pro doesn't is that it has a touch screen with stylus.

For people like app/web developers, video editors or even graphics editors that don't require the ability to draw as they're simply editing photographs, the MBP may be the better option 0 5 months ago Reply Howie Billard Exactly, There needs to be something for the hobbyist around the $1500- $1600 CAD mark, that has a little more oomph than the 12" MacBook. I have a mid 2014 13" MBP that was listed at $1599 CAD IIRC. I have it boot camped to play World of Tanks with the kids. I have a nifti drive with a 128GB micro SSD with my iTunes catalogue on it to make up for the flash storage lost to Windows. I really like this machine, and when it gives out, hopefully in a long time, I'd like to be able to replace it with something comparable for under 2K. What I would consider equivalent to this would set me back $2299 CAD 0 5 months ago Reply Harlan Lachman Going back to more charging/connection ports (I have 7 on my late 2013 Macbook Pro not counting the headphone jack which I use for my external speaker). What peripherals that I now use am I supposed to dispense with? One USB-A port would enable me to continue to use myUSB multiport to delay needing dongles or replacement peripherals for ones that work and I like.. The SD card slot to ensure I can easily load pictures from my two pre-wifi multi-thousand dollar camera systems. And a legacy Thunderbolt port would save me the cost of another cable. I will be delaying replacing my Mac for as long as it works. 1 5 months ago Reply MikhailT I would start by making them Macbooks, not MBPs. For Macbooks, switch to much cheaper PCIe TLC SSDs, stick with 2 TB3 ports and drop the price down by 200-300$. Make Touch bar a BTO on the 999$ Macbook, don't complicate the line up with 3-4 separate models. For MBPs, the focus isn't on the battery life but for performance. That means thicker chassis with larger battery, 32GB support with LPDDR4X, use the fastest PCIe that they have now, support eGPUs out of the box with 4 TB3 ports. Bundle in a few common dongles, absolutely the long power cords included as well. 3 5 months ago Reply mr_coldharbour 1) kept the SD card slot 2) kept MagSafe 2 power port 3) kept at least one "legacy" port such as HDMI (I use that daily when plugging my 15" rMBP to my TV). Or included an adapter or two in the box. 4) added an extra ThunderBolt 3 port for the 15" MBP at least. 5) had more powerful and dedicated AMD GPUs in the lineup at least for the 15" model. 6) added a 32GB RAM option for the 15" model if Apple is not planning on updating the Mac Pro any longer. 0 5 months ago Reply Rowanova I forgot about the HDMI loss, good point. Makes sense for a lot of users. 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK It makes more sense to include an adapter in the box rather than add an old port to the Mac, since USB-C is capable of this 0 5 months ago Reply Ruurd Pels Keep the SD card slot. Keep the Esc key. Keep the magsafe charger. Love the touchpad and the touch bar. From what I've seen they're great. 1 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK I've never used the Esc key except in games to go back to the main menu, and these machines are not primarily designed for gaming 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Just adding to this comment as I recently realized you can close dialog boxes with the Esc key, so that could be a problem for some people. Applications like the terminal should show the Esc key by default 0 5 months ago Reply Egvick I really would have liked to see the retention of magsafe. That is one of the best things they brought to market, and it's being emulated across the board now. USB-C charging is really a step back from magsafe in my opinion. 5 5 months ago Reply Ziich47 Keep the SD card slot Make some sort of USB c magsafe charger More than 4 USB c ports Retained the extension cable More powerful dedicated graphics card option for the 15 inch 32 GB ram option 4 5 months ago Reply Rowanova i personally wouldn't need more than 16 GB of RAM, but I also don't get the "Pro" moniker when limiting some of the pro people who'd use it to its namesake. 1 5 months ago Reply JBSlough They got rid of the extension cable for the charger? That sucks. 0 5 months ago Reply dandbj13 Price! They could have included the Touch Bar on the $1499 model. It is odd that $1500 is not enough to get a Touch Bar. 8 5 months ago Reply Moodyz This. Their recent pricing moves on the Mac side have been downright ridiculous. 5 5 months ago Reply smart_burro Agree. For the price I expected much more. At the very least they should have waited for the Kabylake processors. Going into the event I was planning on buying a new MBP as soon as they are released, but will likely now wait until mid to end of 2017. By then they'll have at least upgraded the processors the Kabylake. If my late 2013 15" MBP continues to do everything I need it to I may wait even longer. I REALLY wish Apple would suck up their pride and make a 2 in 1 device. I have come close a couple times to getting a Surface Pro or Book, but have resisted because I am heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem. That and I really don't care for the Surface Pro's trackpad and paying MBP prices for the Surface Book is hard to justify since I'm not sure how I will like working on a windows machine again. Bad news, my inner geek has to wait a little while longer before scratching the new laptop itch. Good news, my wallet won't be emptied out quite yet.

They're built for portability and yet after these years (decades?) they still possess no LTE chips to do what they were designed to do in the first place - be portable. Kind of ridiculous when we think about it. But, as Rene points out, maybe it's the licensing. But even then, give customers the option of LTE models, or not.

I bought a couple LTE iPads but eventually realized that I didn't need the LTE and data plan because I usually had access to wifi (even when out and about) when I was using my iPad. When I didn't it was easy to just use my iPhone as a hotspot or use my Karma Go hotspot. I could see why others would want it though. Especially for folks on an unlimited data plan that can't use their iPhone as a hotspot.

The adapter is only needed until everyone moves on to USB-C technology which won't take long. USB-C is capable of replacing the HDMI port so it makes sense the HDMI port isn't there either. Essentially you won't need any more cables for this, you just need to replace your HDMI-HDMI cable with a USB-C to HDMI cable. The SD card reader has been removed because barely anyone uses it anymore. Most people have cameras now that can transfer through Wi-Fi, which is a lot easier than having to take the SD card out, put it in your Mac, transferring the photos, then putting the SD card back into your camera. The headphone jack was removed from the iPhone because it can only deliver audio, it's an old port and needed to go. Using audio via the Lightning port or a USB-C port provides better audio fidelity and also the possibility of other features. Someone mentioned you could have headphones with a thermal sensor, for example, only possible when the headphones are plugged into a digital port. Eventually the headphone jack will be gone from the Mac too. You haven't even tried the keyboard yet, give it a chance. When the new Macs are in store, try the keyboard out, then give us your opinion. I agree with you on removing the glowing logo and MagSafe. I loved both of these things and it's a shame they've gone, but the rest of the changes do make sense to me, the future is having 1 type of port that can handle everything, and anything that can be done wirelessly might as well be done wirelessly. 0 5 months ago Reply apple lover 84 the word future is the key hear. i agree the future is usb type c and that is why i think that they should have added them as well. but to take everything that makes it currently functional away and then tell me oh but you won't need it soon and hear is a bunch of dongles or go buy all new cables is just completely the wrong way to do it. this would have been the right move for the next redesign not this one, its just too soon and this future that is usb c is just not ready yet. in 5 years absolutely maybe even 3 but not now. usb A is absolutely everywhere and still the current standard. i agree in the future usb c will gradually be adopted but the future is not hear yet. and won't be for many years to come. they had the right idea but the wrong execution. sd cards are not going anywhere and not everything is wireless yet the fact is people have thousands and tens of thousands of dollars invested in current technology that still depends on sd cards and usb A not to mention legacy equipment such as storage. i am flexible when it comes to HDMI as i was with ethernet but leave me at least one usb A port and my sd card reader so i can still function at least. DONGLES ARE NOT THE FUTURE THEY ARE THE FAILURE!!! 0 5 months ago Reply badMojo69 Yes USB C on everything even the iPhone. Time to kill the Lightning Port. 0 5 months ago Reply tokekijo Agreed!! Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply toneofark I agree. 0 5 months ago Reply smart_burro Should have been done with the iPhone 7 but instead they killed the headphone jack and include lightning headphones. This is basically Apple saying their going to keep the lightning port on the iPhone and not replace it with USB-C. If they did that they would lose their licensing (MFi program) revenue for the manufacturers who make Made for Apple lightning cables. Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK You're completely unaware of how Apple pushes, and has pushed in the past, new standards. Apple has a cruel way of pushing new technology, but I can tell you one thing, it works. By forcing people to use new ports, manufacturers suddenly realize they need to start making USB-C stuff fast. Then there you have it, you've got USB-C accessories in a short amount of time. However, if Apple did what you said and keep USB-A on there because it's "still widely used", manufacturers would be like "Well, the USB-A is still there, we can delay the manufacturing of USB-C accessories until later", and it'd be an incredibly slow process getting USB-C stuff out there. Although it doesn't look like it, Apple has done it the right way and they've done it like this in the past with great results. It's a "be cruel to be kind" situation, just hold tight and soon you won't need dongles anymore when the USB-C stuff comes along, which it will soon 0 5 months ago Reply cmdacos Apple isn't making any push into the future. They are driving arrogance over their former mantra of simplicity and user experience. If they really wanted to move into the future, there wouldn't be any ports at all. Everything can be done through wifi or Bluetooth streaming and although only in its initial stages, power can be sourced either inductively or completely wireless. Apple is not trying to push forward, they proved that 100% by keeping the headphone jack. The inclusion of a USB a port, even a single one would be the right thing to do at this very early stage of tech conversion into the future. The peripherals required by anyone beyond an Instagram Pro like the bloggers on iMore will still be scarce in USB C for over a year. This is Apple saying FU to user simplicity and functionality and saying buy dongles or suffer. Posted via the iMore App for Android -2 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Saying that Apple doesn't want to move into the future just because they kept the headphone jack on the Mac is silly. Come on, you were hating Apple removing the headphone jack, now that they keep it on this product you still have something to complain about? As usual with people that hate Apple, Apple can do no right in their eyes, it's always a lose/lose situation. Yes everything could be done wirelessly, but some things still need to be kept wired for speed. For example you may have created a very large backup on an external hard drive that you need to move to your Mac, this could take a lot longer through a wireless connection. As for inductive charging, it's clear Apple doesn't support this as they haven't implemented it on their mobile devices either. I don't support inductive charging either, and calling it "wireless" charging is exactly the reason I don't support it, it's not wireless and in essence it limits you even more than wired charged for mobile devices, because as soon as you pick up your phone it will stop charging. To me (and probably Apple too) inductive charging is just a gimmick. When the technology for true wireless charging becomes available, where your device isn't touching anything and is just in the range of a charging station, that's when Apple will implement that kind of charging 1 5 months ago Reply cmdacos That's why I included wireless charging separate from inductive. It exists. Patents are out there. And I am not complaining that the MBP still has the headphone Jack. What I am complaining about is the or spin that was put out saying that the decision was a move to wards the future. It wasn't and the MPB proves it. It was simply apple being arrogant. Saying that wires need to stay because of data speed is also no different then everyone else saying headphone jacks need to stay because of superior sound quality. You said it was a non issue and people need to get over it and move forward. Same goes then for the need for wired data transfer speed. Get over it. You either are simply an apologist or you only have an opinion the mirrors Rene which in turn still makes you an apologist. Posted via the iMore App for Android -2 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK Having the headphone jack removed doesn't mean you can't used wired headphones. You use them with a Lightning/USB-C port so you still get superior audio quality. It is a non-issue. 0 5 months ago Reply MacBipes I believe the new MacBook Pro (both 13 and 15) have the headphone jack. Look at the images on Apple's web site. Apologies if you are referring to something else. 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK They do, although cmdacos is trying to say that Apple do not agree the headphone jack is old simply because they left it in the latest Macs. It will go from the Macs eventually, Apple is just giving the Macs more time than they did with the iPhone 0 5 months ago Reply smart_burro So how are you suppose to use the new lightning EarPods with the new MacBook since it doesn't have a lightning port to plug them into? I agree that USB-C is the future, but the fact is many devices recently, currently, and in the near future will still use legacy USB ports. For a computer that is called a "Pro" I would expect that I could plug in any current device without hr need of yet another dongle. SD cards are used for more than just transferring photos from a camera to a computer. On my 2013 MBP I have a microSD card plugged using an adapter that allows it to sit flush with the case and matches the material of the case. I have this card plugged in 24/7 and use it to add 128 GB of storage to my MBP. The removal of the SD card slot and the USB ports makes my cynical side believe this was all done to push users to buy Apple dongles and purchase a bigger HD than we would need to with options like an SD card. I am a diehard Apple fan but I am growing tired of them taking their customers for fools. Sent from the iMore App 0 5 months ago Reply DannyJJK I think you're reading into this too much. The majority of MacBook Pro users don't use an SD card, you're a unique case unfortunately, that's why it was removed. With the USB ports, it depends what you class as the "near future", but I think in a year's time most devices won't use any legacy USB ports anymore, it just wouldn't make sense, we have to move forward, not backwards 0 5 months ago Reply Galaxy_Man "Most people have cameras now that can transfer through Wi-Fi" Most?! 0 2 days ago Reply gerardo2068 touch screen on laptops sucks. just stop please stop this BS 0 5 months ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Amazon has knocked $30 off the sticker price of AMD's Ryzen 7 1800X processor Anyone building a new PC should take a look at this deal on the Ryzen 7 1800X. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 19 April, 2017 05:00 0 - - - - print email IDG Let the PC builds begin. Right now, Amazon is selling the top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 1800X for $470, or $30 off the sticker price. That's one of the best deals we've seen so far among the big retailers. Note that this discount isn't tied to any particular sale, so it could disappear at any time. The 1800X is an eight-core, 16-thread processor with a 3.60GHz base clock and an amazing 95W TDP. At $499, the 1800X was already a better deal than Intel's comparably powerful Skylake CPU, the Core i7-6900K, which is a plus-$1,000 processor with a TDP of 140W. In our Ryzen review, the 1800X matched or beat the 6900K on a number of benchmark performances. The one thing to be aware of is that AMD's Ryzen 7 still isn't quite as fast as Intel processors when it comes to gaming. They'll do just fine, however, and the story is more complicated than we can cover here. Check out our full discussion of gaming and Ryzen from early March for more details. Nevertheless, the Ryzen 7 1800X is an impressive chip that will serve most users well. Also, don't forget to pick up a CPU cooler as this processor doesn't come with a stock cooler in the box. As we mentioned last time, for a quality cooler at a good price check out the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo.

Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

(Photo: Rockstar Games) 4 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why “Grand Theft Auto V” is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas — and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from “Super Mario Bros.” to “Angry Birds” for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from “Grand Theft Auto V.” Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly traveling. 4 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2oSx0yn TOP VIDEOS Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

Firms such as Tata, Infosys (INFY) , and Cognizant (CTSH) that outsource tech jobs are the biggest sponsors of H-1B visas, which allow 85,000 foreign workers each year to fill jobs requiring specific skills. IBM (IBM) , Microsoft (MSFT) , Amazon (AMZN) , Intel (INTC) , Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Apple (AAPL) are also participants, according to stats from Howard University professor Ron Hira. Bucking a recent trend, the number of applicants actually fell this year from 236,000 to 199,000 during the brief application window between April 3 and April 7. The administration caused a stir this year with the Department of Homeland Security disclosing on the eve of the filing date that it would provide extra scrutiny to some categories.  Trump has targeted the H-1B program, claiming they are a source of cheap labor. The White House says 80% of participants receive less than the median wage for their jobs, while 10% get the median wage and 5% or 6% are in the upper echelon for earnings in their niche. The White House noted in its background briefing on Monday that it's planning to conduct a 220-day review of the program. The President wants the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to look for any fraud or abuse, while the administration plans other changes such as shifting from a lottery to merit-based selection criteria.  Height Securities LLC analyst Peter Cohn observed in a Tuesday note that the timeline suggests that developments could come around Thanksgiving Day. "Changes to existing regulations, if any, will still require a lengthy rule-making process subject to notice and comment, and any recommended changes to statute will have to come from Congress, which we believe is unlikely to act prior to the 2018 elections," Height Securities LLC analyst Peter Cohn said.

Homepage Follow Sign in / Sign up Home Patterns Methodology Strategy Newsletter Samuel CozannetBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Apr 18 How we commoditized GPUs for Kubernetes Over the last 4 months I have blogged 4 times about the enablement of GPUs in Kubernetes. Each time I did so, I spent several days building and destroying clusters until it was just right, making the experience as fluid as possible for adventurous readers. It was not the easiest task as the environments were different (cloud, bare metal), the hardware was different (g2.xlarge have old K20s, p2 instances have K80s, I had 1060GTX at home but on consumer grade Intel NUC…). As a result, I also spent several hours supporting people to set up clusters. Usually with success, but I must admit some environments have been challenging. Thankfully the team at Canonical in charge of developing the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes have productized GPU integration and made it so easy to use that it would just be a shame not to talk about it. And as of course happiness never comes alone, I was lucky enough to be allocated 3 brand new, production grade Pascal P5000 by our nVidia friends. I could have installed these in my playful rig to replace the 1060GTX boards. But this would have showed little gratitude for the exceptional gift I received from nVidia. Instead, I decided to go for a full blown “production grade” bare metal cluster, which will allow me to replicate most of the environments customers and partners have. I chose to go for 3x Dell T630 servers, which can be GPU enabled and are very capable machines. I received them a couple of week ago, and… Please don’t mind the cables, I don’t have a rack… There we are! Ready for some awesomeness? What it was in the past If you remember the other posts, the sequence was: Deploy a “normal” K8s cluster with Juju; Add a CUDA charm and relate it to the right group of Kubernetes workers; Connect on each node, and activate privileged containers, and add the experimental-nvidia-gpu tag to the kubelet. Restart kubelet; Connect on the API Server, add the experimental-nvidia-gpu tag and restart the API server; Test that the drivers were installed OK and made available in k8s with Juju and Kubernetes commands. Overall, on top of the Kubernetes installation, with all the scripting in the world, no less than 30 to 45min were lost to perform the specific maintenance for GPU enablement. It is better than having no GPUs, but it is often too much for the operators of the clusters who want an instant solution. How is it now? I am happy to say that the requests of the community have been heard loud and clear. As of Kubernetes 1.6.1, and the matching GA release of the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes, the new experience is : Deploy a normal K8s cluster with Juju Yes, you read that well. Single command deployment of GPU-enabled Kubernetes Cluster Since 1.6.1, the charms will now: watch for GPU availability every 5min. For clouds like GCE, where GPUs can be added on the fly to instances, this makes sure that no GPU will ever be forgotten; If one or more GPUs are detected on a worker, the latest and greatest CUDA drivers will be installed on the node, the kubelet reconfigured and restarted automagically; Then the worker will communicate its new state to the master, which will in return also reconfigure the API server and accept GPU workloads; In case you have a mixed cluster with some nodes with GPUs and others without, only the right nodes will attempt to install CUDA and accept privileged containers. You don’t believe me? Fair enough. Watch me… Requirements For the following, you’ll need: Basic understanding of the Canonical toolbox: Ubuntu, Juju, MAAS… Basic understanding of Kubernetes A little bit of Helm at the end and for the files, cloning the repo: git clone https://github.com/madeden/blogposts cd blogposts/k8s-ethereum Putting it to the test In the cloud Deploying in the cloud is trivial.

That’s it, you can see the K80 from the p2.xlarge instance. I didn’t do anything about it, it was completely automated. This is Kubernetes on GPU steroids. The important option in the bundle file we deployed is: options:       "allow-privileged": "true" If you want to prevent privileged containers until absolutely necessary, you can use the tag “auto”, which will only activate them if GPUs are detected. On Bare Metal Obviously there is a little more to do on Bare Metal, and I will refer you to my previous posts to understand how to set MAAS up & running. This assumes it is already working. Adding the T630 to MAAS is a breeze. If you don’t change the default iDRAC username password (root/calvin), the only thing you have to do it connect them to a network (a specific VLAN for management is preferred of course), set the IP address, and add to MAAS with an IPMI Power type. Adding the nodes into MAAS Then commission the nodes as you would with any other. This time, you won’t need to press the power button like I had to with the NUC cluster: MAAS will trigger via the IPMI card directly, request a PXE boot, and register the node, all fully automagically. Once that is done, tag them “gpu” to make sure to recognize them. details about the T630 in MAAS Then juju bootstrap maas juju deploy src/bundles/k8s-1cpu-3gpu.yaml watch -c juju status --color Wait for a few minutes… You will see at some point that the charm is now installing CUDA drivers.

Again, no user interaction. How awesome is this? Note that the interesting aspects are not only that it automated the GPU enablement, but also that the bundle files (the yaml content) are essentially the same, but for the machine constraints we set. Having some fun with GPUs If you follow me you know I’ve been playing with Tensorflow, so that would be a use case, but I actually wanted to get some raw fun with them! One of my readers mentioned bitcoin mining once, so I decided to go for it. I made a quick and dirty Helm Chart for an Ethereum Miner, along with a simple rig monitoring system called ethmon. This chart will let you configure how many nodes, and how many GPU per node you want to use. Then you can also tweak the miner. For now, it only works in ETH only mode. Don’t forget to create a values.yaml file to add your own wallet (if you keep the default you’ll actually pay me, which is fine :) but not necessarily your purpose), update the ingress xip.io endpoint to match the public IP of one of your workers or use your own DNS Adjust the number of workers and GPUs per worker then cd ~ git clone https://github.com/madeden/charts.git cd charts helm init helm install claymore --name claymore --values /path/to/yourvalues.yaml By default, you’ll get the 3 worker nodes, with 2 GPUs (this is to work on my rig at home) KubeUI with the miners deployed Monitoring interface (ethmon) What did I learn from it? Well, I really need to work on my tuning per card here! The P5000 and the 1060GTX have the same performances, and they also are the same as my Quadro M4000. This is not right (or there is a cap somewhere). But I’m a newbie, I’ll get better. It’s probably not worth it money wise. This would make me less than $100/month with this cluster, less than my electricity bill to run it. There is a LOT of room for Monero mining on the CPU! I run at less than a core for the 6 workers. I’ll probably update it to run less workers, but with all the GPUs allocated to them. But it was very fun to make. And now apparently I need to do “monero”, which is supposedly ASIC resistent and should be more profitable. Stay tuned ;) If you’re interested you can track the evolution of my tuning. Conclusion 3 months ago, I recognize running Kubernetes with GPUs wasn’t a trivial job. It was possible, but you needed to really want it. Today, if you are looking for CUDA workloads, I challenge you to find anything easier than the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes to run that, on Bare Metal or in the cloud. It is literally so trivial to make it work that it’s boring. Exactly what you want from infrastructure. GPUs are the new normal. Get used to it. So, let me know of your use cases, and I will put this cluster to work on something a little more useful for mankind than a couple of ETH! I am always happy to do some skunk work, and if you combine GPUs and Kubernetes, you’ll just be targeting my 2 favorite things in the compute world. Shoot me a message @SaMnCo_23!

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news concerning the upcoming iMac update. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday. Source: Apple New iMac: A new rumor claims that AAPL will release its new iMac updates during the third quarter of 2017, reports DigiTimes. According to the rumor, the company will launch two updates to the iMac line this year. These will be new versions of the 21.5-inch and a 27-inch iMac computers. Quanta Computer will reportedly begin production of the new computers in May. The rumor also says the new iMac models will come with Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor and the latest discrete graphics card. iPhone 8: More rumors backup previous rumors of iPhone 8 features, Bloomberg notes. The rumors claim that the tech company will release a new high-end device this year with a screen that takes up almost the entire front of the device. This will allow it to have a display about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, but on a device that is roughly as big as an iPhone 7. The rumors also say that the device may face a delay due to supply issues. The display may also be curved and Touch ID could be moved to below it. Headphone Jack Adapter: Rumor has it that Apple will still include its headphone hack adapter with its 2017 smartphones, reports MacRumors. However, it says that it is unlikely the tech will include the device with its 2018 models. Previous rumors have claimed that AAPL will get rid of the adapter this year. Apple started including the adapter with its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones. These were the first of its smartphones to ditch the 3.5 mm headphone jack.

Believe it or not, some of the best gaming PCs are under $1000. However, they face stiff competition from Microsoft and Sony, both who produce excellent gaming consoles for less than $500. Thankfully, many of the top premade PC manufacturers have realized that in order to keep up with their living room competition, they must bring the cost of entry down to remain competitive. So, here are our picks for the 5 top gaming PCs under $1,000. Top Gaming PC Under $1,000 2017   CyberPowerPC Gamer Dragon Syber Vapor One Alienware X51 R3 Digital Velocity Micro Vanquish 4 Lenovo Erazer X315 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice #2 #3 #4 #5 Amazon Rating na na Processor Type/Speed Intel Core i7 4790K 4.0GHz Intel Core i5-4690K 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7-6700 4.0GHz Intel Core i5-6500 3.2Ghz (6th-gen Skylake) A10-Series APU A10-7850K 3.7GHz Graphics Card AMD R9 380 4GB AMD R9 380 4GB AMD R9 370 4GB Nvidia GTX 960 AMD Radeon R9 260 2GB Available RAM/Speed 8GB/1600MHz 8GB/2133MHz 8GB/2133MHz 8GB/2133MHz 16GB/1600MHz Storage (SSD/HDD) 1TB HDD 1TB HDD 256GB/1TB 120GB/1TB 2TB Audio Onboard Realtek Audio Onboard 7.1 Audio Onboard Realtek Audio Onboard Realtek Audio Onboard 7.1 Audio Warranty 3 Years Labor /3 Year Parts 1 Year Parts /3 Year Labor 1 Year Parts/Labor 1 Year Parts/ 3 Year Labor 3 Year Parts/Labor Price $919 $964 $999 $999 $949 View on Cyberpower View on Amazon View on Amazon View on Digital Storm View on Amazon #1 Pick CyberPower PC’s Gamer Dragon This much power never came so cheap WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dragon is the best pick for 4K gamer’s budget.  Among the PC gaming community, the customizers and builders at CyberPowerPC are legend. The company is one of the longest running in the business, offering insane deals and discounts on some of the best gaming hardware that assures you you’re always going to get the best possible bang for your buck. Thanks to wholesale buying practices and a dedicated workforce, often the price you’ll pay to build your own comparative system is only around $50 less than what you’d get for CyberPower to build, customize, and ship the whole package to you in one plug-and-play piece. The company offers dozens of different models that feature a range of specific options you can use to refine what you need out of your machine, but in the pre-built category at least, few offer as strong a value as you’ll find in the latest Gamer Dragon. With an AMD R9 380 4GB graphics card and an 8-core AMD FX8320 processor, the Dragon streams through AAA titles at 4K resolution without slipping a frame. Of course, if those specs aren’t up to your bar, the best thing about shopping at CyberPowerPC is nearly every single component on the PC you buy is customizable, giving you the option to add or remove any parts to get the power-to-cost ratio exactly where you want it on the dial. View on Cyberpower – $919 #2 Pick Syber Vapor One The Syber Vapor One is solid gaming PC for under $1000. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Syber One is a PC made for the console convert.  When Steam OS was first announced by Valve back in 2013, dozens of desktop manufacturers rushed out products that were primed to take advantage of the new and exciting operating system. In the case of Syber’s Vapor I, it’s a bit of a “counting your chickens before they hatch” scenario, where potential Steam Machines were commissioned and built before Valve had even confirmed their OS was in beta, leaving them to ship the computer running a regular build of Windows instead. Nonetheless, the company pushed on, pairing their lineup of console competitors with Windows 10 and Steam’s “Big Picture Mode” installed from the start. The gamble paid off, and the Vapor I is a well-priced PC that makes itself just as much at home under your desk as it does sharing a little space next to the PS4 or Xbox One in your living room. It’s got all the power you need to compare to what a console puts out, and a form factor that simply can’t be beat by anything else in its class. View on Amazon – $999 #3 Pick Alienware X51 R3 Style and power make the Alienware X15 a top contender. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK:  The Alienware is built to perform in any condition.  As one of the oldest prebuilt desktop computer manufacturers around, Alienware has worked long and hard to shake off the rep that it only makes “overpriced, underpowered machines for people who don’t know any better”. Simply uttering the name in an PC enthusiast forum is enough to get you shadowbanned for life, but over the past several years the company has made immense strides in creating products that look just as good as they perform – all for a price that won’t send your wallet limping off to the hospital. Read: Best Gaming Laptops 2017 The X51 R3 is the latest PC gaming desktop that is endlessly customizable from the minute you sign on to the website, giving you the option to add as much horsepower as you think you might need and shave off any of the extra noise that doesn’t result in smooth, polygon-packed gaming at its finest. With an Intel 6th-generation Core i7 Skylake processor, it’s rocking the most up-to-date processor of all the other options listed here, not to mention the addition of 8GB of DDR4 RAM clocked to a whopping 2133MHz. If you want the cutting edge of what’s out there right now, look no further than Alienware’s latest and greatest desktop gaming lineup. View on Amazon – $999 #4 Pick Digital Storm Vanquish 4 A powerful gaming PC with upgrade capabilities. WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Digital Storm Vanquish is an all-around star.  Digital Storm has always been known for their attention to detail and quality, and the latest addition to the Vanquish 4 lineup is no different. While it may not be the sleekest or the most stylish of the bunch, it still offers a solid combination of hardware features that will churn out 1080p graphics on medium-to-max settings, depending on the game of your choice. Read: Best Gaming PC 2017 The Vanquish manages to pack in a 5th-generation Intel i5 6500 CPU alongside an Nvidia GTX950 2GB graphics card, both considered to be some of the best valued peripherals that crank out power like nothing else in the business. Best of all, the Vapor I starts at just $899, leaving a solid Benjamin of room for any extra customization options you might want to add on before you hit the checkout. View on Amazon – $725+ #5 Pick Lenovo Erazer X315 An unexpected monster under the hood WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Lenovo offers serious power for multitaskers everywhere.  Although Lenovo may not exactly be well-known for their gaming pedigree, in recent years the company has shifted its focus onto making solid, reliable, and powerful gaming PCs that don’t cost an arm and a leg but still post impressive specs and an even more impressive all-around build quality. The Erazer X315 is the best of this latest collection of high-powered desktops to enter the fray, featuring a whopping 12GB of DDR3 RAM, an R9 260 2GB graphics card, and an AMD A10-7850K processor. Sure, it may not be the prettiest girl at the ball or feature all the sex appeal you might get with the Vapor I, but what it lacks in raw aesthetics it more than makes up for in pure, unadulterated power. The Erazer X315 is a beast beneath the hood, and runs at just under our limit for a cool $999 USD. View on Amazon – $949 Common Mistakes to Avoid When shopping on a budget, especially in the realm of PC gaming, you’re always going to want to choose substance over flash. Sure, a lot of prebuilt boxes out there pride themselves on spectacular design and more LEDs lining the case than you can shake a stick at, but it’s important to remember that all these extra design elements don’t come cheap. As such, you’ll want to avoid things like custom case modifications, laser engraving, or “special anodized materials”, because at the end of the day all these frills do is cut into money that could be better spent on beefing up the graphics card, RAM, or processor. Gaming PCs need all the power they can get, and while the urge to show them off to your friends at the local LAN party may be strong, Features to Look For Processor/Graphics Card Although more often than not we’d split these two categories up, when it comes to prebuilt gaming PCs it’s rare that you’ll find two different brands of either installed in the same machine. This is to say that if you get a machine with an AMD processor, almost always that’s going to be paired with an AMD video card, and the same goes for Intel/Nvidia. One bottlenecks the other in gaming, and it isn’t recommended that you try and mix them up as both will have more options to work with their companion component if you keep them paired up. Nvidia cards work like a charm with Intel CPUs, and AMD processors work like a charm with cards under the same name. RAM Obviously, no gamer worth their salt is going to pack in anything less than 8GB of RAM into their machine, and in the sub-$1,000 range you usually aren’t going to find faster than two sticks clocked at 2400MHz. 1833MHz is fine as well, but the majority of demanding AAA titles these days will struggle if you try and kick this all the way down to 1600MHz. Hard Drive Space This is a big one. Many times the biggest mistake that budget gamers make when picking up a new PC is skimping on hard drive space, or simply grabbing an SSD and forgetting about a secondary HDD altogether. If you plan on gaming, you have to plan on setting aside at least 500GB (1TB ideally) of extra space to fit many of the popular games that are being released today. For example, the base version of The Witcher III  takes up a whopping 40GB of space on its own, let alone the extra add-ons with DLC and expansion packs. Internal/External WiFi Adapter If you plan on keeping your PC right next to your home’s networking modem, this isn’t a consideration, however if it’s going anywhere else, you need to make sure to either use a USB or internal WiFi card to pick up a wireless signal. With USB 3.0, most adapters can handle any speed you throw at them, although some people do still prefer the internal card in order to reduce the cable noise around their gaming station. So Which Gaming PC Under $1,000 is Right For You In a sentence: any of them! The great thing about PC gaming (outside of the beautiful graphics, endless customization, mods, reliable multiplayer, the list goes on), is unlike consoles, you’re never shoehorned into picking either one or the other. If you want something that looks sleek and plays clean, the Vanquish 4 has got the job covered. Want as much power as you can squeeze out of your budget? The AMD 8-core from CyberPower is an unparalleled beast of a machine. PC gaming gives you the option to play how you want to play, and never compromise for anything less than the best.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft reveals killer power management feature for Windows 10 Redstone 3 3 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Apr 18, 2017 at 18:25 GMT12 hours ago Microsoft is introducing a major new feature for Windows 10 with the upcoming “Redstone 3” release that will help save battery life on some laptops. The new feature is called Power Throttling — which, amusingly, is a temporary name for now but Microsoft will probably come up with something more clever and consumer-focused when the feature is officially released. It is important to note that Microsoft actually experimented with Power Throttling in the Windows 10 Creators Update, but it is officially launching with the upcoming Redstone 3 release later this year. Power Throttling can save up to 11% in power consumption by a device’s CPU, but it won’t be available on all Windows 10 devices. The feature only works for devices powered by Intel’s Skylake and Kaby Lake processors for now, but Microsoft says it will bring support for more processors over time. Power Throttling can cut down CPU power consumption by up to 11% So what does Power Throttling actually do? According to Microsoft’s Bill Karagounis, Windows 10 now has a “sophisticated detection system” that can automagically detect what apps and tasks are important to you and the ones that aren’t very important. Depending on the importance of certain tasks, Power Throttling will allocate your CPU’s resources to those. For instance, if you are compiling an app in Visual Studio, the detection system will likely be able to identify that and it will allocate more resources to it so that the compilation takes less time. This will make sure your CPU’s power and device’s battery isn’t being wasted on the handful of background tasks created by Google Chrome — instead, it’ll be used where you actually need it. You’ll be able to turn off Power Throttling for any app you want Of course, we don’t really know the effectiveness of Power Throttling as of yet, but it might just be able to improve your laptop’s performance and battery life quite a bit. More importantly, Microsoft is initially testing Power Throttling in Windows 10 with Windows Insiders. The company claims the new detection system for Power Throttling “works well for most apps” but the company wants Insiders to provide feedback if the detection system doesn’t work as expected. Using the new Power Slider in Windows 10, users can also completely disable Power Throttling by changing the Power Mode to “Best Performance.” But the best thing about Power Throttling? You can disable it for certain apps out-of-the-box. Just head over to the Settings app (Settings > System > Battery) and you’ll be able to disable Power Throttling for any app you want. The company will also provide APIs to develoeprs that will allow them to optimize their apps so that it plays nicely with Power Throttling, but details regarding that will be available later. Power Throttling will arrive with the Windows 10 Redstone 3 update later this Fall, and users part of the Windows Insider program can already try it out in the latest Insider Preview release.

AMD's Ryzen launches March 2, outperforming Intel's Core i7 at a fraction of... Ryzen review: AMD is back Video Let's Play Thimbleweed Park Let the PC builds begin. Right now, Amazon is selling the top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 1800X for $470, or $30 off the sticker price. That's one of the best deals we've seen so far among the big retailers. Note that this discount isn't tied to any particular sale, so it could disappear at any time. The 1800X is an eight-core, 16-thread processor with a 3.60GHz base clock and an amazing 95W TDP. At $499, the 1800X was already a better deal than Intel's comparably powerful Skylake CPU, the Core i7-6900K, which is a plus-$1,000 processor with a TDP of 140W. In our Ryzen review, the 1800X matched or beat the 6900K on a number of benchmark performances. The one thing to be aware of is that AMD's Ryzen 7 still isn't quite as fast as Intel processors when it comes to gaming. They'll do just fine, however, and the story is more complicated than we can cover here. Check out our full discussion of gaming and Ryzen from early March for more details. Nevertheless, the Ryzen 7 1800X is an impressive chip that will serve most users well. Also, don't forget to pick up a CPU cooler as this processor doesn't come with a stock cooler in the box. As we mentioned last time, for a quality cooler at a good price check out the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo.

The feature is designed to improve the power consumption of a battery-powered device running Windows 10 by handling the power consumption of background tasks better. Note: Power Throttling is a temporary name for the feature. The current iteration works only on systems with Intel's 6th-generation or later Core processors. The company plans to improve support in the coming months. Most Windows users run multiple programs at the same time. A web browser and video player, multiple browsers, an email client, image editor, games, image viewers, and a lot more. All of these programs drain power, even if they run in the background. Microsoft's first batch of experiments showed that Power Throttling could save up to 11% in CPU power consumption. While the actual mileage may vary depending on the programs that are run and throttled, it is quite useful for battery powered Windows devices. Windows 10 Power Throttling Microsoft's describes Power Throttling in the following way: With “Power Throttling”, when background work is running, Windows places the CPU in its most energy efficient operating modes – work gets done, but the minimal possible battery is spent on that work. Microsoft built a detection system into Windows 10 to automate the functionality of the feature. This algorithm detects important work, and protects it from being throttled. Work that is deemed important may include foreground programs, but also background apps such as music players and apps you interact with regularly. All other applications and programs may be throttled to decrease the device's power consumption. Managing Power Throttling While the system worked well during tests, errors may be made in determining whether programs should be throttled or not. Windows 10 users have two main options to handle issues that they may run into while Power Throttling is applied to processes on the system: Switch the Power mode to Best Performance This turns off Power Throttling completely, but it will increase the power consumption significantly as power saving functions are disabled as well in that mode. Use Windows-I to open the Settings application. Go to System > Power, and click on Additional power settings. Switch the power plan to high performance on the page that opens. Blacklist apps to exclude them Use a new blacklist setting in the Battery Settings to opt-out individual applications. Use Windows-I to open the Settings application. Go to System > Battery, and click on Battery Usage by App. Select the application you want to blacklist, and toggle the Managed by Windows preference to off. Next, remove the checkmark in Reduce work app does when in background as well. Closing Words Power Throttling is designed to save power on Windows 10 devices. It remains to be seen how much power Windows 10 users will save with the feature enabled on the release channel. Microsoft plans to release APIs for developers to give developers "more fine grained control" over the throttling. Now You: Which power plan do you run on Windows, and why?

If processes run on their own in background without your knowledge, maybe it's time to take a look at what you have installed and how it's configured (done on-the-fly and not rushng out through initial setups helps in this regard). Anyway, on desktop I keep the balanced (afaik "while plugged" is configured the same as high performance). Same on laptop unless I need the longest battery life possible, then I use battery saver profile with maximim processor state set to 50%. I actually configured power saver while plugged in as well to have max CPU state to 50, helps if I just want it to run coulder. Also another thing which saves power is a program called nvidiaInspector which can lock the graphic card to it's lowest speed. The feature is actually named "Multiple Disaplay Power Saver". Also the program is portable, and obviously requires Nvidia card. ^^ All these work on any version of Windows Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The software giant is testing out a new power throttling feature in the latest Windows 10 preview build (16176) which is designed to save as much as 11 percent battery usage. Windows 10 testers can access the new throttling system on Intel 6th generation and above processors, so you’ll need Skylake or Kaby Lake chips to make use of it for now. The power slider has appeared again in the latest Windows 10 preview build, and you can opt out individual apps from the power throttling too. Microsoft won’t enable power throttling when a laptop is plugged in, and you can use the slider to enable the best performance or best battery life on the go. Microsoft started testing a similar feature before the Creators Update, but the company didn’t ship it in time. It’s clear this power throttling feature has now been delayed to Microsoft’s next major Window 10 update, expected to ship later this year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News DockerCon 2017: Powering new Linux innovations with Hyper-V isolation and Windows Server This post was authored by John Gossman, Azure Lead Architect and Linux Foundation Board Member. With over 900,000 containerized applications in the Docker Hub there has never been a better time to be a developer.  However, a barrier remained – Linux images run on a Linux host and Windows images on a Windows host requiring multiple infrastructures and more complex development tooling. Today at DockerCon 2017, Microsoft showcased how we will remove this barrier with Linux containers running natively on Windows Server through our Hyper-V isolation technology.  This will enable developers to build with Windows and IT administrators hosting Windows Server to run any container image regardless of their platform. When we announced and launched Hyper-V Containers it was because some customers desired additional,  hardware-based isolation for multi-tenant workloads, and to support cases where customers may want a different kernel than what the container host is using – for example different versions.  We are now extending this same Hyper-V isolation technology to deliver Linux containers on Windows Server. This will give the same isolation and management experience for Windows Server Containers and Linux containers on the same host, side by side. Tens of thousands of developers depend on Docker Community Edition (CE) on their Windows 10 laptops each day as they build, ship and run Linux and Windows containers.  Microsoft has a long history of working in the Docker community, collaborating to bring container technologies to Windows and Microsoft Azure.  This project is being launched today, at DockerCon, so that we can continue that legacy of working with the community to deliver innovative solutions in open source. More than three years ago, we helped contribute Hyper-V support to the Docker Machine and boot2docker projects which served as the early foundation of Moby and LinuxKit.   Over the last year, we’ve continued working hand-in-hand to bring Windows container support into Docker CE, first with Microsoft adding support for Windows Server Containers on Windows 10 using Hyper-V isolation and then Docker adding support to switch between Linux and Windows.  We are now looking forward to continuing that collaboration in the open source LinuxKit and Docker projects to provide even better Windows and Linux container support. We are also committed to building support for this feature as part of the ongoing containerd project in line with the goals of an industry-standard cross platform container runtime. “Beginning with the very first DockerCon in June 2014, Microsoft’s ongoing strong commitment to Docker and open source has been singular,” said Scott Johnston, COO, Docker, Inc.  “Microsoft’s new Hyper-V Linux containers, announced today at DockerCon, and its collaboration with Docker’s LinuxKit and containerd together represent a unique, innovative solution for developers building heterogeneous, hybrid cloud applications.” In the spirit of providing customers with a choice, we will also enable customers to choose the Linux distributions they want to use to host their Linux containers. Microsoft will be open sourcing the required integration code and we have been working with leading Linux vendors who will be providing container OS images.  We are happy to share that Canonical, Intel, Red Hat and SUSE will also support this project. “Canonical is proud of a longstanding relationship with Microsoft to bring Ubuntu and the best of the open source world to the Windows ecosystem.  We have teamed together to deliver Ubuntu images to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and Azure Container Service, and Ubuntu as the Bash experience in the Windows Subsystem for Linux on the Windows Desktop, and now in the form of a minimal, secure, Ubuntu container OS image.” – Dustin Kirkland, Head of Product, Canonical “We are excited to collaborate closely with Microsoft to optimize and include the Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture as an option for customers to use within their new Linux containers running natively on Windows Server through Hyper-V isolation technology,” – Arjan van de Ven, Sr. Principal Engineer, Intel Corporation “Through both our upstream open source contributions and through Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host and Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat is committed to bringing production-ready container solutions to enterprise customers. The cloud is hybrid and customers want to be able to adopt heterogeneous technologies. Through this aligned vision with Microsoft, we look forward to bringing Red Hat Enterprise Linux containers to Hyper-V users.” – Jim Totton, Vice President and General Manager, Platforms Business Unit, Red Hat “Microsoft is investing in Linux containers on Windows Server — and if security and containers are important to you —  keep on reading. This collaboration is a natural step for SUSE, as we are investing in secure, rootless containers for our CaaS Platform solution. SUSE is excited to be a part of this announcement and will actively collaborate with Microsoft to enable our joint customers with SUSE-based Hyper-V isolated containers that run natively on Windows Server.” – Dr. Gerald Pfeifer, VP of Products and Technology Programs, SUSE We look forward to working with all of you on this project over the coming months.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Brooklyn 5G Summit Showcases Advanced Research and Technology Fueling 5G Wireless Drive To Commercial Reality BROOKLYN, N.Y., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Leaders in wireless, automotive, academia, and government will gather at the annual Brooklyn 5G Summit April 19-21, 2017 to explore how close the industry is to deploying commercial products and services for the next-generation of wireless communications. The fourth annual event will also showcase the latest developments and research in telecommunications, machine-to-machine communication and the Internet of Things (IoT). The invitation-only summit, at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, is jointly organized by NYU WIRELESS and Nokia, and the IEEE Communications Society will broadcast the proceedings. The event features international thought and research leaders from Nokia, Verizon, National Instruments, Intel, Qualcomm, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and others.  "With nearly every major carrier launching 5G wireless field trials this year, this is a watershed moment in the next telecommunications revolution," said Theodore (Ted) S. Rappaport, the Ernst Weber/David Lee professor of electrical engineering at NYU Tandon and founding director of NYU WIRELESS. In recent months major carriers, including Verizon and AT&T, announced trials in nearly a dozen cities for both mid-band and the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bandwidth for which Rappaport and NYU WIRELESS conducted seminal research. Government and industry bodies such as the FCC, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU) have also recently set new benchmarks aimed at taking mobile data speeds to new limits. "Behind the blistering pace of research and development of technology — from microchips with phased-array antennas to vehicle-to-vehicle communications in self-driving cars — is the expectation that ultra-fast connectivity delivering huge data rates is just around the corner," said Rappaport. "NYU WIRELESS' industrial affiliate sponsors, including Nokia, AT&T, Qualcomm, Straight Path Communications, and Verizon are fulfilling those expectations, and NYU WIRELESS is pleased to play a key role as well, with breakthrough research proving that mmWave transmissions can deliver 5G in many more settings than anticipated." A report from Nokia Bell Labs Consulting predicts that by 2020, global demand for digital content and services on mobile and portable devices will increase 30 to 45 times from 2014 levels. The study estimates that there will be over 46 billion Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices by 2020, with audio and video streaming accounting for 79 percent of the total increased consumption. NYU WIRELESS, which conducted the world's first radio channel measurements proving that the mmWave spectrum holds vast potential to improve wireless communications, was one of only two academic institutions recently chosen by the FCC to help test, debug, and provide feedback on a new web-based portal that lets researchers apply for the program experimental license, a new paradigm that will reduce barriers to experimentation for universities, research laboratories, health care institutions, and manufacturers. NYU WIRELESS is also the first to receive a program experimental license. Summit Highlights Driven by this year's theme, "How Close is 5G to Commercial Reality," the Brooklyn 5G Summit will focus on end-to-end system design, regulations and pre-commercial systems. In addition, the conference will address various use cases for 5G in the evolving IoT space by inviting selected start-up companies to share their work. Presentations by industry leaders will include Theodore (Tod) Sizer, vice president of mobile radio research at Nokia; Durga Malladi, senior vice president of Qualcomm; Seizo Onoe, chief technical officer of the prominent Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo; Ken Steward, senior fellow at Intel; Gaurav Bansal, senior researcher at the Toyota InfoTechology Center; and HongBeom Jeon, executive vice president of KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom), which will introduce 5G to the Olympics at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang. Many of the industry affiliate sponsors of NYU WIRELESS are testing breakthrough 5G systems and platforms. Several will demonstrate prototypes and explain their advances. NYU WIRELESS will demonstrate: Groundbreaking research on 5G transmission in the mmWave spectrum, promising up to 40 times today's data transmission rates The latest tools for designing 5G systems, including its widely used NYUSIM open-source channel software simulator (with over 7,000 downloads to date) A new real-time network emulation tool for evaluating virtual reality and other applications over realistic mmWave channels A phased-array antenna system for measuring mmWave directional channel dynamics A new dual architecture channel sounder with 2 GHz RF bandwidth throughout the mmWave spectrum, and a channel sounder on a chip To watch the live stream April 19-21, register at https://register.comsoc.org/brooklyn-5g-summit-2017.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Bypass for Windows Update lock for next-gen processors found By Martin Brinkmann on April 18, 2017 in Windows - Last Update:April 19, 2017 8 Microsoft blocked the delivery of Windows Updates recently to Windows 7 and 8.1 devices powered by a next-generation processor. The company announced the support change in January 2017. Broken down to the essentials, it means that Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge processors are only support by Windows 10, and not older versions of Windows. To hammer that home, Microsoft made the decision to block Windows Update on Windows 7 or 8.1 PCs with those next generation processors. The company introduced patches, KB4012218 and KB4012219 for instance, which introduced process generation and hardware support detection on Windows 7 and 8.1 systems. Windows users who run Windows Update get the unsupported hardware error prompt when they try to scan for and download the latest patches for their -- still supported -- operating system. Bypass for Windows Update lock for next-gen processors GitHub user zeffy made the decision to take a closer look at how the actual blocking is done on the operating system level. What he did was the following: Download the Patch KB4012218 from Microsoft. Extract the content of the MSU file using the expand command line tool. Expand basically extracts all files that are part of an update file so that you can analyze each individually. This resulted in a long list of files. He used PowerShell to filter the files for anything starting with "wu" to filter out Windows Update related files. He then ran diff tools to compare the binaries of the files in the new update file with those on the actual operating system. He discovered the dynamic link library wuaueng.dll, and found the two functions IsCPUSupported(void) and IsDeviceServiceable(void) in it. Now that he found the culprits that blocked the installation of updates on machines with next generation processors, he came up with a solution for that. His preferred solution jumps over the whole "IsDeviceServiceable(void)" body so that Windows Update is notified that the CPU on the machine is supported. The solution requires the patching of the dll file. He has uploaded the patched files for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 to the GitHub project page. The source code has been made available there as well for you to check. The patches come as scripts that you just need to run to make the necessary changes. Windows Update should work just like before then even on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 systems with next generation processors Attention: it is recommended that you create a backup of the wuaueng.dll file before you patch it. Even better, create a backup of the system partition just to be on the safe side of things. One caveat of the method is that any new version of wuaueng.dll that Microsoft releases requires new patching. Microsoft may devise other means to block updates on those systems as well in the future. (via Sergey) Now You: What's your take on Microsoft blocking updates for customer systems?

P S - Only new high-end business OEM PCs running Skylake and built-in vPro(= Remote Management Engine) technology are not being blocked by M$. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Now a dedicated group wants to find out how much they're worth. Tech Culture by Alfred Ng April 15, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @alfredwkng A look inside the Nasdanq closed beta. Alfred Ng/CNET With my best "My Dad Will Sue You" outfit on, I was ready to strike it rich buying and selling memes. It was 9 a.m. ET on a Thursday, early enough that Donald Trump memes hadn't rolled in yet. Feeling lucky, I bought 30 shares of $TRMP. They immediately tanked 21 percent. But I wasn't fazed -- there was plenty of time for the president to, you know, be Trump. I'm not living in a fantasy land. I'm logged in to Nasdanq, a site that lets you to wager on the value of internet memes, similar to how you might punt on shares of a company. Sure, you don't use real money to play, but there's still the satisfaction of knowing you're internet savvy. Memes aren't just digital amusements. They brought Rick Astley's career back from the ashes and sent Oculus founder Palmer Luckey into the shadows. They've seeped into international diplomatic efforts; the UK's Russian embassy posted pictures of Pepe the Frog and netted thousands of retweets in the process. The stock market represents the current value of a company based on expectations of how it will perform in the future. Similarly, the Nasdanq can give you an idea of which meme is about to go viral. Mock markets aren't new, and dedicated fans have created exchanges to turn their knowledge of a subject into games. The Hollywood Stock Exchange lets players "invest" in actors, rewarding those who find hidden stars before their big break. The University of Iowa developed its Iowa Electronic Markets for its business school students to learn how the economy works. It's now used to forecast elections. Memes are a logical step. The Nasdanq traces its origin to the Meme Economy subreddit. It started out as a joke about six months ago, but now members use it to hash out the latest trends in web culture. SpongeBob memes are still blue chips, just like Intel shares, while the hooded "Evil Kermit" meme has been on a downward spiral since January. The value of viral Brandon Wink, one of the Meme Economy subreddit's moderators, teamed with seven people he met there to build the meme market for wannabe wolves of Wall Street. It launched Wednesday as a closed beta. The name is a play on the Nasdaq stock market and "Dank," a slang term that originated in the marijuana community and morphed to mean just about anything. The team set out to take something that's subjective and give it a quantifiable value. While companies on the stock market have quarterly sales and profit to measure, a meme's value is in relevancy and popularity. Who's to say the bottle flip challenge is better than the mannequin challenge? "That's the tricky part. It's something that we're actively working on and trying to figure out an algorithm for," said Kyle Stratis, one of the software engineers behind Nasdanq. "Part of our goal is to make it a little more objective and make it more concrete." Nasdanq stocks are supposed to rise using algorithms looking at the meme's popularity and sentiment analysis. Pepe the Frog memes might be really popular, but the cartoon's negative connotation means it wouldn't do well on the market, Stratis said. The Meme Economy subreddit, where the idea for Nasdanq started. Reddit The pricing on Nasdanq is determined by data scrapers that go through social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. The more popular a phrase is, the more value it has on the simulator. $MRKL, the ticker for Angela Merkel memes, surged 9,826 percent during a rise in mentions of the German chancellor's name on social media after she met with President Trump. It quickly dropped after. The current formula on Nasdanq's beta takes its cues from the way the real economy functions, even though memes don't work that way. In a real economy, popularity of a company's products means growth for the stock. But if a meme goes mainstream, its value tanks since everyone is on the joke. Think about how funny the Crying Jordan face initially was, and how tired it felt once you started seeing it everywhere. Memes, like $PND2, can be bought and sold. Every player starts with 1,000 GBP (the Nasdanq's virtual currency, not the Great British Pound). The simulator has trading firms like Goldmeme Sachs, where groups can get together to buy and sell meme securities. You need 1,500 GBP to start one, and after my Trump memes investment rebounded, I created Lehmeme Brothers. Wink hopes firm members will scour the web and hunt for hidden gems to "invest" in. Even if the market crashes, Nasdanq would teach valuable economic lessons, he said. "The skills are actually transferable if you learn how to look for trends and the sociology of how the internet works," Wink said. The 23-year-old graduate student said he's seen friends use lessons from World of Warcraft's auction-based economy in real-life situations. Time to go positive? Stratis said he's devoted all his free time to working on the meme stock market, spending 12 to 16 hours a day on the weekend. Still, it's buggy. You can't refresh a page without getting a 404 error message, and the Sell button and comments section don't work. Stratis is looking to iron out those wrinkles before Nasdanq is released to the public. His goal is to make a fun game, with data analysis on memes as an added bonus. He and his team are aiming for an official launch by December. "Everyone has a sense of what's popular in their own bubble or their own circle," Stratis said about memes. "We're giving it a hard number." If you're hatching a strategy for when Nasdanq goes public, Wink recommends putting your investments in wholesome memes, that is, inspirational and positive posts. As he puts it, "2016's depressed nature will make the pendulum swing the other way. I have a really good feeling about wholesome memes." Let's hope it doesn't cause a Great Meme Depression. It's Complicated: This is dating in the age of apps. Having fun yet? These stories get to the heart of the matter.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News $100+ Billion Smart Textiles in Apparel Markets: Applications and Technologies Report – Projections to 2025 /EIN News/ — Dublin, April 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „Smart Textiles in Apparel: Markets, Applications and Technologies” report to their offering. This new report ‚Smart Textiles in Apparel: Markets, Applications and Technologies’ examines the markets for textile based wearable technologies, the companies producing them and the enabling technologies. This is creating a 4th industrial revolution for the textiles and fashion industry worth over $100 billion by 2025. Advances in fields such as nanotechnology, organic electronics (also known as plastic electronics) and conducting polymers are creating a range of textile-based technologies with the ability to sense and react to the world around them. This includes monitoring biometric data such as heart rate, the environmental factors such as temperature and The presence of toxic gases producing real time feedback in the form of electrical stimuli, haptic feedback or changes in color. The report identifies three distinct generations of textile wearable technologies: First generation is where a sensor is attached to apparel and is the approach currently taken by major sportswear brands such as Adidas, Nike and Under Armour Second generation products embed the sensor in the garment as demonstrated by products from Samsung, Alphabet, Ralph Lauren and Flex. In third generation wearables the garment is the sensor and a growing number of companies including AdvanPro, Tamicare and BeBop sensors are making rapid progress in creating pressure, strain and temperature sensors. Third generation wearables represent a significant opportunity for new and established textile companies to add significant value without having to directly compete with Apple, Samsung and Intel. The report predicts that the key growth areas will be initially sports and wellbeing followed by medical applications for patient monitoring and fashion. Technical textiles, fashion and entertainment will also be significant applications with the total market expected to rise to over $100 billion by 2025 with triple digit compound annual growth rates across many applications. The rise of textile wearables also represents a significant opportunity for manufacturers of the advanced materials used in their manufacture. Toray, Panasonic, Covestro, DuPont and Toyobo are already suppling the necessary materials, while researchers are creating sensing and energy storage technologies, from flexible batteries to graphene supercapacitors which will power tomorrows wearables. The report examines the markets, details the latest advances and their applications. Key Topics Covered: 1.

Military Military: The Intel VIDEO: Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises Marines airlift 1,100 desert tortoises The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter More than 1,000 desert tortoises are taking a trip with the Marine Corps this month. The Marines are using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the Mojave in make way for an expansion of desert training grounds. During the two-week long process, the hubcap-sized tortoises are being loaded into plastic containers, which are then stacked and strapped to a helicopter. More than 1,000 desert tortoises get a Marine Corps airlift. Their new home will be swaths of federal land to the north and southeast of the Twentynine Palms base, Marine officials said. The areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn’t migrate back to the original habitat. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The cost of the whole effort, including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species, is $50 million. The Marines at the Twentynine Palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering. The campaign goes back to 2008, when the Corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law. The 2014 National Defense Authorization Act handed land formerly managed by the Bureau of Land Management to the Defense Department. Tortoises living on that land are now being moved. In March 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a notice of intent to sue, arguing that the federal government failed to fully examine how the move might harm the tortoises. However, the move went ahead this month after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the Marine Corps that its review wouldn’t be done before the spring window for the move, Marine Corps officials said. It’s not the first time that the Corps has been in the tortoise-moving business. In 2006, the Twentynine Palms base relocated 17 adult tortoises in order to build a training range. Marine officials say no tortoises died during three years of post-move monitoring. This time, Marine Corps biologists will monitor tortoises intensely for the first five years. Then monitoring requirements will diminish over time until the 30-year obligation is met, officials said. About 235 juveniles too small for relocation are being admitted to the base’s “headstart facility,” where they will remain until they grow large enough to better survive on their own.

(AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left Don't let analysts shake you from your conviction. AMD stock still has plenty more upside to deliver. By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Apr 18, 2017, 11:05 am EDT     Popular Posts: 3 Reasons Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is Still a Lemon Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top Buy Recent Posts: International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) Stock Punished After Dismal First Quarter Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Still Has Some Pop Left 3 Reasons Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is Still a Lemon View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been hitting some turbulence lately. That’s largely thanks to Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, who threw cold water on shares with a “sell” rating on AMD stock. Source: AMD Investors took note, scattering to send shares down by 6%. No surprise — Advanced Micro is hyper-sensitive, especially considering how many investors are sitting on triple-digit gains. Why take the risk? Hari offered up several reasons for his bearishness on AMD stock. One is that the valuation appears to be out of sync with the underlying fundamentals; Hari thinks that a fair value is $11. It’s not a crazy argument, as Advanced Micro has spiked from less than $2 in March 2015 to the $13 area and now trades at 43 times forward earnings estimates. By comparison, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at 28X and Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) sports a 14 multiple. But perhaps Hari’s other concern is much more serious: the threat of competition. While AMD’s run has come amid improved fundamentals based on increasingly superior products, NVDA and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are no slouches. These tech operators not only have enormous resources but dominant positions in their market categories. What’s more, they may be willing to engage AMD in price wars if they must. Hari’s not the only skeptical analyst out there, as the consensus price target sits at $12.20, below current prices. AMD Stock and Momentum While the bears have good arguments, I think they miss the point. Advanced Micro Devices is at a major inflection point, which has attracted numerous momentum traders that couldn’t care less about valuation. They see a strong growth path and exciting developments, and that’s enough for them. AMD should continue to deliver on this front. CEO Lisa Su has crafted a great strategy including several years of disciplined R&D efforts. For example, there is the Ryzen 7 CPU, which has garnered standout reviews. The technology is poised to snag a lucrative share of the massive gaming cateogry. There is also the Vega GPU, which is gunning for Nvidia, as well as Naples, a chipset that should give INTC a run for its money in the datacenter market. AMD has already been gaining traction with customer demand. Some of the marquee names include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), which hosts 35% of the websites in China. AMD also has a platform that is based on outsourcing manufacturing to third parties, such as Global Foundries and Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM). This allows for much more focus on innovation and product development — but also means that the company can quickly scale production according to customer needs. In the meantime, Su is continuing to invest in longer-term opportunities like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the internet of things. For example, last week, Su announced a deal to buy startup Nitero, a leader in millimeter wave technologies that allow for wireless VR and AR headsets. Keep in mind that current systems on the market — from HTC, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) — require unwieldy chords. If anything, this has likely been a problem with customer adoption. Bottom Line This isn’t to imply that AMD stock will post triple-digit returns again last year. That’s a stretch. But Advanced Micro is in the midst of a transformative upswing, driven by multiple product launches in red-hot markets. Considering that, it seems like a good bet that AMD should continue to outperform the broader market.

Hitachi uses its analytics platform to integrate production and sensor data outputs to help visualize, analyze and diagnose a manufacture polymer mixing problems. A polymer mixing process was said to be producing inconsistent output quality, with yields dipping to 50%. Hitachi addressed the scrapping of poor batches and huge costs by addressing ever-changing product specifications and variations in a range of production parameters. Using IoT and the analytics platform, production engineers were able to stabilize the process even as new product formulations were introduced. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next Industrial Revolution. It will impact the way all businesses, governments, and consumers interact with the physical world. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps speed has been used in data centers for years. The jump to 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps has come rapidly as a result of the need to increase the quantity of data managed inside the data center with more analytics and more applications. Many of the Cloud 2.0 mega data centers have moved to 100 Gbps, presaging the move to 400 Gbps. One reason for the increase in speed is the growth of data consumption, attributed to smartphones, social media, video streaming, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Big pipes are used to cope with the huge quantities of data that are being transferred. Users, partners, suppliers and other mega-datacenters communicate using digital systems that are automated and self-healing. The effect on the business is compelling, managers have much more responsibility to create maps of strategy and work with IT to see that developers tune the software to fit the current competitive environment. The explosion of data comes from smart phone apps and IoT digital onslaught of streaming data that needs to be processed in real time to look for anomalies, look for change, set alerts, and provide automated response to shifts. “Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that sensors bring to digital controls. The benefits of digital manufacturing, farming, and automotive vehicles are higher productivity and more efficient use of resource. Transparency in is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used in food preparation, and when and how the food was harvested and transported. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport.” Use of IoT sensors and cameras represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying and driving, making ease of use, flight stability, and automated cars a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, IoT continued growth is assured. The worldwide market for Internet of Things (IoT) is $16.3 billion in 2016 anticipated to reach $185.9 billion by 2023. Sensors and software analytics platforms are implemented with connectivity capability for streaming data from endpoints and using analytics to process the data in a manner that generates alerts when appropriate. The complete report provides a comprehensive analysis of Internet of Things (IoT) in different categories, illustrating the diversity of uses for digital tracking devices in industry, healthcare and consumer markets. Analytics makes the images more cogent to everyone, farmers, doctors, machine operators, the uses of IoT are quite diverse. Letting people anticipate problems that only become visible to humans days or weeks after the sensors and images detect issues is a fundamental aspect of IoT, along with generating apocopate levels of alerts.

ThinkPads have been remarkably consistent in quality since the beginning, with every iteration improving performance and functionality without removing features ThinkPad owners have come to love. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a perfect example of this. Lenovo’s signature business ultraportable is now in its 5th generation, adding new Intel Kaby Lake processors and a larger battery without sacrificing the portability of this 14-inch device. And after using this laptop for a few weeks now, it’s clear that Lenovo’s minor year-on-year improvements have led to a stunning device that’s the best ThinkPad ultraportable yet. Like previous versions of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the 5th generation model is remarkably compact for a 14-inch laptop. At just 1.13kg heavy, the X1 Carbon is lighter than most standard 13-inch ultraportables, and this has been achieved without sacrificing battery life. Lenovo hasn’t tried to make the X1 Carbon particularly slim, at 15.95mm thick, however its footprint is similar to 13-inch devices thanks to slim bezels around the display. Lenovo has achieved such a light laptop thanks to their choice of materials for its construction. Rather than opting for a dense metal exterior, like many premium laptops on the market today, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon’s body is almost entirely soft touch plastic. Generally I prefer metal bodies from a visual and textural perspective, but as far as plastic bodies go, the X1 Carbon’s is excellent. Its pleasing texture makes the laptop a joy to carry, and its minimalist design looks great. Understated designs tend to work well in business environments; this is exactly what the X1 Carbon provides. For a laptop that’s mostly black plastic, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is surprisingly resistant to fingerprints and grime. After a few weeks of use you will notice a few marks around the place, but it’s far less prone to fingerprint accumulation than some other laptops I’ve tried. Plus, the X1 Carbon doesn’t have a touchscreen, so you won’t have to obsessively clean the display either. The matte finish to the screen is certainly welcome. The X1 Carbon includes a 180-degree hinge, allowing the display to fold flat in the event you need a wide angle between keyboard and screen. I wish more laptop manufacturers would strive to make the hinge as flexible as possible, as there are times where the angle limit on some laptops isn’t enough. One of my favorite aspects to the X1 Carbon is its outstanding array of ports. You get two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, both of which can be used for charging, along with two USB 3.0 Type-A ports. Lenovo is providing users with a fantastic mix of both future and current USB technology, rather than prematurely forcing users into a USB-C only life. There’s also a full-sized HDMI port, which will come in handy for connecting to meeting room projectors, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Perhaps the strangest port on the X1 Carbon is the proprietary connector that’s dedicated to Ethernet. As this ultraportable is way too slim to include an Ethernet port on the device itself, Lenovo has included a dedicated port that attaches to an included Ethernet dongle. It’s a neat way of dealing with Ethernet on a modern laptop and still gives you access to four USB ports when Ethernet is in use. While not new to the 5th-generation X1 Carbon, I love the inclusion of a fingerprint reader here. More and more laptops are including fingerprint security through smartphone-like touch sensors, and it works well to secure your device while providing quick and easy access to the right user. Lenovo’s implementation here is particularly snappy. One of the best aspects to any ThinkPad laptop is its keyboard. The implementation on the X1 Carbon is largely fantastic, with excellent tactile feedback and travel distance providing a great typing experience for a thin-and-light laptop. Large modifier keys and dedicated buttons for home, insert, delete and even print screen improve the experience. My only real complaint about the keyboard is the terrible position of the Fn key. In every keyboard ever made except for the ThinkPad keyboard, the control key is found in the bottom left corner. However, on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and other ThinkPad laptops, the Fn key is in the bottom left corner. This makes it pretty hard to pick up this laptop and start performing basic commands like copy and paste without rewiring your brain to the new position of the control key. Luckily you can switch the function of the Fn and Ctrl keys in the BIOS of this laptop, which basically solves this issue. This should be the default configuration. The trackpad included with this laptop is excellent. It’s highly responsive, tracks your finger accurately, and includes a very pleasant click mechanism. There’s also ThinkPad's signature red trackpoint you can use as a pointer, which isn’t a favorite of mine, but I know some people swear by this navigation option. Both solutions are well implemented, as you’d expect. Included with my ThinkPad X1 Carbon review unit is a 14-inch IPS LCD 1080p display, although a 1440p option will be available later this year. 1080p is a decent resolution for a laptop of this size, and it works well at 125% scaling. The anti-glare matte coating combined with peak brightness of 310 nits makes this screen easy to view in most lighting conditions, while viewing angles are solid. Surprisingly, Lenovo only rates this display as having a contrast ratio of 700:1. I’m not sure whether this is an extremely conservative estimate, because I measured an actual contrast ratio of nearly 1400:1 at peak brightness. Color accuracy across the board is average, though this is mostly due to an incorrect color temperature of 7340K, which gives the display a ‘cold’ blue tone in general. Slight calibration can easily fix issues with the temperature and gamma (2.0 not 2.2) to provide a decent though not outstanding color experience. The 1440p option could be good for those that want increased sharpness from their display, although the sharpness provided by the 1080p display is still excellent. Upgrading to 1440p will introduce a minor hit to performance and a moderate hit to battery life in most situations.

facebook twitter google rss Home Common Conditions Healthy Habits Drugs & Supplements Latinos Health News Science & General News Videos & Blogs   Advertisement What You Can Expect From The All Microsoft New Surface 5 Laptop comments By Arunima Basu staff@latinoshealth.com Apr 18, 2017 02:46 AM EDT Tags Microsoft, Microsoft Surface, Microsoft Surface Laptop, Microsoft News, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 News, Microsoft Windows Microsoft is working at its best for the highly-anticipated Surface Pro 5. (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft is nearing its big spring event, which is scheduled on May 2, 2017. It is expected that the CEO of Microsoft and its team will talk about the strategies and also announce the revision of the hardware of the very popular Surface Pro hybrid of tablet and ultraportable. The surface laptops came with the Kaby Lake processors from Intel and no updates to the Pro line since the end of the year 2015. So, this event is a great opportunity to improve the hardware specifications in the new release of Microsoft Surface Pro 5. According to Forbes, it is expected that Microsoft would be putting in the latest specifications which will ensure that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 can challenge any brands of laptops. Unlike Apple, Microsoft does not require the sales of hardware to keep it going because it has several manufacturers that cover up the hardware side. On the other hand, Microsoft needs promotion for the use of its software and the various compelling solutions that it can offer. As per Technology Everyday, the current consumer focus on Microsoft is mainly built around increasing the adoption of the cloud-based services. The traditional Microsoft Outlook & Office Suites, One Drive's storage and the subscription of Groove's music and most of the regular bases are covered by Redmond's cloud. Most importantly this is accessible through other operating systems as well such as iOS, Android, and others, but obviously, this is more integrated into Windows 10. Therefore, an increase in the adoption of Windows 10 results in the increase in the adoption of cloud.

(Photo : LinusTechTips/YouTube) Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has been the target of leaks and rumors ever since last year and still, there is no official announcement from the company yet.  With all of these things taking rounds on the internet about the Surface Pro 5, it now includes a new rumor about the Windows 10 Cloud, a completely different product by the American multinational tech company. In a recent report, Microsoft-watcher Paul Thurrott announced some new information about the highly awaited hybrid device in his tweet. Thurrott stated that specs wise, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will indeed use a 7th-generation Kaby Lake processor. According to a source, Thurrott, also made it a point to liken the upcoming convertible tablet into a "Surface Pro 4.5" of sorts. Another interesting revelation from Thurrott claims that Surface Pro 5 may not use USB-C to restore the battery as most 2-in-1 devices tend to do nowadays. Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Possible Specs, Design, And features The device is expected to come with a 12.3-inch screen, 4K UltraHD display, 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM and an upgraded Surface Pen stylus alongside with wireless charging feature. The Surface Pro 5 might be possibly powered by AMD's new Ryzen family of processors, in addition to Intel's Kaby Lake chips. But, details are still uncertain, though some reports suggest that Microsoft might release an AMD-based variant as well as the expected Intel versions. Also, there are claims that the Surface Pro 5 might support Microsoft's Windows 10 Creator's Update including the Hololens and the Surface Dial on release. Microsoft is widely expected to take the wraps off the Surface Pro 5 most likely alongside other Surface-branded devices at Microsoft's Build developer conference which is set to start on May 10th until the 12th in Seattle. Furthermore, Microsoft Surface pricing has barely fluctuated year after year. Fans will expect to see the Surface Pro 5 around $899 depending on configured hardware as well as bundled accessories.                   TAG microsoft, Microsoft Surface Pro, surface pro specs Related Articles Nintendo Switch Availability,Where To Find Stocks And Switch Mini News The Nintendo Switch stocks sell like hotcakes after release.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / G.Skill shows off new Trident Z 4333MHz RAM kits, can be pushed to 4500MHz G.Skill shows off new Trident Z 4333MHz RAM kits, can be pushed to 4500MHz Matthew Wilson 17 hours ago Featured Tech News, Memory G.Skill is back at it again this week. Recently, the enthusiast memory maker unleashed 64GB and 128GB kits of Trident Z DDR4 RAM and now, the company is kicking its speeds into high-gear with the launch of its new 16GB 4333MHz kit. The latest modules run at 4333MHz standard but can be pushed as high as 4500MHz on Intel’s Z270 platform. The new DDR4-4333MHz 16GB Trident Z kit runs at CL19-19-19-39 timing at 1.40V and is the first 16GB kit on the market to reach these speeds in a 8GBx2 configuration. In a proof of concept, G.Skill benched its new memory on an ASUS ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard with an Intel Core i5 7600K processor. Once successfully overclocked to 4500MHz, these modules were able to achieve bandwidth write speeds of 65GB per second in dual channel mode. It also managed 55GB/s read speeds and 52GB/s copy speeds. However, it is important to note that these overclocks aren’t guaranteed, not every Trident Z 4333MHz kit will be capable of hitting this speed while remaining stable. Aside from the new 4333MHz 16GB (8GBx2) kit, G.Skill is also currently testing out a 4400MHz configuration, though stress testing has yet to be completed, so these modules won’t be ready for the market for a while. G.Skill’s Trident Z DDR4 4333MHz kits should be available at retail quite soon. I have emailed our contacts to nail down specifics on pricing and availability dates. KitGuru Says: I’m glad to see companies pushing the boundaries on memory speeds. Hopefully it won’t be too long for these higher speeds to become more commonplace.

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as „would,” „intends,” „believes,” „expects,” „may,” „will,” „should,” „seeks,” „intends,” „plans,” „pro forma,” „estimates,” „anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this press release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this press release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; the markets in which AMD’s products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD’s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD’s products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD’s ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation’s support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD’s products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; AMD’s reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.AMD, the AMD logo, Radeon, and FreeSync are trademarks of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > G.Skill’s new memory kit wrings every last… G.Skill’s new memory kit wrings every last ounce of power from the DDR4 By Brad Jones — April 14, 2017 9:41 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you G.Skill is pushing the envelope when it comes to memory components. These announcements give us a sneak peek of what is coming next and what is on the horizon. Computer hardware is in a constant state of evolution, with new processes and new materials redefining our technological boundaries on a regular basis. Next year, the DDR5 memory specification is expected to be finalized, but manufacturers are still working hard to wring every last drop of performance out of DDR4. Taiwanese computer memory specialist G.Skill unveiled a brand new addition to its Trident Z series of extreme performance memory kits. The component is being billed as the first DDR4-4,333MHz memory kit on the market that is available in an 8GBx2 configuration, for a total of 16GB. The new memory kit is said to run at CL19-19-19-39 timing at 1.40V. G.Skill also shared a screenshot of the component being validated on a system utilizing an Asus ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard and an Intel Core i5-7600K processor. G.Skill However, this DDR4-4,333MHz memory kit is not the only project G.Skill is showing off. The company has also shared some details about an experimental project that has managed to achieve DDR4-4,500MHz speed on the Intel Z270 platform. The company reports that its tests yielded a read speed of 55GB/s, a write speed of 65GB/s, and a copy speed of 52GB/s using dual channel mode. G.Skill also shared a sneak peek of its stress tests of a DDR4-4,400MHz memory speed but noted that specifications are still being worked on, and are a way off being released to the market. G.Skill It’s crucial for a manufacturer like G.Skill to balance the immediate future of its manufacturing efforts with plans for components that will emerge further down the line. DDR4 won’t become immediately obsolete once the DDR5 specification is in place and it seems the company is poised to continue offering cutting-edge memory products for the foreseeable future.

Dell currently offers a wide range of SATA and SAS SSD options and a few NVMe options. Samsung, Intel, HGST and Toshiba are the current SSD suppliers, but from Toshiba only the PX04 and PX05 SAS SSDs have been available in PowerEdge servers. Toshiba's HK4 series stands out as the first self-encrypting drive (SED) model of SATA SSD Dell is offering in their servers. The HK4 series is available in 1 DWPD or 3 DWPD endurance tiers with capacities ranging from 120GB to 2TB and using Toshiba's 15nm MLC NAND flash. Dell will be offering the Toshiba HK4 series SSDs in both 2.5" and 1.8" form factors. The latter form factor is almost unheard of in the client space but still has a niche in the enterprise space: a 1U server like the Dell PowerEdge R630 can support up to 24 1.8" SATA SSDs. The Toshiba HK4 series has not previously been sold in a 1.8" version. Toshiba's HK4 series is not new and has actually been on the market for over a year. Aside from the self-encrypting drive option, the HK4 series does not offer any features that have not already been available for PowerEdge servers using SSDs from competing vendors, and pricing through Dell has not been announced so it's hard to say how attractive the non-SED models will be. However, qualifying the HK4 series with the #2 server vendor should help Toshiba continue the strong growth of their SSD business. (IDC's rankings from February put Toshiba as the fourth-largest SSD vendor but the fastest growing, with SSD revenue more than doubling last year.) Perhaps more importantly, this partnership sets the stage for a much quicker qualification and availability when Toshiba's next generation of enterprise SSDs launches later this year based on their 64-layer BiCS3 3D NAND. Toshiba's earlier 3D NAND generations have had minimal impact on the SSD market, but by shipping 64-layer 3D NAND SSDs this year Toshiba has the chance to catch up to Samsung, Intel and Micron in the 3D NAND transition.

Casey April 15, 2017 Pros / Speedy overall performance; Durable chassis; Thin, light design Cons / Short battery life; Heats up Verdict / The Dell Latitude 5285 is a speedy detachable 2-in-1 with short battery life and heating problems. Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1 from $899.00 Visit Site from Dell Small Business The 12.3-inch Latitude 5285 is a detachable 2-in-1 made for business travellers who want--or need--both a tablet and a laptop. Its thin, light design won't weigh you down, and it's durable enough to survive the inevitable bumps of the road. But while it's speedy enough for the power users, the Latitude doesn't last long away from a power source. Still, business users looking for a convertible PC that actually separates from the keyboard ought to give it some consideration. Specs Design The back shell of the Latitude 5285 2-in-1 features a magnesium-alloy casing and a brushed-metal aluminum kickstand. As a neat trick that saves a moment's effort, the kickstand automatically opens when you push the tablet's bottom edge downward onto a flat surface, activating a pair of notches. You can move to kickstand up to 150 degrees, for optimal viewing angles, but anything beyond the 45-degree default feels awkward. It also doesn't help that moving it past that point requires enough force to make me think I was about to break it.  MORE: Best 2-in-1s (Laptop/Tablet Hybrids) The tablet's display is surrounded by a thick black bezel, which looks unnecessary when you're using it in laptop mode, attached to its optional keyboard ($129). Weighing 2.7 pounds and measuring 0.6 inches thick (with the cover), the Latitude 5285 is similar to the HP EliteBook x360 G2 (2.8 pounds; 0.6 inches) and heavier and thicker than the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (2.4 pounds; 0.4 inches). Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1 from $899.00 Visit Site from Dell Small Business Dell placed the Latitude 5285's headphone jack, USB 3.0 port, dual USB Type-C ports (which support DisplayPort connections) on the left side of the slate, along with its volume rocker switch. You'll find the power button on the right side of the top edge, and a Start button on the top of the right side. Durability & Security Corporate buyers afraid of flimsy units will be happy to hear that the Latitude 5285 passed 15 MIL-SPEC 810G standards, the testing used to measure U.S. military equipment durability. That means drops and dust won't hurt the convertible, and neither will operation during extremely hot or cold environments (from 140 degrees to -20.2 degrees Fahrenheit). In terms of security, little comes standard on the Latitude 5285. All models offer a FIPS-certified TPM chip for securing data, but only the two most expensive (Core i5-7300U; Core i7-7600U) configurations pack Intel's vPro remote-management technology. Optional fingerprint reader ($35) or Smart Card and fingerprint reader ($40) upgrades are also restricted to those two pricier models. Display The Latitude 5285's 12.3-inch screen provides strong color and crisp detail. Thor's rich, red cape captivated me during the "Thor: Ragnarok" trailer as did the crisp white snow-capped mountains outside Asgard and the vibrant green smoke clouds detonating in the sky. The panel also made it easy to see the textures of Jeff Goldblum's sparkling gold robe and the dents in Hulk's armor. According to our colorimeter, the Latitude 5285's display produces 127 percent of the sRGB spectrum. That's more than the 96-percent category average, as well as the Surface Pro 4 (100 percent) and the EliteBook x360 G2 (109 percent). Pleasingly, the Latitude 5285 is as bright as it is colorful. The 2-in-1's display emits an average of 425 nits (a measure of brightness), which is far brighter than the 382-nit Surface Pro 4, the 239-nit EliteBook x360 G2 and the 297-nit category average.  MORE: Best Dell and Alienware Laptops The touchscreen panel accurately tracked my input as I navigated the desktop, and it kept up as I speedily doodled in Paint. The 5295 also recognized Windows 10's edge-swipes and two-finger scrolling. Optional Attachable Keyboard & Active Pen The Latitude 5285's optional detachable keyboard offers a solid typing experience, as long as you know its best angle. Its textured back is easy to grip when carrying it folded up, and the rubbery deck felt great against my wrists while I typed. I eked out 72 words per minute on the 10fastfingers typing test, which is not too far from my 80 wpm average. Its keys are solid, with 1.6 millimeters of travel and 68 grams of required actuation force, are comfortably above our minimum (1.5mm, 60g). The one issue I ran up against was the keyboard flexing under pressure while tying. I quickly learned to avoid this by making sure the accessory lies flat instead of on an incline. The 2.1 x 3.9-inch buttonless touchpad enabled smooth scrolling and offered a solid feel to each click. It also speedily recognized three-finger Windows 10 app-switching gestures. Dell's $59 Active Pen attaches to the right side of the tablet display with a strong magnetic connection. Its pressure-sensitive-tip allows for an excellent drawing experience with minimal latency. Audio The Latitude 5285 can provide decent sound after some slight tweaking. Out of the box, it filled our large conference room with clear cymbals and accurate synths from songs such as Desiigner's "Panda" and the theme from Persona 5. Bass, though, was barely audible, until I opened the Waves MaxxAudio Pro app and turned that setting up to 100. At that level, I'd have preferred the low-end sound to be much stronger, but at least I could hear it. Performance The Latitude 5285's 7th-Gen Kaby Lake Intel Core i7-7600U CPU and 16GB RAM enable tons of multi-tasking. I didn't experience any stutter after splitting my screen between a 1080p YouTube video and a dozen Chrome tabs (including Slack, Google Docs and TweetDeck). Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1 from $899.00 Visit Site from Dell Small Business The Latitude 5285 turned in a superb score of 8,915 on the GeekBench 4 general performance test. That's on a par with the 8,873 mark earned by the EliteBook x360, which packs the same CPU and RAM. It also beats the 6,977 ultraportable notebook average and the 6,835 from the Surface Pro 4, which is using a last-gen Core i5-6300U CPU. The 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Class 40 SSD in the Latitude 5285 duplicated 4.97GB of multimedia files in 15 seconds, for a speed of 339.3 MBps. That's just above the SSDs in the Surface Pro 4 (318.1 MBps) and the HP EliteBook x360 G2 (299.4 MBps), and almost twice as fast as the average for ultraportable laptops (187 MBps). Productivity suite users should note the short 3-minute, 27-second time the Latitude 5285 took to complete our OpenOffice macro (pairing 20,000 names and addresses). That's faster than the Surface Pro 4 (4:11) as well as the 5:49 category average. However, the EliteBook x360 (3:16) finished in less time. The Intel HD 620 graphics chip in the Latitude 5285 enabled its solid 65,938 on the Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test. It's better than the 60,424 from the Surface Pro 4 (Intel HD 520), the 54,800 from the EliteBook x360 G2 (Intel HD 620) and the 54,423 ultraportable notebook average. The Latitude 5285 can play moderately-demanding games, running DIRT 3 (set to Medium graphics) at a smooth 57 frames per second. That tops the 34 fps average for ultraportable notebooks and the too-stuttery 21 fps EliteBook x360. Battery Life Power outlets are the Latitude 5285's best friend, as the 42-watt hour battery only lasted 5 hours and 49 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which is far short of the 8:17 average. MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life The Surface Pro 4 performed marginally better at 6:05, but the HP EliteBook x360 G2 was the clear winner at 9:17. Cameras The 5.7-megapixel rear camera and 3.7MP front-facing shooter on the Dell captures passable photos and video. Since the sensor doesn't allow much light in, stills I shot in and around our NYC office on a bright sunny day turned out far better than those taken inside. So, while snapshots made the brick facade of our building look crisp and clean, a fern in our moderately-lit lobby looks pixelated. Selfies I took on the street also looked best, capturing accurate skin tones and pores, as well as the stitching and green hue of my sweater. Heat The Latitude 5285's tablet panel can get so hot that you'll appreciate its kickstand mode. Its back only went up to 94 degrees Fahrenheit after we streamed 15 minutes of HD video on it, but our heatgun registered temperatures as high as 108 degrees on the rear shell when it had Paint, Camera, Photos and 10 Chrome tabs open. Software Even business computers get the standard bloatware blues. While Dell's CommandUpdate software utility and SupportAssistant for talking to technicians are useful, I don't imagine they need or want Sling TV and games such as March of Empires, Minecraft and Candy Crush Soda Saga. Configuration options We tested a $1,895 version of the Intel Core i7-7600U Latitude 5285, which starts at $1,688 and includes 16GB of RAM and the attachable keyboard. Our customization includes an IR webcam for Windows Hello and a super-speedy 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD ($189). The entry-level 5285 costs $899 and runs on a Core i3-7100U CPU with 4GB of RAM, but doesn't include the $129 keyboard or the $59 Active Pen. Dell Latitude 5285 2-in-1 from $899.00 Visit Site from Dell Small Business For $200, you can upgrade to the Core i5 model ($1,099). Some units start with a 32-watt-hour battery, and Dell charges $21 for an upgrade to the 42-watt-hour battery that lasted less than 6 hours. Bottom Line The Latitude 5285's solid speed and sleek design make it a joy to work on and a laptop worth showing off. However, its short battery life is hard to ignore. The $1,899 HP EliteBook x360 G2 offers better endurance, but its bend-back design means you don't get a detachable display. But, if you need an up-to-date Kaby Lake CPU and a nimble, durable design, the Latitude 5285 2-in-1 is worth considering.

The proposed rule is to mandate new light-duty vehicles to be equipped with dedicated short range communications (DSRC).   5GAA is a new global cross-industry association of automotive, technology and telecommunications companies and includes 42 members, of which 8 are founding members (AUDI AG, BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm). Our mission is to enable communications solutions that address society's connected mobility and road safety needs.   In our submission , 5GAA applauds the concept behind the rule, as V2V safety is important to our technology deployment mission. 5GAA urges NHTSA to not consider just the best technology of today, but also to consider the best technologies of tomorrow.  Such an approach will promote innovation and competitive market-based outcomes, ensuring that American drivers and passengers benefit from the best and most advanced safety solutions available as technology evolves.  Rigid technology mandates such as specifying DSRC, whether direct or de facto, freeze technology solutions to a past point in time. NS will significantly impede the innovation and evolution path for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety, and positions the US to lag behind the rest of the world in V2V communications specifically as well as V2X broadly. 5GAA elaborates on the following points: Similar to DSRC, Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety can transmit BSM in an ad hoc manner without cellular network coverage. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety communications can operate without a SIM card and offers the tools to adopt, evolve or innovate any privacy-preserving security management system including SCRM. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety benefits from a significantly larger link budget than DSRC (e.g., 8 dB at high speeds), corresponding to twice the range of DSRC and higher reliability. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety can support up to 50 messages per second with less than 20 msec latency. Cellular-V2X enables V2V, and for that matter Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N), safety applications to take advantage of the widespread cellular network coverage in the US. 5GAA notes also that the impending launch of 5G will only widen the performance gap between Cellular-V2X and DSRC.   5GAA believes that Rather than moving forward with the proposed regulation, NHTSA should instead undertake an updated, comprehensive technology neutral analysis of V2V solutions, including DSRC and Cellular-V2X, against the performance requirements in the NPRM.  If this review indicates that regulatory action is necessary, the U.S. Department of Transportation should move forward with a technology neutral regulation that sets forth minimum V2V safety performance requirements only.   Contact: Astrid Wilch: T: +49-30-20-45-9329, M: +49-175-5750-529, F: +49-30-20-45-950, Mail: secretariat@5GAA.org Web: http://www.5GAA.org SOURCE 5GAA Copyright (C) 2017 PR Newswire.

Published in News Intel kills off IDF by Nick Farrell on18 April 2017 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email End of an error Chipzilla has decided to cancel its Intel Developer Forum tradeshow including this summer's expected IDF17.  The company claimed it had evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF programme. In the past, Intel has used IDF to launch each year's new processor architecture along with other big product announcements such as Optane non-volatile storage. The difficulties of physics have made it harder for the company to offer an annual architecture refresh, however. Intel has experienced delays in deploying new manufacturing processes and slow, extended rollouts of new chip designs.  "Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions," Intel said. It would be tempting to say that the writing had been on the wall.  For a while, Intel was known to be thinking of new formats for the show to give it new life. It had also pulled the plug of the Chinese IDF. But IDF was still expected in the US, at least this year, so the news is surprising. The official line is that Intel is no longer so heavily PC-centric, with a wider range of products spanning FPGAs, Optane storage, Internet-of-Things microcontrollers, wireless communications, and more. Chipzilla says that it is going to move to a greater variety of smaller, more focused events.  Still it is one less Intel event for Mike Magee to be banned from.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News 5GAA Submitted Comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration MUNICH, April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) submitted comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), "Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; V2V Communications." The proposed rule is to mandate new light-duty vehicles to be equipped with dedicated short range communications (DSRC).   5GAA is a new global cross-industry association of automotive, technology and telecommunications companies and includes 42 members, of which 8 are founding members (AUDI AG, BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm). Our mission is to enable communications solutions that address society's connected mobility and road safety needs.   In our submission , 5GAA applauds the concept behind the rule, as V2V safety is important to our technology deployment mission. 5GAA urges NHTSA to not consider just the best technology of today, but also to consider the best technologies of tomorrow.  Such an approach will promote innovation and competitive market-based outcomes, ensuring that American drivers and passengers benefit from the best and most advanced safety solutions available as technology evolves.  Rigid technology mandates such as specifying DSRC, whether direct or de facto, freeze technology solutions to a past point in time. NS will significantly impede the innovation and evolution path for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety, and positions the US to lag behind the rest of the world in V2V communications specifically as well as V2X broadly. 5GAA elaborates on the following points: Similar to DSRC, Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety can transmit BSM in an ad hoc manner without cellular network coverage. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety communications can operate without a SIM card and offers the tools to adopt, evolve or innovate any privacy-preserving security management system including SCRM. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety benefits from a significantly larger link budget than DSRC (e.g., 8 dB at high speeds), corresponding to twice the range of DSRC and higher reliability. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety can support up to 50 messages per second with less than 20 msec latency. Cellular-V2X enables V2V, and for that matter Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N), safety applications to take advantage of the widespread cellular network coverage in the US. 5GAA notes also that the impending launch of 5G will only widen the performance gap between Cellular-V2X and DSRC.   5GAA believes that Rather than moving forward with the proposed regulation, NHTSA should instead undertake an updated, comprehensive technology neutral analysis of V2V solutions, including DSRC and Cellular-V2X, against the performance requirements in the NPRM.  If this review indicates that regulatory action is necessary, the U.S. Department of Transportation should move forward with a technology neutral regulation that sets forth minimum V2V safety performance requirements only.   Contact: Astrid Wilch: T: +49-30-20-45-9329, M: +49-175-5750-529, F: +49-30-20-45-950, Mail: secretariat@5GAA.org Web: http://www.5GAA.org CategoriesUncategorized TagsTransportation/Trucking/Railroad Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Feedthrough Market expected to grow by 2022: Key Driver, Top Vendors, Market Application Analysis and Outlook Next PostNext Maritime Fende Market Analysis: Growth Challenges, Opportunities and Forthcoming Developments Search Recent Posts Silicon Valley Innovation Center (SVIC) Hosts The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan During His Visit to Silicon Valley Meet the „Strait Paloma,” a New Cocktail inspired by George Strait at Perry’s Steakhouse & Grille in Oak Brook Gold Medal Olympian, Bryan Clay Strikes Gold with ETF Fitness!

The boy had fallen off a rubber raft provided by a smuggler who had promised the boy’s father a motorboat. As the startling images of the drowned boy spread, they prompted an outpouring of humanitarian aid—including from the tech sector, which wanted to help prevent the next Aylan from drowning. Knowing that many refugees have access to cellphones, volunteers around the world began developing apps and other tools to help guide refugees on their journeys, adding to the innovative work under way at humanitarian organizations. The resulting technologies are already helping refugees gather crucial information, reconnect with lost relatives, and establish a legal identity in new countries. Technologies still being developed promise to take the place of translators and perhaps even nurses and doctors. Here are what some current and future tools look like. ADOC / Corbis / Getty; Santi Palacios / AP; Better Shelter; Mint / Getty 1 | Instant Intel Nina Kov, a choreographer who researches the intersection of dance and technology, was in Budapest in the summer of 2015 as migrants streamed into the city’s train stations. Kov and her husband saw a need for reliable and up-to-date information on everything from train schedules to the safety of tap water. They developed an app, which they called InfoAid, to give this kind of guidance, including warnings to avoid smugglers. The app used very little network data, meaning it was convenient for people on restricted data plans, and was available in several languages. InfoAid has been tested in the real world: During the peak of the crisis in Budapest, when the city faced an influx of thousands of migrants, it maintained an online translation chat room, staffed by volunteers. Translating refugees’ questions is time-consuming and relies on attracting qualified volunteers—“Arabic is very specific,” Kov says—and in the absence of funding, InfoAid has become inactive; Kov hopes to get it back up and running soon. In Croatia, an engineer named Valent Turkovic is working to provide internet access in asylum centers, where it is often unavailable. In 2015, Turkovic built makeshift Wi-Fi routers and set them up in Croatian refugee camps; he’s now working on a prototype of a compact, durable router called MeshPoint, which will use open-source software to give hundreds of people internet access at once. The device’s hardware will be open-source as well, which means that anyone with a 3-D printer will be able to construct a router. MeshPoint is easier for aid workers to set up and configure than standard models. And because it runs on batteries, it works even when natural disasters—or terrorist groups—disrupt the power grid. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) is already using drones to monitor on-the-ground conditions in refugee camps. In the future, drones could also provide temporary Wi-Fi and extend phone networks in areas without coverage. 2 | Doctor-Free Diagnoses Refugees often need immediate medical attention and can’t get it. In Oslo, the creators of an app called HealthIntelligence hope to work with local governments and health organizations to build a chatbot that provides pregnant refugees with medical, legal, and other advice in their native language. “Just getting to the hospital can be very hard if you don’t speak the language and have limited legal rights,” says Vincent Olislagers, who oversaw the design of the app. From Our May 2017 Issue Try 2 FREE issues of The Atlantic Subscribe The difficulties are magnified for refugees in remote camps. Basil Leaf Technologies has been at work on DxtER, an app that will come with a small tool kit and use AI to guide patients through a questionnaire, collect vital signs and bodily-fluid samples, and diagnose dozens of health conditions on the spot. Via remote programming, the app will be able to continuously incorporate new data on emerging outbreaks. A company called Zipline has designed a “sky ambulance” to help treat conditions of the kind DxtER will be able to diagnose. This small, robotic airplane can deliver vaccines, medicine, and blood to remote areas. Health workers can place orders via text message; once the materials have been flown in, they float down in parachutes. 3 | Finding Family Separation from relatives is a common trauma for refugees. Since 2008, more than 600,000 people have registered for a mobile platform made by a nonprofit called Refunite, which has reconnected more than 38,000 family members. Refunite’s platform operates in six languages and asks users to enter information about themselves and the people they’re looking for, then allows users with connections to send each other messages. Red Cross and Red Crescent societies have their own reconnection initiative, called Trace the Face. It publishes pictures online of people looking for missing relatives and lets them search photos that others have posted of themselves, filtering by criteria like gender, age, and country of origin. Before long, facial-recognition software could transform this database and others like it into advanced people-finding machines. Blockchain, the decentralized technology behind bitcoin, could offer privacy and safety to people who have reason to fear that registering with a government could put them in danger. In 2015, Bitnation, which offers users banking, education, notary, and other services without any formal state affiliation, created a Refugee Emergency Response program that participants can use to register for emergency IDs. These allow users to securely verify one another’s identity and connect with far-flung family members. 4 | Identity Protection Refugees who want to establish a legal identity in a new country confront countless obstacles—they may have fled without their birth certificate, for instance, if they ever had one. So the UNHCR Biometric Identity Management System, active in 25 countries, collects fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs, and can link them to citizenship records and dates of birth. Biometric identification tools could also help refugees receive financial assistance from nonprofit organizations, according to Rosa Akbari, a senior adviser in Mercy Corps’s Technology for Development division. Iris scanning and fingerprinting, for example, can already be used to verify whether someone is eligible for aid. Official IDs could themselves be made smarter and more useful. The Welcome Card, a finalist in a 2016 UNHCR design challenge, would be distributed to all asylum-seekers in European Union countries as temporary identification. By scanning the cards, which use radio-frequency identification technology, at welcome centers and immigration offices, refugees would be able to check their legal status, learn about language courses, and search for transportation options as they travel across borders. Programs like the Welcome Card will work best if government representatives, immigration-policy experts, and members of the tech community collaborate to ensure that migrants continue to gain access to sophisticated new tools. But of course, for migrants of uncertain status, there is a flip side to that sophistication. A biometric entry/exit tracking system of the sort called for in President Donald Trump’s March executive order is hardly novel; some aspects of it are already in use in the United States. It’s easy to imagine a government using biometric data to track down migrants—not to assist them but to deport them. Share Tweet Comments Latest Video The Visa Uncertainty Holding Back Star Scientists An Indian Ph.D. graduate is working on potentially lifesaving heart research. Will she be able to stay in the U.S. to complete it? The Editors Apr 18, 2017 About the Author Amy Weiss-Meyer is an assistant editor at The Atlantic. Most Popular Presented by U.S. Navy via Reuters How Did the Trump Administration Lose an Aircraft Carrier? David A. Graham The White House said the USS Carl Vinson was headed for North Korea as it sailed the opposite direction—the latest example of a communications failure inside the executive branch. A certain amount of unpredictability is a virtue in foreign policy. When one’s adversaries—and perhaps one’s allies—don’t know precisely what a country will do, it gives that country a little extra power in the relationship. Like all virtues, it turns into a vice when used in excess. Donald Trump, Fred Kaplan recently argued, offers an extreme test of Richard Nixon’s “madman theory,” the Vietnam-era approach of letting enemies think Nixon might really be insane and do anything. As my colleague Kathy Gilsinan wrote last week, the hazards of this approach are on display in the latest American standoff with North Korea—a contest between two leaders who delight in bellicose rhetoric and erratic action. “When two leaders each habitually bluster and exaggerate, there’s a higher likelihood of making a catastrophic mistake based on a bad guess,” she wrote, including the threat of nuclear war. Even for those who espouse unpredictability, the presumption is that at least the putative madman has some sense what’s going on, even if no one else does. The point is the appearance of unpredictability, not true chaos. Continue Reading Oliver Munday Mexico’s Revenge Franklin Foer By antagonizing the U.S.’s neighbor to the south, Donald Trump has made the classic bully’s error: He has underestimated his victim. When Donald Trump first made sport of thumping Mexico—when he accused America’s neighbor of exporting rapists and “bad hombres,” when he deemed the country such a threat that it should be contained by a wall and so clueless that it could be suckered into paying for its own encasement—its president responded with strange equilibrium. Enrique Peña Nieto treated the humiliation like a meteorological disturbance. Relations with the United States would soon return to normal, if only he grinned his way through the painful episode. In August, Peña Nieto invited Trump to Mexico City, based on the then-contrarian notion that Trump might actually become president. Instead of branding Trump a toxic threat to Mexico’s well-being, he lavished the Republican nominee with legitimacy. Peña Nieto paid a severe, perhaps mortal, reputational cost for his magnanimity. Before the meeting, former President Vicente Fox had warned Peña Nieto that if he went soft on Trump, history would remember him as a “traitor.” In the months following the meeting, his approval rating plummeted, falling as low as 12 percent in one poll—which put his popularity on par with Trump’s own popularity among Mexicans. The political lesson was clear enough: No Mexican leader could abide Trump’s imprecations and hope to thrive. Since then, the Mexican political elite has begun to ponder retaliatory measures that would reassert the country’s dignity, and perhaps even cause the Trump administration to reverse its hostile course. With a presidential election in just over a year—and Peña Nieto prevented by term limits from running again—vehement responses to Trump are considered an electoral necessity. Memos outlining policies that could wound the United States have begun flying around Mexico City. These show that Trump has committed the bully’s error of underestimating the target of his gibes. As it turns out, Mexico could hurt the United States very badly. Continue Reading Andrew Hetherington Alec Baldwin Gets Under Trump’s Skin Chris Jones Comedy and tragedy in an age of political chaos 点击这里阅读中文版本 | Read this article in Chinese. Alec Baldwin collapses onto his dressing-room couch at Saturday Night Live like a man participating too enthusiastically in a trust fall. He is 58 years old. He has three children under 4. He has been dividing what’s left of his time between filming a movie with Emilio Estevez in Cincinnati and answering the call from NBC whenever it comes, which, because of his now-signature portrayal of Donald Trump, has been many weeks this season. His appearances gather eyes like car accidents; some clips have been watched on YouTube more than 20 million times. Those legions of viewers have formed a kind of makeshift resistance, a community of the gaslit, together feeling a little less crazy for knowing that at least Alec Baldwin can see what they are seeing. Turning the president into a running joke might prove the most consequential work of his career. It’s at least been the most consuming. Continue Reading Kristian Hammerstad How Late-Night Comedy Fueled the Rise of Trump Caitlin Flanagan Sneering hosts have alienated conservatives and made liberals smug. A month after the election, Trevor Noah, the host of The Daily Show, published an op‑ed in The New York Times that sought to position himself and his show as instruments of healing in a broken land. It was called “Let’s Not Be Divided, Divided People Are Easier to Rule,” and it zapped around progressives’ inboxes and Facebook feeds like a digital balm of Gilead. It was a reminder that we were not, in those fevered early weeks, being our best selves: “Instead of speaking in measured tones about what unites us, we are screaming at each other about what divides us.” How true that was, and—one might churlishly observe—what a sea change from Noah’s tone during the campaign, when he berated the Republican candidate for tweeting with “those fat little tiny fingers of yours” and for trying to think with “that stupid head,” and when he advised the candidate that “maybe you should look in the mirror, asshole.” Continue Reading CBS Stephen Colbert’s Alex Jones Parody Is Hardly a Parody David Sims The Late Show host turned his fire on the embattled InfoWars conspiracy theorist, who now claims he’s been “in character” for years. The InfoWars host Alex Jones has been described as a conspiracy theorist, a pro-Trump propagandist, a very rude lunch host, and (by our current president) a broadcaster with an “amazing” reputation. But he’s never been called a performance artist—at least until this week, when his lawyer claimed that his many baritone online rants were simply part of a “character” he’s playing, and not to be taken seriously. Most comedians have experience saying outrageous things to get a rise out of audiences, but when it comes to playing right-wing talk-show hosts for years at a time, there’s perhaps no better judge than Stephen Colbert. So it was delightful to see The Late Show host dive into Jones’s mindset in the middle of Monday night’s show, first by riffing on the latter’s claim of doing “performance art.” Then, the program cut to Colbert playing a Jones-like character called Tuck Buckford, screaming at the audience in full-throated basso profundo while clad in a stars-and-stripes-emblazoned leather jacket. At the same time, the episode was an alarming sign of how the paradigm has shifted since Colbert first originated his own character for The Colbert Report in 2005—that Jones is now widely known enough to warrant a parody on CBS’s flagship late-night show. Continue Reading Victor R. Ruiz / Wikimedia How Wealth in Childhood Shapes Personality Later in Life Jessi Streib The dynamics of inter-class marriages reveal that money predictably influences the way one goes on to think about with work, emotions, and parenting. Cinderella marries Prince Charming. Aladdin weds Princess Jasmine. In 50 Shades of Grey, Ana falls for Christian. From bedtime stories to films, we are exposed to a repeated idea: that love, or at least lust, crosses class lines. In fiction, cross-class relationships either end in marriage and happily-ever-after, or else in dissolution and even death. But what happens in real life? Last year, I set out to answer this question by interviewing college-educated men and women who had married partners from different class backgrounds, for my book The Power of the Past: Understanding Cross-Class Marriages. Not surprisingly, their relationships had little in common with the romances we see in the movies. Class had shaped each spouse so much that the people I interviewed had more in common with strangers. Continue Reading Shutterstock The Science of Cohabitation: A Step Toward Marriage, Not a Rebellion Lauren Fox New research shows that the older people are when they make their first big commitment—cohabitation or marriage—the better their chances for marital success. As more and more American couples choose to share the bills and a bed without a marriage license, a major question looms. In playing house and stocking up on premarital Ikea furniture are we all heightening our risk for divorce? A new study from the nonpartisan Council on Contemporary Families says no. Moving in before marriage doesn’t automatically make you a divorce statistic. Choosing a partner too early, however, just might. The study, which will appear in the in the April issue of the Journal of Marriage and Family, could redefine how researchers look at cohabitation, but the science shouldn’t change the way couples think about living together. Experts warn it’s hardly something to be taken lightly.

However, North Korea still tightly restricts the movements of visiting journalists within its borders, and controls what can be photographed. For photographers looking in from just over the border, there may be more freedom of movement, but the subjects in North Korea are aware they are being watched, with many looking back—sometimes giving a smile and wave, or sometimes throwing rocks. Gathered here are photographs from the past few years of North Koreans seen just over the border from parts of China and South Korea. Continue Reading Wikimedia How Islam Created Europe Robert D. Kaplan In late antiquity, the religion split the Mediterranean world in two. Now it is remaking the Continent. Europe was essentially defined by Islam. And Islam is redefining it now. For centuries in early and middle antiquity, Europe meant the world surrounding the Mediterranean, or Mare Nostrum (“Our Sea”), as the Romans famously called it. It included North Africa. Indeed, early in the fifth century A.D., when Saint Augustine lived in what is today Algeria, North Africa was as much a center of Christianity as Italy or Greece. But the swift advance of Islam across North Africa in the seventh and eighth centuries virtually extinguished Christianity there, thus severing the Mediterranean region into two civilizational halves, with the “Middle Sea” a hard border between them rather than a unifying force. Since then, as the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset observed, “all European history has been a great emigration toward the North.” Continue Reading Mike Blake / Reuters The Silent Crisis of Retail Employment Derek Thompson What to do when department-store jobs—or mining and manufacturing jobs—go away Brick-and-mortar retail is having a meltdown, and economists are starting to see the effects in the job market. Overall retail employment has fallen every month this year. Department stores, including Macy’s and JC Penney, have shed nearly 100,000 jobs since October—more than the total number of coal miners or steel workers currently employed in the U.S. Even America’s richest areas are getting hit: Employment in New York City clothing stores has fallen three years in a row, the longest period of decline on record, going back to the early 1990s. When some industries lose workers, they win the consolation prize of empty political promises to turn back time. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went up and down Appalachia—and far beyond—to lament the job losses suffered by manufacturers and miners. The loss of these jobs has been devastating to many cities and towns. But department stores have lost 18 times more workers than coal mining since 2001.

In a recent report from DigiTimes, it seems that users who are looking forward to an iMac upgrade will be pleased to learn that come the second half of 2017, we might be able to expect an upgrade. In terms of hardware specs, we’re not sure what we can expect save for the possibility that it could be bumped to Intel’s latest processors, possibly more RAM, and new GPU options, but in terms of the exact specifics that remains to be seen. The report also “confirms” that a higher-end specced iMac could be seeing a release towards the end of the year. Recently Apple had confirmed that they do plan on releasing a pro version of the iMac and if DigiTimes’ report is correct, we can expect to see that model by the end of the year. In fact recently alleged specs of the upcoming computer have been revealed and it will most likely end up with Intel’s Xeon E3 processors and come with 16GB of ECC RAM, faster NVMe SSDs, and will see the use of AMD’s GPUs. In any case take this report with a grain of salt especially since DigiTimes doesn’t exactly have the best track record, but hopefully for iMac users looking to upgrade, we won’t have to wait too long to see something new from Apple.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News 5GAA Submitted Comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration MUNICH, April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) submitted comments to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), „Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; V2V Communications.” The proposed rule is to mandate new light-duty vehicles to be equipped with dedicated short range communications (DSRC).   5GAA is a new global cross-industry association of automotive, technology and telecommunications companies and includes 42 members, of which 8 are founding members (AUDI AG, BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm). Our mission is to enable communications solutions that address society’s connected mobility and road safety needs.   In our submission , 5GAA applauds the concept behind the rule, as V2V safety is important to our technology deployment mission. 5GAA urges NHTSA to not consider just the best technology of today, but also to consider the best technologies of tomorrow.  Such an approach will promote innovation and competitive market-based outcomes, ensuring that American drivers and passengers benefit from the best and most advanced safety solutions available as technology evolves.  Rigid technology mandates such as specifying DSRC, whether direct or de facto, freeze technology solutions to a past point in time. NS will significantly impede the innovation and evolution path for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety, and positions the US to lag behind the rest of the world in V2V communications specifically as well as V2X broadly. 5GAA elaborates on the following points: Similar to DSRC, Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety can transmit BSM in an ad hoc manner without cellular network coverage. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety communications can operate without a SIM card and offers the tools to adopt, evolve or innovate any privacy-preserving security management system including SCRM.

The proposed rule is to mandate new light-duty vehicles to be equipped with dedicated short range communications (DSRC).   5GAA is a new global cross-industry association of automotive, technology and telecommunications companies and includes 42 members, of which 8 are founding members (AUDI AG, BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm). Our mission is to enable communications solutions that address society's connected mobility and road safety needs.   In our submission , 5GAA applauds the concept behind the rule, as V2V safety is important to our technology deployment mission. 5GAA urges NHTSA to not consider just the best technology of today, but also to consider the best technologies of tomorrow.  Such an approach will promote innovation and competitive market-based outcomes, ensuring that American drivers and passengers benefit from the best and most advanced safety solutions available as technology evolves.  Rigid technology mandates such as specifying DSRC, whether direct or de facto, freeze technology solutions to a past point in time. NS will significantly impede the innovation and evolution path for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) safety, and positions the US to lag behind the rest of the world in V2V communications specifically as well as V2X broadly. 5GAA elaborates on the following points: Similar to DSRC, Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety can transmit BSM in an ad hoc manner without cellular network coverage. Cellular-V2X technology for V2V safety communications can operate without a SIM card and offers the tools to adopt, evolve or innovate any privacy-preserving security management system including SCRM.

The new Haifa center, officially inaugurated last month, is the only Flex center in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) region that offers the full range of sketch-to-scale capabilities, the company said. The new center, which adds to the scope of the company’s present R&D activities in Israel, will allow customers of the San Jose, California-based firm to oversee production — from first design sketch to manufacturing and shipping the goods — at its premises, assisting Flex to meet its aim of becoming an end-to-end supplier of production services. “The level of innovation we see coming from Israel meant that having a design center located in Haifa was a foregone conclusion to support our strategy of sketch-to-scale,” Michele Monico, Flex vice president of Design & Engineering for the EMEA region, said. Flex’s Michele Monico at the inauguration of a new design center in Haifa, March 28, 2017 (Courtesy) The company, formerly called Flextronics, employs some 200,000 workers globally and operates in more than 30 countries. Flex manufactures products for thousands of companies around the world and in Israel, making, for example, all the motherboards and network cards for Israel’s Mellanox Technologies Ltd. as well as many components for global multinationals like Intel Corp., GE Healthcare and Strauss Water. After rebranding as Flex in 2015, the company is looking to work with customers in building smarter products for the connected world. And that is where Israel, with its technological edge, can play a part, said Monico. Operating in Israel for more than 20 years, mostly under the radar, Flex has today become the nation’s second-largest tech employer after Intel Corp., counting some 4,000 employees in seven locations. Its main manufacturing center is in Israel’s Migdal Ha’emek, with additional plants in Ofakim and Yavneh. The design center in Haifa currently employs 40 design engineers and this number is expected to rise to 60 by year end, the company said. Originally focused on components for the medical sector, the center has now expanded to support customers in industrial and consumer products. It will offer design and engineering services, new product development, electronic, optical and industrial design and mechanical engineering, among other services. Half of Flex’s global innovation already stems from Israel, Monico said in an interview with The Times of Israel in November. The design center will operate in conjunction with the company’s investment arm to develop, incubate and accelerate homegrown technologies. Flex has invested in six Israeli firms to date via its fund, including, recently, CropX Ltd., PointGrab and OriginGPS. “I am planning to bring 20 factories to Israel by 2020 that combine R&D and production in Israel — just like Flex does,” Ziva Eger, director of Foreign Investment and Industrial Cooperation at Israel’s Ministry of Economy and Industry, said at the opening ceremony. “We want to see more companies like Flex in Israel.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Flex Ltd.,  electronics technology More in Israel Inside 28 ultra-Orthodox journalists arrested on suspicion of extortion Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Flex expands Israel activity with new design center By Shoshanna Solomon   Extracting water from air, Israeli firm looks to quench global thirst By Shoshanna Solomon   Facebook exec: Zuckerberg helped me through grief By Stuart Winer   Kibbutz duo-turned-entrepreneurs on quest to whip gut bugs By Shoshanna Solomon   Glowing bacteria are used to hunt landmines in Hebrew U study By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs April 13, 2017, 6:42 am BDS: Boycott ‘Zionists’/SS: Do not look at Jews’ faces because they will trick you into making you think they are human A woman speaking on a program about Orthodox feminism on Israeli television this week said that by......

Starting at $999, Origin's latest packs in desktop-class graphics with an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti chip, along with Intel's 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors. As the name suggests, the Eon15-S sports a 15-inch 1080p IPS display. While the initial $999 starting configuration includes relatively low specs with an Intel Core i3 processor and 8GB of RAM, the laptop can be outfitted with a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of M.2 SSD storage. You can even make your order a little more personal with a wide range of creatively named colors like Eternal Pink and Sabot Grey. There are certainly better options out there, but given its starting price, the Eon15-S definitely isn't a bad starting point if you just want a game-ready PC you can take on the go. For more, you can check out and customize the Eon15-S at Origin. See at Origin Reader comments Origin's new $999 laptop is for gamers on a budget 13 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating DragonPoo Am I the only person that gets annoyed at the marketing of computer prices?  It's not just Origin.  All PC makers sell devices "as low as $500," with "up to an i7, 2TB SSD, etc."  When you finally upgrade all the parts that make it a decent system, you're nowhere close to the "as low as" price. You can get this Origin gaming laptop for $999, but it comes with an i3, 8GB of RAM, and 120GB SSD.  If you're looking at anything decent, the price quickly jumps up to close to $1600 for just the "Origin recommended" specs. I do appreciate the customisations to the shell, though.  Some of those look pretty sweet. 8 1 day ago Reply Joe Blo2 👊 2 1 day ago Reply JamesDax3 This thing is for gamers on a budget? Really? For $1000 I can build a pretty good gaming PC that will blow this thing out of the water? Why would any "Gamer" with a $1000 budget buy this? Hell, dosen't Dell sell a laptop with better specs then this for a few hundred dollars cheapper? smdh   5 1 day ago Reply DragonPoo Okay, I was curious about your claim as well so I checked out a few Dell systems.  Their XPS 13 with similar specs was $1050.  Main difference was the storage (120GB SSD on Origin, 500GB HDD/32GB SSD on XPS) and the size (15" versus small 13").  The Alienware 15 is meant to be a gaming system, and starts at $1200 for an i5, less GPU RAM (2GB instead of 4GB) and a 1TB HDD.  Upgraded to 256GB SSD puts it at $1300. So, for a gaming laptop, I guess the pricing is competitive.  But to your point, would a real "Gamer" go for a laptop, or opt for a desktop with more power and better options for KVM? 0 1 day ago Reply Zachary Boddy I think he was talking about the Inspiron 7000. 0 1 day ago Reply William Tadekawa If you're looking for budget gaming laptops there's Dell Inspiron 15 7567, Acer VX15, Lenovo Legion Y520, HP Omen 15, etc. 0 14 hours ago Reply DragonPoo Yeah, it's good to know there are alternatives out there.  I think much of the decision is based on brand trust.  Some people I know avoid Lenovo or HP.  Personally, I like Dell.  But a dedicated gaming system company like Origin could stand out to those avoiding big brands. 0 13 hours ago Reply JamesDax3 The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 starts at $749.  That gets you a i5 7300HQ, 8GB DDR4 2400Mhz, 1TB Hybrid HDD, and a GTX 1050.  The Origin Laptop starts at $999.  Now you do get a GTX 1050Ti for that but get down graded to i3 7100HQ, DDR4 2133MHz, and a 120GB SSD all for an extra $250.  No, if you are on a budget and want a Laptop that you can do some gaming on then the Dell is clearly the way to go here.  0 14 hours ago Reply DragonPoo Valid comparision system.  Dell wins on the processor (4 core vs. 2 HT core), RAM speed, and storage size.  Origin wins on storage speed and graphics.  I would wonder if the complete package is better on Origin or Dell, as a single bottleneck would make the performance appear worse on a better system. 0 13 hours ago Reply Joe Blo2 Agree ! 0 1 day ago Reply Jessicator For gaming on a budget, a laptop is hardly the way to go. For the best bang for buck, look no further than the PC Master Race builds wiki page (almost always up-to-date) at https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds (this takes a lot of the guesswork out of building a great PC) 0 1 day ago Reply enzom09 this is not for gamers on a budget. You can find better specc'd laptops out there for around the same price. I believe MSI (as adorama on ebay) was selling one with a gtx 1060 for 860 (the 3gb variant and with a slower HDD, but you can toss a 512gb for another 130 dollars, so nbd) just recently. This is a terrible deal... 0 1 day ago Reply eballack You can buy one if you desperately need a laptop but stay away from laptops which use Optimus technology.Optimus is still broken on win10. 0 17 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Trump to sign 'Buy American, Hire American' executive order President Trump will sign a double-barreled, "Buy American, Hire American" executive order Tuesday, during a visit to Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis. The "Buy American" portion of the order will require federal agencies to buy more goods and services from U.S. companies and workers. It also includes language requiring transportation projects to use steel "melted and poured" in the U.S. The "Hire American" side of the order will clamp down on guest worker visas, specifically the H-1B visa program, which allows 85,000 foreign workers into the U.S. each year to take specific high-skilled jobs with U.S. companies. By combining aspects of immigration policy with federal procurement regulations, Trump is using executive action to advance his philosophy of economic nationalism without waiting for action from Congress.

Democrat Jon Ossoff needs at least 50% of the vote in a battle with 17 other candidates to win the seat and avoid a June run-off with a single Republican nominee. Ossoff, the 30-year-old around whom Democrats are rallying, will most likely fall a few points short Tuesday in winning the seat, previously held by now Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Republican-controlled for nearly four decades. The race caught President Trump’s attention, though, as he tweeted Monday that Ossoff “wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!” CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share A special election on Tuesday to fill Tom Price’s congressional seat is considered an early barometer of President Donald Trump's popularity.

Reuters/Shailesh Andrade Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced a big Spring event on May 2. While he and his team are primarily going to talk strategy, the event is also an excellent opportunity to announce new hardware. One such highly-anticipated device is the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. No hardware updates to the Pro line have been made till 2015. Now that Intel Kaby Lake processors are already available, it makes sense for Microsoft to bump up the specs of the Surface hybrid or release a brand new hybrid to stay in the game. The Redmond-based tech giant needs to take a call on whether to go with a new hybrid or simply upgrade the existing hardware. Unlike Apple, Microsoft does not need hardware sales to keep it going. Thus, bringing the latest specs ensures relevance of Surface Pro 5 but doesn’t generate excitement. Microsoft has a whole lot of manufacturers taking care of the hardware. However, the company does need to promote its software and the solutions it offers. This is where Windows 10 on cloud must be considered in any new hardware Microsoft releases. Increasing the adoption of Windows 10 will also increase the adoption of cloud. Thus, in case Microsoft is looking to push cloud and create new spark among fans, the launching a Surface Cloud next month makes sense. Windows 10 can run on low-end hardware but still places a heavy demand on resources and storage that limit these laptops. Windows Cloud can reduce hardware requirements and offer manufacturers another product line. This will also bring more users to the cloud. Moreover, it will be an amazing alternative to the Google Chromebook that is currently threatening the entire Windows 10 operating system, reports Forbes. With the Creators Update, Microsoft can now that the OS is suitable for smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops. Microsoft’s mobile game has moved on from fighting Android because of an increased focus on its services and easy integration of cloud on iOS, Android, and macOS hardware. Thus, the May 2 event may not see the unveiling of the Surface Pro 5, Surface Book 2 or the Surface Phone. Instead, the company may unveil a mid-range laptop that may run the Windows 10 Cloud. Microsoft Surface CloudBook could be the first Windows 10 Cloud machine. The Surface CloudBook could run on an ARM processor. Microsoft went into a partnership with Qualcomm late 2016 to give ARM another shot. Windows 10 Cloud would be Microsoft’s answer to Google Chromebooks. It will work with Win32 or Universal Windows Platform apps.
